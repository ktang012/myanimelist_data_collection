            "content": "You are a person who loves fighting anime and is looking for something with epic battles and intense rivalries.  Or you are someone who is looking for a good laugh and an entertaining anime that will last you for awhile.  Or, you are somebody who is simply looking for an amazing anime that has all the right pieces that make it extraordinary.  If any of those above scenarios fit you, simply put, Shijou Saikyou No Deshi Kenichi (History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi) is a must-watch anime for you to pick up on.\r\nThe story, although simple at heart, becomes more complex at the surfaceas the anime progresses through the episodes.  Kenichi is your run-of-the mill weakling kid who is always getting picked on by everyone and has no confidence in his abilities whatsoever.  But that doesn't stop him from doing the right thing and stepping into some pretty hairy situations despite his shortcomings.  The story begins with Kenichi wanting to get stronger because of his will to protect his friends.  As a result, he joins the Ry\u014dzanpaku dojo and from there on out, every episode has meaning, and will have you wanting for more.  The story ends with Kenichi in an final showdown verses the leader of the most intense gang in Japan - Ragnorak.  Just from that, it gives you the sense that the plot development is spectacular in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Kenichi is well done.  All of the characters are drawn very well and have distinguishing characteristics that cosplay members will love to create.  Animation is also done very well, as you have great battles and very few  repetition of frames.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the sound is probably the weakest point of the anime, and its not even that weak.  Opening/ending songs are pretty good and the scores used throughout the anime fit quite well with the current scene you are watching.  However, it is the voices to each character that really brings all the characters alive, as you can feel the emotion from all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design in HSD Kenichi is so original and great, that you'll wonder why nobody has ever came up with this before.  Kenichi is trained by six masters, who all specialize in a different form of martial arts.  All of their personalities are so different and unique, you'll also wonder how each of them get along in the first place.  Hence, the many comedic moments and episodes that you'll inevitably witness as they all fight amongst themselves to be the one who trains Kenichi.  Ah, and let's not forget the beautiful Miu Furinji, Kenichi's love interest, who, unlike other female protagonists of similar plots, is one hell of a fighter and the reason Kenichi joins the dojo.  As the anime progresses deeper in the story, you'll be unveiled to a plethora of unique characters who have different fighting styles and unique personalities, which will all amaze and have you laughing at the same time.  For the sake of keeping this section as short as possible, I'm simply going to say character development is flawless in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEven with all of this that I have written about, this anime would be nothing without its comedy, and that is what makes Kenichi so much fun and enjoyable to watch.  You will be literally laughing out loud at some of the hellish training that Kenichi is forcibly put through and will wonder why he hasn't died yet.  (Yes, the training is that hellish).  Even with 50 episodes, the comedy of Kenichi never gets old and you'll find that to be the case right up to the very last episode.  Hell, sometimes you'll wish that they had more comedy than serious fights, because its that good.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kenichi is one of those rare anime shows out there that is able to blend in comedy with the overall serious plot extremely well.  One of the few qualms that I did have with this show was that the ending occurred a little to quick and you'll also wish that they gave more information about the history of each of the masters, as they provide you with relatively very little on each one of them.  In the end, once you watch the final episode of this anime, it will take you five seconds or so to wish that there would be a second season to it.",

            "content": "History\u2019s Strongest Disciple Kenichi is a Shounen, Action, Comedy about a typical high school boy (Kenichi) who\u2019s always being bullied, until one day, he learns of a special dojo that teaches many forms of martial arts.\r\nFrom the start, this anime has a very typical story and plot. Having a high school setting, the story is about Kenichi\u2019s quest to become stronger. The story itself is incredibly basic that any idiot can grasp its concept. The way in which the story flows makes it feel like a game; Kenichi gains some experience points => clears a stage => levels up => makes it to the nextstage. This makes it really enjoyable to watch him develop but its overall simplicity is also its downfall, due to the lack of depth to the story. This doesn\u2019t matter too much, to the average viewer because of than the awesome fights and there\u2019s plenty of comedy that will make it hard to take the show seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is full of so many interesting characters and it\u2019s not only the 2 main ones (Kenichi & Miu). Some of the supporting characters are also great, as their little quirks make the series more enjoyable. With Kenichi being the main titular character, he proves to be quite an amazing well developed one. It just makes it so interesting to watch a \"loser-kun\" character with no natural talent become such a great fighter.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is very peculiar because most of the time it looks really simple and crude. The action on the other hand can be pretty intense but the character\u2019s thoughts tend to slow down the pace. The music has to be the weakest aspect of the show, as there is nothing particularly special about it. Not only that but the background sounds (birds & cicadas) don\u2019t sound good but the SFX during fights help add to the intensity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall History\u2019s Strongest Disciple Kenichi proved to be a really enjoyable and addicting Shounen Action anime to watch, as it didn\u2019t rely on typical \u201cpower ups\u201d and \u201cspecial techniques\u201d but just traditional fighting styles and clich\u00e9s. Of course this anime would have been so much better if it was produced by a different studio but even then the story would still be very linear. If you\u2019ve seen and enjoyed shounen action animes like \u201cTenjou Tenge\u201d & \"Naruto\" then you\u2019ll definitely enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

It's the ultimate definition of a mediocre anime. I had to force my way through every episode. The hero of the story is not likable, and the character Niijima is the equivalent of Jar-Jar Binks in Episode 1. Actually, I take that back because I hated Jar-Jar less. The boob jokes get old, and the action sequences are weak. You can find SO much better. If you want towatch an underdog story with excellent action and lots and lots of GOOD humor, then watch Hajime no Ippo and skip this one. I don't know what the target audience for this was, because teens will see through the weak action sequences, adults will find the perverted jokes unappealing, and children would be bored to tears with the lame story line. \\n\r\nThumbs down.",

            "content": "Animation - 5\r\nThe animation is lack luster. Rather than fluid animation displaying extension of limbs and alertness of characters. Kenichi relies more heavily on the quick flash of motion with speed lines indicating action, and sequences of pictures less worthy of being called animation. Character design is uninspired-ly shounen, with an overall presentation of something one would see in the early 90's.\r\nSound- 4\r\nBad voice acting. There really is no other way to say it. It was surprising to discover that the voice of the main character, Shirahama Kenichi, is acted by Seki Tomokazu one of my personal favorites. The music is equally bad and alsoquite forgettable. I had to go back to youtube just to remember them, and even then it was unfamiliar. Also laughable are the foley effects for fights which prove highly anachronistic given current technology and processes.\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nNothing to see here except a plethora of sterotypes as flat as the paper they were conceived on. We have your meek protagonist who cherishes what little companions he has. His busty, pure-hearted, yet equally shy friend. Kenichi's numerous martial arts masters are all ripoffs of characters from various fighting games and movies. We have the old man with a long beard and ripped muscles, the kung fu master, the kunoichi weapons expert, the thai boxer, badass karate guy, and disciplined but dangeruous Aikido master. On the opposing side we have baddies including a tsundere who likes kittens, a bitter enemy who misdirects rage, and the main bad guy who lusts for power at all costs.\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nThis story plays out as all shounen fighting shows with a hint of romance do: Fight a person and find out that something more sinister awaits. Train. Conflict of conscience. Something bad happens. Train. Fight. Get former enemies to be your friend. Train. Recognition of weakness. Train. Discover you like girl. Date. Train. Remember past with girl and baddies. Train. Turn weakness into strength. Prevail.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nThe only thing I can honestly say that I enjoyed is the application of Norse mythology in the form of giving nick-names to the &quot;bad guys.&quot; I wasted a lot of time during the show trying to find a higher meaning behind the monikers. But clearly the creator though: Norse names are cool sounding. end of thought.\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nKenichi is a laughably mediocre show. I once had this score at a six (I tend to give middle of the road shows the benifit of the doubt), and then a five; however, while writing this review I have come to the conclusion that this show is not the sum of its average parts. At no point in time does this show take the viewer by surprise. Everything from design to execution is bizarrely over-exaggerated and banally predictable. Even if one is a fan of the genre, I doubt that it stacks up to any of the heavy hitters, or even the more marginally popular fare.",

            "content": "History's Greatest Disciple Kenichi starts off as somewhat slow and mediocre. I myself was forced to watch the first few episodes because I had already gotten a few and it seemed like a waste if I didn't even watch what I got. As the story progresses you are left with an endearment to Kenichi himself and maybe one (or all) of his masters. Simply put Kenichi's character is unlike anything I have ever seen. He's like a mixture of Ueki from Law of Ueki and take any lead character of a romantic comedy. Why? Basically, he has the comedic attributes that Ueki has. Unfortunately, hedoesn't have that natural ability to be skillful when fighting. He has that &quot;my friends are important&quot; feature though. The comedy really doesn't come from him but from the situation he's in and how he reacts to it. Add, in that little mix from a romantic comedy and you've got yourself a Kenichi Shirahama.\\n\\n\r\nI gave a 10 for the Characters not only because of this but because of the supporting characters namely his masters and Niijima, his love/hate friend. Its because that there is something to love about every one of them and you can just choose your favorite. I personally love Apachai Hopachai, his Muay Thai master. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically nothing from the ordinary. You've probably seen some like it, but what sets this story apart is how it is executed. Some things are obvious at the start and some things aren't There are a few surprises as the story progresses though. It's one of those &quot;I'll protect the world stories&quot; but with a comedic twist. I would say that the closest anime to Kenichi would be Law of Ueki. If you liked that, then I'm sure you'll love Kenichi.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are fair and at par with most anime. Although upon further reading, the cast is composed of familiar voices and new voices.\\n\\n\r\nHistory's Greatest Disciple Kenichi is one anime that you will surely enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 out of 10",

            "content": "I was going to wait until I reached the end of the series to write a review, however this anime has finally worn away my tolerance. \r\nIn short, skip it. \r\nFor a longer explanation; Kenichi is a moron. He is stupid, gullible and doesn't actually seem to grow as a character. Every time he is taught (or supposedly learns) a lesson he reverts back to his original self, he's dull and easily suckered. \r\nMiu appears to be a complete ditz with a total lack of social skills, yet is a martial arts master. She's only there in the story to be fan fodder, as apparentby her breasts and skimpy outfits. \\n\\n\r\nMany of these characters appear to be high school students, yet are drawn to look like 30 year olds who never got past the 9th Grade. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the masters Kenichi trains under start out fairly interesting but quickly fall into space-fillers. As masters, and people in general, they are terrible. There is almost no positive reinforcement of Kenichi's training and he is constantly belittled. The Drunk, The Samurai, The Pervert, Wise-man, etc. All fall into a category that adds nothing to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses heavily on cliche's, sexism, tropes and stereotypes to move it supposed \"plot\" along. Kenichi and several girls in the series constantly talk about how women CANT do this and CANT do that because they are clearly weaker than men and that will never change. Kenichi himself wont fight a girl because he has \"principles\" and its \"not right\", despite the fact that these people have proven they're strong and have challenged him to a fight. I find it degrading that he would deny a woman a fight but not a guy.\\n\\n\r\nApachai would be the worst crime in this series. They took a character who had the opportunity to be interesting based on his background and fighting style and made him mentally retarded. He is almost too stupid to be able to function, and its insulting.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the series when it started out as a young kid trying to find his way, learning martial arts and better himself, but it quickly devolves into a DBZ wanna be with \"special moves\", \"power up's\" and drawn out fights. \\n\\n\r\nThese teens talk about their training as if they've been at it for decades, when really it seems like only weeks or months have passed. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is bland, repetitive, lacks growth and is completely forgettable. I will finish it purely out of spite, but I would advise everyone else to skip it.",

The sound is perfect, all the character's voicesfit their personalities, and you can really feel the emotion in Kenichi's voice. Again, a great anime if you are into martial arts stuff, or just a growin pains anime with a hint of romance\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting, in that we see a culmination of everything in the last few episodes. We see why Kenichi is so driven to learn martial arts, and the depth of this drive, with how he pushes himself through inhuman training. Definitely, the characters of this anime are unforgettable, each makes a lasting impact on you, from Kenichi and his friends, to his eccentric masters, and his enemies.",

            "content": "This anime has its pros and cons that really do stand out in a certain way, but overall enjoyable and entertaining. I&rsquo;ll talk about the major flaws and issues I had with this anime when I come to the conclusion so in the mean time, I&rsquo;ll talk about what I like about this anime and the minor flaws. First off, it has a great cast of characters where everybody gets to shine and they all have their own contribution to the overall progression of the story and development of the main characters. It has great character development and I feel that there will be somecharacter(s) you can make some connection to because most of them get an in-depth back-story to offer those opportunities to relate to them. It also has a good amount of comedy. But in the beginning, specifically the first portion will be a bit slow and will focus more on the comedy, but then it becomes more focused on the development and the fights.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that the character design is basic and simple. Some people may see past this, some probably won&rsquo;t. But I feel that the diversity of the character design in comparison to lets say Gundam SEED makes up for it because you&rsquo;re getting all kinds of outfits and characters in this show which adds personality. Overall, I feel that the character designs that were presented are good examples of how to draw anime and I feel it should be in a beginner&rsquo;s guide to drawing anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are reasonably paced and exciting. Considering the nature of this anime, you&rsquo;re not going to get fireballs, bullet time, or anything that excessively violates physics in a trendy and clich&eacute; manner. So if you enjoy the fights in Hajime no Ippo or Grappler Baki, you will probably like this one though it&rsquo;s really not as technical as the fights in those shows. I say if you like Jackie Chan and Jet Li fan, then this is truly for you, but if you&rsquo;re a Mixed Martial Arts fanatic like I am, there will be some things that will probably irritate and you which I will get into at the conclusion of my review.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs which I forgot the names of and too lazy to look up are pretty nice and energetic, but compared to other main stream songs and artists out there like what L&rsquo;Arc~En~Ciel has done for GTO, Rurouni Kenshin, and Gundam 00, it doesn&rsquo;t really stand out and doesn&rsquo;t really capture my interest in comparison to that band as well as other big name artists and bands like NEWS, TM Revolution, Crystal Kay, Nami Tamaki, BoA, Hamasaki Ayumi, and some others. But you&rsquo;re free to disagree on that one. I&rsquo;m saying the music is good, but not really great. The background music on the other hand is pretty intense and accurately captures the eastern setting like how Naruto does in the ninja kind of manner and used appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast I have to admit is top notch. The English dub is officially not out yet upon the time of this review so I really can&rsquo;t comment yet on that, but the Japanese version should be satisfying for those interested. I really loved the multi-talented Tomokazu Seki, the voice of Miyata from Hajime no Ippo; Keisuke from Initial D; and Domon from G Gundam as Kenichi. He captures the characters situations and moods very excellently. My favorite cast member had to be Horikawa Ryou, the voice of Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z as Hermit. He plays the character in a very interesting way and his acting abilities are just convincing the way he comes across at times which you have to see for yourself to understand because it&rsquo;d be a spoiler if I talked about it. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I&rsquo;ve gotten the good points out of the way, I feel I should now talk about the bad points, but I don&rsquo;t feel the qualities I found negative should make anyone refrain from watching this anime because I admit I&rsquo;m making the negative qualities stand out more from the good though that wasn&rsquo;t really my intention. First off, a guy who trains in all these disciplines and these characters that represent other kinds of martial arts is the novelty, but I felt the biggest flaw in relation was the execution and it&rsquo;s based on how I view martial arts today. It&rsquo;s not something I would say as inaccurate or myth, but an archaic way of thinking, especially in relation to Mixed Martial Arts and the philosophies of Bruce Lee. The perfect example is when Renka is critical of Kenichi for practicing other martial arts saying he should stick to one. That alone from tells me what this anime is doing is a completely outdated way of thinking and this is probably something that could have acceptable by my standards in maybe 1998 instead of 2008. Bruce Lee always talked about not limiting oneself to one style and the concept of styles shouldn&rsquo;t really exist. His frustrations with wing chun in a fight and seeing his own art&rsquo;s limitations bounded by their techniques and traditions was what led him to develop Jeet Kune Do. \\n\\n\r\nThen 30 years later, mixed martial arts came and what you see in UFC makes up a good portion of what Bruce Lee is in a philosophical sense. The ending fight is also something that violates what Bruce Lee also talks about. Such as Kenichi transitioning moves from one martial art to the next. Some people have a misconception of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s philopshies of how he took the best moves from these martial arts to create JKD, but here is an example of what he&rsquo;s really talking about. You&rsquo;re in a street fight and you use a jab similar to boxing but you miss, do you switch to using a karate seiken punch in hopes of winning? That&rsquo;s an example of what this show is doing. I have never taken a Jeet Kune Do class, but I have friends that are certified instructors and they tell me in that situation, if you miss, you can still attack with the corresponding elbow you throw the jab with since your elbow could still be in front of your opponent&rsquo;s face. Jeet Kune Do was about using every possibility to your advantage in a street fight. Even biting, eye gouging, and striking the family jewels. And I just felt that this anime doesn&rsquo;t do the best job of differentiating between intramural martial arts and real fighting and the only exemption to this was when Kenichi fought the captain of the Karate club.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the next topic, I will address what people are going to say. &ldquo;But GrapplerJMo, it&rsquo;s just an anime.&rdquo; Yes, I know that, but remember that when kung fu movies came out in the 1970s it was creating actual misconceptions that what you saw also worked in real fights, and when kickboxing came along in the 1980s for awhile, people were disappointed that what they saw in the movies wasn&rsquo;t real fighting because they never really saw those flashy kicks in those fights, and I got this personal paranoia that to some extent this anime is capable of carrying on that tradition because this anime is still based on real world principles at some capacity. But going on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother trait in relation to what personally bothered me was the lack of representation of other phases of combat or styles such as ground and submission fighting. The only character that somewhat represents them is the street brawler, Shinnosuke. Akisame is sort of like this, but his holds are based more on small joint manipulation and you really don&rsquo;t see them in the fights that often anyway. But it did disappoint me I didn&rsquo;t see the use of the guard, an armbar, or a chokehold, which are considered effective moves. And some of these real life practioners and fighters such as the Gracie family and Ken Shamrock are training our troops who fighting in the middle east and I feel with the mainstreaming of MMA, especially in Japan for 15 years now, it is a personal disappointment for me because of the intention this show has in that regard. Though it does represent the spirit of marital arts, it doesn&rsquo;t represent the evolution.",

There was not much thrill at the start, and it seemed like it would be another slice of life, kid gets bullied on, kid fights back thing. But, to my surprise, the story streamed off to another anime, which is quite appealing. I for one would NEVER watch fighting or brawling animes simply because I enjoy lore, mystical powers, etc etc, and eventually Kenichi does get these aspects. Although it is indisputably a fighting anime, the level of practicality is&hellip; just what the doctor ordered, none of the major events in Kenichi are possible whatsoever after acertain turning point (A few episodes after he joins the academy).\\n\r\n10/10, I am urging for a new season.

            "content": "A anime of nothing more than a kid getting his ass kicked, rising up and training to be the best. This is one of the better if not best action/martial arts anime out there. If you love karate kid you'll love this anime. It deals with the hard decisions of a young disciple learning martial arts and finding out what he is fighting for. It hold a good balance of being serious with a comic relief. It seriously will keep you entertained with all the masters and how their lives are changed by Kenichi  being in their life!\r\nThe story itself was nothing more thanepic. It showed a very good ladder of the disciple growing stronger and learning from his losses. It didn't sidestep at all from the main story and it made it easy to understand what was going on in the story! Overall you will enjoy the story and it will keep you wanting to watch more like it did for me....10....\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly good, it kept my senses liking what it saw and it was well drawn. I did see an improvement of art work during the ending of the series which was neat to see an improvement!.....9......\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the series were great. I loved listening to action scenes and emotional ones and hearing the music change with it!......10....\\n\\n\r\nThe character background, there influence and how they changed throughout  the anime is very special. You'll see characters influence one another and see them just change 180 from their previous thoughts and ideals which is very touching. The characters grow a strong relationship with one another and you realize watching that friendship always withstands everything and you can get pure energy from the power of your friends. Of course there are a couple love triangles in the series which is always fun to watch and you see characters true emotions coming out end the end of the series which is a shame because i like to see the series take a follow up on their emotions and the outcome. I hope they play more with that in the manga which I haven't read which is the next step for me. score........10.....\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was a very enjoyable series, I actually learned a lot about the different types of martial arts and their style which was neat because I have no knowing of any martial arts. I don't know how much is true about what they do and practice but it is very entertaining and if its factual, then its very informational. Overall its is a very fun, enjoyable, action pack and comical series which I believe all will enjoy and love watching. overall scoring is a epic 10!",

            "content": "Well, Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple... probably the most surprising anime I have ever seen. \r\nStory- For the most part I love a story that starts off with a weakling and he/she trains hard and becomes more and more powerful as the show progresses. That's what you get with this anime. I had interest a long time ago and finally got the chance to watch it. The anime itself is only 50 episodes and then after that is a bunch of OVAs that follow the story. This isn't just a fighting anime, the comedy is very good in both the Dub and Sub versions so whatever one you decide, you are going to find it enjoyable. The fights in the anime are very good in the beginning and anyone who likes to see people train and get stronger this is an anime for you. There is some \"filler\" but not really; there isn't any fighting but it does serve purpose to character development. Towards the end of season one the fighting gets kinda boring and then season 2 comes in. The fights continue to get better and better and come more frequently. If you found season 1 too slow, stick with it because season 2 kicks it into overdrive! The last fight of the series shocked me beyond belief... It blew all the other fights in the show out of the water and in my opinion, although the anime isn't in my top 5 favorite... the last fight was my second favorite fight of all time.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was flawless. There wasn't anything too flashy or ridiculous it was fine art that really couldn't have been done any better. Kenichi was made in 2006-2007 so the art was just as good as most modern anime although in my opinion doesn't surpass FMA brotherhood in art but that IMO was my favorite art in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- About as average as you can get. The sound kinda repeats itself but it doesn't really take away from the anime. The endings aren't that great but the 2 openings are really really good!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- So characters.... hmmmm. Well Kenichi is an awesome protagonist and the bad guys are incredible. The masters that train Kenichi are so interesting and I would watch a series about each one of them but that's the thing. They don't have a lot of time to shine but when they do, it's never a dull moment. Miu, Kenichi's crush, is awesome but the real big down fall is Kenichi's \"friend\" Shirahama. He is so incredibly annoying and it might be hard for people to watch the show if they can't stand annoying voices although I must say the Sub voice is much less annoying than the Dub voice.\\n\\n\r\nI had a really fun time watching this anime, it was really quick and on Netflix along with other anime watching sites of course but anything on Netflix is usually easier to watch and Netflix has both Dub and Sub versions. I give it a 9 out of 10. Very fun to watch, awesome fights, cool characters for the most part and a story that will make you cheer and route for Kenichi as if he were real and it may even inspire you to take up a martial art since he learns 5 types... Just saying it's very realistic...",

            "content": "This is not your average tough-guy anime. Not a typical comedy or coming of age. Kenichi uniquely blends together a variety of interesting aspects into a very enjoyable and well thought out series.\r\nThe story centers around Kenichi Shirahama, a mostly typical highschool boy who is unfortunately picked on and bullied for most of his life. But just as he's getting used to the idea, he meets a very unusual girl who changes his whole perspective. She does what he couldn't do: protect people. With that girl in focus, he determines he no longer wants to be pushed around and sets out to change himself throughmartial arts. But really, it seems that he bites more than he can chew, as he finds himself confronted with ever tougher opponents as things progress. But thanks to the girl, Miu Furinji, we find Kenichi training with five (sometimes six) of the best martial arts masters in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does an excellent job building each character and makes everyone (besides random grunts) a joy to watch grow and open up as people. The masters are hilarious in how much they differ yet still come together to build something greater than the parts in Kenichi Shirahama. Even his former bully turned grudging friend, Haruo Niijima, is an interesting supporting character that provides exposition, builds situations, and offers comedic relief through a mischievous, methodical, ridiculous, self-centered, slimy persona that creates a real love/hate relationship for him.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes for this fighting-level anime are superb, not only giving intense matchups but describing a variety of moves and techniques that are pertinent to their respective styles. Seeing how things play out while learning some things along the way makes the fighting that much more interesting to watch, which reminds me of watching Initial D in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nWhile being a comedy, with some romantic interest sprinkled in, Kenichi doesn't let that take him too far off track. Miu is really an amazing fighter, better than most of the enemies throughout the show, but is also a super nice, caring girl who becomes an excellent friend. This is a refreshing role to see a girl in, one that gets extended to other supporting rivals later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, Funimation did an excellent job casting the characters and giving engaging dialogue that entertains all the way through. There are times when I do get tired of Funimation's recycling of their voice actors in all-but-typical roles which doesn't help with my suspension of disbelief. But I feel their choices here fit pretty well for the variety of characters they had to work with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show has great pacing, great comedy, great action and great characters. Although they do touch on some of the masters' backgrounds, I wish they had delved into some of the others some more. And I really wish weapons master Shigure was given more opportunity to show how she trains Kenichi. But the series otherwise pulls everything together thoroughly and keeps its focus on the battles to come.",

Although it isnt one of the worst series i have ever watched it certainly isnt one of the best.\r\nStory: The basic premise of the anime is a generic weak schoolboy kenichi tries to become stronger, encounters a busty schoolgirl miu and together train to become stronger, meanwhile encountering new challenges and rigourous training. seems generic enough. nothing special though. however it just doesnt seem executed well. Although i havent seen all of the episodes yet it appears to be just another show where newchallengers appear every episode or two.  6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I am suprised that this series was made as late as 2006/2007 and still has this poor of artwork. not much detailing put into the character design. colours are crisp and nice though. Detail was nicely put into the action scenes but thats basically all. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Prolly one of the higher points, op was ok but ending was a nice song, nothing special with the seiyu. 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Wasn't a fan of the characters, They just didnt put enough time to develop the characters, it seems like another one of those series where they went for quantity over quality. Viewers are provided with a basic motivation  for each character and thats about it.

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 10 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for. However, note that I've read about over 400 chapters of this manga at one point, so I am familiar with the events transpiring in the anime.\r\nI never considered Kenichi to be a particularly good manga. I mean, it could be amusing at times despite the characters not being particularly filled with depth, but because they were simple, the author couldpull off a few gags that went on as comedic well enough, despite the humor being rather outdated with cliches and stereotypes. It could be interesting at times, by displaying certain principles of martial arts, despite continuously exaggerating the powers of its characters to a rather unnerving degree. The fact that there's a but to any praise I can give it, and a few other displeasing things with no buts, I'd call out Kenichi as a rather average comedic battle shounen. However, coupled with poor animation, which the anime does have, I'd recommend to steer clear of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation could be passable in standards of the late 90's perhaps, but even then I'd have fair examples from that time that do surpass it in animation, like Hajime no Ippo as one example, but Kenichi has aired in 2006, when things such as Death Note and Black Lagoon aired. Yes, these are some very different shows from Kenichi, but Kenichi has such poor animation, that in comparison to those shows, it feels like it should've been released 10 years prior. I mean, excluding the aspect ratio being 4:3, which can be considered passable at the time, Kenichi relies too heavily on speed lines to show off fast movement, has pisspoor shading, like you can perhaps see in the picture MAL uses for the show, but not as bad. It also uses motion pictures to display hits that are impactful, blue backgrounds with shifting levels of blurred out white to simulate motion that could be acceptable when you run out of budget for maybe one or two fight scenes, but not all of them. All in all, the animation for any fight scene is simply hogwash because it all looks dull and poorly made. The fact that the character designs in the show and the manga look like bodybuilder rejects that got sentenced to go live in a japanese highschool for abusing steroids, does not help with any early hooks, and any other designs look pretty blandly shounenistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you'd be missing out by skipping this anime is a few poorly animated sequences about some loser that decided to take action against the people that were making fun of him, alongside his crush, some big blonde klutzy tits, as well as some gags about his masters, that have some tropes attached to them as well. Personally I find it pointless watching an action series that is simply poorly animated, but if you're that curious, know that it is pretty much like most other shounens. It starts with a loser incapable of fighting that will develop himself in order to be able to protect the weak/his friends/the weak & his friends. Evil is wrong because being evil is wrong and all that morallistic bullshit, to the point where they reach two paths in martial arts between people that use martial arts to kill and people that fight with martial arts that don't kill. The characters are gonna undergo some love chain where x has a crush on y for the most part and villains are eventually gonna become friends of the protagonists in a cartoonish manner, where they change sides because they lost and any villanous traits are forgiven. Eventually the show after abandoning deliquent fights, it becomes about the confrontation of people that use their fists to kill and the people that don't, and it constantly undergoes a moral enbargo. It also starts relying more on ecchi and showing as many nipple shots as it can as the story goes on. Gotta make those sales somehow. The driving hook for the fights will be how over the top the powers they display are and how the characters progress in their training, but that all becomes dull, because the show has a reliance on buffing up characters every time to make a higher threat than the former. Upping up the ante how many times will impress the viewer? There is a limit, and Kenichi has no idea where that threshold should stop.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi is a poorly animated battle shounen that relies on tropes and exaggerated powers to hook its viewers. It  gets rather repetitive as it progresses and the only enjoyment that I'd say you can get out of it, is if you're in the same line of humor as the show is, and that often revolves about exaggerated sequences of traiting and the characters oogling on women. There are a few punch lines that can work from the training, due to the sheer ridiculousness of it, but ultimately, I think there are far better alternatives to Kenichi, which I can say that it doesn't really have anything unique in its execution, and in both animation and mentality of the characters, feels quite dated. It can be watchable, if you're a fan of shounens and are merely looking for something to watch casually as a shounen, as it will proceed being comedic and upping up the ante. But that's the basic formula used to sell this type of stuff. And if you're one person that buys into it, Kenichi should work well on you, despite its shortcomings.",

            "content": "At first I was sceptical, because after all most martial arts anime are not that well done, mainly due to the difficulty trying to try complex styles, moves, and attacks. the art isn't the best, I didn't exactly like the style that was used in this series, but as I watched more and more I found that it wasn't to bad, and was bearable. and that the style began to fit with the pace the anime was flowing and the moves that were being shown.\r\nThe characters are well diverse, especially Kenichis 5 masters, ranging from Karate, Weapons, Chinese Martial arts, Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai. eachof them having their own unique personality and been very strong and fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is upon Kenichi a weak and cowardly boy, who wants to learn karate to become stronger. due to his shortness and weak build, he is bullied in the school dojo and challenged to a duel that who ever loses will have to quit karate. Kenichi accepts, and is troubled, and stumbles upon a blonde girl interfering in local yakuza bullying an old man, Kenichi fearing the girl will lose her life rushes to her aid with not even a thought, only to realise he was going to die. It was during this time the girl saves him with her amazing skills. and introduces him to her dojo.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime series, flows well, and makes alot of sense in some way. because as kenichi becomes stronger and defeats a strong opponent he attracts more stronger opponents who want to defeat him.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is full of action and comedy and ecchi scenes. and also its just fun to watch someone become stronger and making alot of allies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it and rewatch this alot. I hope you all enjoy it as much as me.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a great way to start this story. This is the first story arc from the manga series, and it's adapted fairly well. The manga has a bit more ecchi and better artwork, but the anime stays in tune with it's comedy. Beware of the synopsis for this, it's a little off, but it does cover a couple of the basics.\r\nKenichi is picked on by literally everyone at school. The story starts with this weakling attempting to protect a girl (that really doesn't need his protection at all) from a few thugs. In his attempt to \"save\" her, she sees something in himand they become friends. The synopsis is right on about the karate club, and Furinji Miu (the girl he befriends) teaches him his first basic moves so he doesn't get destroyed. He has no talent whatsoever (this is key) but his hard work and practice pays off. Now he's in over his head and Furinji Miu takes him to her father's dojo where the strongest fighters in the world have gathered. He begins his intense training one style on top of another, but he doesn't realize the world he's just fallen into. His driving motivation is to surpass Miu so that he can be strong enough to protect her.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is filled with so much comedy, and the fighting scenes are great. The manga is a must read, and this is a great introduction to the manga. It's hard not to respect Kenichi, he has an incredibly strong character when the chips are down, but in daily life he still cowers from delinquents (though he could easily mop the floor with them thanks to his training). There are a lot of valuable lessons of friendship, doing the right thing, standing up for what you believe in, and more.\\n\\n\r\nI passed over this series many times without giving it a look, and when I finally did I regretted not giving it a try sooner. It's introduced me to the manga series that I religiously read week to week. This is a must watch so don't delay like I did.",

The series starts with are protagonist who is tried of being picked on deciding to do something about it by learning Karate and we get to see him progress though his training From Wimp to Warrior, This series has the perfect balance of action to keep you interested and comedy to keepyou laughing. Now I'm not saying you will be rolling on the ground laughing, but some parts are pretty funny. I really don't want to say anymore cause I might give something away.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nI give the art a 10 because everything was really well drawn and the fight scene where really well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nI felt that the opening and closing songs really fit the mood of the anime, personally I liked the first opening the best, but the second one was good too. The Characters voices all  fit their personalty really well and the sound effects where really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nThe characters where really well done and they all added to the story line. I think Kenichi is one of the best main characters of all time, because I think a lot of people can relate to him, Cause I fell we have all got picked on and want to do something about it. Also a lot of these kinds of series seem to have this over powering main character that seems to win ever fight with ease, where as  in this story we get to see Kenichi at the Start of his training and progress though his wins and loses as a martial artist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nLike I said up above this is one of my favorite anime series of all time, I liked this series so much cause I could really relate to the characters and it had a lot of good life lessons in it. I loved this anime series I couldn't find really anything wrong. Other than the fact that I wish their was a 3rd season rather than a few OVA's. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\nIf you are in to martial art type anime I would defiantly recommend you give this one a try, or if you just like action or comedy genre anime, despite what you might think this show isn't just about fighting and martial arts it is much more than that.",

            "content": "You are a person who loves fighting anime and is looking for something with epic battles and intense rivalries.  Or you are someone who is looking for a good laugh and an entertaining anime that will last you for awhile.  Or, you are somebody who is simply looking for an amazing anime that has all the right pieces that make it extraordinary.  If any of those above scenarios fit you, simply put, Shijou Saikyou No Deshi Kenichi (History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi) is a must-watch anime for you to pick up on.\r\nThe story, although simple at heart, becomes more complex at the surfaceas the anime progresses through the episodes.  Kenichi is your run-of-the mill weakling kid who is always getting picked on by everyone and has no confidence in his abilities whatsoever.  But that doesn't stop him from doing the right thing and stepping into some pretty hairy situations despite his shortcomings.  The story begins with Kenichi wanting to get stronger because of his will to protect his friends.  As a result, he joins the Ry\u014dzanpaku dojo and from there on out, every episode has meaning, and will have you wanting for more.  The story ends with Kenichi in an final showdown verses the leader of the most intense gang in Japan - Ragnorak.  Just from that, it gives you the sense that the plot development is spectacular in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Kenichi is well done.  All of the characters are drawn very well and have distinguishing characteristics that cosplay members will love to create.  Animation is also done very well, as you have great battles and very few  repetition of frames.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the sound is probably the weakest point of the anime, and its not even that weak.  Opening/ending songs are pretty good and the scores used throughout the anime fit quite well with the current scene you are watching.  However, it is the voices to each character that really brings all the characters alive, as you can feel the emotion from all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design in HSD Kenichi is so original and great, that you'll wonder why nobody has ever came up with this before.  Kenichi is trained by six masters, who all specialize in a different form of martial arts.  All of their personalities are so different and unique, you'll also wonder how each of them get along in the first place.  Hence, the many comedic moments and episodes that you'll inevitably witness as they all fight amongst themselves to be the one who trains Kenichi.  Ah, and let's not forget the beautiful Miu Furinji, Kenichi's love interest, who, unlike other female protagonists of similar plots, is one hell of a fighter and the reason Kenichi joins the dojo.  As the anime progresses deeper in the story, you'll be unveiled to a plethora of unique characters who have different fighting styles and unique personalities, which will all amaze and have you laughing at the same time.  For the sake of keeping this section as short as possible, I'm simply going to say character development is flawless in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEven with all of this that I have written about, this anime would be nothing without its comedy, and that is what makes Kenichi so much fun and enjoyable to watch.  You will be literally laughing out loud at some of the hellish training that Kenichi is forcibly put through and will wonder why he hasn't died yet.  (Yes, the training is that hellish).  Even with 50 episodes, the comedy of Kenichi never gets old and you'll find that to be the case right up to the very last episode.  Hell, sometimes you'll wish that they had more comedy than serious fights, because its that good.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kenichi is one of those rare anime shows out there that is able to blend in comedy with the overall serious plot extremely well.  One of the few qualms that I did have with this show was that the ending occurred a little to quick and you'll also wish that they gave more information about the history of each of the masters, as they provide you with relatively very little on each one of them.  In the end, once you watch the final episode of this anime, it will take you five seconds or so to wish that there would be a second season to it.",

            "content": "History\u2019s Strongest Disciple Kenichi is a Shounen, Action, Comedy about a typical high school boy (Kenichi) who\u2019s always being bullied, until one day, he learns of a special dojo that teaches many forms of martial arts.\r\nFrom the start, this anime has a very typical story and plot. Having a high school setting, the story is about Kenichi\u2019s quest to become stronger. The story itself is incredibly basic that any idiot can grasp its concept. The way in which the story flows makes it feel like a game; Kenichi gains some experience points => clears a stage => levels up => makes it to the nextstage. This makes it really enjoyable to watch him develop but its overall simplicity is also its downfall, due to the lack of depth to the story. This doesn\u2019t matter too much, to the average viewer because of than the awesome fights and there\u2019s plenty of comedy that will make it hard to take the show seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is full of so many interesting characters and it\u2019s not only the 2 main ones (Kenichi & Miu). Some of the supporting characters are also great, as their little quirks make the series more enjoyable. With Kenichi being the main titular character, he proves to be quite an amazing well developed one. It just makes it so interesting to watch a \"loser-kun\" character with no natural talent become such a great fighter.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is very peculiar because most of the time it looks really simple and crude. The action on the other hand can be pretty intense but the character\u2019s thoughts tend to slow down the pace. The music has to be the weakest aspect of the show, as there is nothing particularly special about it. Not only that but the background sounds (birds & cicadas) don\u2019t sound good but the SFX during fights help add to the intensity.\\n\\n\r\nOverall History\u2019s Strongest Disciple Kenichi proved to be a really enjoyable and addicting Shounen Action anime to watch, as it didn\u2019t rely on typical \u201cpower ups\u201d and \u201cspecial techniques\u201d but just traditional fighting styles and clich\u00e9s. Of course this anime would have been so much better if it was produced by a different studio but even then the story would still be very linear. If you\u2019ve seen and enjoyed shounen action animes like \u201cTenjou Tenge\u201d & \"Naruto\" then you\u2019ll definitely enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

It's the ultimate definition of a mediocre anime. I had to force my way through every episode. The hero of the story is not likable, and the character Niijima is the equivalent of Jar-Jar Binks in Episode 1. Actually, I take that back because I hated Jar-Jar less. The boob jokes get old, and the action sequences are weak. You can find SO much better. If you want towatch an underdog story with excellent action and lots and lots of GOOD humor, then watch Hajime no Ippo and skip this one. I don't know what the target audience for this was, because teens will see through the weak action sequences, adults will find the perverted jokes unappealing, and children would be bored to tears with the lame story line. \\n\r\nThumbs down.",

            "content": "Animation - 5\r\nThe animation is lack luster. Rather than fluid animation displaying extension of limbs and alertness of characters. Kenichi relies more heavily on the quick flash of motion with speed lines indicating action, and sequences of pictures less worthy of being called animation. Character design is uninspired-ly shounen, with an overall presentation of something one would see in the early 90's.\r\nSound- 4\r\nBad voice acting. There really is no other way to say it. It was surprising to discover that the voice of the main character, Shirahama Kenichi, is acted by Seki Tomokazu one of my personal favorites. The music is equally bad and alsoquite forgettable. I had to go back to youtube just to remember them, and even then it was unfamiliar. Also laughable are the foley effects for fights which prove highly anachronistic given current technology and processes.\\n\r\nCharacters - 4\\n\r\nNothing to see here except a plethora of sterotypes as flat as the paper they were conceived on. We have your meek protagonist who cherishes what little companions he has. His busty, pure-hearted, yet equally shy friend. Kenichi's numerous martial arts masters are all ripoffs of characters from various fighting games and movies. We have the old man with a long beard and ripped muscles, the kung fu master, the kunoichi weapons expert, the thai boxer, badass karate guy, and disciplined but dangeruous Aikido master. On the opposing side we have baddies including a tsundere who likes kittens, a bitter enemy who misdirects rage, and the main bad guy who lusts for power at all costs.\\n\r\nStory - 5\\n\r\nThis story plays out as all shounen fighting shows with a hint of romance do: Fight a person and find out that something more sinister awaits. Train. Conflict of conscience. Something bad happens. Train. Fight. Get former enemies to be your friend. Train. Recognition of weakness. Train. Discover you like girl. Date. Train. Remember past with girl and baddies. Train. Turn weakness into strength. Prevail.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nThe only thing I can honestly say that I enjoyed is the application of Norse mythology in the form of giving nick-names to the &quot;bad guys.&quot; I wasted a lot of time during the show trying to find a higher meaning behind the monikers. But clearly the creator though: Norse names are cool sounding. end of thought.\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nKenichi is a laughably mediocre show. I once had this score at a six (I tend to give middle of the road shows the benifit of the doubt), and then a five; however, while writing this review I have come to the conclusion that this show is not the sum of its average parts. At no point in time does this show take the viewer by surprise. Everything from design to execution is bizarrely over-exaggerated and banally predictable. Even if one is a fan of the genre, I doubt that it stacks up to any of the heavy hitters, or even the more marginally popular fare.",

            "content": "History's Greatest Disciple Kenichi starts off as somewhat slow and mediocre. I myself was forced to watch the first few episodes because I had already gotten a few and it seemed like a waste if I didn't even watch what I got. As the story progresses you are left with an endearment to Kenichi himself and maybe one (or all) of his masters. Simply put Kenichi's character is unlike anything I have ever seen. He's like a mixture of Ueki from Law of Ueki and take any lead character of a romantic comedy. Why? Basically, he has the comedic attributes that Ueki has. Unfortunately, hedoesn't have that natural ability to be skillful when fighting. He has that &quot;my friends are important&quot; feature though. The comedy really doesn't come from him but from the situation he's in and how he reacts to it. Add, in that little mix from a romantic comedy and you've got yourself a Kenichi Shirahama.\\n\\n\r\nI gave a 10 for the Characters not only because of this but because of the supporting characters namely his masters and Niijima, his love/hate friend. Its because that there is something to love about every one of them and you can just choose your favorite. I personally love Apachai Hopachai, his Muay Thai master. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically nothing from the ordinary. You've probably seen some like it, but what sets this story apart is how it is executed. Some things are obvious at the start and some things aren't There are a few surprises as the story progresses though. It's one of those &quot;I'll protect the world stories&quot; but with a comedic twist. I would say that the closest anime to Kenichi would be Law of Ueki. If you liked that, then I'm sure you'll love Kenichi.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are fair and at par with most anime. Although upon further reading, the cast is composed of familiar voices and new voices.\\n\\n\r\nHistory's Greatest Disciple Kenichi is one anime that you will surely enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 out of 10",

            "content": "I was going to wait until I reached the end of the series to write a review, however this anime has finally worn away my tolerance. \r\nIn short, skip it. \r\nFor a longer explanation; Kenichi is a moron. He is stupid, gullible and doesn't actually seem to grow as a character. Every time he is taught (or supposedly learns) a lesson he reverts back to his original self, he's dull and easily suckered. \r\nMiu appears to be a complete ditz with a total lack of social skills, yet is a martial arts master. She's only there in the story to be fan fodder, as apparentby her breasts and skimpy outfits. \\n\\n\r\nMany of these characters appear to be high school students, yet are drawn to look like 30 year olds who never got past the 9th Grade. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the masters Kenichi trains under start out fairly interesting but quickly fall into space-fillers. As masters, and people in general, they are terrible. There is almost no positive reinforcement of Kenichi's training and he is constantly belittled. The Drunk, The Samurai, The Pervert, Wise-man, etc. All fall into a category that adds nothing to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses heavily on cliche's, sexism, tropes and stereotypes to move it supposed \"plot\" along. Kenichi and several girls in the series constantly talk about how women CANT do this and CANT do that because they are clearly weaker than men and that will never change. Kenichi himself wont fight a girl because he has \"principles\" and its \"not right\", despite the fact that these people have proven they're strong and have challenged him to a fight. I find it degrading that he would deny a woman a fight but not a guy.\\n\\n\r\nApachai would be the worst crime in this series. They took a character who had the opportunity to be interesting based on his background and fighting style and made him mentally retarded. He is almost too stupid to be able to function, and its insulting.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the series when it started out as a young kid trying to find his way, learning martial arts and better himself, but it quickly devolves into a DBZ wanna be with \"special moves\", \"power up's\" and drawn out fights. \\n\\n\r\nThese teens talk about their training as if they've been at it for decades, when really it seems like only weeks or months have passed. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is bland, repetitive, lacks growth and is completely forgettable. I will finish it purely out of spite, but I would advise everyone else to skip it.",

The sound is perfect, all the character's voicesfit their personalities, and you can really feel the emotion in Kenichi's voice. Again, a great anime if you are into martial arts stuff, or just a growin pains anime with a hint of romance\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting, in that we see a culmination of everything in the last few episodes. We see why Kenichi is so driven to learn martial arts, and the depth of this drive, with how he pushes himself through inhuman training. Definitely, the characters of this anime are unforgettable, each makes a lasting impact on you, from Kenichi and his friends, to his eccentric masters, and his enemies.",

            "content": "This anime has its pros and cons that really do stand out in a certain way, but overall enjoyable and entertaining. I&rsquo;ll talk about the major flaws and issues I had with this anime when I come to the conclusion so in the mean time, I&rsquo;ll talk about what I like about this anime and the minor flaws. First off, it has a great cast of characters where everybody gets to shine and they all have their own contribution to the overall progression of the story and development of the main characters. It has great character development and I feel that there will be somecharacter(s) you can make some connection to because most of them get an in-depth back-story to offer those opportunities to relate to them. It also has a good amount of comedy. But in the beginning, specifically the first portion will be a bit slow and will focus more on the comedy, but then it becomes more focused on the development and the fights.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure out that the character design is basic and simple. Some people may see past this, some probably won&rsquo;t. But I feel that the diversity of the character design in comparison to lets say Gundam SEED makes up for it because you&rsquo;re getting all kinds of outfits and characters in this show which adds personality. Overall, I feel that the character designs that were presented are good examples of how to draw anime and I feel it should be in a beginner&rsquo;s guide to drawing anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are reasonably paced and exciting. Considering the nature of this anime, you&rsquo;re not going to get fireballs, bullet time, or anything that excessively violates physics in a trendy and clich&eacute; manner. So if you enjoy the fights in Hajime no Ippo or Grappler Baki, you will probably like this one though it&rsquo;s really not as technical as the fights in those shows. I say if you like Jackie Chan and Jet Li fan, then this is truly for you, but if you&rsquo;re a Mixed Martial Arts fanatic like I am, there will be some things that will probably irritate and you which I will get into at the conclusion of my review.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs which I forgot the names of and too lazy to look up are pretty nice and energetic, but compared to other main stream songs and artists out there like what L&rsquo;Arc~En~Ciel has done for GTO, Rurouni Kenshin, and Gundam 00, it doesn&rsquo;t really stand out and doesn&rsquo;t really capture my interest in comparison to that band as well as other big name artists and bands like NEWS, TM Revolution, Crystal Kay, Nami Tamaki, BoA, Hamasaki Ayumi, and some others. But you&rsquo;re free to disagree on that one. I&rsquo;m saying the music is good, but not really great. The background music on the other hand is pretty intense and accurately captures the eastern setting like how Naruto does in the ninja kind of manner and used appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast I have to admit is top notch. The English dub is officially not out yet upon the time of this review so I really can&rsquo;t comment yet on that, but the Japanese version should be satisfying for those interested. I really loved the multi-talented Tomokazu Seki, the voice of Miyata from Hajime no Ippo; Keisuke from Initial D; and Domon from G Gundam as Kenichi. He captures the characters situations and moods very excellently. My favorite cast member had to be Horikawa Ryou, the voice of Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z as Hermit. He plays the character in a very interesting way and his acting abilities are just convincing the way he comes across at times which you have to see for yourself to understand because it&rsquo;d be a spoiler if I talked about it. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I&rsquo;ve gotten the good points out of the way, I feel I should now talk about the bad points, but I don&rsquo;t feel the qualities I found negative should make anyone refrain from watching this anime because I admit I&rsquo;m making the negative qualities stand out more from the good though that wasn&rsquo;t really my intention. First off, a guy who trains in all these disciplines and these characters that represent other kinds of martial arts is the novelty, but I felt the biggest flaw in relation was the execution and it&rsquo;s based on how I view martial arts today. It&rsquo;s not something I would say as inaccurate or myth, but an archaic way of thinking, especially in relation to Mixed Martial Arts and the philosophies of Bruce Lee. The perfect example is when Renka is critical of Kenichi for practicing other martial arts saying he should stick to one. That alone from tells me what this anime is doing is a completely outdated way of thinking and this is probably something that could have acceptable by my standards in maybe 1998 instead of 2008. Bruce Lee always talked about not limiting oneself to one style and the concept of styles shouldn&rsquo;t really exist. His frustrations with wing chun in a fight and seeing his own art&rsquo;s limitations bounded by their techniques and traditions was what led him to develop Jeet Kune Do. \\n\\n\r\nThen 30 years later, mixed martial arts came and what you see in UFC makes up a good portion of what Bruce Lee is in a philosophical sense. The ending fight is also something that violates what Bruce Lee also talks about. Such as Kenichi transitioning moves from one martial art to the next. Some people have a misconception of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s philopshies of how he took the best moves from these martial arts to create JKD, but here is an example of what he&rsquo;s really talking about. You&rsquo;re in a street fight and you use a jab similar to boxing but you miss, do you switch to using a karate seiken punch in hopes of winning? That&rsquo;s an example of what this show is doing. I have never taken a Jeet Kune Do class, but I have friends that are certified instructors and they tell me in that situation, if you miss, you can still attack with the corresponding elbow you throw the jab with since your elbow could still be in front of your opponent&rsquo;s face. Jeet Kune Do was about using every possibility to your advantage in a street fight. Even biting, eye gouging, and striking the family jewels. And I just felt that this anime doesn&rsquo;t do the best job of differentiating between intramural martial arts and real fighting and the only exemption to this was when Kenichi fought the captain of the Karate club.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into the next topic, I will address what people are going to say. &ldquo;But GrapplerJMo, it&rsquo;s just an anime.&rdquo; Yes, I know that, but remember that when kung fu movies came out in the 1970s it was creating actual misconceptions that what you saw also worked in real fights, and when kickboxing came along in the 1980s for awhile, people were disappointed that what they saw in the movies wasn&rsquo;t real fighting because they never really saw those flashy kicks in those fights, and I got this personal paranoia that to some extent this anime is capable of carrying on that tradition because this anime is still based on real world principles at some capacity. But going on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother trait in relation to what personally bothered me was the lack of representation of other phases of combat or styles such as ground and submission fighting. The only character that somewhat represents them is the street brawler, Shinnosuke. Akisame is sort of like this, but his holds are based more on small joint manipulation and you really don&rsquo;t see them in the fights that often anyway. But it did disappoint me I didn&rsquo;t see the use of the guard, an armbar, or a chokehold, which are considered effective moves. And some of these real life practioners and fighters such as the Gracie family and Ken Shamrock are training our troops who fighting in the middle east and I feel with the mainstreaming of MMA, especially in Japan for 15 years now, it is a personal disappointment for me because of the intention this show has in that regard. Though it does represent the spirit of marital arts, it doesn&rsquo;t represent the evolution.",

There was not much thrill at the start, and it seemed like it would be another slice of life, kid gets bullied on, kid fights back thing. But, to my surprise, the story streamed off to another anime, which is quite appealing. I for one would NEVER watch fighting or brawling animes simply because I enjoy lore, mystical powers, etc etc, and eventually Kenichi does get these aspects. Although it is indisputably a fighting anime, the level of practicality is&hellip; just what the doctor ordered, none of the major events in Kenichi are possible whatsoever after acertain turning point (A few episodes after he joins the academy).\\n\r\n10/10, I am urging for a new season. One involving the masters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you did in fact find this review helpful, I do take value in my &ldquo;Helpful&rdquo; rating, so please take a moment of your time to tell me how you liked this review.",

            "content": "A anime of nothing more than a kid getting his ass kicked, rising up and training to be the best. This is one of the better if not best action/martial arts anime out there. If you love karate kid you'll love this anime. It deals with the hard decisions of a young disciple learning martial arts and finding out what he is fighting for. It hold a good balance of being serious with a comic relief. It seriously will keep you entertained with all the masters and how their lives are changed by Kenichi  being in their life!\r\nThe story itself was nothing more thanepic. It showed a very good ladder of the disciple growing stronger and learning from his losses. It didn't sidestep at all from the main story and it made it easy to understand what was going on in the story! Overall you will enjoy the story and it will keep you wanting to watch more like it did for me....10....\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fairly good, it kept my senses liking what it saw and it was well drawn. I did see an improvement of art work during the ending of the series which was neat to see an improvement!.....9......\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the series were great. I loved listening to action scenes and emotional ones and hearing the music change with it!......10....\\n\\n\r\nThe character background, there influence and how they changed throughout  the anime is very special. You'll see characters influence one another and see them just change 180 from their previous thoughts and ideals which is very touching. The characters grow a strong relationship with one another and you realize watching that friendship always withstands everything and you can get pure energy from the power of your friends. Of course there are a couple love triangles in the series which is always fun to watch and you see characters true emotions coming out end the end of the series which is a shame because i like to see the series take a follow up on their emotions and the outcome. I hope they play more with that in the manga which I haven't read which is the next step for me. score........10.....\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was a very enjoyable series, I actually learned a lot about the different types of martial arts and their style which was neat because I have no knowing of any martial arts. I don't know how much is true about what they do and practice but it is very entertaining and if its factual, then its very informational. Overall its is a very fun, enjoyable, action pack and comical series which I believe all will enjoy and love watching. overall scoring is a epic 10!",

            "content": "Well, Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple... probably the most surprising anime I have ever seen. \r\nStory- For the most part I love a story that starts off with a weakling and he/she trains hard and becomes more and more powerful as the show progresses. That's what you get with this anime. I had interest a long time ago and finally got the chance to watch it. The anime itself is only 50 episodes and then after that is a bunch of OVAs that follow the story. This isn't just a fighting anime, the comedy is very good in both the Dub and Sub versions so whatever one you decide, you are going to find it enjoyable. The fights in the anime are very good in the beginning and anyone who likes to see people train and get stronger this is an anime for you. There is some \"filler\" but not really; there isn't any fighting but it does serve purpose to character development. Towards the end of season one the fighting gets kinda boring and then season 2 comes in. The fights continue to get better and better and come more frequently. If you found season 1 too slow, stick with it because season 2 kicks it into overdrive! The last fight of the series shocked me beyond belief... It blew all the other fights in the show out of the water and in my opinion, although the anime isn't in my top 5 favorite... the last fight was my second favorite fight of all time.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was flawless. There wasn't anything too flashy or ridiculous it was fine art that really couldn't have been done any better. Kenichi was made in 2006-2007 so the art was just as good as most modern anime although in my opinion doesn't surpass FMA brotherhood in art but that IMO was my favorite art in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- About as average as you can get. The sound kinda repeats itself but it doesn't really take away from the anime. The endings aren't that great but the 2 openings are really really good!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- So characters.... hmmmm. Well Kenichi is an awesome protagonist and the bad guys are incredible. The masters that train Kenichi are so interesting and I would watch a series about each one of them but that's the thing. They don't have a lot of time to shine but when they do, it's never a dull moment. Miu, Kenichi's crush, is awesome but the real big down fall is Kenichi's \"friend\" Shirahama. He is so incredibly annoying and it might be hard for people to watch the show if they can't stand annoying voices although I must say the Sub voice is much less annoying than the Dub voice.\\n\\n\r\nI had a really fun time watching this anime, it was really quick and on Netflix along with other anime watching sites of course but anything on Netflix is usually easier to watch and Netflix has both Dub and Sub versions. I give it a 9 out of 10. Very fun to watch, awesome fights, cool characters for the most part and a story that will make you cheer and route for Kenichi as if he were real and it may even inspire you to take up a martial art since he learns 5 types... Just saying it's very realistic...",

            "content": "This is not your average tough-guy anime. Not a typical comedy or coming of age. Kenichi uniquely blends together a variety of interesting aspects into a very enjoyable and well thought out series.\r\nThe story centers around Kenichi Shirahama, a mostly typical highschool boy who is unfortunately picked on and bullied for most of his life. But just as he's getting used to the idea, he meets a very unusual girl who changes his whole perspective. She does what he couldn't do: protect people. With that girl in focus, he determines he no longer wants to be pushed around and sets out to change himself throughmartial arts. But really, it seems that he bites more than he can chew, as he finds himself confronted with ever tougher opponents as things progress. But thanks to the girl, Miu Furinji, we find Kenichi training with five (sometimes six) of the best martial arts masters in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does an excellent job building each character and makes everyone (besides random grunts) a joy to watch grow and open up as people. The masters are hilarious in how much they differ yet still come together to build something greater than the parts in Kenichi Shirahama. Even his former bully turned grudging friend, Haruo Niijima, is an interesting supporting character that provides exposition, builds situations, and offers comedic relief through a mischievous, methodical, ridiculous, self-centered, slimy persona that creates a real love/hate relationship for him.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes for this fighting-level anime are superb, not only giving intense matchups but describing a variety of moves and techniques that are pertinent to their respective styles. Seeing how things play out while learning some things along the way makes the fighting that much more interesting to watch, which reminds me of watching Initial D in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nWhile being a comedy, with some romantic interest sprinkled in, Kenichi doesn't let that take him too far off track. Miu is really an amazing fighter, better than most of the enemies throughout the show, but is also a super nice, caring girl who becomes an excellent friend. This is a refreshing role to see a girl in, one that gets extended to other supporting rivals later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, Funimation did an excellent job casting the characters and giving engaging dialogue that entertains all the way through. There are times when I do get tired of Funimation's recycling of their voice actors in all-but-typical roles which doesn't help with my suspension of disbelief. But I feel their choices here fit pretty well for the variety of characters they had to work with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show has great pacing, great comedy, great action and great characters. Although they do touch on some of the masters' backgrounds, I wish they had delved into some of the others some more. And I really wish weapons master Shigure was given more opportunity to show how she trains Kenichi. But the series otherwise pulls everything together thoroughly and keeps its focus on the battles to come.",

Although it isnt one of the worst series i have ever watched it certainly isnt one of the best.\r\nStory: The basic premise of the anime is a generic weak schoolboy kenichi tries to become stronger, encounters a busty schoolgirl miu and together train to become stronger, meanwhile encountering new challenges and rigourous training. seems generic enough. nothing special though. however it just doesnt seem executed well. Although i havent seen all of the episodes yet it appears to be just another show where newchallengers appear every episode or two.  6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I am suprised that this series was made as late as 2006/2007 and still has this poor of artwork. not much detailing put into the character design. colours are crisp and nice though. Detail was nicely put into the action scenes but thats basically all. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Prolly one of the higher points, op was ok but ending was a nice song, nothing special with the seiyu. 6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Wasn't a fan of the characters, They just didnt put enough time to develop the characters, it seems like another one of those series where they went for quantity over quality. Viewers are provided with a basic motivation  for each character and thats about it. Stereotypical cliched characters thoughout, 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Rather low i must say, it seems almost a chore to watch the next episode, although i continue to watch in hopes of improval. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although i havent seen it all yet, the series seems rather disapponting considering such high ratings this series has been given 5/10",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 10 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for. However, note that I've read about over 400 chapters of this manga at one point, so I am familiar with the events transpiring in the anime.\r\nI never considered Kenichi to be a particularly good manga. I mean, it could be amusing at times despite the characters not being particularly filled with depth, but because they were simple, the author couldpull off a few gags that went on as comedic well enough, despite the humor being rather outdated with cliches and stereotypes. It could be interesting at times, by displaying certain principles of martial arts, despite continuously exaggerating the powers of its characters to a rather unnerving degree. The fact that there's a but to any praise I can give it, and a few other displeasing things with no buts, I'd call out Kenichi as a rather average comedic battle shounen. However, coupled with poor animation, which the anime does have, I'd recommend to steer clear of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation could be passable in standards of the late 90's perhaps, but even then I'd have fair examples from that time that do surpass it in animation, like Hajime no Ippo as one example, but Kenichi has aired in 2006, when things such as Death Note and Black Lagoon aired. Yes, these are some very different shows from Kenichi, but Kenichi has such poor animation, that in comparison to those shows, it feels like it should've been released 10 years prior. I mean, excluding the aspect ratio being 4:3, which can be considered passable at the time, Kenichi relies too heavily on speed lines to show off fast movement, has pisspoor shading, like you can perhaps see in the picture MAL uses for the show, but not as bad. It also uses motion pictures to display hits that are impactful, blue backgrounds with shifting levels of blurred out white to simulate motion that could be acceptable when you run out of budget for maybe one or two fight scenes, but not all of them. All in all, the animation for any fight scene is simply hogwash because it all looks dull and poorly made. The fact that the character designs in the show and the manga look like bodybuilder rejects that got sentenced to go live in a japanese highschool for abusing steroids, does not help with any early hooks, and any other designs look pretty blandly shounenistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you'd be missing out by skipping this anime is a few poorly animated sequences about some loser that decided to take action against the people that were making fun of him, alongside his crush, some big blonde klutzy tits, as well as some gags about his masters, that have some tropes attached to them as well. Personally I find it pointless watching an action series that is simply poorly animated, but if you're that curious, know that it is pretty much like most other shounens. It starts with a loser incapable of fighting that will develop himself in order to be able to protect the weak/his friends/the weak & his friends. Evil is wrong because being evil is wrong and all that morallistic bullshit, to the point where they reach two paths in martial arts between people that use martial arts to kill and people that fight with martial arts that don't kill. The characters are gonna undergo some love chain where x has a crush on y for the most part and villains are eventually gonna become friends of the protagonists in a cartoonish manner, where they change sides because they lost and any villanous traits are forgiven. Eventually the show after abandoning deliquent fights, it becomes about the confrontation of people that use their fists to kill and the people that don't, and it constantly undergoes a moral enbargo. It also starts relying more on ecchi and showing as many nipple shots as it can as the story goes on. Gotta make those sales somehow. The driving hook for the fights will be how over the top the powers they display are and how the characters progress in their training, but that all becomes dull, because the show has a reliance on buffing up characters every time to make a higher threat than the former. Upping up the ante how many times will impress the viewer? There is a limit, and Kenichi has no idea where that threshold should stop.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi is a poorly animated battle shounen that relies on tropes and exaggerated powers to hook its viewers. It  gets rather repetitive as it progresses and the only enjoyment that I'd say you can get out of it, is if you're in the same line of humor as the show is, and that often revolves about exaggerated sequences of traiting and the characters oogling on women. There are a few punch lines that can work from the training, due to the sheer ridiculousness of it, but ultimately, I think there are far better alternatives to Kenichi, which I can say that it doesn't really have anything unique in its execution, and in both animation and mentality of the characters, feels quite dated. It can be watchable, if you're a fan of shounens and are merely looking for something to watch casually as a shounen, as it will proceed being comedic and upping up the ante. But that's the basic formula used to sell this type of stuff. And if you're one person that buys into it, Kenichi should work well on you, despite its shortcomings.",

            "content": "At first I was sceptical, because after all most martial arts anime are not that well done, mainly due to the difficulty trying to try complex styles, moves, and attacks. the art isn't the best, I didn't exactly like the style that was used in this series, but as I watched more and more I found that it wasn't to bad, and was bearable. and that the style began to fit with the pace the anime was flowing and the moves that were being shown.\r\nThe characters are well diverse, especially Kenichis 5 masters, ranging from Karate, Weapons, Chinese Martial arts, Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai. eachof them having their own unique personality and been very strong and fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is upon Kenichi a weak and cowardly boy, who wants to learn karate to become stronger. due to his shortness and weak build, he is bullied in the school dojo and challenged to a duel that who ever loses will have to quit karate. Kenichi accepts, and is troubled, and stumbles upon a blonde girl interfering in local yakuza bullying an old man, Kenichi fearing the girl will lose her life rushes to her aid with not even a thought, only to realise he was going to die. It was during this time the girl saves him with her amazing skills. and introduces him to her dojo.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime series, flows well, and makes alot of sense in some way. because as kenichi becomes stronger and defeats a strong opponent he attracts more stronger opponents who want to defeat him.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is full of action and comedy and ecchi scenes. and also its just fun to watch someone become stronger and making alot of allies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it and rewatch this alot. I hope you all enjoy it as much as me.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a great way to start this story. This is the first story arc from the manga series, and it's adapted fairly well. The manga has a bit more ecchi and better artwork, but the anime stays in tune with it's comedy. Beware of the synopsis for this, it's a little off, but it does cover a couple of the basics.\r\nKenichi is picked on by literally everyone at school. The story starts with this weakling attempting to protect a girl (that really doesn't need his protection at all) from a few thugs. In his attempt to \"save\" her, she sees something in himand they become friends. The synopsis is right on about the karate club, and Furinji Miu (the girl he befriends) teaches him his first basic moves so he doesn't get destroyed. He has no talent whatsoever (this is key) but his hard work and practice pays off. Now he's in over his head and Furinji Miu takes him to her father's dojo where the strongest fighters in the world have gathered. He begins his intense training one style on top of another, but he doesn't realize the world he's just fallen into. His driving motivation is to surpass Miu so that he can be strong enough to protect her.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is filled with so much comedy, and the fighting scenes are great. The manga is a must read, and this is a great introduction to the manga. It's hard not to respect Kenichi, he has an incredibly strong character when the chips are down, but in daily life he still cowers from delinquents (though he could easily mop the floor with them thanks to his training). There are a lot of valuable lessons of friendship, doing the right thing, standing up for what you believe in, and more.\\n\\n\r\nI passed over this series many times without giving it a look, and when I finally did I regretted not giving it a try sooner. It's introduced me to the manga series that I religiously read week to week. This is a must watch so don't delay like I did.",

The series starts with are protagonist who is tried of being picked on deciding to do something about it by learning Karate and we get to see him progress though his training From Wimp to Warrior, This series has the perfect balance of action to keep you interested and comedy to keepyou laughing. Now I'm not saying you will be rolling on the ground laughing, but some parts are pretty funny. I really don't want to say anymore cause I might give something away.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nI give the art a 10 because everything was really well drawn and the fight scene where really well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nI felt that the opening and closing songs really fit the mood of the anime, personally I liked the first opening the best, but the second one was good too. The Characters voices all  fit their personalty really well and the sound effects where really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nThe characters where really well done and they all added to the story line. I think Kenichi is one of the best main characters of all time, because I think a lot of people can relate to him, Cause I fell we have all got picked on and want to do something about it. Also a lot of these kinds of series seem to have this over powering main character that seems to win ever fight with ease, where as  in this story we get to see Kenichi at the Start of his training and progress though his wins and loses as a martial artist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nLike I said up above this is one of my favorite anime series of all time, I liked this series so much cause I could really relate to the characters and it had a lot of good life lessons in it. I loved this anime series I couldn't find really anything wrong. Other than the fact that I wish their was a 3rd season rather than a few OVA's. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\nIf you are in to martial art type anime I would defiantly recommend you give this one a try, or if you just like action or comedy genre anime, despite what you might think this show isn't just about fighting and martial arts it is much more than that.",

From episode 1 to 50 you see a wide variety of growth that you'd expect and almost want to see from the various characters in the show. From the awkward relationship between Kenichi and Mui to various others you meet throughout the show.\r\nI foundpersonally, with how Kenichi acts he is able to draw people around him much to the likes of Luffy or Naruto are able to in their own series.\\n\\n\r\nStory : It gets going quickly off the start with some filler here and there but is quite often VERY entertaining and showing a lot of growth in characters. I never found during the storyline of the anime to come to a stop, it was always progressing forward.\\n\\n\r\nArt : What to say, it was like Dragon Ball Z meets Street Fighter (you'll see what is meant by this if you make it through the series). I really enjoyed the look and feel, even with the very childish parts.\\n\\n\r\nSound : A great soundtrack can make or break a series, this one helped to move the series along and really draws you in. The characters are done amazingly and all the sounds sound very natural as to what you would think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Without spoiling anything, if you love character development and growth. Humor and seriousness than there's no much more to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10, why? I could not go without watching 6+ episodes at a time. Moving from one fight to the next you would always want to see where the story was going to take you and make you laugh all along the way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : MUST WATCH! Even if you're not a \"sports anime fan\" this is in a whole different category that the Naruto/Bleach fans and the Prince of Tennis fans can both call a middle ground. If you haven't had the chance to see it, give it a try I can say that it only gets better as the show goes on.",

Hence why i've watched Kenichi probably 7-8 times over and over again... Many series I rewatch I end up fast forwarding to the funny/crucial/best parts, but not Kenichi... Kenichi I watch every episode, even the intros... Because it is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nPS, one of the main chars have huge boobies, another reason to run off and watch it asap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The artwork overall is fair, some episodes are better than other, and occasionally you can tell the studio went in for the cheap so they could save up for more cinematic fights later on. The storyline is interesting, but gets ridiculous by the end. Still, I found myself watching just to see what kind of shenanigans would happen next. \r\nThis is definitely geared towards a younger male viewing demographic. Some of the fan-service is ridiculous and bordering on uncomfortable, but I suppose it draws attention. \r\nOveralll, an enjoyable tale aboutself-respect, courage, friendship, and learning to stand on your own two feet.",

            "content": "Well this is the first anime in a while that\u2019s driven me to watch it one episode after another until I eventually collapse into bed from exhaustion only to awake to do the same again.\r\nWhile it does make for wonderful viewing it can sometimes make a series hard to digest as your consuming the entire stream of the story rather than the \"bite-size\" pieces it\u2019s usually served up in. It also works best with shows that have a continuous narrative as opposed to an episodic approach.\r\nNeedless to say Kenichi has such a format and as such made for extremely enjoyable viewing. Story wise it\u2019s afairly basic spin on the classic shonen martial arts series. What really makes it appeal though is the interesting and appealing characterisation of the protagonists (and antagonists).\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge appeal for me was the fact that in many ways the entire show could be seen as one long training session interspersed with bouts of action and character development side pieces. While this may not appeal to everyone (because some people are clearly deviant bastards) it really appeals to me. I really love those bits in martial art films, books, anime, etc. where after been beaten the hero goes of into the mountains or seeks out a reclusive master to learn new techniques and increase his power. In many ways such training scenes are as enjoyable for me as the fight scenes. And the more mental the training the better it is (e.g. Drunken Master).\\n\\n\r\nAs Kenichi contains training nearly every other episode I really liked that facet of it as it mixed all my favourite martial art genre tropes into a nice cohesive whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also quite an amusing show, though sometimes the jokes do require (fairly basic) knowledge of other fighting anime/manga series.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose the main downside to Kenichi is the fact that there are only fifty episodes in the first season and as the manga is still ongoing it\u2019s clear that the story isn\u2019t finished in these fifty episodes. Though it is a fully contained story arc and only one main plot thread is left open so while it leaves the viewer wanting more it certainly doesn\u2019t leave them feeling cheated.",

            "content": "Great characterization, great humor and great study into all kinds of martial arts, for those who love fighting based Anime, History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi is for you.\r\nKenichi Shirahama, a young man who has always had a fascination with the martial arts one day has a fateful encounter with a certain someone that would change his life forevermore...that someone was Miu Furinji, a beautiful and talented martial artist who would introduce Kenichi into the world of true martial arts...\r\nUpon discovering Kenichi's interest into practicing martial arts and because of his strong moral desires to protect those that he cares about, Miu introduces Kenichi to her familydojo of Ryozanpaku, where 6 of the greatest martial arts masters of all time gather together and live with one another, Kenichi wonders to himself, upon meeting with these 6 masters trained in a different area of the martial arts each respectively...how is it that they haven't killed each other already!? a puzzle that continues to circle around in Kenichi's mind even after joining Ryozanpaku and becoming the dojo's very first disciple.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the masters themselves:\\n\\n\r\nShio Sakaki-A master of Karate who loves to drink and ride bikes, although he has a gruff demeanor, big down he's just a big softie although he would most probably \"kill\" anyone who would ever mention that.\\n\\n\r\nAkisame Koetsuji-A master of Jujitsu and may very well be the incarnation of Buddha himself, he has trained his body to near superhuman peak conditions and likes to spend his time talking about philosophy, he has a clinic next to the dojo.\\n\\n\r\nKensei Ma-A master of Chinese Kenpo who is a comedic lech and tries to both bribe and tempt Kenichi into buying one of his dirty magazines, despite his eccentric personality however, he is a true practitioner of martial arts, he is also skilled in using therapeutic needles.\\n\\n\r\nApachai Hopachai-A master of Muay Thai, he is the most gentle and fun loving of all the masters, he gets along well with everyone although some people find him to be scary due to his humongous size, Apachai has trouble in holding back his sheer strength during training.\\n\\n\r\nShigure Kosaka-A master of all kinds of weaponry and the most reserved of the 6 masters, however, she tends to open up from time to time, showing an almost humorous side to herself, she keeps a pet mouse by her side at almost all times named Tochumaru.\\n\\n\r\nFinally last but especially not least\\n\\n\r\nHayato Furinji-Miu's grandfather, the owner of Ryozanpaku and of whom is considered to be the Japanese Superman, to this day, no other master of the martial arts in history has surpassed him in both strength and wisdom alike, he hides his motives very well...\\n\\n\r\nWith these 6 masters, Kenichi definitely wonders...will he be able to survive all of the training they are about to put him through!? however, should he master the training, he may very well just become not just Ryozanpaku's greatest disciple but also history's greatest disciple...history's strongest disciple Kenichi Shirahama.\\n\\n\r\nThe series of History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi is definitely both a good read and watch, it has an in depth analysis of almost every real life martial arts known to the world and whilst that is indeed one of its strengthening points, it may also complicate viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe major praise of the series in this Review however goes towards the strongly developed individual characters and the story that allows them to be who they naturally are, full of comedic insanity and pure gentle kindness.\\n\\n\r\nThe masters of Kenichi in particular show very strong character developments, as his mentors, they know when to be strict and teach him about how life is an ever winding circle full of battle, thus preparing him for all kinds of fights that he may very well get involved in whether of his choosing or not.\\n\\n\r\nFor Kenichi Shirahama himself, he is a very strong protagonist full of determination and idealism, unlike most Shonen genre based series main protagonists, Kenichi is a unique individual in the sense that once he declares something and he intends to do it, he will not change his mind in the slightest, no matter who stands in his way, what makes this unique about him is that unlike other primary protagonists who tend to throw away their morals during fights, Kenichi refuses to do that whatsoever at all, he is strong willed and refuses to change his mindset especially even during fights, for example, whenever Kenichi finds himself in a battle against a woman, he will not raise even a pinky finger against them, he wishes to stay true to what are his principles, even if it means certain death...Kenichi is inspiring in this regard because his stubborn will to remain gentlemanly, as it were and not obey the laws of survival of the fittest can maybe, not 100% certainly but just maybe help those who are pessimistic in real life about the concept of survival of the fittest stay true to the morals and principles they have placed for themselves, becoming a little if not slightly more optimistic about the future ahead of them...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is one fatal flaw in Kenichi's character that i wish to point out to viewers, because he falls in love with Miu, sometimes because of a vow he makes to himself to protect Miu no matter what does it appear that he is borderline obsessed with her if not more so, sometimes it might put viewers off the potential budding romance between the two.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Miu herself, she is a strong and independent heroine of the series, she fights in the places that Kenichi refuses to, picking up the slack, if that is the correct term of expression to use for those moments, although a fierce warrior at heart, she does not hide a more sociable and attractive side to herself, the latter playing into her character overall.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning about the series, it is heavily Ecchi based, although a true fighting based series to be sure, Ecchi is used a lot of the time in the action scenes and could be considered, as a weak point to the tone and structure of how the story is played out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi fails in some areas, it makes up for in  others, the series itself could be considered a hidden jewel among Shonen genre based Manga/Anime, it is popular but funnily enough not so much considered popular in the same regards that Fairy Tail, Fullmetal Alchemist and Soul Eater are to more Western based audiences.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps that is for the best, the adventure of finding something new fulfills a person in a way, don't you agree?\\n\\n\r\nStory, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall, especially Story and Character are all worthy of praise, i strongly recommend giving the series a try and see what you think of it, it may or may not start an interest into pursuing an area of martial arts that you like.\\n\\n\r\nMartial arts is not the study of fighting but the study of training one's inner self both physically and mentally, to learn the martial arts is to learn more about one's spirit and how it is currently balanced and what can be done to properly balance it, the essence of martial arts is to find inner peace within one's self through the channeling and the movement of the body, to access a person's Chi is a result of the ever ongoing training of martial arts, it begins but never ends, a reflection of the circle of life we all live in, it may not benefit any noteworthy results but there is one result that is most certainly noteworthy: the mastery of peace and balance within one's heart, body and spirit.\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that is the whole lesson that all martial arts practitioners learn upon completing its forms of art, i honestly would not really know, as i don't study martial arts but i'm guessing that's what the final result could possibly turn out to be.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, here's hoping this Review was helpful in any way.",

The plot is pretty simple, a weak and helpless young high school boy becomes an elite Martial artist under the guidance of six of the world greatest martial artist. He is introduced to ryouzanpaku, a world class dojo, by his classmate/love interest; where experts in jujitsu, Chinese kenpo, mauy tai, karate, and weaponry live. From the lovable Apachai to the intelligent Akisame (one of my top 10 anime characters of all time), the characters in the show will keep you laughing and enjoying the whole series. The fight scenes are really good too, secondto none.\\n\\n\r\nI completed the manga that this anime was adapted from and it is amazing! The anime only covers over about 1/4 of the whole manga, which is a shame because the best part picks up after the ending of this anime. The OVA that follows gives you a close glimpse, but it still doesn't do justice to the manga so I can understand some peoples frustration with the anime. If I had not read the manga I would have probably ranked it an 7 or 6. If your an action fan, I highly recommend you watch the series and also read the manga, since the adventures get more exciting and dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nI really hope the remaining story line gets animated in the near future, I am sure many MAL users agree with me.",

            "content": "BEWARE! THE AWESOMENESS OF THIS ANIME IS TOO ADDICTING!  YOU WERE WARNED!!!  \r\nThe anime follows the exploits of Shirahama Kenichi; your average student who's always bullied (thus earning him the nickname \"Weak legs\"). One fateful day, he meets Furinji Miu (a fellow student) who helps him overcome his fears and he begins training at the Ryouzanpaku Dojo under six exceptional martial artists.....\r\nEvery episode will have you dying from fits of laughter; the gags aren't overused hence they never get old. The action and fight scenes aren't over-the-top (just the right amount of reality + unbelievable). Art style is pretty good, sounds used suitthe situations and convey the feelings the animation's staff want to portray and a great storyline that won't leave you confused.\\n\r\nIn my view, the anime's strength lies in its characters and their development: varied, easy to relate to, humorous, interesting past etc. The makers paid close attention to these aspects (especially Niijima........I loved how they introduced him as an annoying pest and somehow managed to transform him into one of the funniest, likeable characters in the show).\\n\\n\r\nDownsides? Only a few: Odin's reason for fighting was absolute trash in my opinion. Sadly Kenichi and Miu's relationship never progresses past friends. Why did this anime have to end at episode 50? This aired in 06-07 and it definitely deserves A LOT more seasons. For those who cannot get enough of it, it continues at chapter 144 in the magna. I definitely recommend picking it up. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is shounen, martial arts masterpiece. \\n\r\nIt will grab you from the first episode and not let go; quickly getting you hooked........when it is over, you will definitely be craving for more...",

            "content": "After reading the synopsis you might think this is just another typical martial arts shounen, Boy gets stronger, fights for his friends, and at the end saves the day. Why in the world do i need to watch this?? Well it's rather simple.\r\nLet's start of with the story. As stated above the story is almost the same as any other shounen but he, that's what makes this a shounen. Nevertheless Kenichi is kinda different. He just doesn't have talent. Finally a protagonist that doesn't discover a hidden power and BAM owns the whole world. Nope Kenichi has put his heart and soul into the trainingfor him to become a bit stronger. Maybe some impatient people dont like this but i think it's rather nice he needs to try his best and not everything is handed to him.\\n\\n\r\nNext stop, Art. The art in kenichi is pretty nice, but the female boobs are way to big. Those girl have got to have some serious back problems. This doesn't really bother me but i think some viewers may not like this.\\n\\n\r\nWhat gives Kenichi it's strenght are the characters. Kenichi is very lovable because of his strong willpower, This in combination with his lacking strenght gives a lot of funny moments. The rest of the masters of zanpaktou aren't really deep. Some episodes may be based around their background but dont expect to much. The reason they are here is to entertain the viewer(or so it seems).\\n\\n\r\nI think that while watching this anime i laughed more than while watching any other anime. Comedy definitly play a big role in Kenichi. \\n\\n\r\nIn short. If your into watching anime where a boy struggles to get stronger under the supervision of a bunch of idiots Kenichi is definitly a YES!",

            "content": "The story is about a boy named Kenichi who's nicknamed \"weak legs\". Kenichi is often picked on due to his soft nature. The story doesn't seem like anything special at the beginning, however the story quickly starts to pick up and become exciting once Kenichi joins Ryozanpaku. After that we get introduced to a world filled with strong and interesting characters and obstacles Kenichi has to overcome. Through these tough experiences Kenichi makes friends, grows as a character and earns a reputation for himself. The way this series executes Kenichi's growth is exciting and well done. Despite the fact that Kenichi learns to fight forthe purpose of getting these bully's off his back he manages to become infamous and gain the attention of even stronger enemies. I found it hilarious as Kenichi became more infamous the more enemies he defeated. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the best aspect in this series. Ryouzanpaku's masters each have distinct and likeable personalities. It's heart warming to watch Kenichi bond with his masters on a personal level and watch characters friendships form and strengthen with one another as they each go through hardships together. Once enemies but now friends. This is one of the reasons I love this series so much. Each of the voices for the characters suit them perfectly and do a good job at complementing their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very colourful in this anime and the animation for the movements are well done. I personally love the opening and ending songs. They suit the series perfectly. I love feel good anime/manga which is why I like this series so much and the opening and credit songs do a good job capturing the feel of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is really enjoyable if you like martial arts, comedy, great fights and friendship. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a fun series with great characters and a good story.",

The fighting goes from pedestrian to over-the-top, especially with Kenichi's 5 Martial arts masters. I fell in love with this show because the characters are so entertaining and and the story is very engrossing in a laid-back sort of way.\r\nKenichi is a pathetic wimp who gets bullied in school. He meets a girl who lives at a dojo and she invites him to come to the dojo to train in martial arts. Little does he know, there are 5 mastersat this dojo who all have inhuman skills in various martial arts. They train him until he is on the verge of death so he can become a strong martial artist as fast as possible. He attracts the attention of the local martial arts gang and has to take on their members throughout the show. If you like funny, happy, action-packed shows, then at least give this a try.",

My only complaint is that there is plenty story to tell and the anime is only 50 eps. long.

I'm no fan of shounen, and it is not a supreme masterpiece, but this anime manages to provide good comedy mixed with fighitng, and maintains good pacing throughout most of its episodes. Definitely recommended.\r\nStory:\r\nGood and fairly simple. Final conflict was a bit underwhelming, but the story mostly worked as a background for comedic plots and it worked for those purposes well. There's wide array of gags, running gags, etc.\r\nArt:\r\nAbove average. Characters are a bit more detailed than what you'd usually see in anime with lower budget. There's barely any reused scene (i've spotted about two), characters are not cookie-cutter (visually).\r\nSound:\r\nDecentmusic, solid voice work. I've recognized voices of Motoko Kusanagi (from GiS) and Yakumo Tsukamoto (School rumble). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters are fairly stereotypical, but there's great deal of character development going on. Characters change over time, cheir personalities change as well, they grow stronger, etc. The interactions are mostly slapstic comedy (although it isn't very cliched on its own), but those interactions are amusing. Characters are memorable, for example, protagonists's sister was one of the most amusing \"little sister\" characters I saw. Protagonist steadily grows in strength and his character transforms along the way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement:\\n\r\nNear the end of the series where the series lost their momentumn and started stretching fights for too long. There weren't a lot of those, though. Overall I found it interesting to watch due to comedy element.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is 50 episodes, but the quality of series is surprisingly good. It does occasionally have darker sadder moment, but it does not obsess over them, and is mostly on lighthearted side. There are better animes, of course, but there's not THAT many of them, and this anime works great when you need to relax/unwind. \\n\\n\r\nSo, recommended.",

The weak are bullied and thay want to get stronger to protect their beloved  ones. But the presentation is buffed with characters, emotion (voice acting) also fights ! and it doesn't seem out of place so (10/10)\r\nSound :\r\nThe animes all time music is good the fights are much more epic and it also addsemotion that are necessery to feel the saddness and awesomeness. The opening songs are very good and catchy i remember i was mumbling it from time to time without knowing so (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nThe characters are ok ! sometimes you get irritated of Kenichi because he keeps running away from training with knowing he needs it ! The other characters are also, some of them that is, interesting and sometimes they make you choose them instead of our blank minded idiot :D (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nYou do enjoy watching the anime, it might make you wanna take up some martial arts as well ! so (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nYou should watch it if you like fighting, comedy etc  kind of genres and it is an all time star in fighting animes so yeah watch it ! The only problem is the anime is a lot more shorter than the manga, the manga continues btw. If you like anime continue reading manga you will understand more about it and it will get more epicer ! (10/10)",

            "content": "Before I start this review I'd like to say that I have not seen the whole series, but I have seen half of it and I believe it's enough to give the gist of what this series is about. So anyways, on to the review. The story is basically about your average cowardly kid named Kenichi Shirahama who isn't very strong and is always being picked on constantly, because of this he attempts to learn Martial Arts through books which didn't work very well obviously. Kenichi then meets this girl Miu who after beating up and saving Kenichi from a gang of thugs offers himto train at her dojo. Unfortunately Kenichi did not know what kind of dojo this was and agreed. This is where he meets the masters which he will be trained by. There are 5 masters and  each are masters of their art, these arts are Muay Thai, Karate, Weapons, Jiu Jitsu and Kung Fu. Overall the story is enjoyable and even good for the most casual anime fans. The characters are fun  and the way the characters interact  can give quite the good laugh. It teaches you that you must work very hard towards a goal and it does not come easy, which is shown through Kenichi's training.  The fights scenes are great to watch and aren't over very over the top, the fights can actually become quite technical and every movement and attack has an explanation behind it. Another great thing about this anime is that everything Kenichi learns is applied time after time in each fight. Overall if you if are interested in Martial or train in the Martial Arts like myself you will probably enjoy this anime and will get excited to see many of the techniques you've seen or have even done yourself, in the anime being used. If anything at least give this anime a try, it's not the best anime ever made but it is a very fun watch.",

The story is really a classic one but doesnt get boring in any point. The classic \"wanna be stronger\" character that also posses his own well designed character elements. The art gives me the feeling of an old anime without that being bad or anything, only contributing to considering this anime an instant classic. In terms of character development it's really well made although it doesn't get away from stereotypes all that much. Finally,what makes it so great is that it'sreally fun to watch and makes you a fan right away.Definately reccomended\\n",

In other words, it's a simple story that's uniformly recognizable.\r\nArt: I, personally, found the animation to be slippery. \"Slippery\" meaning that there were a lot of coloring and  errors within the simple movements of the characters. Though the \"slippery\" quality tended  to get in the way of me watching the show, the gems within the show had to be the sequences with the  fights and most of the training with Kenichi freaking out the entire time. However, it seems that the animation gets better everycouple episodes. There is hope.\\n\\n\r\nSound: FUNimation products never cease to amaze me and Kenichi is no exception. However, I believe that, the sound quality is too good for the animation that is provided in the show thus far. The casting and line producing  were wonderfully orchestrated in all aspects. The voices match the character and vice versa. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main characters all seem to have a distinct personality but not to the point of complete predictability. The \"bad guys\" seem some what generic as well as some of Kenichi's own traits. These characters defiantly drive much of the story line.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Over-all, this anime was/is fun to watch. The dub was what, honestly, got me through some of the poorly done animation sequences. The fighting sequences were wonderful to watch and you feel like you're learning along with Kenichi once you get into it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Wonderful show to watch and to be introduced into the heavy shonen/fighting anime genre. The animation isn't up to par with the way it sounds and I hope that the story becomes more complicated soon.",

Well kenichi as an anime has great animation and flawless action, although the sound track is average. In my opinion the only down side to it is that the plot can tend to get a bit week at a few points, buti highly recommend it as a must see anime, even if your not a fan of martial arts. \\n\r\nP.S: The girls in Kenichi are amazing =3",
