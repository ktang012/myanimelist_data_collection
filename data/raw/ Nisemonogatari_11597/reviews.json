            "content": "Fanservice has always been a bit of a controversial issue. Some love it, some hate all instances of it. There's really no feasible way to please everybody when the reaction can often be likened to a dichotomy, split between 'too much' and 'not enough'. While Bakemonogatari is a series known by most for its unique art direction and character interaction, to say that it's removed itself entirely from sexual themes would be a flat-out lie. It's not much of a surprise then, that these elements are even more prolific in Nisemonogatari, for both better and for worse.  \r\nThe first thing that should be recognizedbefore watching Nisemonogatari is this very change and shift in focus. It wouldn't be much an exaggeration to say that at times it can feel like a different series, and certainly not all fans are going to approve of the change in tone and theme. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, things are not all that unlike either.\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this is the sequel to one of SHAFT's most successful anime, it would be incomprehensible for them to suddenly remove the unique style and flavor that the series became so known for in the first place. Head tilts are still prominent, the scenery is highly stylized, the characters will frequently engage in a playful diatribe and critique of Araragi, and surrealism remains a pervasive aspect in the presentation and overall experience. This is Bakemonogatari in much of its glory, but with the story itself becoming something of less importance than the characters and their interaction with each other. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the largest addition to Nisemonogatari is the new role of Araragi's two younger sisters, Karen and Tsukihi. Both of them form a group known as the 'Fire Sisters', and together they create the main focus of the entire show. Tsukihi is a sharply sarcastic and disapproving sister while Karen, voiced by the beloved Kitamura Eri, behaves as a bit of a tomboy and energetic character who strives to fight for justice and what she feels is the right thing. \\n\\n\r\nThese ideals of justice create an interesting problem for Karen as she comes into contact with the antagonist, Kaiki, a con artist exploiting teenage girls out of their money which quickly escalates into a conflict between the two, with Karen focusing on protecting the innocent and Kaiki on using them for his own avaricious goals. Kaiki as a character is quite unique and interesting as he never falls into a generic and stereotyped 'bad guy' persona, instead adopting a very grey morality where neither good nor bad exists. He cares for little else than money, and money is something he aims to attain regardless of who loses out for it. Surprisingly, he doesn't antagonize the main characters very much outside of their first few encounters with each other. As long as they don't complicate matters for him, he generally has no issue. The way his departure is handled is also very surprising and refreshing when compared to the usual conventions in storytelling. It's just disappointing that he loses his role as a main character in the second half and falls much to the side, since his scenes are without a doubt the most memorable and engaging in the entire show. Being a character that stands out so much in a series full of unique characters is a very hard feat to achieve but Kaiki managed to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Nisemonogatari wouldn't be the same without the cast from the previous season playing a prominent role in the story. All of the main characters from Bakemonogatari retain a large role in Nisemonogatari each with their own unique scenes, though unfortunately most of them don't appear anywhere near as much as they did in Bakemonogatari. Senjougahara in particular is largely missing from the first half of the series until becoming a large focus of the story again, which may be a bit disappointing at first for fans of her character. Thankfully, the episodes before that focus on an excellent blend of new and old characters and concepts, bringing just enough to the table to make the series fresh again while maintaining enough of the old that fans will still feel mostly at home when watching. \\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the aforementioned Kaiki as the antagonist, the story itself is largely about his exploits and the characters' resulting intervention for the first half of the story. It picks up further towards the end into a galvanizing climax and battle between Araragi and the two new antagonists, one of which being a character from the previous season. Fans of Bakemonogatari will find something enjoyable in that respect once things start to pick up, but the story itself is not so much the focus of Nisemonogatari as it is what gives a way for the audience to see the characters interact in a variety of new and different situations.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us to the main problem \u2014 fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like fanservice? Do you want fanservice? If not, you probably won't enjoy Nisemonogatari too much. It's not nearly as oppressive or prominent as some screenshots would lead to believe but it's very easily a defining and inherent part of the experience. Characters will frequently try to seduce Araragi which leads to some amusing scenes with him on the verge of cheating on his beloved girlfriend and paying dearly for it. There's also fanservice for the female viewers, with long shots gawking deeply at Araragi's chest. Nude scenes are not too uncommon and the series often plays more with sexual feelings than it does with its witty dialogue and stylized presentation. Though these common elements still do remain a large part of the experience, all one needs to do is take a look at the infamous toothbrush scene to have a good understanding of how Nisemonogatari is often presented. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not the viewer will approve of these changes comes down to personal taste and what they primarily enjoy the series for. It would be a lie to say that I didn't enjoy the frequent fanservice and sexual themes at least somewhat, but it's just that, perhaps, Nisio Isin and SHAFT went slightly overboard and forgot a little bit about what made the series so highly respected in the first place. It's enjoyable in smaller and occasional doses but being that it's the forefront of the entire experience, it sometimes detract from what is an otherwise very engaging and unique story. Subtle or even suggestive fanservice would have been preferable to the ubiquitous butt-shots and nude scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help matters much when the pacing of the anime is negatively impacted by the fanservice as well. As a result of much of the screentime being spent on trying to make the viewer erect, it often feels like the main conflict surrounding Kaiki and the later two antagonists is a bit rushed. Certainly, more time could have been spent developing those characters and the main plotline. Things often shift haphazardly between fanservice and important story events and it feels a bit unwieldy and awkward for that reason. It's hard to appreciate the fanservice much when there's a serious and interesting story going on in the background, and conversely it's also hard to fully appreciate the story when the next scene will transition into more of the fanservice and silly interaction. Had SHAFT and Nisio Isin focused primarily on the story instead of these sexual themes, the main story could easily have been something equal to or even greater than Bakemonogatari. Which is a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, thanks to the success of Bakemonogatari from a few years earlier, a large budget increase is very evident with the quality of animation. This really is one of the best-looking TV anime on the market and the fluidity in each frame is something truly stunning at times. The way the characters move and jump around so freely is something unique to the series when compared to the previous season which relied primarily on transitions and stills. While some complained about the lack of animation and movement in Bakemonogatari -- often comparisons to a slideshow -- this is definitely not the case with Nisemonogatari. This is just as much a visual presentation as it is a verbal one \\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari can often verge on the surreal with its artwork. SHAFT loves to play with their scenery in highly creative and interesting ways which serves to immerse the viewer and give personality to the artwork and the area that the characters live and interact in. It wouldn't be strange to see a colorless cityscape with a bright blue-green sky looming above, a room filled with mountains upon mountains of same-colored books, a sudden letterbox effect in the image, a home bathroom with stained-glass windows reminiscent of a medieval church, or a gloomy thicket dyed beneath a red sunset. It's this stylized presentation which creates much of the atmosphere of Nisemonogatari and what makes the viewer feel like they're in a very different place. There's really nothing out there that looks or feels the same way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with more effort spent on the series, positive improvement comes to the music and soundtrack as well. The usage of songs and music is a perfect fit for the scenes they are used in, especially those involving Kaiki. They may not all be songs that will stick in your mind and be reminisced for long after, but when used in the anime itself they are an excellent fit. And much like Bakemonogatari, a variety of unique opening sequences are performed by the seiyuu and each styled with their own unique theme. While there's nothing quite on the same level as 'Renai Circulation' here, all three of the openings are very catchy and memorable. In particular, the second opening 'Marshmallow Justice' was something that I felt perfectly represented the series as a whole and its theme. Disregarding my own love towards Kitamura Eri as a seiyuu, it's quite a pleasant song that mixes the quirkiness of the series with the energy of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end it becomes very easy to see where the complaints and negativity surrounding Nisemonogatari come from. While there is truth to be found in the complaints of there being too much fanservice, it's also evident that some are focusing too much on this one aspect instead of fully seeing what it accomplished and did well. It's not quite as good as its predecessor, but Nisemonogatari still manages to be a solid entry to the series and one that paints its own unique character as well. It's certainly different, and different in a way that will be either a bad or a good thing depending on the feelings and tastes of the individual. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, with the next animated installment of the Monogatari series these fanservice elements will be toned down a bit. We (well, some of us) have had our fun, and now it's time for the series to go back to its roots. Small change can often be beneficial but in cases like these it's best to know when to leave well enough alone.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari was certainly one of the more interesting anime of the season, not least for its trait of dividing viewers down the middle in terms of who enjoyed it and who didn't; this show, being the continuation of a well-known franchise, has attracted plenty of vitriol in the last eleven weeks, even though many people have been outspoken in its defence. But now that broadcasting is finished (even if the argument  over whether it is masterpiece or merely the latest victim of too-high expectations has plenty of fuel still left to burn), I'm afraid to say that I couldn\u2019t resist the lure dangling sotemptingly in front of me, and so it\u2019s time to tackle Nisemonogatari and hopefully wring a definitive conclusion out of it.\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main sticking point with Nisemonogatari has been the storyline, which was quite slow in its progression; if you\u2019ve recently read about the \u2018fast-paced, clever storyline\u2019, and are quite surprised by this assertion, then I shall elaborate; the first three episodes reintroduced characters from the first series, and while the Karen Bee arc was supposedly seven episodes long, it really did drag at points. In addition to that, the resolutions of each arc felt way too easy, and while we\u2019re on it, the almost-complete absence of Tsukihi from the first two episodes of her own arc was bizarre. Although it initially wasn't promising, the story did become more interesting as the series went on, although I believe there will be further episode releases post-broadcast, because not everything came to a conclusion within the eleven episodes (and the Japanese equivalent of 'to be continued' seen at the end of the final episode is a confirmation that we'll be getting more Monogatari one way or another). I think the best way to see Nisemonogatari is as the bridging point which sets everything up nicely for a third series (and if the director is to believed, several more series after that), and in terms of introducing characters who will probably play a part in these later series, it does a pretty good job. Contrary to the impression I might have made, I did enjoy watching this, but I do think it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is extremely effective. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything quite like it before (except in Bakemonogatari, to state the obvious for the resident pedants here). The background art is most striking, with the use of colour co-ordinated objects and scenery to create scenes which immediately grab the viewer\u2019s attention. The much-debated black and red scenes seem to have been cut down on since Bakemonogatari, now only making a couple of appearances per episode, but the use of talking heads is still common. The background sets the atmosphere much more effectively than a show which is constrained by realism; just watch Kaiki Deishuu\u2019s first screen appearance, and the shadows of the trees stretching out towards Koyomi, and you will realise the brilliance of this art style.  And now, the fanservice; how do they handle it? Well, what\u2019s happening on screen and the progression of the storyline are almost completely separate from one another, for starters. It\u2019s nothing compared to an actual ecchi series, and the characters are wearing clothes (cough\u2026 most of the time), it\u2019s just the choice of shot and where it focuses on the character\u2019s body that makes it fanservice. And when there are no clothes present, any details are obscured by the production team, preventing the need for masking or other censorship. That was incredibly awkward to write. Moving on\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound hasn\u2019t changed drastically from the first series; the episodes start with a blast of heavily distorted electric guitar, and a catchy pop-song opening, which is reminiscent of Staple Stable, to say the least. The lack of background music in Nisemonogatari compared to other series is noticeable,  with only the occasional piano melody from the opening or ending slipped in at appropriate moments, but with the amount of dialogue that it has, this is actually a good thing; it would be pointless including any more soundtrack, as it would just either pass completely over our heads or make it incredibly difficult to listen to. The ending is a pop-rock four-chord number which will probably get stuck in your head on an endless loop at some stage, and no amount of purging your memory with your own music collection will dislodge it. If you liked Bakemonogatari\u2019s Staple Stable and Renai Circulation, then this is definitely worth a listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the first series remain as they are for the most part, with the exception of Hanekawa Tsubasa, who is now short-haired. Hitagi Senjougahara, self-diagnosed tsundere of the highest order, seems to have been relegated to a supporting role in Nisemonogatari, having only made three or so appearances in seven episodes; however, Araragi\u2019s sisters, Karen and Tsukihi, step into the breach, so we have a net gain of characters. Connoisseur of Hawaiian t-shirts and supernatural phenomena Oshino Meme has disappeared, and the role of \u2018sole adult in the series\u2019 has gone to the much more evil, scheming Deishuu Kaiki, who looks like one of the creepier film incarnations of Dracula. It\u2019s interesting that they\u2019ve gone for a central villain, rather than having different problems which are unrelated in cause, as per Bakemonogatari. It must be mentioned that in this series, the characters do not merely lean on the fourth wall, they've practically installed a revolving door in it for their convenience. Even the creation of the anime was slipped a thinly veiled reference in one of the characters' metaphors. I quite like it, but you will need to know at least a little bit about the Monogatari franchise to get some of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt should probably be mentioned that Nisemonogatari will make some of its audience feel uncomfortable at certain points. Aside from the various Lolita characters, there are incestuous overtones involving Araragi and his sisters, including the now-infamous \u2018toothbrush scene\u2019. And I know that people will say \u201cOh, it\u2019s only here in the West that we\u2019ve got a problem with it, but in Japan, those scenes are seen as the funniest part of the show.\u201d Aside from not wishing to read anything into these peoples\u2019 apparent attempts to justify having relationships with underage girls or members of their own family, they might have a point; our moral values here don\u2019t let us see the funny side. If we look at the source of all this trouble, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s now-infamous novel, half the time he is mocking us and our values; are SHAFT doing the same thing? Quite possibly. Just be prepared to ignore the screams of moral outrage you might occasionally feel welling up inside you while you\u2019re watching this show, make sure your parents/partner/siblings/friends aren\u2019t going to walk in at an awkward moment and then spend the next three weeks not talking to you, and you should be able to cope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n\\n\r\nSo, Nisemonogatari does indeed have all the elements that Bakemonogatari was praised for, and at the same time features fanservice, which Bakemonogatari, if I remember correctly, did also have a certain amount of. I don\u2019t think it is possible that it has ruined the series, as some people claim; these claims probably would have been made regardless of the actual nature of the series, and were sparked by its mere existence. Unfortunately for those claims and the people making them, Akiyuki Shinbo, the animation director, has apparently stated his intention to animate every single Monogatari novel, of which there are (or will be, to be entirely accurate) twelve. Now, if the first one came out in 2009, and the second in 2012, I think we can safely say that this series will continue for a while. For my part, I'm looking forward to it, and I hope that it may continue to be as innovative and interesting as it has been up to this point!",

            "content": "Shaft has been on a pretty good run for the last few years churning out some extremely popular and perhaps over-hyped series.  Now they have brought us Nisemonogatari, a show that I was looking forward to quite a bit.  This is partly because I just generally find their work interesting but also because I did enjoy its predecessor.   Now while I would not classify myself as a huge fan of the original show I did enjoy the characters, quirky story, and fabulous artwork.  However Nisemonogatari is a pointless and directionless mess that feels more like a cash grab that takeseverything good about the original and turns it to crap.\\n\\n\r\nI am sure people will accuse me of being excessively harsh when I say Nise's story... is one of the five worst things I have ever seen.  Maybe that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t any story to speak of.  What this series promised us was a story about Araragi's younger sisters and their encounter with the black swindler.  It also promised some fill in the blanks of some of some of the other story arcs from Bakemono.  I was particularly interested in seeing more on how Senjougahara ended up cursed.  What we got instead is what I would consider to be a full length DVD extra putting the various girls in the cast in compromising situations and in assorted states of undress.  The anime plods along aimlessly, taking us nowhere substantive.  When they do finally get around to something other than panties or erotic tooth brushing, it is crammed in to an episode and a half and then quickly buried to get back to what\u2019s really important.  What\u2019s too bad is that when they do bother to tell some story I do find myself interested in it.  But also I was pissed off that it was all I got.  To be honest the entire \"story\" could have been more productively told with a 2 episode OVA than an entire TV season.  (cough: money grab)\\n\\n\r\nNow I am not going to sit here and rail against service in anime, what\u2019s the point?  I am not even offended by it and I find it pretty amusing most of the time.  Bakemono certainly had its pervy undertones but it didn't revolve around them or beat you over the head with them either.  Nise seems to have just taken those elements and decided to make an anime around them.  Frankly what offends me the most about the way the service is presented is that it takes itself way to seriously.  It\u2019s like somebody at Shaft just discovered you can put this kind of thing in anime and just completely lost their heads.  Then have the nerve to act like it\u2019s somehow smarter than anything we have ever seen before.  Just because you inserted some witty dialogue and clever puns in between the breast fondling and skirt flipping doesn't turn it into high art.\\n\\n\r\nSecond only to the horrible story is what they did to the series cast of characters.  Say what you will about Araragi's but for a harem lead (yes fanboys, Bakemono was a harem anime.  Deal with it.  It\u2019s not a bad word), he managed to be a pretty interesting and compelling character.  Well you can throw all of that out the window after viewing this series.  He is a shell of his former self as he has been relegated to an immature perverted lolicon and pedophile who would be a registered sex offender in every developed nation in the world.  His world view is that of a 10 year old boy, not a high school senior who is a borderline adult.  People might try to say he is being ironic or sarcastic or maybe he's just a bully or a clown.  But seriously who in high school, particularly a senior still goes around flipping the skirts of elementary school girls?\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast fairs no better.  The girls get little in the way of character development and are only treated as objects and tools for service.  While you may initially feel some nostalgia as the previous cast is reintroduced and it feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends. However, if you went into this show like I did, wanting to see and learn more about Araragi's two sisters Karen and Tsukihi, then you\u2019re in for a rude awakening.  (Unless that is you wanted to learn more about their bust size and figures)  For a series that was supposedly based around the two of them they have shockingly little actual screen time.\\n\\n\r\nWell it\u2019s not all bad.  As expected from Shaft, the shows artwork and animation is absolutely fabulous.  As is customary of their productions the screen is full visual overload of information with innumerable references and puns if you\u2019re able to catch or comprehend them.  The styling of the show is very much like its predecessor and has a very unique original feeling about the entire production.  Even though the artwork is undeniably stunning, I did not always care for it.  Another annoyance would be why they decided to cut the hair of every girl in the show.  By the end of the series everyone looks the same.  I mean... why?  If they had changed their hair colors I wouldn't have even known who some of them were.   But if you\u2019re just a general fan of art and animation there is a whole lot to love about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting is also equally brilliant.  I honestly think this is the one thing Shaft almost never fails at, is picking appropriate music and animation to open and close their anime titles.  Like Bakemono, Nise uses the voice cast to sing the various OP songs but it was the show's ED song which stands out the most.  ClariS' \"Naisho no Hanashi\" is by far the duo's best single to date.  Maybe I enjoyed it so much because it meant the episode was over?\\n\\n\r\nOverall only the most ardent Bakemono and Shaft fanboys need apply when it comes to watching this show.  Though if you were truly a fan of Bakemono I don\u2019t know how you could not end up being disappointed.  The lack of any kind of coherent story mars any sensory satisfaction you may get out of the shows artwork and audio track.  You can pour and entire bottle of perfume on a pile of crap but in the end its still, crap.\\n",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is the sequel to Shaft's 2009 hit Bakemonogatari. It features much of the same cast as the first show, but it includes many new characters as well. The particular focus is on Araragi's sisters, Karen and Tsukihi this time around. The first show broke sales records and this one is looking to do incredibly well as well. However, if you were expecting more of Bakemonogatari you might be in for a surprise.\r\nThere is always an issue with sequels when it comes to the story. They always seem to never really live up to their predecessors and sadly Nisemonogatari suffers from this issue as well.While the story is both interesting and engaging, it just lacks that overall \u201cwow\u201d factor that Bakemonogatari had. This pattern is especially prevalent in Shaft's other sequels other than maybe Hidamari Sketch but that's probably due to me needing a nutbladder replacement every time I watch another one of those. However, that is not to say that the story is not good. It is actually very good but it just lacks that special feeling that the first series had. When it comes to the actual story, it is a similar format to the first series where Araragi goes around messing with the various females in his life and unraveling mysteries. In Nisemonogatari the focus is on his two younger sisters and their issues though. However, instead of spending a significant amount of time on the mysteries themselves the sequel focuses more on character development and character interaction. I will not say that it's particularly a \u201cbad thing\u201d but the overall pace and tone of the story is definitely different from the first series and I'm not completely sold on those changes. Without spoiling everything, if you enjoyed the setup of Bakemonogatari and you enjoyed the characters of the first series you'll most likely enjoy the sequel. There really isn't much to say on the story just because if you're watching this, you must have watched Bakemonogatari as well so I would just be reiterating the facts that you already know. What I must point out is one of the flaws and distractions that was present in the sequel though.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari essentially translates into \u201cFalsestory\u201d or \u201cImpostory\u201d. However, it should be translated into \u201cFanservicestory\u201d. If I were to say Bakemonogatari didn't feature a significant amount of fanservice I would be lying, but they really did go overboard with the sequel. They must have put a significant amount of effort into cramming the most amount of fanservice into this 11 episode series and it definitely shows. From the convenient camera angles to half an episode dedicated to a discussion with Shinobu in the bath to the (in)famous \u201ctoothbrush scene\u201d you can definitely see that there was a significant amount of work involved. While the novel includes this as well, it certainly is incredibly distracting to the overall tone and mood of the show. This is one of those cases where the source material does not particularly go over well into the adaption. While the original source material did include a lot of fanservice, Shaft also took it a step further with a multitude of compromising camera angles. That is not unexpected of them since it occurs in nearly every one of their shows, but it only adds to the distraction and makes the overall feeling of the show more low brow than the predecessor. Before you get your jimmies rustled, I am not against fanservice. I enjoy fanservice masterpieces such as Queen's Blade after all. I just feel that the second season's fanservice was a bit excessive and detrimental to this show's overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat wasn't detrimental to the overall quality was the art in this show. Shaft generally has a policy where the TV broadcast looks abysmal but they come up with an absolutely stunning Blu Ray release. In the case of Nisemonogatari, the TV version is excellent and they will be hard pressed to do any incredible changes to the Blu Ray release. The animation was for the most part very fluid and the background scenes were beautiful. They really outdid themselves on this show and it looks great. Likewise, the sound was also excellent in this show. The OST was fitting and the various openings were all great as well. Platinum Disco definitely stole the show this time around, like how Ren'ai Circulation stole the show in Bakemonogatari. I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to the art or sound in Nisemonogatari. Shaft went above and beyond my expectations on making an actually presentable TV anime and the sound continued on par with it's predecessor. Overall I feel that this section is much better than Bakemonogatari since you could only really enjoy it if you watched the Blu Rays due to the sheer amount of fixing they did to it.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Nisemonogatari focuses more on characterization over the mystery solving that was most prevalent in its predecessor. We see several new characters such Kaiki who brings up quite a bit of Hitagi's past and Yozuru and Yotsugi who serve as an exorcist combo. We also see Karen and Tsukihi having actual roles in the story as well. Without going into much detail since that would give away the entire show, I must say that the characters are once again a very strong point for the show. There is little character degradation between both shows and there is quite a bit of development as well (some of which I don't particularly like but I guess it can't be helped after all). The new characters are interesting and enjoyable while the old ones are what you knew and loved from before. The voice acting was once again top notch. The cast is filled with veterans that you have heard many times before. The new characters are also voiced by veterans and are fitting for their respective roles. Even Shinobu gets to talk this time around, however instead of Aya Hirano we have Maaya Sakamoto for obvious reasons. The characters are definitely a strong point for the *monogatari series and it continues on quite well in this sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I must say that I enjoyed this show quite a bit but I was not nearly as impressed with it as I was with Bakemonogatari. Nisemonogatari does well as a sequel since it mostly maintains itself but it just leaves you feeling just a little disappointed. Bakemonogatari is one of my favorite shows due to its interesting dialogue, it's characters, and the overall story of it. Nisemonogatari picks up on much of that but the overall product feels unimpressive compared to Bakemonogatari. I think the issue with this show is that despite being great, it still pales in comparison to Bakemonogatari. The excessive fanservice and some certain \u201ccharacter development\u201d that happened in the last episode really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. That along with some of the previous season's characters getting much less screen time and development also makes me feel somewhat frustrated with this series. I will not say that I am platinum disappointed with this show overall, but I just feel that it is not as good as Bakemonogatari. What is good news is that this particular arc of the story is now over and there are plans to continue this animation project with even more. The Kizumonogatari movie should be coming up soon and a suspicious \u201cto be continued\u201d at the end of the last episode shows that this story is definitely not done with. What I can say is that I am still looking forward to more and I hope that the upcoming projects maintain the overall quality. Surpassing the original will be a difficult feat, but I'm optimistic about the upcoming projects and I can't wait to see more. I just hope to the Space Pope that Shaft doesn't decide to release them as online episodes every 6 months.",

            "content": "I will be honest, I hold a certain amount of bias for this anime, a bias that leans towards \"SUPAH\" positive. I love Bakemonogatari with a passion, and I will always convince myself that Nisio Isin will remain to be one of the greatest writers I've ever seen, at least when dialogue and plot is involved.\r\nSo, if I seem like I'm just acting out my part to spearhead the opinion of the fanbase, don't hold it against me. I will do my best to be as unbiased as possible. You have been warned.\r\nStory [9]\r\nTo be honest, I thought the highlight of the Monogatari series interms of story was found in Kizumonogatari. Nisemonogatari was slightly weaker, but this is a personal opinion. Usually, I would give it 10 and be done with it, but I will stamp it on with a 9 because of the fact that it's the second season of Bakemonogatari.It's not because I think sequels suck, I just feel that Nisemonogatari should've taken the liberty of introducing the setting of the series to potential newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nI've met many people who saw Nisemonogatari a watch, and couldn't enjoy it nearly as much because they didn't understand the story. I feel that some time could've been spent in easing the viewer into the idea of Nisemonogatari. If I were to fix it, I would've introduced Kanbaru and Shinobu, or at least give them mention. Maybe I might've missed them somewhere, but I doubt I did.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10]\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari has the same art style as Bakemonogatari, except a lot cleaner. I don't have much more to add. The art fits the spirit of the series, and to be honest, if comical art was more fitting to a series than a beautiful art, the comical would get a 10 in my book and the beautiful would get maybe an 8. Art's important to set the mood, in my opinion, and Nisemonogatari succeeded on that. Feel free to disagree on my thought in regards to how I grade art.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9]\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this series has always been great in regards to making elements outside of the plot fitting. Art works, and so does the music. My only complaint is the OP. It's terrific, but I feel like it was recycled from \"Staple Stable\", even though it totally isn't.\\n\\n\r\nMy take is that the OP is just to get into the musical style Bakemonogatari displayed, so it's not too much of a problem. I'm just going to tack on a 9 there though, but it will probably change in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10]\\n\\n\r\nI will not write anything outside of these three statements, including this one. I cannot effectively review this section because I'm too much in love with the eccentric characters that the Monogatari series has displayed, and although I shall miss Oshino Meme, the characters in the series have never appeared flat to me, and if anything, the characters really makes Nisio's invention shine through.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue is key, and I shall not comment further, for this is the third statement.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\\n\r\nRead the above if you haven't already, please.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nDid you now? Sorry...and if you just read it after reading the message above the ellipses above this statement, then thank you for following my directions.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Nisemonogatari displays the same strengths that made Bakemonogatari one of my favorite anime series of all times. It could be kinder in setting the mood for newcomers, or doing something new with the effective mood element. Hell, anything with the word \"new\" tagged in it could be improved on, but it's not going to detract me from waiting for new episodes every week.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? Very much so. \\n\\n\r\n...And with that all done and typed, my first review on an anime series is done. I shall click this pretty blue button that says \"Submit Review\" now.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari was a special anime for me. While it didn't really have any stand out qualities, the whole show ended up being much more than the sum of its parts. It had some nice visuals, fun dialogue, interesting characters and plot.  Maybe a dab of mystery/suspense here and maybe a few seconds of good animation there. Ultimately it was an incredibly enjoyable show that was just a blast to watch when all of its elements came together in a dizzying fashion. So you can imagine my confusion when I finished Nise only to realize that I hadn't enjoyed the show all that much. WhenI came along for this ride, I was expecting to have a damn good time, similar to all the fun I had with Bake. So what exactly went wrong with this show? A hell of a lot apparently. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is more or less the same kind of scenario we saw in its predecessor. The biggest difference between the two however is the pacing. Bake moved along at a brisk pace, it introduced new elements quickly and broke them up with some occasional fanservice bits and exchanges of dialogue. Nise does the opposite and moves along at a snail's pace. Everything is introduced very slowly and is resolved equally as slowly. The climaxes to the story arcs didn't really evoke any particular sense of excitement in me. Which brings me to another problem, and that's the complete lack of urgency and tension. Bake had a lot of mystery and suspense in all of its arcs; it was carefully put together and enjoyable to watch unfold. Nise somehow completely forgets to introduce any sort of tension until half-way through the show and right before the climax of its first arc. Yeah Kaiki was imposing when he was introduced yet he never became a threat until a couple episodes later, the mystery surrounding him wasn't particularly well established. There was an attempt at build up with off-screen interactions between him and the supporting cast but it was all vague. So when the time came for a resolution, I came away thinking \"so what?\u201d. There's definitely a problem when you're waiting for something good to happen each episode but nothing ever does. Nise is stunted as hell, there's no real build up and whatever little characterization there is, comes in the form of isolated little moments of plot instead of a subtle constant stream of information. The storytelling is a noticeable step down, and it doesn't improve a great deal. Rather you'll always come away feeling unsatisfied and wanting something more substantial from it. It does manage to get interesting during the course of its run but it never becomes truly engaging, it teases you with some good scenes and moments but it rarely follows through.\\n\\n\r\nBake found a balance between characterization, fanservice and witty dialogue. It juggled these three elements very well, always managing to stimulate the audience with their juxtaposing. Nise does not have this balance, and looking back, it\u2019s what made Bake as good as it was. It\u2019s what I mean by \"more than the sum of its parts\". These core elements are what made the original show so much fun. Nise unfortunately decides to throw characterization out the window in favor of more sexual stimulation and dialogue with 60% less charm. I don't have a problem with fanservice but it needs to be well-implemented just like any other aspect. In Nise's case, a barrage of gratuitous fanservice every other minute doesn't really constitute as good execution. An overload on one stimulus just makes it boring when it happens again. Fanservice gets yawn-inducing fast when it\u2019s the only aspect of note in an episode. The dialogue isn't nearly as fun as it was in Bake, it lacks the hints of characterization that was so prevalent in the conversations Araragi had with the girls. It\u2019s like they stripped these elements of what made them good in the first place and threw 'em back in without any substance this time around. With the interesting characters playing support, they don't really offer anything to the audience besides some occasional humor and tips for Araragi. The sisters don't fill this vacuum at all, one is boring as fuck and the other is irrelevant for all intents and purposes. Ultimately this entire story is really about Araragi and his relationship with his sisters, not the sisters themselves. His soliloquies are sparse and aren't nearly as effective as they ought to be, though this is more of an execution problem with the show. There's Kaiki and Shinobu as well, and admittedly, they're pretty cool. Shinobu's bits serve as closure for Kizumonogatari so I imagine that some of its impact is lost on the viewers who haven't read the Light Novels. There's not enough of Kaiki unfortunately, he's probably the best character to come out of this and his screen time is pitifully short. Overall Nise feels like a shallow version of its predecessor, which is saying quite a bit since Bake wasn't exactly down there in the Mariana Trench either. Bake's main theme (Growth/Healing) worked on several different levels of the story and was naturally interwoven into the narrative. It felt organic and refreshing; however Nise's themes (Fake/Imitation) feel extremely superfluous. It felt as though they were clumsily thrown in, as if NisioIsn was trying far too hard to emulate the same poetry of his previous works. Ironically Nise appears to be a hollow imitation of its predecessors which in and of itself could be considered \"Fake\" on some level. I wouldn't put it past NisioIsin to include such nonsensical meta bullshit in his works but this one is delivered in a half-assed manner so it\u2019s largely meaningless. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the only area where Nise falls short of Bake either; even some of the technical aspects are weaker. Yes the animation quality is much more consistently well done this time but Nise lacks flair and punch in its visuals. Many of the key staff that made Bake as good as it was are missing in Nise. People like Nobuyuki Takeuchi, Tatsuya Oishi, Toshimasa Suzuki and Shaft's own ace key animator, Ryo Imamura are not present and their absences are very noticeable. Takeuchi and Oishi contributed a hefty amount to the storyboard work; they made the visuals fairly exciting and involving, even if Bake often took the route with less animation. Nise however has less experienced people on storyboarding, so while Nise does have a fairly consistent level of animation quality, none of it is particularly fun to watch or evocative of the imagination. For example, part of the fight in episode 7 was done by Hironori Tanaka, a talented key animator. He was responsible for a good portion of the fight in episode 8 of Bake as well. One had incredibly dynamic, fast-paced and visceral animation; the other was slow, lacked any sort of momentum and was a bore to watch overall. I'll leave you to guess which one is which. The music on the other hand, is actually well done. The new OPs sung by Karen and Tsukihi's respective seiyuus are every bit as catchy and enjoyable as you'd expect from this series. Kaiki's main theme is amazing of course; the music is one of the few aspects that are on par with the other season. \\n\\n\r\nNise is a decent watch. Certainly above some many other anime but it's heavily flawed and is a clear decline from the first season. On the surface it appears to have all the same things that brought us all to love this series but lacks the gritty details. If Bake was more than the sum of its parts, Nise is in fact the opposite. Somehow its less than all of its individual elements. While some of them might indeed be great, the entire show is pulled down by sloppy writing, bad pacing, a lack of focus and an overabundance of fanservice. It feels directionless, its dialogue more meandering than subtle, its humor more reference-filled than witty, its themes more pretentious than heartfelt, and its characters more pandering-bait than people we should care about. This probably would have worked better as a short OVA series or something. Though at this point I believe Bake was a mistake on both NisioIsin's/Shaft's end and we'll probably never see the Monogatari series on that same level again. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh but it\u2019s annoying when people don't seem to realize what exactly it was that made a show good, especially if those people are the same ones who created the damn thing in the first place.",

            "content": "You may have read my review for Bakemonogatari, and if you have, you will know that I consider anime to be a legitimate genre of art, as are paintings, video games, and novels.  You will also know that my admiration for Bakemonogatari goes well beyond simple fandom and that I regard it as one of the masterpieces that transcends the genre, as is Michelangelo's David to sculptures.  If you have not watched Bakemonogatari, much of this review will not make sense.  That's to be expected since Nisemonogatari shouldn't make much sense if you haven't watched Bakemonogatari.  With that out there, Ibegin my review.\\n\\n\r\n***NOTE that the show is still airing, and I have only watched 8 episodes of of the 11 planned.  I feel that this is enough to write a review, but, as we learned from Bakemonogatari, when it comes to this series, one episode, or even one scene can change one's outlook on the entire series.  I will promptly address any changes that might arise upon completion of the entire season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 10\\n\r\nThose of you who have read my Bakemonogatari review will know that I actually gave lavish praise to its minimal and episodic plot, on the grounds that an elaborate storyline would actually distract from the character interactions.  I feel differently for Nisemonogatari.  This was never intended to be a standalone series; it is basically Monogatari series Season 2 (or 3, if you include the upcoming Kizumonogatari).  Therefore, most of the characters were already introduced in Bakemonogatari, and now it's time for some story, some of that actual \"monogatari.\"  And I had high expectations because I am currently reading a manga by the same author, which convinced me that NisiOisin is fully capable of writing elaborate, enthralling, and spectacular storyline in addition to the breathtaking characters showcased by Bakemonogatari.  Indeed, as I had anticipated, Nisemonogatari is much more plot-driven than was its prequel.  Character and dialogue is still very much the heart and soul of the series, but now we have longer story arcs, more plot expositions (as opposed to Bakemonogatari, in which most expositions were character expositions), and something resembling an antagonistic entity, the lack of which turned off many a shounen-lovers from Bakemonogatari.  The attention to plot is present in every scene.  For example, Bakemonogatari, while not simple by any means, was very chronological.  However, right from the beginning of Nisemonogatari, we see masterful anachronistic storytelling, which is hard to pull off unless the author and the director are both focusing on storytelling aspects.  This shift is slight indeed (the show is still very much character-driven), but in such a complex and well-balanced show, the effects are definitely felt.  It was a very smooth move to allow plot progression to occupy a bit more of the foreground, while the consolidation of the characters we already know and the introduction of only 3 more characters casually take a step back.  Svelte indeed.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? It's Studio SHAFT.  They absolutely splurged on the artistic presentation.  Much of what I have to say on the art overlaps with the lengthy discussion I provided on my Bakemonogatari review.  In short, the art really went for nothing but perfection.  Every frame is idealized and perfected, which is really a prime advantage anime has over live action.  Whatever isn't absolutely necessary to the scene or the plot is radically minimized, truncated, and symbolized.  What I really have to say beyond what I already discussed for Bakemonogatari is that the art style in Nisemonogatari is even more stylized and surreal.  The overlaps of realities, the use of light, scenery, the symbolims, the entire mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of every scene are much more dramatic than they were in Bakemonogatari, which was delightfully surreal to begin with.  This confirmed a conjecture I had upon viewing Bakemonogatari, that the series is just as much what happens inside the character's minds (usually Koyomi's) as it is what actually happens.  This accounts for a part of why the series is so inexplicably identifiable.  For example, movies like The Grudge horrify the viewers by showing them frightening images.  On the other hand, movies like The Blair Witch Project feature no actual frightening image, but manipulates the very emotion of fear in the viewer by evoking the genetically-ingrained terror of the unknown, of being pursued, etc.  The series, Nisemonogatari more intensely so, elicits emotion on two different levels in a similar manner. For example, we, as (male) viewers would see Senjougahara and think that she is a very pretty character.  However, add to that the viewpoint of Koyomi, her lover, and how he sees her, how he focuses on the way her skirt moves with her legs, the way she tosses her hair; also throw in those notorious symbolic frames that flash by more intensely as the two leads' verbal fencing match intensifies, those shots of Koyomi's rather excitable hair, and the result is a greatly amplified emotional response compared to what would have been had we simply seen Araragi and Senjougahara talk back and forth.  Genius, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI actually don't have much to say here.  To be honest, I just thought the opening and ending songs of Bakemonogatari were great, and the same goes for Nisemonogatari.  But to offer my perfectly honest and perhaps controversial opinion, I don't think OP and ED are really an integral part of an anime experience.  As such, I will not offer review of OP/ED titles.  I mean, they're like a minute long to look up and watch on YouTube, so no need for me to review them.  On the other hand, I actually kind of miss some of the mundane BGM's of Bakemonogatari that were apparently swapped or scrapped for the new series.  It seemed that Nisemonogatari is much lighter on the BGM and it being a proactive part of dialogue.  Other than that, the voice acting is the same top-notch performance we are familiar with, except maybe Senjougahara sounds even more breathtakingly sardonic.  This is one of those things where I really don't have much to say because the sound is just flawless.  Only that I miss some of those sound effect/BGM's that really set the atmosphere of surreal absorption.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nOhoho MAJOR, MAJOR character development from Bakemonogatari.  I mean, only three new characters are introduced, but the existing characters are oh so subtly revamped.  Again, some of the changes may not be noticeable unless you've seen each episode of Bakemonogatari, like, a dozen times as have I, but even subtle changes are massive in such delicate work.  To say to much would lead to inadvertent spoilers, so I will be brief.\\n\r\nKoyomi is a much more proactive and much more of a \"main\" character in Nisemonogatari.  In a way, Nisemonogatari is much more \"first-person\" than Bakemonogatari was.  Most of the expositions come from Koyomi's perspective, and the psychological reality I discussed in ART section is mostly what goes on inside Koyomi's head.  Also, I discussed before that there is much more plot now.  With more plot, there needs to be more action, and it is mostly Koyomi that answers the call and actually does stuff.  Interestingly, he was hinted to be a bit of a pervert (who isn't?) in Bakemonogatari.  This is explored much further in Nisemonogatari, and, in my opinion, is actually kind of a theme.  But more on that.\\n\r\nSenjougahara is ever so ethereal and psychotic.  Both her stationary and her wit have further sharpened since Bakemonogatari.  Since the two story arcs focus around the two new characters, she does take a bit of a back seat, but her interaction with Koyomi is still what the core of this show consists of.  Some interesting development happens to her in that she finally shows some level of emotional interaction with a character other than Koyomi; she now has a thing (I know not any other way to put it) apparently with Hanekawa, which is currently in the funny, joke-material stage, but I suspect that I will lead to something.  Some major, major, MAJOR stuff happens around her, but you will have to watch yourself to find out.\\n\r\nHanekawa, first of all, looks much better without her glasses and with those ridiculous braids gone.  Well, she's no longer the resident maganekko, for those of you who are into that, but she looks much better IMO.  And, as is always the case for anime heroines who take off their glasses and/or cut her hair, she has become more assertive, and over all, a stronger character.  Her relationship with Koyomi is both more involved and more distant, but more on that later.\\n\r\nHachikuji is probably the character whose development I most enjoyed since Bakemonogatari.  Apart from her actual story arc, Hachikuji was a bit of a comic relief character and occasionally a foil to Senjougahara, but she is now a much deeper (and funnier!) character whose position in Koyomi's psyche is elaborated upon.  Her appearances are some of the most entertaining scenes in Nisemonogatari.\\n\r\nKanbaru is largely unchanged as her brusque, depraved self, but her relationship with Koyomi has progressed.  More on that later.\\n\r\nSengoku.... err.. just watch that episode.\\n\r\nKaren and Tsukihi are Koyomi's sisters that were pretty much nobodies in Bakemonogatari.  They each get a story arc.  Since they are kind of the main heroines of Nisemonogatari (as Senjougahara was for Bakemonogatari), any in-depth discussion of their characters would spoil the entire season.  However, the role they have on Bake/Nisemonogatari as a \"harem\" show is important, and I will discuss that in the next section.\\n\r\nSo that's a brief rundown of the characters, but this show is different for everyone, so the goal of listing my perception of each character was only to show how exciting this anime is, especially if you're a fan of Bakemonogatari.  Make you own blissful judgments after you've experienced the unprecedented, mega-witty, mesmerizing character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nThis section is obviously highly subjective, and, because of that, it is here that I will discuss some of the more interesting things that have come to me upon viewing the first 8 episodes out of 11.  I was finally able to put a handle on what it is that made Bakemonogatari such an experience because Nisemonogatari is more overt when it comes to themes.  I've come to realize that the series can be summed up as a meta-fanservice.  Really, the show is mild in comparison to the level of fanservice in other mainstream anime, yet it elicits the most emotional response.  My theory is that the Bake/Nisemonogatari series touches on not just the sexual fantasies of viewers, but scratches the emotional itches of the viewer, resulting in a much, much fuller experience.  Those of you who have seen Bakemonogatari will recall that the climax of Koyomi and Senjougahara's romance, in the TV finale, actually occurred off-screen.  An even bigger pivotal event takes place in Nisemonogatari, and it is also off-screen.  That is why it's okay for Bakemonogatari to be a \"harem\" anime.  Nisemonogatari is very overt and gratuitous when it comes to fanservice, much more so than was Bakemonogatari.  However, all compromising situations Koyomi gets into with each female character (THE TOOTHBRUSH) is rendered moot in a fell swoop by the decision to minimize Koyomi and Senjougahara's romance on screen.  The two lovers spend the vast majority of their screentime together giving us those magnificent dialogues, and don't do any of the display of affection stuff we're so used to seeing in romance anime.  That is because, to Koyomi, Senjougahara is the subject of love and respect.  The ridiculous and often highly immoral (taken to a whole new level in Nisemonogatari THE TOOTHBRUSH) erotic situations he lands himself in with other female characters are meant to be gratuitous fanservice and nothing more.  I actually found those fanservice scenes to be the funniest of the series because they were so tongue-in-cheek in absolutely ridiculing fanservice, while actually providing top-quality fanservice.  That is what I call meta-fanservice.  Koyomi and Senjougahara's relationship has noticeably solidified.  In Bakemonogatari, there was always a sense of both Koyomi and Senjougahara playing along with the dialogue for the sake of the dialogue.  Senjougahara surely doesn't actually see Koyomi as a worthless human garbage (remember that dialogue?), but she says with her trademark snark, and Koyomi knows this, but he feigns injury.  This is much more involved in Nisemonogatari, where the verbal banters are more poignant, yet I could almost hear Koyomi and Senjougahara having a parallel telepathic conversation in which they sweet-talked each other.  In other words, their banters are like flirting; that's how they keep their relationship interesting for themselves and the viewers.  And, as their relationship has matured and solidified, it became more platonic, at least on screen, and other female \"harem\" members naturally could get more intensely involved with Koyomi to create those outrageous, delightful, hilarious scenes of meta-fanservice.  It is self-aware fanservice for the self-aware viewer.  Because I am a very self-aware and meta-cognitive person, I would, to be honest, have been a bit repulsed by the overtly pedophilic and even incestuous situations, but actually found them quite entertaining because the scenes themselves were also self-aware.  As is all over my profile, I'm pretty against the whole moe/loli trend, but I did not find Koyomi/Hachikuji harassment situations weird at all.  That is why Araragi Koyomi is actually an even more magnificent character than Senjougahara Hitagi: because he, for the sole sake of the viewer's gratification, goes out and gets tangled up with other women, but saves the viewer (and himself) from any danger of guilt by reserving 100% of his real love for Senjougahara only. \\n\\n\r\nI think I've blabbered on for enough now, but that just goes to show how much I appreciate this series.  Bakemonogatari was pretty much my penultimate anime experience (along with NGE), so I consciously lowered my expectations of Nisemonogatari, lest I be frustrated.  Looking back, however, there was no need at all.  Nisemonogatari is subtly, yet significantly of different flavor from Bakemonogatari, but it is just as enjoyable an experience.  The shifts in direction may have led some fans to believe that the show has lost its art-house flair and became a bit too mainstream, but I still maintain that Nisemonogatari is a continuation of Bakemonogatari as the culmination of modern anime counterculture (refer to my Bakmonogatari review).  I cannot give more praise to this wonderful sequel to a groundbreaking series.",

            "content": "An imposter is one who is skilled at the arts of deception, often using their gifts to swindle unsuspecting victims. While its predecessor, Bakemonogatari, focused on the supernatural forms of five everyday animals and how the heroines of the story had to deal with them, Nisemonogatari shifts the focal point to the effect that imposters can have on the lives of those around them, specifically the two Araragi sisters. The sequel brings back the heavy dialogue to a lesser extent, adding in a touch of fanservice to fill in the gaps. While liking one does not necessarily mean it'll be same for the other, thereis no doubt that both the Monogataris are NisiOisiN's more famous and successful pieces of work. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nAnyone who has watched anime for a reasonably long period of time must have come across SHAFT's animation on at least one occasion. Known for their \"unique\" artwork, SHAFT's approach is often times a risky \"hit or miss\". For Nisemonogatari, I felt the artwork matched the overall atmosphere of the series. The often comical expressions of the characters fit in well with the less serious aspects of the series. The usage of rapid scene changes and abstract visuals in the other parts were also able to set the mood with relative effectiveness. While it may take getting used to, the overall animation style is much more than decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nFirstly, Araragi Koyomi continues showing why he is one of the most interesting and respectable male protagonists in anime. Given the opportunity and situation, the words that come out of his mouth are unbelievably moving, even encouraging and true. One can easily empathize with his beliefs and ideals, which he strongly holds onto even in the toughest of times. Unfortunately, such a solid character is a rarity these days. While Bakemonogatari dealt with five of his female friends, Nisemonogatari expands on the two characters that are even closer to him: his younger sisters. The combination of Karen and Tsukihi make for an interesting pair; the two are literally the opposites of each other in terms of personality. Nonetheless, after having their fair share of screentime this time around, both sisters were developed quite well (more so Karen than Tsukihi, in my opinion). This can be mostly credited to the exceptional use of development-driving dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nAlthough there were fewer OPs used in Nisemonogatari than in Bakemonogatari, I felt they were all quite catchy and a pleasure to listen to. As for the ED, even though I really liked it too, my expectations for it (given that it was written by ryo from supercell and performed by ClariS) weren't exactly met. With that being said, topping \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" was hard enough already so I'm not going to be too critical. The BGM was at most times overshadowed by the dialogue. But when it was noticeable, it greatly enhanced each scene. Voice acting was once again top notch, with the cast from Bakemonogatari returning, including some new voices. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nCompared to a \"Ghostory\" or \"Monstory\", an \"Impostory\" is slightly more believable. Dealing with and confronting an imposter is no easy task. The main protagonist, Araragi Koyomi, was taught this lesson twice in the span of eleven episodes. With the story taking place over a time period of a few days, the amount of content involved is astounding. The fact that there were only a few episodes that were devoid of plot-development, proves how concentrated and detailed it is. Like in Bakemonogatari, the plot is mostly dialogue-driven. While this may bore those who are used to action-packed stories, I personally found the large number of long conversations, especially their contents, to be really interesting - especially the way they develop characters that, in turn, end up contributing towards the development of the plot. Although I'm certain that I missed many of the implicit meanings behind certain scenes, the fact that the story is still enjoyable is what matters, even if the bare minimum of what was intended is absorbed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nThe increased use of fanservice in Nisemonogatari may be a turn off for fans of the prequel. However, I felt it lightened up the series quite a bit, while at the same time reaching out to those who didn't really enjoy Bakemonogatari because of its complex storyline and total dependence on dialogue to drive the plot forward. Personally, I enjoyed Nisemonogatari more than Bakemonogatari. The balance between gags and seriousness made virtually all 11 episodes enjoyable and interesting. Boredom was hardly an issue throughout and it helped that each of the sisters got four arcs for development instead of the two or three that the other characters got back in Bakemonogatari. So even if you watched Bakemono and didn't enjoy it, I recommend you give Nisemono a try. They're more or less the same but the differences do make a noticeable impact. As for me, I'll be looking forward to a sequel seeing as how there was a \"To Be Continued\" sign at the conclusion of the last episode.",

            "content": "Better than the real thing.\r\nFake, unreal, an impostor. Story. With even more of a play on words than its predecessor, Bakemonogatari. Nisemonogatari is everything you can believe or disbelieve in when it comes to being a good anime. Directed by the avant-garde-ish Akiyuki Shinbo, Nisemonogatari pushes the boundaries of conventionality in anime and even in our own perceptions in more than a few ways.  Like Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari splits itself into two character-centric arcs, focusing on Araragi Koyomi's sisters, Araragi Karen and Araragi Tsukihi.\r\nAs a show Nisemonogatari carries surrealist presentation, strong dialogue interactions, characterisation, story, tenets of philosophy and seamlessly integrated 'fanservice'. It is thatfinal point which I believe draws the greatest strength of Nisemonogatari, not as an anime or show, but in the name itself. The seamless integration of the fanservice in this show brings about discussion whether or not Nisemonogatari delivers a story at all, or whether it is just simply a conduit for the release of morally questionable content, which is a valid point for many viewers and indeed the polarising point. If the latter being the case, then Nisemonogatari has already sold itself strongly as not being a story at all, that the Impostory has always simply been telling us the truth and we refused to believe it wasn't a story and that it was always intent on showcasing various fetishes. However if it is truly a story, then we can say it is a story about various impostors and believe the falsity or fanservice in some aspects of its presentation as being integral towards it. Either way in this discussion, the great power in the name of Nisemonogatari has already demonstrated what I believe to be an excellent show which will leave you reeling one way or the other as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe six elements of this show as mentioned above are seamless in their integration together which is primarily why I feel Nisemonogatari succeeds well in encapsulating the viewer in its mysterious world. As a show driven strongly by its dialogue, it is well backed up by the developed personalities and quirks of its various characters. The opening episode helps us reminisce the sharp personality of Senjougahara, her borderline sadism and her 'tender' love for Araragi Koyomi and hammers in what this show is all about, the powerful dialogue and serious yet occasionally comedic exchanges between the often powerful personalities in play. Within this scene, viewers are also treated with the surrealist presentation, the quick scene cuts, the magnified close ups which delivers a powerful intimacy, an almost voyeuristic, teasing approach to observing the relationship between Koyomi and Senjougahara. In terms of the story, this opening exchange would not have seemed significant at all, however the proceeding scenes and the effectiveness of their dialogue allows for seamless transition as the story is revealed to the viewer, bit by bit. Nisemonogatari continues in this vein albeit after this scene, exchanges grow even more unconventional, including the make or break element of fanservice. Combined with the surrealist approach and voyeuristic directing, the exchanges between Koyomi and various female characters have put many viewers on edge and an amount on high. However because these scenes generally carry some story significance or at least are serving as a transitional point, the fanservice slips itself in as a strange necessity almost. It is also important to note that these scenes serve as the intimate observation point of the developing feelings of many of the girls have for Koyomi.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I discuss fanservice, Nisemonogatari also strays far from the typical conventional ecchi like scenes found in various harem shows. That is to say that the fanservice in Nisemonogatari is different in terms of impact, presentation, time, location and case. One of the first things I should mention is how normalised the fanservice is in some cases. The character Kanbaru Suruga is an example of where her flirtatious personality results in her being intimately nude in her own room. The setting of her room is different to say more traditional fanservice locations such as the beach of hot springs and this also brings me to another point. As is with Shinbo's directing, Nisemonogatari's fanservice brings about this intimacy which is only exemplified by the surroundings and the scene cuts and close-ups. In some cases, the fanservice occurs in the room of the girl, or in one case Koyomi's own room which adds additional characterisation elements and heightens parts of the dialogue. Additionally, the fanservice brings forth extra dialogue which helps to proceed to the next element of the story. Some say you could compare it to Phoenix Wright, with a little more intimate action from examining witnesses in attempting to unveil the mystery. Also unlike other shows with fanservice, I feel that the fanservice here is not forced per se, but as mentioned integrated well into the story. Because the fanservice was done with story intent in many cases, and done seamlessly I feel that this element contributes to the success of Nisemonogatari as a show and to itself as a name. There is also the impact of a certain scene in Episode 8 which will not be forgotten any time soon.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the core of Nisemono (The Impostor), Nisemonogatari brings forth various intelligent exchanges regarding that topic. Whether it be fake love, fake feelings, lies, families, justice, relationships, Nisemonogatari has excelled at keeping towards its particular core topic. Some of the best exchanges are a result of discussions between Koyomi/Senjougahara and a self described villain and a self described good guy and they have raised interesting philosophical points of things we perceive in society such as good and evil and the power of lies. This is partly due to the excellence of the source material written by Nsio Isin, whose manipulation of language has proven to create powerful dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding some of the more technical aspects such as music, voice acting and animation, this is probably one of SHAFT's better works in terms of animation. Many will recall how horrible and non-existent the animation for Bakemonogatari was and will notice that Nisemonogatari relies far less on full screen cuts and has much more fluid animation. The voice acting for Nisemonogatari has also been excellent, in particular the voice of Kaiki Deishu, voiced by the experienced Miki Shinichiro. His deliverance of lines which were lies and compliments with sarcasm and scorn enhanced the many scenes he was in and certainly heightened the personality traits of his character. Kamiya Hiroshi also remains excellent as Koyomi Araragi, delivering comedic, serious lines along his character. I felt the OST remained a little under the radar, but proved to be good enough for the situations they were played in.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari presents a mature, comedic, intimate, emotional rollercoaster of a show with its avant-garde methods of presentation, backed up by its powerful characters and their exchanges and dialogues. As a sequel, it will prove more difficult to watch without watching Bakemonogatari, and as what I would deem a seinen show, difficult for newcomers to anime, especially those unaccustomed to degrees of fanservice. If you enjoyed Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari will be familiar to you and I would recommend you continue even if you don't enjoy fanservice. Fans of SHAFT shows should also explore the Gatari series and watch up to Nisemonogatari. Mystery, Fantasy and Comedy fans should also try watching Nisemonogatari, through watching through Bakemonogatari first. Nisemonogatari for me has few weaknesses as a show aside from it being a sequel and I'd rate it a 9 for enjoyment. Critically, Nisemonogatari also fares very well as a show, I think of it as the smooth, silky tapestry located in an art museum with all the statues and nude pictures, it's captivating, flowing and intricate, yet you don't stare at it for all the naughty bits. It scores a critical score of 8.",

            "content": "It might be a bit premature to say this, as (the infuriatingly-titled) Monogatari Second Season is still airing as of this review, but Nise is definitely the odd bird amongst the Monogatari series, always spoken of as an exception where the other three are the rule. And though I enjoyed it immensely, for reasons both wrong and right, it's an uneven mess from start to finish.\r\nNisemonogatari starts off sloppily, wasting the bulk of the first several episodes of an already short series reintroducing the cast of the first series, as well as the two new challengers: Ararararararagi's sisters, Karen and Tsukihi. They both fill morestandard harem archetypes that the first series left unfilled - Karen is the spunky, martial arts loving Genki Girl, whilst Tsukihi is something of a yandere (albeit more restrained than many others of her ilk). Both, of course, have a raging brother complex, because for all its good qualities the Monogatari series is still a harem, and therefore every single female character needs to be in love with the protagonist because fuck logic that's why.\\n\\n\r\nIt also introduces the first villainous character in Monogatari's canon, Kaiki Deishuu, a supernatural con-man who has run afoul of Karen and Tsukihi's vigilante antics. The Kaiki Deishuu plot is definitely the best part of Nise's first two thirds, but poor pacing leads it to take up a disproportionately low amount of screentime compared to reintroductions and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me this: while the other Monogatari series have plenty of fanservice, Nise is by far the most fanservice-centric. Entire episodes of it amount to nothing more than catering to various fetishes, some of which you probably didn't even know existed before Nise (if you've seen it, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). As a result, Nise is less substance and more cocktease, and suffers for it.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say Nisemonogatari is without substance - in fact, it does a very good job of furthering the various character interactions that are the meat of Monogatari. However, most of this is confined to one episode - along with most of the plot. This breakneck pacing immediately following several episodes of slow-burn nothingness is disorienting, to say the least, and lessens the effect of how good said episode actually was.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc that follows it is similarly rushed and very underwhelming compared to (the actual plot of) Nise's first arc, and renders Tsukihi one of the weakest Monogatari girls by making her little more than a plot device in her own arc. In spite of its themes of family bonds, it's one of the weaker arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAll this having been said, Nisemonogatari is not bad, and the reason for this is that it's Monogatari, so in spite of all its missteps, the directing is still wonderfully off-kilter (and the art has improved on its predecessor, what with being a post-Madoka shaft series and having an actual budget), and the dialogue is still utterly exceptional. With these being constants, it's hard to make anything actually /bad/, but not for lack of trying in Nise's case.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Nise is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine and is an entertaining romp, but it's easily the weakest part of the Monogatari canon. Also, toothbrushing.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Mysterious Girlfriend X, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari was definitely one of the most talked about anime during 2009. Whether it was the clever dialogue or Senjouhara Hitagi herself, fascination was aroused among the viewers. Now in 2012 Nisemonogatari, the sequel, rivals the splendidness presented in the prequel. However, Nisemonogatari shouldn't be pressing attention for the same reason, in fact its dialogue lacks the same teasing tone as Bakemonogatari, but it poses an interesting Eastern philosophy which most people tends to ignore while thinking of Nisemonogatari.\r\nOne of the most brought up issues about Nisemonogatari is its fan service. While rarely noticed in Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari presents its fan service in the most rawform possible. This claim can easily be justified by the old cliched lifting the skirt up, and touching female private parts actions shown constantly in Nisemonogatari, and if I recall correctly there is one episode where nothing else but fan service exists.\u00a0These flashy scenes don't bother me, but it's the incest connotation which comes along with it. Although these are just personal ethic beliefs, the fact that Nisemonogatari seems to be promoting incest behavior is definitely nauseating. Also, last season Bakemonogatari exposed just as much body parts in the beginning, but as the series progressed fan service was toned down. While, Nisemonogatari did the exact opposite.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Nisemonogatari can be split into two parts, each about Arargi, the main protagonist, and his two sisters. It starts out with Arargi's first sister, Karen, who believes she is justice. Karen goes after a character who was referenced multiple times in Bakemonogatari as an evil villain. And Arargi, thinking that he's responsible for his sister, goes after the villain as well, without much knowledge of what he's getting himself into. This conflict eventually gets resolved, but it doesn't end there. Then the story goes on to talk about the origin of Arargi's family's evil, and his second sister named Tsukihi. This is where the Name of The series, Nisemono, which translates to Fakery in Japanese, actually starts sinking in. The rest of this tale proceeds to talk about an Eastern philosophy which basically believes in the superiority of Eternal Beasts and how supreme animal beings can transmigrate their souls into actual human souls.\\n\\n\r\nNow when you think about ancient Japanese tales, that's usually it. The duality between material and spiritual souls was their deity/religion, and it's typically boring when anime are made about these sorts of topic. But what Nisemonogatari manages to do, the industry doesn't successfully do most of the time. It manages to mix religious tales within a modern perspective, specifically in modern Japan.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the own thing supernatural about Nisemonogatari, though. Many of the characters take in interesting modern outlooks on things. For example, Arargi is half a vampire, and most of the his friends are or were associated with supernatural beasts, mostly animals.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhat the Series ended up doing, like many anime does, is defy many laws of gravity as well as physicals. But it does conclude in a very intriguing way. A very interesting quote which went along with its central philosophy is this: \u201cGiven the real thing, and an indistinguishable fake, which is worth more? Naturally, my response was that the real thing was worth more. Oshino-kun asserted that they had equal value, though. But here is [his] argument: The fake is of far great value. In its deliberate attempt to be real, it\u2019s more real than the real thing.\" (ep 11) Such said quotes intrigued many interesting philosophical points which goes through many of its branches, such as idealism conflicting materialism, but were perfidiously introduced and explored.\\n\\n\r\nFor many of us viewers who enjoys philosophy over fan service, this anime would seemingly have failed in its attempt. Since, the series only elaborate on this philosophy to the extent of a few episodes while the first half was more on a seemingly pointless fan service session. Unfortunately, the sad fact is \u00a0people who watches anime these days prefers an enjoyable series such as Bakemonogatari, rather than seriously philosophical works. Thus, I understand why Nisemonogatari went down how it did, but why the directors could have just ignored following the Light Novels, and extended the series, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe new introduced characters in Nisemonogatari are really meant to appeal to the audiences. They can't really be considered new since their appearances were obviously present in Balemonogatari, but in this series their appearances are more pro-dominant. What's disappointing to many of Senjouhara fans is that her airing time compared to Bakemonogatari significantly decreased. However, it should be awarding that in a sequel about a whole another story she was allowed any. Other than that, the other two main characters are obviously Arargi's two sisters, and they're only decent. In a sense, Arargi is illustrated as a creeper/pedophile in Nismonogatari, more than in Bakemono. If you're into those kind of things, well here's a plus. If you're not, there's not many explicit scenes shown in this series so don't worry... Too much. Although I should warn you that blood is like pouring rain near the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Nisemonogatari is the outstanding aspect of the Monogatari series and perhaps even a trademark of the Shaft Studio nowadays. I was not disappointed by the visuals at all through this series, as well as the music. During Bakemonogatari's airing, Supercell was the main focus of the series and they succeeded with many of the Original Soundtracks. You could say it was the apex of Supercell's career. I can't say I wasn't disappointed by their disappearance in Nisemonogatari, but with its creativeness in the OP and Ed, I can't say I wasn't satisfied either.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series is the one that could have surpassed it's prequel, with more meaning behind it. However, due to its restricted requirements of having to follow an adaptation, Nisemonogatari ended up emphasizing the lesser important aspects of the show. As a result, Nisemonogatari's more insightful view points were almost concealed. But, the industry needs its money, and if they can manage to get it through other solutions such as fan service. So be it. Despite all its poor qualities, Nisemonogatari was still quite inspirational for a sequel, and I recommend it to any viewers who enjoyed Bakemonogatari's artwork or many of its previous characters.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNow let's just cross our figures and hope all the Gatari series after this one will learn from Nisemonogatari's mistakes, and become outstanding sequels themselves.",

            "content": "WAIT. Read. I didn't just unilaterally give Nisemonogatari a 1 because I didn't like the show and I'm thoughtless and spiteful like that. I want to start this review out with a bit of a preface. I've never written a review of something that I've given a 1 before, and that's because I usually don't finish watching them. Why would I? If something is terrible, I turn it off. However, Nisemonogatari is completely unlike any of the other shows I would usually give 1s, and is also the sequel to Bakemonogatari, a show that I am very enthusiastic about. I want to make that veryclear first: this is not an attack on the Monogatari series as a whole, but merely a single part of it. A part of it I very much feel it could have done without.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I give Nisemonogatari a 1? Is it because it has absolutely no merits, a void of any sort of intelligence or engagement? No. Not at all. Nise is actually an incredibly smart show, and there were aspects of it that I appreciated immensely. The backgrounds are stunning, the references are great, the humor is oftentimes on-point and a good portion of the dialogue is insightful and meaningful. There were several episodes (3 in total) that I actually enjoyed from start to finish. The reason I gave Nisemonogatari a 1 is that it aptly fits my description of a 1: It negatively impacted me as an individual and I feel as though it is an unhealthy, detracting experience for people in general. It promotes toxic ideals and actively helps to make the world a worse place. \\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't aware already, Nisemonogatari is famous for its fanservice. The entire Monogatari series is, actually, but I wouldn't even call it fanservice in the rest of the series. In Bakemonogatari, for instance, the camera is used effectively as a lense for the protagonist Araragi to show what he is focused on. When he is having lewd thoughts about a person, it will portray them sexually. This is only the case, however, when it actually fits with what is going through his head, and regardless of how Araragi may VIEW various characters, this doesn't change what actually HAPPENS. This is because he is a human not a god and regardless of what his fantasies may be the world is not going to conform around them. Instead, he is often chastised for his perverse thoughts and it's something he eventually has to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nIn Nisemonogatari, this changes. Araragi suddenly becomes the focal point of the world, with every straight girl inevitably seeking to erotically seduce him and even the lesbian character wants to tear off his clothes and roll around naked with him. Even if there is no spontaneous sexual tension between Araragi and a character, the show still devises plenty of ways to put them in absurd compromising positions with each other, liking having Hanekawa roll around on his bed or Shinobu take a bath with him. Now I've heard plenty an educated argument for Nisemonogatari, claiming that it actually hates fanservice and is demonstrating the incredible potential of the camera to portray a character's intentions or emotions, and I would agree that the directing work is masterful. There are two scenes; one towards the beginning and one towards the end of the series in which Araragi's sister receives a crotch-shot. The first one is completely un-sexual, demonstrating the lack of tension in their relationship, while the last one is the exact opposite, showing how that has changed. It's extremely well-done. However, that doesn't change the fact that it's just an intelligent way of fan-pandering. This argument can be applied to nearly all of Nisemonogatari: yes, Nise hates fan service; or rather, Nise hates the uncreative and unenlightened way in which most fan service is done. It wants to demonstrate how it can be done more effectively, setting up moments of situational and emotional softcore porn as opposed to just making some tits & ass wobble. It's extremely good at it, too: if your evaluation of a show is ambition vs. result, than Nise is a roaring success. However, it's not the execution for which I condemn Nise, its for what its goals are and therefore what its effect on its audience is.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice is annoying. At least, that's how I feel. But fanservice alone, ironic or no, is not enough for me to write off a show. Sure it can get irritating at times and it's a little insulting, but I don't consider it normally capable of single-handedly sabotaging a show. It's usually the case that shows that rely on fanservice to entertain their audience do so because they don't hold a great deal of respect for themselves in the first place or because they don't feel as though they have anything especially original to do or say, causing them to fall back on basic, shallow means of engaging their viewers. This isn't always the case, though: Code Geass and Haruhi Suzumiya stand out as examples to the contrary. Nise's not like that though: it takes pride in its ability to absorb its viewers in its carefully-crafted pandering, and that makes it all the more poisonous.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three major reasons why I abhor Nisemonogatari. They are as follows.\\n\\n\r\n1. The fan-service actively detracts from, and oftentimes takes the place of the plot and characters. The show constantly goes out of its way to create appealing situations, turning its characters from the previously multi-dimensional beings that they were into absurd blobs of either hormones or obliviousness. Characters are made conveniently unaware of their situation to allow other characters to up their advances, taking the believability out of them. Entire episodes are spent on contrived erotic situations that devour any meaningful character interactions and replace them with characters making excuses to the audience to touch each other and calling it development. The actual story is condensed to the ends of arcs, becoming rushed and crammed into single episodes of extremely belated exposition rammed back-to-back with resolutions. This makes the show itself far more simple than it could have been, substituting the difficult truths of Bakemonogatari for childish moral taglines and replacing the meaningful personal revelations that were a result of conflict that was internal with physical villains who are either stupidly irredeemable or blatantly hypocritical. This is a very steep and very sickening price to pay for the constant fan-service.\\n\\n\r\n2. Nisemonogatari is part of the Monogatari series. As a stand-alone, it could just be written off or dropped. However, as is, Nise is an active part of a pretty incredible series, one that it actively detracts from. It would be one thing if it were merely boring or slow, but it's more than that. No one's character motivations are consistent: Hitagi, who used to be over-protective and possessive of Araragi, suddenly decides instead that she's fine with him sleeping with whoever he wants as long as he loves her. Suruga, who used to be many things: athletic, energetic, envious, self-loathing; becomes defined exclusively by the trait \"she is horny\". Hanegawa, who was previously sharp with Araragi for being perverse despite her feelings for him, starts cracking jokes about him feeling her up. Araragi himself is the worst offender. While initially he was characterized as selfless to a fault, self-aware, and endearingly thoughtful of people's feelings, he's now decided to be conveniently oblivious and remorseless as he tramples on whoever-the-fucks emotions to cop a feel whenever possible. What once were entirely believable fantasies have manifested themselves in far-less believable actions. It's a lot easier to control what we do than what we think, and Araragi has aptly demonstrated an incredible willpower many a time. That he would so casually revert to this without any sort of triggering event or internal conflict is entirely unbelievable. All of this is a result of the show warping its characters to create the erotic situations it wants to, and it bends everything too far. Nisemonogatari breaks the illusion of the Monogatari world. Its inconsistencies, indulgent depravity and unfortunate placing in the middle of the series cause it to do hefty and irrevocable damage to the series as a whole. With a series as generally impressive as Monogatari, this is a real tragedy.\\n\\n\r\n3. This is the big one. So far, I've described why I believe the show is bad, but internal sabotage and series sabotage are not enough to warrant a series a 1. What makes Nise so irredeemable is the impact is has on society's perception of sexuality. There is already enough of a problem with media portraying sex as very different than it actually is, glorifying it, creating false expectations of what it is supposed to be like, and taking the messiness and humanity out of it. This is actively damaging to impressionable youths and has a negative impact on social behavior and body image. Nise actively promotes these portrayals, portraying characters as young as 14 in erotic situations in ways that are meant to, as obvious by the expert camerawork, glorify it. This creates a false impression of what sex is like and pushes people to feel as though this sort of behavior is what is expected of them. If they aren't indulging in it too, they're missing out. Look how fucking hot it is, right? This is not to mention the fact that she show uses incest and a vampire trapped in an 8-year-old's body to draw out the appeal of a 'forbidden love' in its viewers. The worst part of all this is the way that Araragi is portrayed: not as the sleazy womanizer that he is, but as a gallant hero who all men should aspire to be like. He's shown as a kind, protective, morally-sound guy who gets to fool around with lots of girls as a result because he's earned all of their affections. In addition to this, unlike similar shows Nise has a very intellectual and mellow vibe to it that makes it much easier to justify enjoying. It's not in-your-face trashy. If you're looking for ways to make entitled monsters out of lonely and insecure young boys, then you've found a pretty sound bet in Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nInevitably, the show's final flaw is that it never addresses any of its choices. For a season that's essentially about fanservice, it sure never tries to make any contrasting points about why perhaps this kind of media and the ideas that it fosters are unhealthy. No, right up to the end Nisemonogatari is detrimental to itself, detrimental to the Monogatari series, and detrimental to society as a whole. For all of its gorgeous art and witty conversation, I can't think of anything I've actually finished that has been more deserving of a score of 1.",

            "content": "I really, really wanted to review Bakemonogatari way back when it aired, since the show seemed to captivate the anisphere but because of the fact I only just joined, that was of course wasn't possible. Here\u2019s the thing though: I was never quite sure what I watched. To me, the show was overly complex when it didn't need to be, a continual tease, and only \u201cintelligent\u201d in the way two teenagers up late talking about life can be. But I held my tongue. I could never form a set of arguments that satisfied me. Nisemonogatari, on the other hand, I understand and was prepared for.This time, I get it, because if the prequel was everything people said of it, the Spring 2012 show is definitely worse.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10) - Nisemonogatari\u2019s TV run picks up shortly after the end of its prequel series and sees Koyomi Araragi spending time shirking his studies and visiting his various friends. While the anime starts off touching base with its characters and serving up the meandering conversations for which Bakemonogatari gets so much praise, eventually a pair of incidents surrounding Araragi\u2019s \u201cFire Sisters\u201d become the show a semblance of a plot.\\n\r\nSadly, Shinbo gets in the way more in this season than the last. He turns the fanservice meter up to to eleven, exchanging the clever banter for lovingly crafted shots of his underage beauties. Sure, the first season had its awkward moments of lingering on jailbait, but this time, we spend significant portions of the plot watching Araragi oggle, fondle, and play twister with teenage girls with very little story-related payoff. The infamous toothbrush scene--during which Koyomi and Karen play a punishment game in pretty explicit imitation of a sex act--in particular drags on for an uncomfortable amount of time and doesn't do much more than provide cognitive dissonance with Araragi\u2019s later explanations of filial relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (10/10) - In contrast to the scattered storytelling bringing down the anime, the visuals deliver precisely what the audience has come to expect from Shinbo at the top of his game. While the direction remains avant garde at times, the animations ensure that the characters and settings appear as lovingly rendered as possible, and the juxtaposition works. The constant cuts work better in the more intimate setting of this series and either work to intensify the action (the few times when it does come up) or create an almost tactile understanding of a scene in his viewers (see: the pencil or toothbrush scenes).\\n\r\nThe character designs help Shinbo in his quest to provide the best visual experience. Each character can flow between eerie, moe, and attractive almost at will without damaging the coherence of a scene, and again the disjointed direction helps ease the transition between the silly and the serious. The mercurial and flexible portrayals work best with Koyomi, Kanbaru, and Kagenui who work hard at hiding multiple sides to their personalities and identities. But it also helps to add surprising depth to Hachikuji whom the script treats strangely.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - For all that Renai Circulation should still be banging around in some of your heads, Platinum Disco manages to raise the bar. Its combination of traditional sounds, upbeat vocals, and a pop baseline makes it one of the best offerings of the year.\\n\r\nOnce again, Hiroshi Kamiya gives us a super-plastic Araragi who really saves the show. Since he\u2019s in just about every scene and spends a good portion of the time wandering all over the emotional spectrum, this performance determines whether the narrative holds together at all. That he succeeds frees the rest of the cast to stick to caricature. Of these, my personal favorites are Maaya Sakamoto\u2019s Shinobu, Emiri Katou as Hachikuji, and the delightfully petulant Tsuhiki played by Yuka Iguchi, although my preference for those characters clouds my judgement. Fans of aloof tsundere should still find Chiwa Saito\u2019s Senjogahara easy on the ears and the newcomers playing Kagenui and her familiar provide excellent \u2018otherness\u2019 so needed for the roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) - Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari play with the shifting space between characters as tropes or ideas and characters as interesting, layered personalities. The earlier show\u2019s meatier conversations create a wide-open space for exploring each characters\u2019 quirks as he or she (mostly she) banters with Araragi. Here, however, something seems off. Araragi spends too much of his time alone in the first half of the show or beating around the bush as the first conflict winds up. Moreover, Suruga and Nadeko, who had displayed their personal conflicts and quirks prominently before, flatten into their single defining traits for their brief appearances which feels disappointing after their humorous arcs in the first season.\\n\r\nEven so, some characters shine through the odd direction choices. First and foremost, Hitagi\u2019s moments near the end of the Karen Bee arc show a vulnerability and depth of emotion to her that works well at complementing the sensitivity shown near the end of the first season. Retreading her weakness provides some much-needed cracks in her cool tsundere. Shinobu gets a similar treatment that has her bounding between violent legendary vampire and lonely little girl. Isin binds the two personalities together using her condescension as glue, which allows her to be aloof, ironic, and earnestly concerned about Araragi without stretching the limits of her characterization.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) - Its prequel straddles the line between self-importance and brilliance. Nisemonogatari, however, distorts the formula sufficiently to lose some of its shine. The top-notch visuals and exceptional sound direction don\u2019t entirely excuse Shinbo\u2019s explosions of fanservice and stuttering plotting, but fans of the first series should still find lines of character development worth following and many of the same themes on display. If you liked Nisio Isin\u2019s first installment, you should take this second bite, just don\u2019t expect it to blow your mind.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is the most disappointing thing since Barack Obama.\r\nI mean what the hell was that, this wasn\u2019t a sequel, for the most part it felt like a really long OVA that you\u2019d get for buying a special edition of Bakemonogatari, because nothing happens in this series at all, except we are introduced to Araragis sisters but that\u2019s all, there is virtually no character development for the sisters at all in a series that is almost entirely about characters.Now Bakemonogatari was good, i didn't love it or anything but for the most part i enjoyed it,  the visuals were a pleasure to watch, the music was good, the dialogue was sharp as a blade and the characters were mostly interesting because it was a pleasure to see them interact with each other and see what happens. But if you\u2019ll recall Bakemonogatari also had something that called a story, you know things happen in it, characters are introduced and develop and grow, problems arise and our characters try overcoming them and maybe learning something along the way you know shit like that. But Nisemonogatari has nothing, the characters are boring cardboard cut outs and the most shocking thing of all is that nothing happens in this series at all unless you include implied incest as something but if you do then you need take your brain medicine and get back in your toll booth. \\n\\n\r\nOkay so let\u2019s get into this shit and start with what\u2019s wrong with the story, as if I even need to say it because it so obvious Ray Charles could see it, and he doesn\u2019t even know anything about anime. Okay so I\u2019ll be brief there is no story, it\u2019s just a bunch of stuff that happens to give us an excuse to see girls in compromising situations and yes I know Bakemonogatari is a harem but we still need something or else we don\u2019t care about the characters and it gets boring. And thats what Nisemonogatari was, boring, uneventful and ultimately pointless you could watch the episodes in any order and it wouldn\u2019t make a lick of difference because there\u2019s no story. The whole series just comes off a sequence of colourful crisp images played in a sequence to trick people into thinking there watching an anime when in fact they\u2019re just being scammed. That\u2019s right I said Nisemonogatari is just a big scam to trick idiots who liked Bakemonogatari into thinking there watching the same thing when in fact they be better off watching a strobe light while listen to music from Bakemonogatari  because that\u2019s basically what this was. I mean I know Bakemonogatari was no Citizen Kane but it was fun to watch, the show struck a great balance between comedy, fan service characters and story and even threw in some nice visuals and music to boot while Nisemonogatari is like its retarded little brother which fucked up everything from pacing to character development to my brain, ahhh it hurts, make it stop!      \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, another glaring problem with this faecal matter was the characters, much of the original characters return but they feel like shadows of their former selves and don\u2019t do anything to the point where I wonder if the people who made Nisemonogatari even watched Bakemonogatari or have any idea of what made it good. They come off as cardboard cut-outs just there to further the illusion that what we`re watching is a sequel to Bakemonogatari and not crap. So anyway the whole point of this I think was to introduce us to Araragi`s sisters and then have something involving them happen or whatever but does that happen\u2026\u2026 no! Jack shit happens except scene after scene after scene of Karen and whatever the other sister was called in provocative positions and some half assed plot about some guy who\u2019s doing something to people at their school but it goes nowhere and the bad guy just leaves when confronted. Jesus Christ are they trying to bore the audience to death, I think the people that made this thought that as long as it looked like Bakemonogatari then they put whatever the hell they wanted into it and get away because idiots can\u2019t tell when their being scammed.     \\n\\n\r\nSo anyway there\u2019s about a million other things wrong with this series but I\u2019ve wasted enough of my time on this shit, when you\u2019re 147 years old like I am you can\u2019t waste your time so, you know, watch it, don\u2019t watch, I don\u2019t really give a flying fuck but if you\u2019ve got like cancer or something that\u2019s like killing or something then you then you probably shouldn\u2019t watch this because it sucks balls and is just a big time wasting scam.  \\n",

            "content": "Shaft... just words can't describe their magnificence.  If you have seen Shaft's works, they are truly amazing and one of the best animation studio. Bakemonogatari was the first anime I've watched when I came back to watching anime in December 2012. I've got to say that Bakemonogatari was a genuine work of literature and it was my favorite. The monogatari series focuses on mysteries of each character and explains them in a beautiful way. I kept telling myself that this series isn't the best, but I was sadly lying to myself.\r\nNisemonogatari is a continuation of Bakemonogatari and focuses on the sisters. Araragi-Kun has twosisters: Karen and Tsukihi. As we already know, Araragi is a vampire and he has to the decency to help other people with weird problems. Who knows that the sisters even had supernatural problems? The plot was creative and wasn't cliche. Give a hand of applause to Isin Nisio, the author of the Monogatari series. I couldn't tell what this intelligent man was thinking, but I had to agree that his literature was one of my favorite. Nisemonogatari shows the relationship Araragi has with his sisters since it wasn't focused much on Bakemonogatari. There has to be some background knowledge if you introduced a character into an anime. It would be vague if the sisters weren't explained, but introduced in Bakemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely amazing. I loved the way Shaft animated it. It is truly convey the cinematic. I'm glad that Shaft is going to animate Monogatari: Season 2 in the summer. To add more, their going to animate the movie, Kizumonogatari! The head tilt is what Shaft was known for and it was unique in its own way. The characters were well drawn and the background was good. There was a bit of action in Nisemonogatari and it was amazing. It was just the literature which makes Monogatari series stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime focuses on the sisters, there are only 3 opening. The beginning is Senjougahara, but the rest focuses on Karen and Tsukihi. The music for Shaft is amazing and I love the way they animate each one. I have to say that Tuskihi's opening was my favorite. It was cute and it reminded me classical music. The ending was made by ClariS and it was pretty good. Other than that, Nise was well made.\\n\\n\r\nThe huge change I've seen was that Nisemonogatari added too much fanservice. I can say that it was hilarious cause I believe it was intentional and it has a significance in the anime. It isn't those ecchi anime without any meaning. I mean I can just sit here and watch oppais bouncing around, but the ecchi here is creative and symbolic. It is also to approach siscons and brocons. The monogatari series have a broad genre that it appeals to most viewers. You don't have to be a mystery lover to enjoy this anime, nor a ecchi fan to enjoy it too. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I just want Shaft to take my wallet and my car and my clothes and my computer and yadda yadda. This is one of the anime I was interested in buying figurines and stuff to support the author and the company. The story was great, the art is superb, the music was soothing, and characters were likeable and I enjoyed the anime throughout. It touched the goal where Araragi wants to save everyone who he cared deeply for.\\n\\n\r\n\"It is impossible for someone to replace someone else.\" - Araragi Koyomi",

            "content": "Ka, ka, so this 11 episode anime has just ended, as far as I want to give it a good rating, it simply doesn't deserve  any, in fact the story doesn't apply fully to the plot and the plot is often accompanied by a lot of symbolisim and metaphore usually in conjuction with art, so for the story it is a \"Poor\" number 3. And as for the art, I'll give it a \"Good\" number 7, since the illustrator puts more detail into the art than the story.\r\nSound: Fair 6.\r\nDon't ask.\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\r\nFrankly this is no longer about Koyomi and Hitagi rather this ison Koyomi and his relationship with his fire sisters, namely Karen and Tsukihi, with Shinbo on the sides. It won't be fair if I'll just focus on the wussie Koyomi if I don't inculde his fire sisters and his vampire familiar. But I cannot discount the antoagonist Kaiki Deshi who at first we are expecting to have some fight against the protagonist. Sadly, the expected fight didn't came instead it the fight is between Koyomi and Shinbo vs Yosuru and Yotsuga. Oh, and Koyomi is one big loser compared to Shinbo who was able to beat the crap out of Yotsuga, so this part only deserves a 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, first of all this anime's genre is comedy and supernatural, the thing is the comedy part is pretty lame, only the supernaturaln thing is one that carrys the overall of this anime, the enjoyable part is mostly on the incest play that Koyomi does with his fire sisters and all the blah, blah, blah that comes with, also there is the art which were exhibited as metaphore that more likely serves as fillers to elaborate the anime's overall make up, so at this point, it is clear that this is simply not for those who don't see the symbolisim that goes with the plot, ka,ka.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari..\r\nNisemonogatari... \r\n\"The series was first created by Nisio Isin as a series of short stories for Mephisto magazine.\" -Wiki\r\nIt seems quite a few people who watch this series are unawares or only partially aware to the fact that this series was originally a  light novel. I'm writing this review thinking of the viewers who do not know quite as much about the series as they could, and may want to learn a bit more after seeing Bakemonogatari.\r\nLet me start off saying that the author of this series has captured my heart, be it translated bits of light novel or the animated adaptations that havesprung fourth from this series popularity, the Monogatari Series has awed me in many many ways.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari; even though this is my only review written for the Monogatari series at all so far, I will attempt to focus on Nisemonogatari itself. \\n\\n\r\nNise~ is a continuation of the Monogatari series. It is indeed a sequel. It is the 2nd volume in the light novels as well as the 2nd season in the animation. It picks up after Koyomi has successfully saved 5 different girls and now allows us to see him developing his relationships with the characters now surrounding him rather than completely focusing on the mysteries surrounding spirits and the people they attach themselves to.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a sharp-tongued ex-vampire who lives in Koyomi's shadow to a pair of younger sisters attempting to exact justice on the world, even at the expense of their older brother's peace of mind, Nisemonogatari is here to help us grasp what is happening to the characters since the first volume/season ended.\\n\\n\r\nOne very unique aspect I love about this series is that it frequently uses a psuedo-fanservice to drive many of it's scenes and conversations. The way the characters talk with each other, the concern or lack of concern for delicate situations between characters, these vague ideas express specific instances that occur throughout the series where when you are watching these scenes; you are able to grasp just what kind of relationship certain characters have without much needing to even be spelled out for you. \\n\r\n(One example those who have not read the light novel will not get is; when Koyomi is taking a bath and Shinobu comes out of his shadow to bathe with him. This is done in a non-sexual manner, but also with a lot of sexual tension.\\n\r\nIn the LN Volume titled \"Koyomi Vamp\" Book #4, we get a LOT of back-story to his VERY intricate relationship with Shinobu, which is a reason as to why she is likely my favorite character in this series as of now)\\n\\n\r\nThe story, albeit confusing for newcomers, is amazing. Though it is isn't told in complete chronological order, they keep the story & the dialogue they do have in the animation true to form. After reading bits and pieces of the translated light novel I am truly impressed with how well this was adapted into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the anime is effing awesome, and not only just for it's attention to detail, but also for how expressive it can be do the mood-changes in a conversation. The rooms that Araragi Koyomi is in, and the paths he travels from place to place upon while conversing with a character ~ will only resemble a real room or path 50% of the time. Our characters surroundings are frequently used in the animation to project certain emotions to the audience with the characters themselves hardly needing to say a word.The art is extremely symbolic as well as being some of the most quality animation I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. Nothing seems distorted or out of place. The character voices are clear and do not distort. In fact the music in the background used throughout the series is fantastic at setting certain tones. We know when the story is being playful, as well as when it is getting relatively serious. And the voice actors do a fantastic job of delivering our characters and their personalities. Nothing seems forced, it all simply flows.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are numerous and their personalities voluminous. So many unique interactions ensue that even though each episode is mostly dialogue, it feels as though they pass in a matter of minutes. From a Tsundere girlfriend to a quick witted ghost child we are never left wanting with each person Koyomi stops to engage. And these interactions pop up so frequently it sometimes takes half an episode for Koyomi to simply leave his house.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, every episode is a treat for me. I am never opposed to a bit of fanservice, and I feel this series is far less random with it. In fact I think the fanservice effectively moves the plot forward and makes the characters stand out even more. The humor is subtle most of the time, but it makes the story even more endearing than the constant outrageous outbursts some anime rely on to entertain the viewers. The supernatural aspect is so intriguing alone that we never know what route exactly Koyomi will need to pursue to shed light on the matters he deals with.\\n\\n\r\nI know giving a 10 is always fairly ridiculous for any anime, because nothing is perfect and no viewer is exactly the same, but I really do love this series. This is simply one of those series that make me wish I knew Japanese so that I could dive into the wealth of novels and games created around it. After reading the translated Koyomi Vamp installment and rewatching this series, I understood this series so much better, and thus fell in love with the many characters all over again. Shinobu, who at first only was able to thoroughly confuse me as a presence, easily became my favorite character for Koyomi to interact with in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest that if you watch this anime, you at least read some of the translated Light Novel as well to fill in the gaps. I cannot wait for the movie based off Koyomi Vamp to be released~\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is one of those truly unique animes. Never have I seen anything like it. Unlike other animes, Nisemonogatari relies heavily on character dialogue and interactions and almost the entire episodes are spent on discussions between characters. It is very unique on this aspect, but let\u2019s review each aspect in greater depth, shall we?\r\nStory: The story revolves around Araragi, a former vampire who is trying to help other people get rid of certain curses that are pestering them. Now, if you are reading this review and you haven\u2019t watch the first season Bakemonogatari, then I suggest that you watch that first because you may notbe able to understand this Nisemonogatari without prior knowledge of its prequel. All I can tell you is that unlike the first season, Nisemonogatari revolve more on Araragi and his family, specifically his sisters. It starts of light-hearted and then turns into a more serious tone when his and his sister\u2019s views and beliefs collide, forming an interesting story. Overall I would give it an 8/10 because although the story was not incredible, it\u2019s just that the way it was told was amazing, and is truly unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation is one of the strong points of this anime. There are beautiful visuals, smooth animations, and wonderful character designs. The animation of Nisemonogatari is also unique in a way that the scene changes every so often, and is shown at weird angles, although it can get a bit annoying at times. There are also times when the background is completely abstract, as if everything has been covered in wallpaper. There are also some fight scenes which are good enough to be considered on par with shounen animes like Bleach that other ninja crap. I guess in terms of visuals, you can also compare it to the anime \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d, since both contain some serious eye candy. All I can is that this anime is really a feast for the eyes and for that I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting in this anime is really well done. Considering that the dialogues make up almost 90% of the anime, it really did a great job. I give the voice actors a thumbs up for being able to internalize not only the characters, but also the scene itself and also for being able to talk for like 20 minutes straight. In addition to that, Nisemonogatari actually has an opening, unlike its prequel. The OP is very nice actually, with a nice cheerful tone. Overall I give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Nisemonogatari are nothing that hasn\u2019t been shown in other animes. You can pretty much describe all of them in a simple phrase. There is the heroic \u2013but-peverted main character, miss tsundere, hentai underclassman, a spirit who is apparently going hiking, loli vampire, a shy type-girl, and two hot blooded sisters. Although the character designs can be quite clich\u00e9, they are by no means static. Each character has his or her own story, as well a certain depth. Since the entire anime is mostly about characters talking to each other, there is a lot of character development. Overall I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me, Nisemonogatari is more of a intellectual anime(?) wherein there are lots of debates that will make you think about your own opinion on the subject. Of course it is more of a comedy so most of the times these debates will often lead to laughter. I really enjoyed it, and of course, there are also some yummy fanservice here and there, although it may not be what you expect(ever got raped by a toothbrush?). Overall I give it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think that Nisemonogatari will either be a hit or a miss for your taste. If you are the kind of person who likes heated arguments, sensible debates, and long speeches then this anime is for you but if you have a phobia of long dialogues then steer away, you may not like it. I for one really liked this anime it can make you think, although not in a way like in Steins;gate wherein it just mindfucks you, but more of a question-what-you-believe-in or question-your-values type of make you think. It has also made me laugh, gave me a very weird boner left me wanting more when it ended. Overall I would give it a 9/10 for giving me a completely unique experience unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the entire review then please do post a comment on my page and give me some feedback. Thx :))\\n",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari, the sequel to  bakemonogatari another beautiful masterpiece created by Shaft, the animation continues to be as weird as ever, an amazing sequel that has a similar atmosphere to bakemonogatari when watching it.\r\nStory 8\r\nNisemonogatari, focuses on Koyomi's sisters, also known as the \"fire sisters\", theses active and outgoing sisters, embark on a journey to caputre Deishu. Based on the light novel Karen Bee and Tsukihi phoenix. The story is as unique as ever, with an \"unusual development\" between the siblings it'll surely make you go \"What the F***\". The story is as great as ever, showing the strong relationship between the Araragi siblings andhow much they depend on each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nShaft, has continued to uphold the weird animation style with hundreds of eye shots, and the abnormal sized rooms/back grounds. The character design are as amazing as ever with several changes to their appearances such as hair cuts, in certain scenes the detail (toothbrush scene) sets the mood and inhances the weird/awkward feelings you sometimes get when watching nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, the thing that defines this anime isn't really the sound. But i guess one thing to look out for is that each main character that gets a story has its own opening and ending each matching the style of the character\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 \\n\\n\r\nWe see the return of the main characters from the last season such as Hitagi, Tsubasa and etc. Some have changed their appearances while their personality is still the same, but the relationship between the old characters and koyomi has gotten stronger showing more trust and etc. If you a massive fan of Shinobu like me, then guess what she finally speaks!!!!! Ka Ka. Nisemonogatari mainly shows the development Koyomi and his sisters, which was known in season 1 that they always fight, but like all family's Koyomi as the older brother has to look out for his sisters no matter what which leads to unusual developments, and strengthening of their relationship, and scenes that makes you basically go \"Aww, Good job Koyomi! thats a good answer\" or something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard not to enjoy a show like this, with many awkward scenes or weird rape scenes that make you go \"Ka Ka\". But as ever the dialogue coupled with the weird animation makes a great combination and draws you in to the anime as much as possible. This anime doens't contain a lot of fight scenes, but when it does your sure up for a hell of a show, with lots of gore. The thing i enjoyed the most in this anime was seeing Shinobu in her adult form/teenager form (hard to tell) =P\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a great successor of bakemonogatari with most of the good aspects of bakemonogatari applied in Nisemonogatari, One thing to note is that it is shorter, with less story rather than 5 stories this one has 2, but i guess the stories in this one is more developed and detailed. If your a fan of the Bakemonogatari series, then your up for one hell of a ride when you watch this.",

            "content": "Fanservice has always been a bit of a controversial issue. Some love it, some hate all instances of it. There's really no feasible way to please everybody when the reaction can often be likened to a dichotomy, split between 'too much' and 'not enough'. While Bakemonogatari is a series known by most for its unique art direction and character interaction, to say that it's removed itself entirely from sexual themes would be a flat-out lie. It's not much of a surprise then, that these elements are even more prolific in Nisemonogatari, for both better and for worse.  \r\nThe first thing that should be recognizedbefore watching Nisemonogatari is this very change and shift in focus. It wouldn't be much an exaggeration to say that at times it can feel like a different series, and certainly not all fans are going to approve of the change in tone and theme. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, things are not all that unlike either.\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this is the sequel to one of SHAFT's most successful anime, it would be incomprehensible for them to suddenly remove the unique style and flavor that the series became so known for in the first place. Head tilts are still prominent, the scenery is highly stylized, the characters will frequently engage in a playful diatribe and critique of Araragi, and surrealism remains a pervasive aspect in the presentation and overall experience. This is Bakemonogatari in much of its glory, but with the story itself becoming something of less importance than the characters and their interaction with each other. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the largest addition to Nisemonogatari is the new role of Araragi's two younger sisters, Karen and Tsukihi. Both of them form a group known as the 'Fire Sisters', and together they create the main focus of the entire show. Tsukihi is a sharply sarcastic and disapproving sister while Karen, voiced by the beloved Kitamura Eri, behaves as a bit of a tomboy and energetic character who strives to fight for justice and what she feels is the right thing. \\n\\n\r\nThese ideals of justice create an interesting problem for Karen as she comes into contact with the antagonist, Kaiki, a con artist exploiting teenage girls out of their money which quickly escalates into a conflict between the two, with Karen focusing on protecting the innocent and Kaiki on using them for his own avaricious goals. Kaiki as a character is quite unique and interesting as he never falls into a generic and stereotyped 'bad guy' persona, instead adopting a very grey morality where neither good nor bad exists. He cares for little else than money, and money is something he aims to attain regardless of who loses out for it. Surprisingly, he doesn't antagonize the main characters very much outside of their first few encounters with each other. As long as they don't complicate matters for him, he generally has no issue. The way his departure is handled is also very surprising and refreshing when compared to the usual conventions in storytelling. It's just disappointing that he loses his role as a main character in the second half and falls much to the side, since his scenes are without a doubt the most memorable and engaging in the entire show. Being a character that stands out so much in a series full of unique characters is a very hard feat to achieve but Kaiki managed to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Nisemonogatari wouldn't be the same without the cast from the previous season playing a prominent role in the story. All of the main characters from Bakemonogatari retain a large role in Nisemonogatari each with their own unique scenes, though unfortunately most of them don't appear anywhere near as much as they did in Bakemonogatari. Senjougahara in particular is largely missing from the first half of the series until becoming a large focus of the story again, which may be a bit disappointing at first for fans of her character. Thankfully, the episodes before that focus on an excellent blend of new and old characters and concepts, bringing just enough to the table to make the series fresh again while maintaining enough of the old that fans will still feel mostly at home when watching. \\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the aforementioned Kaiki as the antagonist, the story itself is largely about his exploits and the characters' resulting intervention for the first half of the story. It picks up further towards the end into a galvanizing climax and battle between Araragi and the two new antagonists, one of which being a character from the previous season. Fans of Bakemonogatari will find something enjoyable in that respect once things start to pick up, but the story itself is not so much the focus of Nisemonogatari as it is what gives a way for the audience to see the characters interact in a variety of new and different situations.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us to the main problem \u2014 fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like fanservice? Do you want fanservice? If not, you probably won't enjoy Nisemonogatari too much. It's not nearly as oppressive or prominent as some screenshots would lead to believe but it's very easily a defining and inherent part of the experience. Characters will frequently try to seduce Araragi which leads to some amusing scenes with him on the verge of cheating on his beloved girlfriend and paying dearly for it. There's also fanservice for the female viewers, with long shots gawking deeply at Araragi's chest. Nude scenes are not too uncommon and the series often plays more with sexual feelings than it does with its witty dialogue and stylized presentation. Though these common elements still do remain a large part of the experience, all one needs to do is take a look at the infamous toothbrush scene to have a good understanding of how Nisemonogatari is often presented. \\n\\n\r\nWhether or not the viewer will approve of these changes comes down to personal taste and what they primarily enjoy the series for. It would be a lie to say that I didn't enjoy the frequent fanservice and sexual themes at least somewhat, but it's just that, perhaps, Nisio Isin and SHAFT went slightly overboard and forgot a little bit about what made the series so highly respected in the first place. It's enjoyable in smaller and occasional doses but being that it's the forefront of the entire experience, it sometimes detract from what is an otherwise very engaging and unique story. Subtle or even suggestive fanservice would have been preferable to the ubiquitous butt-shots and nude scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help matters much when the pacing of the anime is negatively impacted by the fanservice as well. As a result of much of the screentime being spent on trying to make the viewer erect, it often feels like the main conflict surrounding Kaiki and the later two antagonists is a bit rushed. Certainly, more time could have been spent developing those characters and the main plotline. Things often shift haphazardly between fanservice and important story events and it feels a bit unwieldy and awkward for that reason. It's hard to appreciate the fanservice much when there's a serious and interesting story going on in the background, and conversely it's also hard to fully appreciate the story when the next scene will transition into more of the fanservice and silly interaction. Had SHAFT and Nisio Isin focused primarily on the story instead of these sexual themes, the main story could easily have been something equal to or even greater than Bakemonogatari. Which is a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, thanks to the success of Bakemonogatari from a few years earlier, a large budget increase is very evident with the quality of animation. This really is one of the best-looking TV anime on the market and the fluidity in each frame is something truly stunning at times. The way the characters move and jump around so freely is something unique to the series when compared to the previous season which relied primarily on transitions and stills. While some complained about the lack of animation and movement in Bakemonogatari -- often comparisons to a slideshow -- this is definitely not the case with Nisemonogatari. This is just as much a visual presentation as it is a verbal one \\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari can often verge on the surreal with its artwork. SHAFT loves to play with their scenery in highly creative and interesting ways which serves to immerse the viewer and give personality to the artwork and the area that the characters live and interact in. It wouldn't be strange to see a colorless cityscape with a bright blue-green sky looming above, a room filled with mountains upon mountains of same-colored books, a sudden letterbox effect in the image, a home bathroom with stained-glass windows reminiscent of a medieval church, or a gloomy thicket dyed beneath a red sunset. It's this stylized presentation which creates much of the atmosphere of Nisemonogatari and what makes the viewer feel like they're in a very different place. There's really nothing out there that looks or feels the same way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd with more effort spent on the series, positive improvement comes to the music and soundtrack as well. The usage of songs and music is a perfect fit for the scenes they are used in, especially those involving Kaiki. They may not all be songs that will stick in your mind and be reminisced for long after, but when used in the anime itself they are an excellent fit. And much like Bakemonogatari, a variety of unique opening sequences are performed by the seiyuu and each styled with their own unique theme. While there's nothing quite on the same level as 'Renai Circulation' here, all three of the openings are very catchy and memorable. In particular, the second opening 'Marshmallow Justice' was something that I felt perfectly represented the series as a whole and its theme. Disregarding my own love towards Kitamura Eri as a seiyuu, it's quite a pleasant song that mixes the quirkiness of the series with the energy of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end it becomes very easy to see where the complaints and negativity surrounding Nisemonogatari come from. While there is truth to be found in the complaints of there being too much fanservice, it's also evident that some are focusing too much on this one aspect instead of fully seeing what it accomplished and did well. It's not quite as good as its predecessor, but Nisemonogatari still manages to be a solid entry to the series and one that paints its own unique character as well. It's certainly different, and different in a way that will be either a bad or a good thing depending on the feelings and tastes of the individual. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully, with the next animated installment of the Monogatari series these fanservice elements will be toned down a bit. We (well, some of us) have had our fun, and now it's time for the series to go back to its roots. Small change can often be beneficial but in cases like these it's best to know when to leave well enough alone.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari was certainly one of the more interesting anime of the season, not least for its trait of dividing viewers down the middle in terms of who enjoyed it and who didn't; this show, being the continuation of a well-known franchise, has attracted plenty of vitriol in the last eleven weeks, even though many people have been outspoken in its defence. But now that broadcasting is finished (even if the argument  over whether it is masterpiece or merely the latest victim of too-high expectations has plenty of fuel still left to burn), I'm afraid to say that I couldn\u2019t resist the lure dangling sotemptingly in front of me, and so it\u2019s time to tackle Nisemonogatari and hopefully wring a definitive conclusion out of it.\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\\n\r\nNow, the main sticking point with Nisemonogatari has been the storyline, which was quite slow in its progression; if you\u2019ve recently read about the \u2018fast-paced, clever storyline\u2019, and are quite surprised by this assertion, then I shall elaborate; the first three episodes reintroduced characters from the first series, and while the Karen Bee arc was supposedly seven episodes long, it really did drag at points. In addition to that, the resolutions of each arc felt way too easy, and while we\u2019re on it, the almost-complete absence of Tsukihi from the first two episodes of her own arc was bizarre. Although it initially wasn't promising, the story did become more interesting as the series went on, although I believe there will be further episode releases post-broadcast, because not everything came to a conclusion within the eleven episodes (and the Japanese equivalent of 'to be continued' seen at the end of the final episode is a confirmation that we'll be getting more Monogatari one way or another). I think the best way to see Nisemonogatari is as the bridging point which sets everything up nicely for a third series (and if the director is to believed, several more series after that), and in terms of introducing characters who will probably play a part in these later series, it does a pretty good job. Contrary to the impression I might have made, I did enjoy watching this, but I do think it could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is extremely effective. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything quite like it before (except in Bakemonogatari, to state the obvious for the resident pedants here). The background art is most striking, with the use of colour co-ordinated objects and scenery to create scenes which immediately grab the viewer\u2019s attention. The much-debated black and red scenes seem to have been cut down on since Bakemonogatari, now only making a couple of appearances per episode, but the use of talking heads is still common. The background sets the atmosphere much more effectively than a show which is constrained by realism; just watch Kaiki Deishuu\u2019s first screen appearance, and the shadows of the trees stretching out towards Koyomi, and you will realise the brilliance of this art style.  And now, the fanservice; how do they handle it? Well, what\u2019s happening on screen and the progression of the storyline are almost completely separate from one another, for starters. It\u2019s nothing compared to an actual ecchi series, and the characters are wearing clothes (cough\u2026 most of the time), it\u2019s just the choice of shot and where it focuses on the character\u2019s body that makes it fanservice. And when there are no clothes present, any details are obscured by the production team, preventing the need for masking or other censorship. That was incredibly awkward to write. Moving on\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound hasn\u2019t changed drastically from the first series; the episodes start with a blast of heavily distorted electric guitar, and a catchy pop-song opening, which is reminiscent of Staple Stable, to say the least. The lack of background music in Nisemonogatari compared to other series is noticeable,  with only the occasional piano melody from the opening or ending slipped in at appropriate moments, but with the amount of dialogue that it has, this is actually a good thing; it would be pointless including any more soundtrack, as it would just either pass completely over our heads or make it incredibly difficult to listen to. The ending is a pop-rock four-chord number which will probably get stuck in your head on an endless loop at some stage, and no amount of purging your memory with your own music collection will dislodge it. If you liked Bakemonogatari\u2019s Staple Stable and Renai Circulation, then this is definitely worth a listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the first series remain as they are for the most part, with the exception of Hanekawa Tsubasa, who is now short-haired. Hitagi Senjougahara, self-diagnosed tsundere of the highest order, seems to have been relegated to a supporting role in Nisemonogatari, having only made three or so appearances in seven episodes; however, Araragi\u2019s sisters, Karen and Tsukihi, step into the breach, so we have a net gain of characters. Connoisseur of Hawaiian t-shirts and supernatural phenomena Oshino Meme has disappeared, and the role of \u2018sole adult in the series\u2019 has gone to the much more evil, scheming Deishuu Kaiki, who looks like one of the creepier film incarnations of Dracula. It\u2019s interesting that they\u2019ve gone for a central villain, rather than having different problems which are unrelated in cause, as per Bakemonogatari. It must be mentioned that in this series, the characters do not merely lean on the fourth wall, they've practically installed a revolving door in it for their convenience. Even the creation of the anime was slipped a thinly veiled reference in one of the characters' metaphors. I quite like it, but you will need to know at least a little bit about the Monogatari franchise to get some of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt should probably be mentioned that Nisemonogatari will make some of its audience feel uncomfortable at certain points. Aside from the various Lolita characters, there are incestuous overtones involving Araragi and his sisters, including the now-infamous \u2018toothbrush scene\u2019. And I know that people will say \u201cOh, it\u2019s only here in the West that we\u2019ve got a problem with it, but in Japan, those scenes are seen as the funniest part of the show.\u201d Aside from not wishing to read anything into these peoples\u2019 apparent attempts to justify having relationships with underage girls or members of their own family, they might have a point; our moral values here don\u2019t let us see the funny side. If we look at the source of all this trouble, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s now-infamous novel, half the time he is mocking us and our values; are SHAFT doing the same thing? Quite possibly. Just be prepared to ignore the screams of moral outrage you might occasionally feel welling up inside you while you\u2019re watching this show, make sure your parents/partner/siblings/friends aren\u2019t going to walk in at an awkward moment and then spend the next three weeks not talking to you, and you should be able to cope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n\\n\r\nSo, Nisemonogatari does indeed have all the elements that Bakemonogatari was praised for, and at the same time features fanservice, which Bakemonogatari, if I remember correctly, did also have a certain amount of. I don\u2019t think it is possible that it has ruined the series, as some people claim; these claims probably would have been made regardless of the actual nature of the series, and were sparked by its mere existence. Unfortunately for those claims and the people making them, Akiyuki Shinbo, the animation director, has apparently stated his intention to animate every single Monogatari novel, of which there are (or will be, to be entirely accurate) twelve. Now, if the first one came out in 2009, and the second in 2012, I think we can safely say that this series will continue for a while. For my part, I'm looking forward to it, and I hope that it may continue to be as innovative and interesting as it has been up to this point!",

            "content": "Shaft has been on a pretty good run for the last few years churning out some extremely popular and perhaps over-hyped series.  Now they have brought us Nisemonogatari, a show that I was looking forward to quite a bit.  This is partly because I just generally find their work interesting but also because I did enjoy its predecessor.   Now while I would not classify myself as a huge fan of the original show I did enjoy the characters, quirky story, and fabulous artwork.  However Nisemonogatari is a pointless and directionless mess that feels more like a cash grab that takeseverything good about the original and turns it to crap.\\n\\n\r\nI am sure people will accuse me of being excessively harsh when I say Nise's story... is one of the five worst things I have ever seen.  Maybe that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t any story to speak of.  What this series promised us was a story about Araragi's younger sisters and their encounter with the black swindler.  It also promised some fill in the blanks of some of some of the other story arcs from Bakemono.  I was particularly interested in seeing more on how Senjougahara ended up cursed.  What we got instead is what I would consider to be a full length DVD extra putting the various girls in the cast in compromising situations and in assorted states of undress.  The anime plods along aimlessly, taking us nowhere substantive.  When they do finally get around to something other than panties or erotic tooth brushing, it is crammed in to an episode and a half and then quickly buried to get back to what\u2019s really important.  What\u2019s too bad is that when they do bother to tell some story I do find myself interested in it.  But also I was pissed off that it was all I got.  To be honest the entire \"story\" could have been more productively told with a 2 episode OVA than an entire TV season.  (cough: money grab)\\n\\n\r\nNow I am not going to sit here and rail against service in anime, what\u2019s the point?  I am not even offended by it and I find it pretty amusing most of the time.  Bakemono certainly had its pervy undertones but it didn't revolve around them or beat you over the head with them either.  Nise seems to have just taken those elements and decided to make an anime around them.  Frankly what offends me the most about the way the service is presented is that it takes itself way to seriously.  It\u2019s like somebody at Shaft just discovered you can put this kind of thing in anime and just completely lost their heads.  Then have the nerve to act like it\u2019s somehow smarter than anything we have ever seen before.  Just because you inserted some witty dialogue and clever puns in between the breast fondling and skirt flipping doesn't turn it into high art.\\n\\n\r\nSecond only to the horrible story is what they did to the series cast of characters.  Say what you will about Araragi's but for a harem lead (yes fanboys, Bakemono was a harem anime.  Deal with it.  It\u2019s not a bad word), he managed to be a pretty interesting and compelling character.  Well you can throw all of that out the window after viewing this series.  He is a shell of his former self as he has been relegated to an immature perverted lolicon and pedophile who would be a registered sex offender in every developed nation in the world.  His world view is that of a 10 year old boy, not a high school senior who is a borderline adult.  People might try to say he is being ironic or sarcastic or maybe he's just a bully or a clown.  But seriously who in high school, particularly a senior still goes around flipping the skirts of elementary school girls?\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast fairs no better.  The girls get little in the way of character development and are only treated as objects and tools for service.  While you may initially feel some nostalgia as the previous cast is reintroduced and it feels like reacquainting yourself with old friends. However, if you went into this show like I did, wanting to see and learn more about Araragi's two sisters Karen and Tsukihi, then you\u2019re in for a rude awakening.  (Unless that is you wanted to learn more about their bust size and figures)  For a series that was supposedly based around the two of them they have shockingly little actual screen time.\\n\\n\r\nWell it\u2019s not all bad.  As expected from Shaft, the shows artwork and animation is absolutely fabulous.  As is customary of their productions the screen is full visual overload of information with innumerable references and puns if you\u2019re able to catch or comprehend them.  The styling of the show is very much like its predecessor and has a very unique original feeling about the entire production.  Even though the artwork is undeniably stunning, I did not always care for it.  Another annoyance would be why they decided to cut the hair of every girl in the show.  By the end of the series everyone looks the same.  I mean... why?  If they had changed their hair colors I wouldn't have even known who some of them were.   But if you\u2019re just a general fan of art and animation there is a whole lot to love about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting is also equally brilliant.  I honestly think this is the one thing Shaft almost never fails at, is picking appropriate music and animation to open and close their anime titles.  Like Bakemono, Nise uses the voice cast to sing the various OP songs but it was the show's ED song which stands out the most.  ClariS' \"Naisho no Hanashi\" is by far the duo's best single to date.  Maybe I enjoyed it so much because it meant the episode was over?\\n\\n\r\nOverall only the most ardent Bakemono and Shaft fanboys need apply when it comes to watching this show.  Though if you were truly a fan of Bakemono I don\u2019t know how you could not end up being disappointed.  The lack of any kind of coherent story mars any sensory satisfaction you may get out of the shows artwork and audio track.  You can pour and entire bottle of perfume on a pile of crap but in the end its still, crap.\\n",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is the sequel to Shaft's 2009 hit Bakemonogatari. It features much of the same cast as the first show, but it includes many new characters as well. The particular focus is on Araragi's sisters, Karen and Tsukihi this time around. The first show broke sales records and this one is looking to do incredibly well as well. However, if you were expecting more of Bakemonogatari you might be in for a surprise.\r\nThere is always an issue with sequels when it comes to the story. They always seem to never really live up to their predecessors and sadly Nisemonogatari suffers from this issue as well.While the story is both interesting and engaging, it just lacks that overall \u201cwow\u201d factor that Bakemonogatari had. This pattern is especially prevalent in Shaft's other sequels other than maybe Hidamari Sketch but that's probably due to me needing a nutbladder replacement every time I watch another one of those. However, that is not to say that the story is not good. It is actually very good but it just lacks that special feeling that the first series had. When it comes to the actual story, it is a similar format to the first series where Araragi goes around messing with the various females in his life and unraveling mysteries. In Nisemonogatari the focus is on his two younger sisters and their issues though. However, instead of spending a significant amount of time on the mysteries themselves the sequel focuses more on character development and character interaction. I will not say that it's particularly a \u201cbad thing\u201d but the overall pace and tone of the story is definitely different from the first series and I'm not completely sold on those changes. Without spoiling everything, if you enjoyed the setup of Bakemonogatari and you enjoyed the characters of the first series you'll most likely enjoy the sequel. There really isn't much to say on the story just because if you're watching this, you must have watched Bakemonogatari as well so I would just be reiterating the facts that you already know. What I must point out is one of the flaws and distractions that was present in the sequel though.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari essentially translates into \u201cFalsestory\u201d or \u201cImpostory\u201d. However, it should be translated into \u201cFanservicestory\u201d. If I were to say Bakemonogatari didn't feature a significant amount of fanservice I would be lying, but they really did go overboard with the sequel. They must have put a significant amount of effort into cramming the most amount of fanservice into this 11 episode series and it definitely shows. From the convenient camera angles to half an episode dedicated to a discussion with Shinobu in the bath to the (in)famous \u201ctoothbrush scene\u201d you can definitely see that there was a significant amount of work involved. While the novel includes this as well, it certainly is incredibly distracting to the overall tone and mood of the show. This is one of those cases where the source material does not particularly go over well into the adaption. While the original source material did include a lot of fanservice, Shaft also took it a step further with a multitude of compromising camera angles. That is not unexpected of them since it occurs in nearly every one of their shows, but it only adds to the distraction and makes the overall feeling of the show more low brow than the predecessor. Before you get your jimmies rustled, I am not against fanservice. I enjoy fanservice masterpieces such as Queen's Blade after all. I just feel that the second season's fanservice was a bit excessive and detrimental to this show's overall quality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat wasn't detrimental to the overall quality was the art in this show. Shaft generally has a policy where the TV broadcast looks abysmal but they come up with an absolutely stunning Blu Ray release. In the case of Nisemonogatari, the TV version is excellent and they will be hard pressed to do any incredible changes to the Blu Ray release. The animation was for the most part very fluid and the background scenes were beautiful. They really outdid themselves on this show and it looks great. Likewise, the sound was also excellent in this show. The OST was fitting and the various openings were all great as well. Platinum Disco definitely stole the show this time around, like how Ren'ai Circulation stole the show in Bakemonogatari. I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to the art or sound in Nisemonogatari. Shaft went above and beyond my expectations on making an actually presentable TV anime and the sound continued on par with it's predecessor. Overall I feel that this section is much better than Bakemonogatari since you could only really enjoy it if you watched the Blu Rays due to the sheer amount of fixing they did to it.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Nisemonogatari focuses more on characterization over the mystery solving that was most prevalent in its predecessor. We see several new characters such Kaiki who brings up quite a bit of Hitagi's past and Yozuru and Yotsugi who serve as an exorcist combo. We also see Karen and Tsukihi having actual roles in the story as well. Without going into much detail since that would give away the entire show, I must say that the characters are once again a very strong point for the show. There is little character degradation between both shows and there is quite a bit of development as well (some of which I don't particularly like but I guess it can't be helped after all). The new characters are interesting and enjoyable while the old ones are what you knew and loved from before. The voice acting was once again top notch. The cast is filled with veterans that you have heard many times before. The new characters are also voiced by veterans and are fitting for their respective roles. Even Shinobu gets to talk this time around, however instead of Aya Hirano we have Maaya Sakamoto for obvious reasons. The characters are definitely a strong point for the *monogatari series and it continues on quite well in this sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I must say that I enjoyed this show quite a bit but I was not nearly as impressed with it as I was with Bakemonogatari. Nisemonogatari does well as a sequel since it mostly maintains itself but it just leaves you feeling just a little disappointed. Bakemonogatari is one of my favorite shows due to its interesting dialogue, it's characters, and the overall story of it. Nisemonogatari picks up on much of that but the overall product feels unimpressive compared to Bakemonogatari. I think the issue with this show is that despite being great, it still pales in comparison to Bakemonogatari. The excessive fanservice and some certain \u201ccharacter development\u201d that happened in the last episode really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. That along with some of the previous season's characters getting much less screen time and development also makes me feel somewhat frustrated with this series. I will not say that I am platinum disappointed with this show overall, but I just feel that it is not as good as Bakemonogatari. What is good news is that this particular arc of the story is now over and there are plans to continue this animation project with even more. The Kizumonogatari movie should be coming up soon and a suspicious \u201cto be continued\u201d at the end of the last episode shows that this story is definitely not done with. What I can say is that I am still looking forward to more and I hope that the upcoming projects maintain the overall quality. Surpassing the original will be a difficult feat, but I'm optimistic about the upcoming projects and I can't wait to see more. I just hope to the Space Pope that Shaft doesn't decide to release them as online episodes every 6 months.",

            "content": "I will be honest, I hold a certain amount of bias for this anime, a bias that leans towards \"SUPAH\" positive. I love Bakemonogatari with a passion, and I will always convince myself that Nisio Isin will remain to be one of the greatest writers I've ever seen, at least when dialogue and plot is involved.\r\nSo, if I seem like I'm just acting out my part to spearhead the opinion of the fanbase, don't hold it against me. I will do my best to be as unbiased as possible. You have been warned.\r\nStory [9]\r\nTo be honest, I thought the highlight of the Monogatari series interms of story was found in Kizumonogatari. Nisemonogatari was slightly weaker, but this is a personal opinion. Usually, I would give it 10 and be done with it, but I will stamp it on with a 9 because of the fact that it's the second season of Bakemonogatari.It's not because I think sequels suck, I just feel that Nisemonogatari should've taken the liberty of introducing the setting of the series to potential newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nI've met many people who saw Nisemonogatari a watch, and couldn't enjoy it nearly as much because they didn't understand the story. I feel that some time could've been spent in easing the viewer into the idea of Nisemonogatari. If I were to fix it, I would've introduced Kanbaru and Shinobu, or at least give them mention. Maybe I might've missed them somewhere, but I doubt I did.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10]\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari has the same art style as Bakemonogatari, except a lot cleaner. I don't have much more to add. The art fits the spirit of the series, and to be honest, if comical art was more fitting to a series than a beautiful art, the comical would get a 10 in my book and the beautiful would get maybe an 8. Art's important to set the mood, in my opinion, and Nisemonogatari succeeded on that. Feel free to disagree on my thought in regards to how I grade art.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9]\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this series has always been great in regards to making elements outside of the plot fitting. Art works, and so does the music. My only complaint is the OP. It's terrific, but I feel like it was recycled from \"Staple Stable\", even though it totally isn't.\\n\\n\r\nMy take is that the OP is just to get into the musical style Bakemonogatari displayed, so it's not too much of a problem. I'm just going to tack on a 9 there though, but it will probably change in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10]\\n\\n\r\nI will not write anything outside of these three statements, including this one. I cannot effectively review this section because I'm too much in love with the eccentric characters that the Monogatari series has displayed, and although I shall miss Oshino Meme, the characters in the series have never appeared flat to me, and if anything, the characters really makes Nisio's invention shine through.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue is key, and I shall not comment further, for this is the third statement.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\\n\r\nRead the above if you haven't already, please.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nDid you now? Sorry...and if you just read it after reading the message above the ellipses above this statement, then thank you for following my directions.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Nisemonogatari displays the same strengths that made Bakemonogatari one of my favorite anime series of all times. It could be kinder in setting the mood for newcomers, or doing something new with the effective mood element. Hell, anything with the word \"new\" tagged in it could be improved on, but it's not going to detract me from waiting for new episodes every week.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? Very much so. \\n\\n\r\n...And with that all done and typed, my first review on an anime series is done. I shall click this pretty blue button that says \"Submit Review\" now.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari was a special anime for me. While it didn't really have any stand out qualities, the whole show ended up being much more than the sum of its parts. It had some nice visuals, fun dialogue, interesting characters and plot.  Maybe a dab of mystery/suspense here and maybe a few seconds of good animation there. Ultimately it was an incredibly enjoyable show that was just a blast to watch when all of its elements came together in a dizzying fashion. So you can imagine my confusion when I finished Nise only to realize that I hadn't enjoyed the show all that much. WhenI came along for this ride, I was expecting to have a damn good time, similar to all the fun I had with Bake. So what exactly went wrong with this show? A hell of a lot apparently. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is more or less the same kind of scenario we saw in its predecessor. The biggest difference between the two however is the pacing. Bake moved along at a brisk pace, it introduced new elements quickly and broke them up with some occasional fanservice bits and exchanges of dialogue. Nise does the opposite and moves along at a snail's pace. Everything is introduced very slowly and is resolved equally as slowly. The climaxes to the story arcs didn't really evoke any particular sense of excitement in me. Which brings me to another problem, and that's the complete lack of urgency and tension. Bake had a lot of mystery and suspense in all of its arcs; it was carefully put together and enjoyable to watch unfold. Nise somehow completely forgets to introduce any sort of tension until half-way through the show and right before the climax of its first arc. Yeah Kaiki was imposing when he was introduced yet he never became a threat until a couple episodes later, the mystery surrounding him wasn't particularly well established. There was an attempt at build up with off-screen interactions between him and the supporting cast but it was all vague. So when the time came for a resolution, I came away thinking \"so what?\u201d. There's definitely a problem when you're waiting for something good to happen each episode but nothing ever does. Nise is stunted as hell, there's no real build up and whatever little characterization there is, comes in the form of isolated little moments of plot instead of a subtle constant stream of information. The storytelling is a noticeable step down, and it doesn't improve a great deal. Rather you'll always come away feeling unsatisfied and wanting something more substantial from it. It does manage to get interesting during the course of its run but it never becomes truly engaging, it teases you with some good scenes and moments but it rarely follows through.\\n\\n\r\nBake found a balance between characterization, fanservice and witty dialogue. It juggled these three elements very well, always managing to stimulate the audience with their juxtaposing. Nise does not have this balance, and looking back, it\u2019s what made Bake as good as it was. It\u2019s what I mean by \"more than the sum of its parts\". These core elements are what made the original show so much fun. Nise unfortunately decides to throw characterization out the window in favor of more sexual stimulation and dialogue with 60% less charm. I don't have a problem with fanservice but it needs to be well-implemented just like any other aspect. In Nise's case, a barrage of gratuitous fanservice every other minute doesn't really constitute as good execution. An overload on one stimulus just makes it boring when it happens again. Fanservice gets yawn-inducing fast when it\u2019s the only aspect of note in an episode. The dialogue isn't nearly as fun as it was in Bake, it lacks the hints of characterization that was so prevalent in the conversations Araragi had with the girls. It\u2019s like they stripped these elements of what made them good in the first place and threw 'em back in without any substance this time around. With the interesting characters playing support, they don't really offer anything to the audience besides some occasional humor and tips for Araragi. The sisters don't fill this vacuum at all, one is boring as fuck and the other is irrelevant for all intents and purposes. Ultimately this entire story is really about Araragi and his relationship with his sisters, not the sisters themselves. His soliloquies are sparse and aren't nearly as effective as they ought to be, though this is more of an execution problem with the show. There's Kaiki and Shinobu as well, and admittedly, they're pretty cool. Shinobu's bits serve as closure for Kizumonogatari so I imagine that some of its impact is lost on the viewers who haven't read the Light Novels. There's not enough of Kaiki unfortunately, he's probably the best character to come out of this and his screen time is pitifully short. Overall Nise feels like a shallow version of its predecessor, which is saying quite a bit since Bake wasn't exactly down there in the Mariana Trench either. Bake's main theme (Growth/Healing) worked on several different levels of the story and was naturally interwoven into the narrative. It felt organic and refreshing; however Nise's themes (Fake/Imitation) feel extremely superfluous. It felt as though they were clumsily thrown in, as if NisioIsn was trying far too hard to emulate the same poetry of his previous works. Ironically Nise appears to be a hollow imitation of its predecessors which in and of itself could be considered \"Fake\" on some level. I wouldn't put it past NisioIsin to include such nonsensical meta bullshit in his works but this one is delivered in a half-assed manner so it\u2019s largely meaningless. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the only area where Nise falls short of Bake either; even some of the technical aspects are weaker. Yes the animation quality is much more consistently well done this time but Nise lacks flair and punch in its visuals. Many of the key staff that made Bake as good as it was are missing in Nise. People like Nobuyuki Takeuchi, Tatsuya Oishi, Toshimasa Suzuki and Shaft's own ace key animator, Ryo Imamura are not present and their absences are very noticeable. Takeuchi and Oishi contributed a hefty amount to the storyboard work; they made the visuals fairly exciting and involving, even if Bake often took the route with less animation. Nise however has less experienced people on storyboarding, so while Nise does have a fairly consistent level of animation quality, none of it is particularly fun to watch or evocative of the imagination. For example, part of the fight in episode 7 was done by Hironori Tanaka, a talented key animator. He was responsible for a good portion of the fight in episode 8 of Bake as well. One had incredibly dynamic, fast-paced and visceral animation; the other was slow, lacked any sort of momentum and was a bore to watch overall. I'll leave you to guess which one is which. The music on the other hand, is actually well done. The new OPs sung by Karen and Tsukihi's respective seiyuus are every bit as catchy and enjoyable as you'd expect from this series. Kaiki's main theme is amazing of course; the music is one of the few aspects that are on par with the other season. \\n\\n\r\nNise is a decent watch. Certainly above some many other anime but it's heavily flawed and is a clear decline from the first season. On the surface it appears to have all the same things that brought us all to love this series but lacks the gritty details. If Bake was more than the sum of its parts, Nise is in fact the opposite. Somehow its less than all of its individual elements. While some of them might indeed be great, the entire show is pulled down by sloppy writing, bad pacing, a lack of focus and an overabundance of fanservice. It feels directionless, its dialogue more meandering than subtle, its humor more reference-filled than witty, its themes more pretentious than heartfelt, and its characters more pandering-bait than people we should care about. This probably would have worked better as a short OVA series or something. Though at this point I believe Bake was a mistake on both NisioIsin's/Shaft's end and we'll probably never see the Monogatari series on that same level again. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh but it\u2019s annoying when people don't seem to realize what exactly it was that made a show good, especially if those people are the same ones who created the damn thing in the first place.",

            "content": "You may have read my review for Bakemonogatari, and if you have, you will know that I consider anime to be a legitimate genre of art, as are paintings, video games, and novels.  You will also know that my admiration for Bakemonogatari goes well beyond simple fandom and that I regard it as one of the masterpieces that transcends the genre, as is Michelangelo's David to sculptures.  If you have not watched Bakemonogatari, much of this review will not make sense.  That's to be expected since Nisemonogatari shouldn't make much sense if you haven't watched Bakemonogatari.  With that out there, Ibegin my review.\\n\\n\r\n***NOTE that the show is still airing, and I have only watched 8 episodes of of the 11 planned.  I feel that this is enough to write a review, but, as we learned from Bakemonogatari, when it comes to this series, one episode, or even one scene can change one's outlook on the entire series.  I will promptly address any changes that might arise upon completion of the entire season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 10\\n\r\nThose of you who have read my Bakemonogatari review will know that I actually gave lavish praise to its minimal and episodic plot, on the grounds that an elaborate storyline would actually distract from the character interactions.  I feel differently for Nisemonogatari.  This was never intended to be a standalone series; it is basically Monogatari series Season 2 (or 3, if you include the upcoming Kizumonogatari).  Therefore, most of the characters were already introduced in Bakemonogatari, and now it's time for some story, some of that actual \"monogatari.\"  And I had high expectations because I am currently reading a manga by the same author, which convinced me that NisiOisin is fully capable of writing elaborate, enthralling, and spectacular storyline in addition to the breathtaking characters showcased by Bakemonogatari.  Indeed, as I had anticipated, Nisemonogatari is much more plot-driven than was its prequel.  Character and dialogue is still very much the heart and soul of the series, but now we have longer story arcs, more plot expositions (as opposed to Bakemonogatari, in which most expositions were character expositions), and something resembling an antagonistic entity, the lack of which turned off many a shounen-lovers from Bakemonogatari.  The attention to plot is present in every scene.  For example, Bakemonogatari, while not simple by any means, was very chronological.  However, right from the beginning of Nisemonogatari, we see masterful anachronistic storytelling, which is hard to pull off unless the author and the director are both focusing on storytelling aspects.  This shift is slight indeed (the show is still very much character-driven), but in such a complex and well-balanced show, the effects are definitely felt.  It was a very smooth move to allow plot progression to occupy a bit more of the foreground, while the consolidation of the characters we already know and the introduction of only 3 more characters casually take a step back.  Svelte indeed.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? It's Studio SHAFT.  They absolutely splurged on the artistic presentation.  Much of what I have to say on the art overlaps with the lengthy discussion I provided on my Bakemonogatari review.  In short, the art really went for nothing but perfection.  Every frame is idealized and perfected, which is really a prime advantage anime has over live action.  Whatever isn't absolutely necessary to the scene or the plot is radically minimized, truncated, and symbolized.  What I really have to say beyond what I already discussed for Bakemonogatari is that the art style in Nisemonogatari is even more stylized and surreal.  The overlaps of realities, the use of light, scenery, the symbolims, the entire mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of every scene are much more dramatic than they were in Bakemonogatari, which was delightfully surreal to begin with.  This confirmed a conjecture I had upon viewing Bakemonogatari, that the series is just as much what happens inside the character's minds (usually Koyomi's) as it is what actually happens.  This accounts for a part of why the series is so inexplicably identifiable.  For example, movies like The Grudge horrify the viewers by showing them frightening images.  On the other hand, movies like The Blair Witch Project feature no actual frightening image, but manipulates the very emotion of fear in the viewer by evoking the genetically-ingrained terror of the unknown, of being pursued, etc.  The series, Nisemonogatari more intensely so, elicits emotion on two different levels in a similar manner. For example, we, as (male) viewers would see Senjougahara and think that she is a very pretty character.  However, add to that the viewpoint of Koyomi, her lover, and how he sees her, how he focuses on the way her skirt moves with her legs, the way she tosses her hair; also throw in those notorious symbolic frames that flash by more intensely as the two leads' verbal fencing match intensifies, those shots of Koyomi's rather excitable hair, and the result is a greatly amplified emotional response compared to what would have been had we simply seen Araragi and Senjougahara talk back and forth.  Genius, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nI actually don't have much to say here.  To be honest, I just thought the opening and ending songs of Bakemonogatari were great, and the same goes for Nisemonogatari.  But to offer my perfectly honest and perhaps controversial opinion, I don't think OP and ED are really an integral part of an anime experience.  As such, I will not offer review of OP/ED titles.  I mean, they're like a minute long to look up and watch on YouTube, so no need for me to review them.  On the other hand, I actually kind of miss some of the mundane BGM's of Bakemonogatari that were apparently swapped or scrapped for the new series.  It seemed that Nisemonogatari is much lighter on the BGM and it being a proactive part of dialogue.  Other than that, the voice acting is the same top-notch performance we are familiar with, except maybe Senjougahara sounds even more breathtakingly sardonic.  This is one of those things where I really don't have much to say because the sound is just flawless.  Only that I miss some of those sound effect/BGM's that really set the atmosphere of surreal absorption.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\r\nOhoho MAJOR, MAJOR character development from Bakemonogatari.  I mean, only three new characters are introduced, but the existing characters are oh so subtly revamped.  Again, some of the changes may not be noticeable unless you've seen each episode of Bakemonogatari, like, a dozen times as have I, but even subtle changes are massive in such delicate work.  To say to much would lead to inadvertent spoilers, so I will be brief.\\n\r\nKoyomi is a much more proactive and much more of a \"main\" character in Nisemonogatari.  In a way, Nisemonogatari is much more \"first-person\" than Bakemonogatari was.  Most of the expositions come from Koyomi's perspective, and the psychological reality I discussed in ART section is mostly what goes on inside Koyomi's head.  Also, I discussed before that there is much more plot now.  With more plot, there needs to be more action, and it is mostly Koyomi that answers the call and actually does stuff.  Interestingly, he was hinted to be a bit of a pervert (who isn't?) in Bakemonogatari.  This is explored much further in Nisemonogatari, and, in my opinion, is actually kind of a theme.  But more on that.\\n\r\nSenjougahara is ever so ethereal and psychotic.  Both her stationary and her wit have further sharpened since Bakemonogatari.  Since the two story arcs focus around the two new characters, she does take a bit of a back seat, but her interaction with Koyomi is still what the core of this show consists of.  Some interesting development happens to her in that she finally shows some level of emotional interaction with a character other than Koyomi; she now has a thing (I know not any other way to put it) apparently with Hanekawa, which is currently in the funny, joke-material stage, but I suspect that I will lead to something.  Some major, major, MAJOR stuff happens around her, but you will have to watch yourself to find out.\\n\r\nHanekawa, first of all, looks much better without her glasses and with those ridiculous braids gone.  Well, she's no longer the resident maganekko, for those of you who are into that, but she looks much better IMO.  And, as is always the case for anime heroines who take off their glasses and/or cut her hair, she has become more assertive, and over all, a stronger character.  Her relationship with Koyomi is both more involved and more distant, but more on that later.\\n\r\nHachikuji is probably the character whose development I most enjoyed since Bakemonogatari.  Apart from her actual story arc, Hachikuji was a bit of a comic relief character and occasionally a foil to Senjougahara, but she is now a much deeper (and funnier!) character whose position in Koyomi's psyche is elaborated upon.  Her appearances are some of the most entertaining scenes in Nisemonogatari.\\n\r\nKanbaru is largely unchanged as her brusque, depraved self, but her relationship with Koyomi has progressed.  More on that later.\\n\r\nSengoku.... err.. just watch that episode.\\n\r\nKaren and Tsukihi are Koyomi's sisters that were pretty much nobodies in Bakemonogatari.  They each get a story arc.  Since they are kind of the main heroines of Nisemonogatari (as Senjougahara was for Bakemonogatari), any in-depth discussion of their characters would spoil the entire season.  However, the role they have on Bake/Nisemonogatari as a \"harem\" show is important, and I will discuss that in the next section.\\n\r\nSo that's a brief rundown of the characters, but this show is different for everyone, so the goal of listing my perception of each character was only to show how exciting this anime is, especially if you're a fan of Bakemonogatari.  Make you own blissful judgments after you've experienced the unprecedented, mega-witty, mesmerizing character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\r\nThis section is obviously highly subjective, and, because of that, it is here that I will discuss some of the more interesting things that have come to me upon viewing the first 8 episodes out of 11.  I was finally able to put a handle on what it is that made Bakemonogatari such an experience because Nisemonogatari is more overt when it comes to themes.  I've come to realize that the series can be summed up as a meta-fanservice.  Really, the show is mild in comparison to the level of fanservice in other mainstream anime, yet it elicits the most emotional response.  My theory is that the Bake/Nisemonogatari series touches on not just the sexual fantasies of viewers, but scratches the emotional itches of the viewer, resulting in a much, much fuller experience.  Those of you who have seen Bakemonogatari will recall that the climax of Koyomi and Senjougahara's romance, in the TV finale, actually occurred off-screen.  An even bigger pivotal event takes place in Nisemonogatari, and it is also off-screen.  That is why it's okay for Bakemonogatari to be a \"harem\" anime.  Nisemonogatari is very overt and gratuitous when it comes to fanservice, much more so than was Bakemonogatari.  However, all compromising situations Koyomi gets into with each female character (THE TOOTHBRUSH) is rendered moot in a fell swoop by the decision to minimize Koyomi and Senjougahara's romance on screen.  The two lovers spend the vast majority of their screentime together giving us those magnificent dialogues, and don't do any of the display of affection stuff we're so used to seeing in romance anime.  That is because, to Koyomi, Senjougahara is the subject of love and respect.  The ridiculous and often highly immoral (taken to a whole new level in Nisemonogatari THE TOOTHBRUSH) erotic situations he lands himself in with other female characters are meant to be gratuitous fanservice and nothing more.  I actually found those fanservice scenes to be the funniest of the series because they were so tongue-in-cheek in absolutely ridiculing fanservice, while actually providing top-quality fanservice.  That is what I call meta-fanservice.  Koyomi and Senjougahara's relationship has noticeably solidified.  In Bakemonogatari, there was always a sense of both Koyomi and Senjougahara playing along with the dialogue for the sake of the dialogue.  Senjougahara surely doesn't actually see Koyomi as a worthless human garbage (remember that dialogue?), but she says with her trademark snark, and Koyomi knows this, but he feigns injury.  This is much more involved in Nisemonogatari, where the verbal banters are more poignant, yet I could almost hear Koyomi and Senjougahara having a parallel telepathic conversation in which they sweet-talked each other.  In other words, their banters are like flirting; that's how they keep their relationship interesting for themselves and the viewers.  And, as their relationship has matured and solidified, it became more platonic, at least on screen, and other female \"harem\" members naturally could get more intensely involved with Koyomi to create those outrageous, delightful, hilarious scenes of meta-fanservice.  It is self-aware fanservice for the self-aware viewer.  Because I am a very self-aware and meta-cognitive person, I would, to be honest, have been a bit repulsed by the overtly pedophilic and even incestuous situations, but actually found them quite entertaining because the scenes themselves were also self-aware.  As is all over my profile, I'm pretty against the whole moe/loli trend, but I did not find Koyomi/Hachikuji harassment situations weird at all.  That is why Araragi Koyomi is actually an even more magnificent character than Senjougahara Hitagi: because he, for the sole sake of the viewer's gratification, goes out and gets tangled up with other women, but saves the viewer (and himself) from any danger of guilt by reserving 100% of his real love for Senjougahara only. \\n\\n\r\nI think I've blabbered on for enough now, but that just goes to show how much I appreciate this series.  Bakemonogatari was pretty much my penultimate anime experience (along with NGE), so I consciously lowered my expectations of Nisemonogatari, lest I be frustrated.  Looking back, however, there was no need at all.  Nisemonogatari is subtly, yet significantly of different flavor from Bakemonogatari, but it is just as enjoyable an experience.  The shifts in direction may have led some fans to believe that the show has lost its art-house flair and became a bit too mainstream, but I still maintain that Nisemonogatari is a continuation of Bakemonogatari as the culmination of modern anime counterculture (refer to my Bakmonogatari review).  I cannot give more praise to this wonderful sequel to a groundbreaking series.",

            "content": "An imposter is one who is skilled at the arts of deception, often using their gifts to swindle unsuspecting victims. While its predecessor, Bakemonogatari, focused on the supernatural forms of five everyday animals and how the heroines of the story had to deal with them, Nisemonogatari shifts the focal point to the effect that imposters can have on the lives of those around them, specifically the two Araragi sisters. The sequel brings back the heavy dialogue to a lesser extent, adding in a touch of fanservice to fill in the gaps. While liking one does not necessarily mean it'll be same for the other, thereis no doubt that both the Monogataris are NisiOisiN's more famous and successful pieces of work. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nAnyone who has watched anime for a reasonably long period of time must have come across SHAFT's animation on at least one occasion. Known for their \"unique\" artwork, SHAFT's approach is often times a risky \"hit or miss\". For Nisemonogatari, I felt the artwork matched the overall atmosphere of the series. The often comical expressions of the characters fit in well with the less serious aspects of the series. The usage of rapid scene changes and abstract visuals in the other parts were also able to set the mood with relative effectiveness. While it may take getting used to, the overall animation style is much more than decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nFirstly, Araragi Koyomi continues showing why he is one of the most interesting and respectable male protagonists in anime. Given the opportunity and situation, the words that come out of his mouth are unbelievably moving, even encouraging and true. One can easily empathize with his beliefs and ideals, which he strongly holds onto even in the toughest of times. Unfortunately, such a solid character is a rarity these days. While Bakemonogatari dealt with five of his female friends, Nisemonogatari expands on the two characters that are even closer to him: his younger sisters. The combination of Karen and Tsukihi make for an interesting pair; the two are literally the opposites of each other in terms of personality. Nonetheless, after having their fair share of screentime this time around, both sisters were developed quite well (more so Karen than Tsukihi, in my opinion). This can be mostly credited to the exceptional use of development-driving dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nAlthough there were fewer OPs used in Nisemonogatari than in Bakemonogatari, I felt they were all quite catchy and a pleasure to listen to. As for the ED, even though I really liked it too, my expectations for it (given that it was written by ryo from supercell and performed by ClariS) weren't exactly met. With that being said, topping \"Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari\" was hard enough already so I'm not going to be too critical. The BGM was at most times overshadowed by the dialogue. But when it was noticeable, it greatly enhanced each scene. Voice acting was once again top notch, with the cast from Bakemonogatari returning, including some new voices. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nCompared to a \"Ghostory\" or \"Monstory\", an \"Impostory\" is slightly more believable. Dealing with and confronting an imposter is no easy task. The main protagonist, Araragi Koyomi, was taught this lesson twice in the span of eleven episodes. With the story taking place over a time period of a few days, the amount of content involved is astounding. The fact that there were only a few episodes that were devoid of plot-development, proves how concentrated and detailed it is. Like in Bakemonogatari, the plot is mostly dialogue-driven. While this may bore those who are used to action-packed stories, I personally found the large number of long conversations, especially their contents, to be really interesting - especially the way they develop characters that, in turn, end up contributing towards the development of the plot. Although I'm certain that I missed many of the implicit meanings behind certain scenes, the fact that the story is still enjoyable is what matters, even if the bare minimum of what was intended is absorbed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nThe increased use of fanservice in Nisemonogatari may be a turn off for fans of the prequel. However, I felt it lightened up the series quite a bit, while at the same time reaching out to those who didn't really enjoy Bakemonogatari because of its complex storyline and total dependence on dialogue to drive the plot forward. Personally, I enjoyed Nisemonogatari more than Bakemonogatari. The balance between gags and seriousness made virtually all 11 episodes enjoyable and interesting. Boredom was hardly an issue throughout and it helped that each of the sisters got four arcs for development instead of the two or three that the other characters got back in Bakemonogatari. So even if you watched Bakemono and didn't enjoy it, I recommend you give Nisemono a try. They're more or less the same but the differences do make a noticeable impact. As for me, I'll be looking forward to a sequel seeing as how there was a \"To Be Continued\" sign at the conclusion of the last episode.",

            "content": "Better than the real thing.\r\nFake, unreal, an impostor. Story. With even more of a play on words than its predecessor, Bakemonogatari. Nisemonogatari is everything you can believe or disbelieve in when it comes to being a good anime. Directed by the avant-garde-ish Akiyuki Shinbo, Nisemonogatari pushes the boundaries of conventionality in anime and even in our own perceptions in more than a few ways.  Like Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari splits itself into two character-centric arcs, focusing on Araragi Koyomi's sisters, Araragi Karen and Araragi Tsukihi.\r\nAs a show Nisemonogatari carries surrealist presentation, strong dialogue interactions, characterisation, story, tenets of philosophy and seamlessly integrated 'fanservice'. It is thatfinal point which I believe draws the greatest strength of Nisemonogatari, not as an anime or show, but in the name itself. The seamless integration of the fanservice in this show brings about discussion whether or not Nisemonogatari delivers a story at all, or whether it is just simply a conduit for the release of morally questionable content, which is a valid point for many viewers and indeed the polarising point. If the latter being the case, then Nisemonogatari has already sold itself strongly as not being a story at all, that the Impostory has always simply been telling us the truth and we refused to believe it wasn't a story and that it was always intent on showcasing various fetishes. However if it is truly a story, then we can say it is a story about various impostors and believe the falsity or fanservice in some aspects of its presentation as being integral towards it. Either way in this discussion, the great power in the name of Nisemonogatari has already demonstrated what I believe to be an excellent show which will leave you reeling one way or the other as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe six elements of this show as mentioned above are seamless in their integration together which is primarily why I feel Nisemonogatari succeeds well in encapsulating the viewer in its mysterious world. As a show driven strongly by its dialogue, it is well backed up by the developed personalities and quirks of its various characters. The opening episode helps us reminisce the sharp personality of Senjougahara, her borderline sadism and her 'tender' love for Araragi Koyomi and hammers in what this show is all about, the powerful dialogue and serious yet occasionally comedic exchanges between the often powerful personalities in play. Within this scene, viewers are also treated with the surrealist presentation, the quick scene cuts, the magnified close ups which delivers a powerful intimacy, an almost voyeuristic, teasing approach to observing the relationship between Koyomi and Senjougahara. In terms of the story, this opening exchange would not have seemed significant at all, however the proceeding scenes and the effectiveness of their dialogue allows for seamless transition as the story is revealed to the viewer, bit by bit. Nisemonogatari continues in this vein albeit after this scene, exchanges grow even more unconventional, including the make or break element of fanservice. Combined with the surrealist approach and voyeuristic directing, the exchanges between Koyomi and various female characters have put many viewers on edge and an amount on high. However because these scenes generally carry some story significance or at least are serving as a transitional point, the fanservice slips itself in as a strange necessity almost. It is also important to note that these scenes serve as the intimate observation point of the developing feelings of many of the girls have for Koyomi.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I discuss fanservice, Nisemonogatari also strays far from the typical conventional ecchi like scenes found in various harem shows. That is to say that the fanservice in Nisemonogatari is different in terms of impact, presentation, time, location and case. One of the first things I should mention is how normalised the fanservice is in some cases. The character Kanbaru Suruga is an example of where her flirtatious personality results in her being intimately nude in her own room. The setting of her room is different to say more traditional fanservice locations such as the beach of hot springs and this also brings me to another point. As is with Shinbo's directing, Nisemonogatari's fanservice brings about this intimacy which is only exemplified by the surroundings and the scene cuts and close-ups. In some cases, the fanservice occurs in the room of the girl, or in one case Koyomi's own room which adds additional characterisation elements and heightens parts of the dialogue. Additionally, the fanservice brings forth extra dialogue which helps to proceed to the next element of the story. Some say you could compare it to Phoenix Wright, with a little more intimate action from examining witnesses in attempting to unveil the mystery. Also unlike other shows with fanservice, I feel that the fanservice here is not forced per se, but as mentioned integrated well into the story. Because the fanservice was done with story intent in many cases, and done seamlessly I feel that this element contributes to the success of Nisemonogatari as a show and to itself as a name. There is also the impact of a certain scene in Episode 8 which will not be forgotten any time soon.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the core of Nisemono (The Impostor), Nisemonogatari brings forth various intelligent exchanges regarding that topic. Whether it be fake love, fake feelings, lies, families, justice, relationships, Nisemonogatari has excelled at keeping towards its particular core topic. Some of the best exchanges are a result of discussions between Koyomi/Senjougahara and a self described villain and a self described good guy and they have raised interesting philosophical points of things we perceive in society such as good and evil and the power of lies. This is partly due to the excellence of the source material written by Nsio Isin, whose manipulation of language has proven to create powerful dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding some of the more technical aspects such as music, voice acting and animation, this is probably one of SHAFT's better works in terms of animation. Many will recall how horrible and non-existent the animation for Bakemonogatari was and will notice that Nisemonogatari relies far less on full screen cuts and has much more fluid animation. The voice acting for Nisemonogatari has also been excellent, in particular the voice of Kaiki Deishu, voiced by the experienced Miki Shinichiro. His deliverance of lines which were lies and compliments with sarcasm and scorn enhanced the many scenes he was in and certainly heightened the personality traits of his character. Kamiya Hiroshi also remains excellent as Koyomi Araragi, delivering comedic, serious lines along his character. I felt the OST remained a little under the radar, but proved to be good enough for the situations they were played in.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari presents a mature, comedic, intimate, emotional rollercoaster of a show with its avant-garde methods of presentation, backed up by its powerful characters and their exchanges and dialogues. As a sequel, it will prove more difficult to watch without watching Bakemonogatari, and as what I would deem a seinen show, difficult for newcomers to anime, especially those unaccustomed to degrees of fanservice. If you enjoyed Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari will be familiar to you and I would recommend you continue even if you don't enjoy fanservice. Fans of SHAFT shows should also explore the Gatari series and watch up to Nisemonogatari. Mystery, Fantasy and Comedy fans should also try watching Nisemonogatari, through watching through Bakemonogatari first. Nisemonogatari for me has few weaknesses as a show aside from it being a sequel and I'd rate it a 9 for enjoyment. Critically, Nisemonogatari also fares very well as a show, I think of it as the smooth, silky tapestry located in an art museum with all the statues and nude pictures, it's captivating, flowing and intricate, yet you don't stare at it for all the naughty bits. It scores a critical score of 8.",

            "content": "It might be a bit premature to say this, as (the infuriatingly-titled) Monogatari Second Season is still airing as of this review, but Nise is definitely the odd bird amongst the Monogatari series, always spoken of as an exception where the other three are the rule. And though I enjoyed it immensely, for reasons both wrong and right, it's an uneven mess from start to finish.\r\nNisemonogatari starts off sloppily, wasting the bulk of the first several episodes of an already short series reintroducing the cast of the first series, as well as the two new challengers: Ararararararagi's sisters, Karen and Tsukihi. They both fill morestandard harem archetypes that the first series left unfilled - Karen is the spunky, martial arts loving Genki Girl, whilst Tsukihi is something of a yandere (albeit more restrained than many others of her ilk). Both, of course, have a raging brother complex, because for all its good qualities the Monogatari series is still a harem, and therefore every single female character needs to be in love with the protagonist because fuck logic that's why.\\n\\n\r\nIt also introduces the first villainous character in Monogatari's canon, Kaiki Deishuu, a supernatural con-man who has run afoul of Karen and Tsukihi's vigilante antics. The Kaiki Deishuu plot is definitely the best part of Nise's first two thirds, but poor pacing leads it to take up a disproportionately low amount of screentime compared to reintroductions and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me this: while the other Monogatari series have plenty of fanservice, Nise is by far the most fanservice-centric. Entire episodes of it amount to nothing more than catering to various fetishes, some of which you probably didn't even know existed before Nise (if you've seen it, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). As a result, Nise is less substance and more cocktease, and suffers for it.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say Nisemonogatari is without substance - in fact, it does a very good job of furthering the various character interactions that are the meat of Monogatari. However, most of this is confined to one episode - along with most of the plot. This breakneck pacing immediately following several episodes of slow-burn nothingness is disorienting, to say the least, and lessens the effect of how good said episode actually was.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc that follows it is similarly rushed and very underwhelming compared to (the actual plot of) Nise's first arc, and renders Tsukihi one of the weakest Monogatari girls by making her little more than a plot device in her own arc. In spite of its themes of family bonds, it's one of the weaker arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAll this having been said, Nisemonogatari is not bad, and the reason for this is that it's Monogatari, so in spite of all its missteps, the directing is still wonderfully off-kilter (and the art has improved on its predecessor, what with being a post-Madoka shaft series and having an actual budget), and the dialogue is still utterly exceptional. With these being constants, it's hard to make anything actually /bad/, but not for lack of trying in Nise's case.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Nise is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine and is an entertaining romp, but it's easily the weakest part of the Monogatari canon. Also, toothbrushing.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nActing: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Mysterious Girlfriend X, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari was definitely one of the most talked about anime during 2009. Whether it was the clever dialogue or Senjouhara Hitagi herself, fascination was aroused among the viewers. Now in 2012 Nisemonogatari, the sequel, rivals the splendidness presented in the prequel. However, Nisemonogatari shouldn't be pressing attention for the same reason, in fact its dialogue lacks the same teasing tone as Bakemonogatari, but it poses an interesting Eastern philosophy which most people tends to ignore while thinking of Nisemonogatari.\r\nOne of the most brought up issues about Nisemonogatari is its fan service. While rarely noticed in Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari presents its fan service in the most rawform possible. This claim can easily be justified by the old cliched lifting the skirt up, and touching female private parts actions shown constantly in Nisemonogatari, and if I recall correctly there is one episode where nothing else but fan service exists.\u00a0These flashy scenes don't bother me, but it's the incest connotation which comes along with it. Although these are just personal ethic beliefs, the fact that Nisemonogatari seems to be promoting incest behavior is definitely nauseating. Also, last season Bakemonogatari exposed just as much body parts in the beginning, but as the series progressed fan service was toned down. While, Nisemonogatari did the exact opposite.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Nisemonogatari can be split into two parts, each about Arargi, the main protagonist, and his two sisters. It starts out with Arargi's first sister, Karen, who believes she is justice. Karen goes after a character who was referenced multiple times in Bakemonogatari as an evil villain. And Arargi, thinking that he's responsible for his sister, goes after the villain as well, without much knowledge of what he's getting himself into. This conflict eventually gets resolved, but it doesn't end there. Then the story goes on to talk about the origin of Arargi's family's evil, and his second sister named Tsukihi. This is where the Name of The series, Nisemono, which translates to Fakery in Japanese, actually starts sinking in. The rest of this tale proceeds to talk about an Eastern philosophy which basically believes in the superiority of Eternal Beasts and how supreme animal beings can transmigrate their souls into actual human souls.\\n\\n\r\nNow when you think about ancient Japanese tales, that's usually it. The duality between material and spiritual souls was their deity/religion, and it's typically boring when anime are made about these sorts of topic. But what Nisemonogatari manages to do, the industry doesn't successfully do most of the time. It manages to mix religious tales within a modern perspective, specifically in modern Japan.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the own thing supernatural about Nisemonogatari, though. Many of the characters take in interesting modern outlooks on things. For example, Arargi is half a vampire, and most of the his friends are or were associated with supernatural beasts, mostly animals.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWhat the Series ended up doing, like many anime does, is defy many laws of gravity as well as physicals. But it does conclude in a very intriguing way. A very interesting quote which went along with its central philosophy is this: \u201cGiven the real thing, and an indistinguishable fake, which is worth more? Naturally, my response was that the real thing was worth more. Oshino-kun asserted that they had equal value, though. But here is [his] argument: The fake is of far great value. In its deliberate attempt to be real, it\u2019s more real than the real thing.\" (ep 11) Such said quotes intrigued many interesting philosophical points which goes through many of its branches, such as idealism conflicting materialism, but were perfidiously introduced and explored.\\n\\n\r\nFor many of us viewers who enjoys philosophy over fan service, this anime would seemingly have failed in its attempt. Since, the series only elaborate on this philosophy to the extent of a few episodes while the first half was more on a seemingly pointless fan service session. Unfortunately, the sad fact is \u00a0people who watches anime these days prefers an enjoyable series such as Bakemonogatari, rather than seriously philosophical works. Thus, I understand why Nisemonogatari went down how it did, but why the directors could have just ignored following the Light Novels, and extended the series, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe new introduced characters in Nisemonogatari are really meant to appeal to the audiences. They can't really be considered new since their appearances were obviously present in Balemonogatari, but in this series their appearances are more pro-dominant. What's disappointing to many of Senjouhara fans is that her airing time compared to Bakemonogatari significantly decreased. However, it should be awarding that in a sequel about a whole another story she was allowed any. Other than that, the other two main characters are obviously Arargi's two sisters, and they're only decent. In a sense, Arargi is illustrated as a creeper/pedophile in Nismonogatari, more than in Bakemono. If you're into those kind of things, well here's a plus. If you're not, there's not many explicit scenes shown in this series so don't worry... Too much. Although I should warn you that blood is like pouring rain near the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Nisemonogatari is the outstanding aspect of the Monogatari series and perhaps even a trademark of the Shaft Studio nowadays. I was not disappointed by the visuals at all through this series, as well as the music. During Bakemonogatari's airing, Supercell was the main focus of the series and they succeeded with many of the Original Soundtracks. You could say it was the apex of Supercell's career. I can't say I wasn't disappointed by their disappearance in Nisemonogatari, but with its creativeness in the OP and Ed, I can't say I wasn't satisfied either.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series is the one that could have surpassed it's prequel, with more meaning behind it. However, due to its restricted requirements of having to follow an adaptation, Nisemonogatari ended up emphasizing the lesser important aspects of the show. As a result, Nisemonogatari's more insightful view points were almost concealed. But, the industry needs its money, and if they can manage to get it through other solutions such as fan service. So be it. Despite all its poor qualities, Nisemonogatari was still quite inspirational for a sequel, and I recommend it to any viewers who enjoyed Bakemonogatari's artwork or many of its previous characters.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nNow let's just cross our figures and hope all the Gatari series after this one will learn from Nisemonogatari's mistakes, and become outstanding sequels themselves.",

            "content": "WAIT. Read. I didn't just unilaterally give Nisemonogatari a 1 because I didn't like the show and I'm thoughtless and spiteful like that. I want to start this review out with a bit of a preface. I've never written a review of something that I've given a 1 before, and that's because I usually don't finish watching them. Why would I? If something is terrible, I turn it off. However, Nisemonogatari is completely unlike any of the other shows I would usually give 1s, and is also the sequel to Bakemonogatari, a show that I am very enthusiastic about. I want to make that veryclear first: this is not an attack on the Monogatari series as a whole, but merely a single part of it. A part of it I very much feel it could have done without.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I give Nisemonogatari a 1? Is it because it has absolutely no merits, a void of any sort of intelligence or engagement? No. Not at all. Nise is actually an incredibly smart show, and there were aspects of it that I appreciated immensely. The backgrounds are stunning, the references are great, the humor is oftentimes on-point and a good portion of the dialogue is insightful and meaningful. There were several episodes (3 in total) that I actually enjoyed from start to finish. The reason I gave Nisemonogatari a 1 is that it aptly fits my description of a 1: It negatively impacted me as an individual and I feel as though it is an unhealthy, detracting experience for people in general. It promotes toxic ideals and actively helps to make the world a worse place. \\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't aware already, Nisemonogatari is famous for its fanservice. The entire Monogatari series is, actually, but I wouldn't even call it fanservice in the rest of the series. In Bakemonogatari, for instance, the camera is used effectively as a lense for the protagonist Araragi to show what he is focused on. When he is having lewd thoughts about a person, it will portray them sexually. This is only the case, however, when it actually fits with what is going through his head, and regardless of how Araragi may VIEW various characters, this doesn't change what actually HAPPENS. This is because he is a human not a god and regardless of what his fantasies may be the world is not going to conform around them. Instead, he is often chastised for his perverse thoughts and it's something he eventually has to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nIn Nisemonogatari, this changes. Araragi suddenly becomes the focal point of the world, with every straight girl inevitably seeking to erotically seduce him and even the lesbian character wants to tear off his clothes and roll around naked with him. Even if there is no spontaneous sexual tension between Araragi and a character, the show still devises plenty of ways to put them in absurd compromising positions with each other, liking having Hanekawa roll around on his bed or Shinobu take a bath with him. Now I've heard plenty an educated argument for Nisemonogatari, claiming that it actually hates fanservice and is demonstrating the incredible potential of the camera to portray a character's intentions or emotions, and I would agree that the directing work is masterful. There are two scenes; one towards the beginning and one towards the end of the series in which Araragi's sister receives a crotch-shot. The first one is completely un-sexual, demonstrating the lack of tension in their relationship, while the last one is the exact opposite, showing how that has changed. It's extremely well-done. However, that doesn't change the fact that it's just an intelligent way of fan-pandering. This argument can be applied to nearly all of Nisemonogatari: yes, Nise hates fan service; or rather, Nise hates the uncreative and unenlightened way in which most fan service is done. It wants to demonstrate how it can be done more effectively, setting up moments of situational and emotional softcore porn as opposed to just making some tits & ass wobble. It's extremely good at it, too: if your evaluation of a show is ambition vs. result, than Nise is a roaring success. However, it's not the execution for which I condemn Nise, its for what its goals are and therefore what its effect on its audience is.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice is annoying. At least, that's how I feel. But fanservice alone, ironic or no, is not enough for me to write off a show. Sure it can get irritating at times and it's a little insulting, but I don't consider it normally capable of single-handedly sabotaging a show. It's usually the case that shows that rely on fanservice to entertain their audience do so because they don't hold a great deal of respect for themselves in the first place or because they don't feel as though they have anything especially original to do or say, causing them to fall back on basic, shallow means of engaging their viewers. This isn't always the case, though: Code Geass and Haruhi Suzumiya stand out as examples to the contrary. Nise's not like that though: it takes pride in its ability to absorb its viewers in its carefully-crafted pandering, and that makes it all the more poisonous.\\n\\n\r\nThere are three major reasons why I abhor Nisemonogatari. They are as follows.\\n\\n\r\n1. The fan-service actively detracts from, and oftentimes takes the place of the plot and characters. The show constantly goes out of its way to create appealing situations, turning its characters from the previously multi-dimensional beings that they were into absurd blobs of either hormones or obliviousness. Characters are made conveniently unaware of their situation to allow other characters to up their advances, taking the believability out of them. Entire episodes are spent on contrived erotic situations that devour any meaningful character interactions and replace them with characters making excuses to the audience to touch each other and calling it development. The actual story is condensed to the ends of arcs, becoming rushed and crammed into single episodes of extremely belated exposition rammed back-to-back with resolutions. This makes the show itself far more simple than it could have been, substituting the difficult truths of Bakemonogatari for childish moral taglines and replacing the meaningful personal revelations that were a result of conflict that was internal with physical villains who are either stupidly irredeemable or blatantly hypocritical. This is a very steep and very sickening price to pay for the constant fan-service.\\n\\n\r\n2. Nisemonogatari is part of the Monogatari series. As a stand-alone, it could just be written off or dropped. However, as is, Nise is an active part of a pretty incredible series, one that it actively detracts from. It would be one thing if it were merely boring or slow, but it's more than that. No one's character motivations are consistent: Hitagi, who used to be over-protective and possessive of Araragi, suddenly decides instead that she's fine with him sleeping with whoever he wants as long as he loves her. Suruga, who used to be many things: athletic, energetic, envious, self-loathing; becomes defined exclusively by the trait \"she is horny\". Hanegawa, who was previously sharp with Araragi for being perverse despite her feelings for him, starts cracking jokes about him feeling her up. Araragi himself is the worst offender. While initially he was characterized as selfless to a fault, self-aware, and endearingly thoughtful of people's feelings, he's now decided to be conveniently oblivious and remorseless as he tramples on whoever-the-fucks emotions to cop a feel whenever possible. What once were entirely believable fantasies have manifested themselves in far-less believable actions. It's a lot easier to control what we do than what we think, and Araragi has aptly demonstrated an incredible willpower many a time. That he would so casually revert to this without any sort of triggering event or internal conflict is entirely unbelievable. All of this is a result of the show warping its characters to create the erotic situations it wants to, and it bends everything too far. Nisemonogatari breaks the illusion of the Monogatari world. Its inconsistencies, indulgent depravity and unfortunate placing in the middle of the series cause it to do hefty and irrevocable damage to the series as a whole. With a series as generally impressive as Monogatari, this is a real tragedy.\\n\\n\r\n3. This is the big one. So far, I've described why I believe the show is bad, but internal sabotage and series sabotage are not enough to warrant a series a 1. What makes Nise so irredeemable is the impact is has on society's perception of sexuality. There is already enough of a problem with media portraying sex as very different than it actually is, glorifying it, creating false expectations of what it is supposed to be like, and taking the messiness and humanity out of it. This is actively damaging to impressionable youths and has a negative impact on social behavior and body image. Nise actively promotes these portrayals, portraying characters as young as 14 in erotic situations in ways that are meant to, as obvious by the expert camerawork, glorify it. This creates a false impression of what sex is like and pushes people to feel as though this sort of behavior is what is expected of them. If they aren't indulging in it too, they're missing out. Look how fucking hot it is, right? This is not to mention the fact that she show uses incest and a vampire trapped in an 8-year-old's body to draw out the appeal of a 'forbidden love' in its viewers. The worst part of all this is the way that Araragi is portrayed: not as the sleazy womanizer that he is, but as a gallant hero who all men should aspire to be like. He's shown as a kind, protective, morally-sound guy who gets to fool around with lots of girls as a result because he's earned all of their affections. In addition to this, unlike similar shows Nise has a very intellectual and mellow vibe to it that makes it much easier to justify enjoying. It's not in-your-face trashy. If you're looking for ways to make entitled monsters out of lonely and insecure young boys, then you've found a pretty sound bet in Araragi. \\n\\n\r\nInevitably, the show's final flaw is that it never addresses any of its choices. For a season that's essentially about fanservice, it sure never tries to make any contrasting points about why perhaps this kind of media and the ideas that it fosters are unhealthy. No, right up to the end Nisemonogatari is detrimental to itself, detrimental to the Monogatari series, and detrimental to society as a whole. For all of its gorgeous art and witty conversation, I can't think of anything I've actually finished that has been more deserving of a score of 1.",

            "content": "I really, really wanted to review Bakemonogatari way back when it aired, since the show seemed to captivate the anisphere but because of the fact I only just joined, that was of course wasn't possible. Here\u2019s the thing though: I was never quite sure what I watched. To me, the show was overly complex when it didn't need to be, a continual tease, and only \u201cintelligent\u201d in the way two teenagers up late talking about life can be. But I held my tongue. I could never form a set of arguments that satisfied me. Nisemonogatari, on the other hand, I understand and was prepared for.This time, I get it, because if the prequel was everything people said of it, the Spring 2012 show is definitely worse.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10) - Nisemonogatari\u2019s TV run picks up shortly after the end of its prequel series and sees Koyomi Araragi spending time shirking his studies and visiting his various friends. While the anime starts off touching base with its characters and serving up the meandering conversations for which Bakemonogatari gets so much praise, eventually a pair of incidents surrounding Araragi\u2019s \u201cFire Sisters\u201d become the show a semblance of a plot.\\n\r\nSadly, Shinbo gets in the way more in this season than the last. He turns the fanservice meter up to to eleven, exchanging the clever banter for lovingly crafted shots of his underage beauties. Sure, the first season had its awkward moments of lingering on jailbait, but this time, we spend significant portions of the plot watching Araragi oggle, fondle, and play twister with teenage girls with very little story-related payoff. The infamous toothbrush scene--during which Koyomi and Karen play a punishment game in pretty explicit imitation of a sex act--in particular drags on for an uncomfortable amount of time and doesn't do much more than provide cognitive dissonance with Araragi\u2019s later explanations of filial relationships.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (10/10) - In contrast to the scattered storytelling bringing down the anime, the visuals deliver precisely what the audience has come to expect from Shinbo at the top of his game. While the direction remains avant garde at times, the animations ensure that the characters and settings appear as lovingly rendered as possible, and the juxtaposition works. The constant cuts work better in the more intimate setting of this series and either work to intensify the action (the few times when it does come up) or create an almost tactile understanding of a scene in his viewers (see: the pencil or toothbrush scenes).\\n\r\nThe character designs help Shinbo in his quest to provide the best visual experience. Each character can flow between eerie, moe, and attractive almost at will without damaging the coherence of a scene, and again the disjointed direction helps ease the transition between the silly and the serious. The mercurial and flexible portrayals work best with Koyomi, Kanbaru, and Kagenui who work hard at hiding multiple sides to their personalities and identities. But it also helps to add surprising depth to Hachikuji whom the script treats strangely.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - For all that Renai Circulation should still be banging around in some of your heads, Platinum Disco manages to raise the bar. Its combination of traditional sounds, upbeat vocals, and a pop baseline makes it one of the best offerings of the year.\\n\r\nOnce again, Hiroshi Kamiya gives us a super-plastic Araragi who really saves the show. Since he\u2019s in just about every scene and spends a good portion of the time wandering all over the emotional spectrum, this performance determines whether the narrative holds together at all. That he succeeds frees the rest of the cast to stick to caricature. Of these, my personal favorites are Maaya Sakamoto\u2019s Shinobu, Emiri Katou as Hachikuji, and the delightfully petulant Tsuhiki played by Yuka Iguchi, although my preference for those characters clouds my judgement. Fans of aloof tsundere should still find Chiwa Saito\u2019s Senjogahara easy on the ears and the newcomers playing Kagenui and her familiar provide excellent \u2018otherness\u2019 so needed for the roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) - Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari play with the shifting space between characters as tropes or ideas and characters as interesting, layered personalities. The earlier show\u2019s meatier conversations create a wide-open space for exploring each characters\u2019 quirks as he or she (mostly she) banters with Araragi. Here, however, something seems off. Araragi spends too much of his time alone in the first half of the show or beating around the bush as the first conflict winds up. Moreover, Suruga and Nadeko, who had displayed their personal conflicts and quirks prominently before, flatten into their single defining traits for their brief appearances which feels disappointing after their humorous arcs in the first season.\\n\r\nEven so, some characters shine through the odd direction choices. First and foremost, Hitagi\u2019s moments near the end of the Karen Bee arc show a vulnerability and depth of emotion to her that works well at complementing the sensitivity shown near the end of the first season. Retreading her weakness provides some much-needed cracks in her cool tsundere. Shinobu gets a similar treatment that has her bounding between violent legendary vampire and lonely little girl. Isin binds the two personalities together using her condescension as glue, which allows her to be aloof, ironic, and earnestly concerned about Araragi without stretching the limits of her characterization.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) - Its prequel straddles the line between self-importance and brilliance. Nisemonogatari, however, distorts the formula sufficiently to lose some of its shine. The top-notch visuals and exceptional sound direction don\u2019t entirely excuse Shinbo\u2019s explosions of fanservice and stuttering plotting, but fans of the first series should still find lines of character development worth following and many of the same themes on display. If you liked Nisio Isin\u2019s first installment, you should take this second bite, just don\u2019t expect it to blow your mind.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is the most disappointing thing since Barack Obama.\r\nI mean what the hell was that, this wasn\u2019t a sequel, for the most part it felt like a really long OVA that you\u2019d get for buying a special edition of Bakemonogatari, because nothing happens in this series at all, except we are introduced to Araragis sisters but that\u2019s all, there is virtually no character development for the sisters at all in a series that is almost entirely about characters.Now Bakemonogatari was good, i didn't love it or anything but for the most part i enjoyed it,  the visuals were a pleasure to watch, the music was good, the dialogue was sharp as a blade and the characters were mostly interesting because it was a pleasure to see them interact with each other and see what happens. But if you\u2019ll recall Bakemonogatari also had something that called a story, you know things happen in it, characters are introduced and develop and grow, problems arise and our characters try overcoming them and maybe learning something along the way you know shit like that. But Nisemonogatari has nothing, the characters are boring cardboard cut outs and the most shocking thing of all is that nothing happens in this series at all unless you include implied incest as something but if you do then you need take your brain medicine and get back in your toll booth. \\n\\n\r\nOkay so let\u2019s get into this shit and start with what\u2019s wrong with the story, as if I even need to say it because it so obvious Ray Charles could see it, and he doesn\u2019t even know anything about anime. Okay so I\u2019ll be brief there is no story, it\u2019s just a bunch of stuff that happens to give us an excuse to see girls in compromising situations and yes I know Bakemonogatari is a harem but we still need something or else we don\u2019t care about the characters and it gets boring. And thats what Nisemonogatari was, boring, uneventful and ultimately pointless you could watch the episodes in any order and it wouldn\u2019t make a lick of difference because there\u2019s no story. The whole series just comes off a sequence of colourful crisp images played in a sequence to trick people into thinking there watching an anime when in fact they\u2019re just being scammed. That\u2019s right I said Nisemonogatari is just a big scam to trick idiots who liked Bakemonogatari into thinking there watching the same thing when in fact they be better off watching a strobe light while listen to music from Bakemonogatari  because that\u2019s basically what this was. I mean I know Bakemonogatari was no Citizen Kane but it was fun to watch, the show struck a great balance between comedy, fan service characters and story and even threw in some nice visuals and music to boot while Nisemonogatari is like its retarded little brother which fucked up everything from pacing to character development to my brain, ahhh it hurts, make it stop!      \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, another glaring problem with this faecal matter was the characters, much of the original characters return but they feel like shadows of their former selves and don\u2019t do anything to the point where I wonder if the people who made Nisemonogatari even watched Bakemonogatari or have any idea of what made it good. They come off as cardboard cut-outs just there to further the illusion that what we`re watching is a sequel to Bakemonogatari and not crap. So anyway the whole point of this I think was to introduce us to Araragi`s sisters and then have something involving them happen or whatever but does that happen\u2026\u2026 no! Jack shit happens except scene after scene after scene of Karen and whatever the other sister was called in provocative positions and some half assed plot about some guy who\u2019s doing something to people at their school but it goes nowhere and the bad guy just leaves when confronted. Jesus Christ are they trying to bore the audience to death, I think the people that made this thought that as long as it looked like Bakemonogatari then they put whatever the hell they wanted into it and get away because idiots can\u2019t tell when their being scammed.     \\n\\n\r\nSo anyway there\u2019s about a million other things wrong with this series but I\u2019ve wasted enough of my time on this shit, when you\u2019re 147 years old like I am you can\u2019t waste your time so, you know, watch it, don\u2019t watch, I don\u2019t really give a flying fuck but if you\u2019ve got like cancer or something that\u2019s like killing or something then you then you probably shouldn\u2019t watch this because it sucks balls and is just a big time wasting scam.  \\n",

            "content": "Shaft... just words can't describe their magnificence.  If you have seen Shaft's works, they are truly amazing and one of the best animation studio. Bakemonogatari was the first anime I've watched when I came back to watching anime in December 2012. I've got to say that Bakemonogatari was a genuine work of literature and it was my favorite. The monogatari series focuses on mysteries of each character and explains them in a beautiful way. I kept telling myself that this series isn't the best, but I was sadly lying to myself.\r\nNisemonogatari is a continuation of Bakemonogatari and focuses on the sisters. Araragi-Kun has twosisters: Karen and Tsukihi. As we already know, Araragi is a vampire and he has to the decency to help other people with weird problems. Who knows that the sisters even had supernatural problems? The plot was creative and wasn't cliche. Give a hand of applause to Isin Nisio, the author of the Monogatari series. I couldn't tell what this intelligent man was thinking, but I had to agree that his literature was one of my favorite. Nisemonogatari shows the relationship Araragi has with his sisters since it wasn't focused much on Bakemonogatari. There has to be some background knowledge if you introduced a character into an anime. It would be vague if the sisters weren't explained, but introduced in Bakemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely amazing. I loved the way Shaft animated it. It is truly convey the cinematic. I'm glad that Shaft is going to animate Monogatari: Season 2 in the summer. To add more, their going to animate the movie, Kizumonogatari! The head tilt is what Shaft was known for and it was unique in its own way. The characters were well drawn and the background was good. There was a bit of action in Nisemonogatari and it was amazing. It was just the literature which makes Monogatari series stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime focuses on the sisters, there are only 3 opening. The beginning is Senjougahara, but the rest focuses on Karen and Tsukihi. The music for Shaft is amazing and I love the way they animate each one. I have to say that Tuskihi's opening was my favorite. It was cute and it reminded me classical music. The ending was made by ClariS and it was pretty good. Other than that, Nise was well made.\\n\\n\r\nThe huge change I've seen was that Nisemonogatari added too much fanservice. I can say that it was hilarious cause I believe it was intentional and it has a significance in the anime. It isn't those ecchi anime without any meaning. I mean I can just sit here and watch oppais bouncing around, but the ecchi here is creative and symbolic. It is also to approach siscons and brocons. The monogatari series have a broad genre that it appeals to most viewers. You don't have to be a mystery lover to enjoy this anime, nor a ecchi fan to enjoy it too. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I just want Shaft to take my wallet and my car and my clothes and my computer and yadda yadda. This is one of the anime I was interested in buying figurines and stuff to support the author and the company. The story was great, the art is superb, the music was soothing, and characters were likeable and I enjoyed the anime throughout. It touched the goal where Araragi wants to save everyone who he cared deeply for.\\n\\n\r\n\"It is impossible for someone to replace someone else.\" - Araragi Koyomi",

            "content": "Ka, ka, so this 11 episode anime has just ended, as far as I want to give it a good rating, it simply doesn't deserve  any, in fact the story doesn't apply fully to the plot and the plot is often accompanied by a lot of symbolisim and metaphore usually in conjuction with art, so for the story it is a \"Poor\" number 3. And as for the art, I'll give it a \"Good\" number 7, since the illustrator puts more detail into the art than the story.\r\nSound: Fair 6.\r\nDon't ask.\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\r\nFrankly this is no longer about Koyomi and Hitagi rather this ison Koyomi and his relationship with his fire sisters, namely Karen and Tsukihi, with Shinbo on the sides. It won't be fair if I'll just focus on the wussie Koyomi if I don't inculde his fire sisters and his vampire familiar. But I cannot discount the antoagonist Kaiki Deshi who at first we are expecting to have some fight against the protagonist. Sadly, the expected fight didn't came instead it the fight is between Koyomi and Shinbo vs Yosuru and Yotsuga. Oh, and Koyomi is one big loser compared to Shinbo who was able to beat the crap out of Yotsuga, so this part only deserves a 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nOk, first of all this anime's genre is comedy and supernatural, the thing is the comedy part is pretty lame, only the supernaturaln thing is one that carrys the overall of this anime, the enjoyable part is mostly on the incest play that Koyomi does with his fire sisters and all the blah, blah, blah that comes with, also there is the art which were exhibited as metaphore that more likely serves as fillers to elaborate the anime's overall make up, so at this point, it is clear that this is simply not for those who don't see the symbolisim that goes with the plot, ka,ka.",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari..\r\nNisemonogatari... \r\n\"The series was first created by Nisio Isin as a series of short stories for Mephisto magazine.\" -Wiki\r\nIt seems quite a few people who watch this series are unawares or only partially aware to the fact that this series was originally a  light novel. I'm writing this review thinking of the viewers who do not know quite as much about the series as they could, and may want to learn a bit more after seeing Bakemonogatari.\r\nLet me start off saying that the author of this series has captured my heart, be it translated bits of light novel or the animated adaptations that havesprung fourth from this series popularity, the Monogatari Series has awed me in many many ways.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari; even though this is my only review written for the Monogatari series at all so far, I will attempt to focus on Nisemonogatari itself. \\n\\n\r\nNise~ is a continuation of the Monogatari series. It is indeed a sequel. It is the 2nd volume in the light novels as well as the 2nd season in the animation. It picks up after Koyomi has successfully saved 5 different girls and now allows us to see him developing his relationships with the characters now surrounding him rather than completely focusing on the mysteries surrounding spirits and the people they attach themselves to.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a sharp-tongued ex-vampire who lives in Koyomi's shadow to a pair of younger sisters attempting to exact justice on the world, even at the expense of their older brother's peace of mind, Nisemonogatari is here to help us grasp what is happening to the characters since the first volume/season ended.\\n\\n\r\nOne very unique aspect I love about this series is that it frequently uses a psuedo-fanservice to drive many of it's scenes and conversations. The way the characters talk with each other, the concern or lack of concern for delicate situations between characters, these vague ideas express specific instances that occur throughout the series where when you are watching these scenes; you are able to grasp just what kind of relationship certain characters have without much needing to even be spelled out for you. \\n\r\n(One example those who have not read the light novel will not get is; when Koyomi is taking a bath and Shinobu comes out of his shadow to bathe with him. This is done in a non-sexual manner, but also with a lot of sexual tension.\\n\r\nIn the LN Volume titled \"Koyomi Vamp\" Book #4, we get a LOT of back-story to his VERY intricate relationship with Shinobu, which is a reason as to why she is likely my favorite character in this series as of now)\\n\\n\r\nThe story, albeit confusing for newcomers, is amazing. Though it is isn't told in complete chronological order, they keep the story & the dialogue they do have in the animation true to form. After reading bits and pieces of the translated light novel I am truly impressed with how well this was adapted into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the anime is effing awesome, and not only just for it's attention to detail, but also for how expressive it can be do the mood-changes in a conversation. The rooms that Araragi Koyomi is in, and the paths he travels from place to place upon while conversing with a character ~ will only resemble a real room or path 50% of the time. Our characters surroundings are frequently used in the animation to project certain emotions to the audience with the characters themselves hardly needing to say a word.The art is extremely symbolic as well as being some of the most quality animation I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. Nothing seems distorted or out of place. The character voices are clear and do not distort. In fact the music in the background used throughout the series is fantastic at setting certain tones. We know when the story is being playful, as well as when it is getting relatively serious. And the voice actors do a fantastic job of delivering our characters and their personalities. Nothing seems forced, it all simply flows.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are numerous and their personalities voluminous. So many unique interactions ensue that even though each episode is mostly dialogue, it feels as though they pass in a matter of minutes. From a Tsundere girlfriend to a quick witted ghost child we are never left wanting with each person Koyomi stops to engage. And these interactions pop up so frequently it sometimes takes half an episode for Koyomi to simply leave his house.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, every episode is a treat for me. I am never opposed to a bit of fanservice, and I feel this series is far less random with it. In fact I think the fanservice effectively moves the plot forward and makes the characters stand out even more. The humor is subtle most of the time, but it makes the story even more endearing than the constant outrageous outbursts some anime rely on to entertain the viewers. The supernatural aspect is so intriguing alone that we never know what route exactly Koyomi will need to pursue to shed light on the matters he deals with.\\n\\n\r\nI know giving a 10 is always fairly ridiculous for any anime, because nothing is perfect and no viewer is exactly the same, but I really do love this series. This is simply one of those series that make me wish I knew Japanese so that I could dive into the wealth of novels and games created around it. After reading the translated Koyomi Vamp installment and rewatching this series, I understood this series so much better, and thus fell in love with the many characters all over again. Shinobu, who at first only was able to thoroughly confuse me as a presence, easily became my favorite character for Koyomi to interact with in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest that if you watch this anime, you at least read some of the translated Light Novel as well to fill in the gaps. I cannot wait for the movie based off Koyomi Vamp to be released~\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is one of those truly unique animes. Never have I seen anything like it. Unlike other animes, Nisemonogatari relies heavily on character dialogue and interactions and almost the entire episodes are spent on discussions between characters. It is very unique on this aspect, but let\u2019s review each aspect in greater depth, shall we?\r\nStory: The story revolves around Araragi, a former vampire who is trying to help other people get rid of certain curses that are pestering them. Now, if you are reading this review and you haven\u2019t watch the first season Bakemonogatari, then I suggest that you watch that first because you may notbe able to understand this Nisemonogatari without prior knowledge of its prequel. All I can tell you is that unlike the first season, Nisemonogatari revolve more on Araragi and his family, specifically his sisters. It starts of light-hearted and then turns into a more serious tone when his and his sister\u2019s views and beliefs collide, forming an interesting story. Overall I would give it an 8/10 because although the story was not incredible, it\u2019s just that the way it was told was amazing, and is truly unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Animation is one of the strong points of this anime. There are beautiful visuals, smooth animations, and wonderful character designs. The animation of Nisemonogatari is also unique in a way that the scene changes every so often, and is shown at weird angles, although it can get a bit annoying at times. There are also times when the background is completely abstract, as if everything has been covered in wallpaper. There are also some fight scenes which are good enough to be considered on par with shounen animes like Bleach that other ninja crap. I guess in terms of visuals, you can also compare it to the anime \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d, since both contain some serious eye candy. All I can is that this anime is really a feast for the eyes and for that I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting in this anime is really well done. Considering that the dialogues make up almost 90% of the anime, it really did a great job. I give the voice actors a thumbs up for being able to internalize not only the characters, but also the scene itself and also for being able to talk for like 20 minutes straight. In addition to that, Nisemonogatari actually has an opening, unlike its prequel. The OP is very nice actually, with a nice cheerful tone. Overall I give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Nisemonogatari are nothing that hasn\u2019t been shown in other animes. You can pretty much describe all of them in a simple phrase. There is the heroic \u2013but-peverted main character, miss tsundere, hentai underclassman, a spirit who is apparently going hiking, loli vampire, a shy type-girl, and two hot blooded sisters. Although the character designs can be quite clich\u00e9, they are by no means static. Each character has his or her own story, as well a certain depth. Since the entire anime is mostly about characters talking to each other, there is a lot of character development. Overall I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me, Nisemonogatari is more of a intellectual anime(?) wherein there are lots of debates that will make you think about your own opinion on the subject. Of course it is more of a comedy so most of the times these debates will often lead to laughter. I really enjoyed it, and of course, there are also some yummy fanservice here and there, although it may not be what you expect(ever got raped by a toothbrush?). Overall I give it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think that Nisemonogatari will either be a hit or a miss for your taste. If you are the kind of person who likes heated arguments, sensible debates, and long speeches then this anime is for you but if you have a phobia of long dialogues then steer away, you may not like it. I for one really liked this anime it can make you think, although not in a way like in Steins;gate wherein it just mindfucks you, but more of a question-what-you-believe-in or question-your-values type of make you think. It has also made me laugh, gave me a very weird boner left me wanting more when it ended. Overall I would give it a 9/10 for giving me a completely unique experience unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the entire review then please do post a comment on my page and give me some feedback. Thx :))\\n",

Based on the light novel Karen Bee and Tsukihi phoenix. The story is as unique as ever, with an \"unusual development\" between the siblings it'll surely make you go \"What the F***\". The story is as great as ever, showing the strong relationship between the Araragi siblings andhow much they depend on each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\\n\r\nShaft, has continued to uphold the weird animation style with hundreds of eye shots, and the abnormal sized rooms/back grounds. The character design are as amazing as ever with several changes to their appearances such as hair cuts, in certain scenes the detail (toothbrush scene) sets the mood and inhances the weird/awkward feelings you sometimes get when watching nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special, the thing that defines this anime isn't really the sound. But i guess one thing to look out for is that each main character that gets a story has its own opening and ending each matching the style of the character\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 \\n\\n\r\nWe see the return of the main characters from the last season such as Hitagi, Tsubasa and etc. Some have changed their appearances while their personality is still the same, but the relationship between the old characters and koyomi has gotten stronger showing more trust and etc. If you a massive fan of Shinobu like me, then guess what she finally speaks!!!!! Ka Ka. Nisemonogatari mainly shows the development Koyomi and his sisters, which was known in season 1 that they always fight, but like all family's Koyomi as the older brother has to look out for his sisters no matter what which leads to unusual developments, and strengthening of their relationship, and scenes that makes you basically go \"Aww, Good job Koyomi! thats a good answer\" or something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard not to enjoy a show like this, with many awkward scenes or weird rape scenes that make you go \"Ka Ka\". But as ever the dialogue coupled with the weird animation makes a great combination and draws you in to the anime as much as possible. This anime doens't contain a lot of fight scenes, but when it does your sure up for a hell of a show, with lots of gore. The thing i enjoyed the most in this anime was seeing Shinobu in her adult form/teenager form (hard to tell) =P\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a great successor of bakemonogatari with most of the good aspects of bakemonogatari applied in Nisemonogatari, One thing to note is that it is shorter, with less story rather than 5 stories this one has 2, but i guess the stories in this one is more developed and detailed. If your a fan of the Bakemonogatari series, then your up for one hell of a ride when you watch this.",

            "content": "Ah, Nisemonogatari.\r\nA sequel that kinda surprised me, because I don't expect that Monogatari has many series and this one had been released this year. Last year I watched Bakemonogatari then fortunately, Nisemonogatari released a few months later. Lucky me, hahaha. Then I immediately take a look at the synopsis. So, it's about Koyomi's sisters. Seems legit.\r\nI didn't really aware about the existence of Koyomi's sister though, but since I watched Nisemonogatari, I think they are very interesting. And now Araragi Karen even become my #1 favorite character, just because of this anime. The interaction between Koyomi and his sisters was always hilarious and fun towatch. Karen & Tsukihi are both annoying at first. Karen is a tomboy, Tsukihi is more girly but then some episodes revealed that she is actually quite sharp & sadist a.k.a yandere.\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing about this anime: fanservice. Yeah sure this anime is full of fanservice that make me bored when watching the first three episodes. But once again, some interesting dialogues and jokes can make me laugh sometimes. Many fanservice for Suruga, Mayoi, Nadeko, Tsubasa, and Hitagi's fans in the early episodes. I don't mind though, just a bit boring. By the way, Shinobu was really surprising here. In Bakemonogatari, she didn't said a single word, but in Nisemonogatari she was very talkative and a bit annoying. She's like a replacement for Meme who suddenly disappeared, so Koyomi can ask for advice to her. The only episode that can make me laugh hardly and enjoyed it at the same time is the legendary Episode 8 a.k.a \"Toothbrush rape episode.\" I never thought that toothbrushing your little sister can be that erotic. Yeah that must be just fantasy of the author, since I've read a comment from other forum user that have tried it to his little sister and then nothing happened. Hahaha, I laughed after reading that comment.. xD\\n\\n\r\nSecond, of course about the story. The main plot is about \"impostor\" that referred to Karen and Tsukihi. Both of them have something fake. Even Tsukihi is a \"fake\" little sister from the start. What did I mean by this \"fake\"? You'll find out after watching this anime. I don't want to post spoilers here. Nisemonogatari also introduced three new villains: Kaiki Deshu, Kagenui Yodzuru, and Ononoki Yotsugi. In \"Karen Bee\" arc, Kaiki played an important role for what happened on Karen. He also has his own reason for doing something evil. The reason was very realistic, you'll find out later. After Karen has been cured, she changed into an obedient little sister that will always ready to help her brother, because she was very grateful for being saved by him. This obedient attitude is the main cause of the toothbrushing scene . After that, the story focused immediately into Tsukihi's problems. That arc named \"Tsukihi Phoenix.\" Koyomi met Yodzuru and Yotsugi, the demon hunter who will exterminate Phoenix. Since Tsukihi have the Phoenix, Yodzuru ordered Yotsugi to attack Tsukihi. This led Koyomi to the \"battle\" with Yodzuru, and Shinobu fought Yotsugi. The villains \"defeated\" and walk out, Tsukihi still being herself. Karen? Guarding Araragi's house.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bam, the end. The ending was disappointing for me. That story \"end\" just like that is just... Still I have a big hope for next sequel, although the nearest release is Kizumonogatari (prequel of Bakemonogatari). If it's Monogatari series, I'll watch it for sure, because their \"character\" has gotten into me, LOL. And also, the OST was always good. Like the ED that sung by ClariS. I liked it. For the OP, I think Tsukihi arc's OP was better than Karen arc's.\\n\\n\r\nThe story-telling and character development was amazing, just like Bakemonogatari. The only thing I didn't like is the story that kinda too shallow and boring. Just chit-chat and it's all over. Need more action! By the way, about the artwork: it's even more amazing than Bakemonogatari. I really enjoyed every scene, especially when Karen was there, because her chara design was good. Cute face, nice expression, and slender body. Plus, Eri Kitamura played her voice really good! All of those awesomeness made me gave this anime an overall score of 9 instead of 8, hehehe.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that's all. When we talked about Monogatari series, we always talked about characters. That's why I liked the Monogatari series and will watch every title of them. If the story isn't good, doesn't matter, because once again, it's all about character. \\n\r\nYeah, CHARACTER rulez! ^^",

            "content": "The chronicle of Araragi Koyomi and his harem of supernatural girls have been influencing the anime industry since Bakemonogatari's release. While Bakemonogatari was a complete success, there were a number of hitches it had that prevented it from reaching its full potential. Animation cuts, frames with absolutely nothing during a key point (Nadeko snake fight?) in the story.  It was unfortunate it couldn't reach its full potential and take flight. I can securely say, Shaft has lived up to its expectations of clever dialog, multicolored characters, and wacky animation with Nisemonogatari.Nisemonogatari is an entertaining watch. The story is literally about almost nothing but the smallest of occurrences. This is due to the original source material, being entirely written for the authors own personal amusement. One episode is wholly about Araragi brushing his sister\u2019s teeth, and that's it. But remarkably, I never cease to have interest in what's going on. The story has a way of enveloping its finger around the viewer and immersing them in its tale of idiotic and amusing antics.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                          An example of this boarding on insane attitude and approach to storytelling, is meeting one of the main antagonists, right inside a donut shop. Wait, what are you doing here? To be fair, Kaiki was only attempting to enjoy his drink. Shaft has a weird sense of pace. It'll spend most of the episode on courage jokes (The courage to not give a fuck about pace!) just to get to the \"plot\" at the end. It's verging on asinine and impractical, but it works.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                           That's another important issue you want to take into consideration, the \"plot\". Yes, there is a ton of fan service. Final boss of the internet anyone? This is generally a fan service show. But it just so happens to be, an enjoyable beyond expectations and restrictions fan service show. From erotic twister to being inside your sister with a toothbrush, hell, even a Loli vampire that loves donuts! It's an entirely amusing show, whether anyone wants to argue if it's deep or not (HUR DUR DEEP DARKNESS) is another page in the great big book of fucking retards. \\n\\n\\n\r\n                  In my opinion, Shaft is a very good company when it comes to animation. No, I'm not a Shaftfag; I just particularly enjoy some of their shows. Back on track, the animation is literally out of this world. No I'm serious. It's like Shaft hired a group of children, drugged them with cocaine, gave them a box of 64 color crayons and told them to get to work. People are going to argue that the wacky and wild structures are \"deep\" or are a form of symbolism. Mistaken, they\u2019re simply there for the purpose of looking fucking cool, and to benefit the immersion of the world of Monogatari. Even Anno said the ton of religious symbols in Evangelion were only there, because he thought it looked cool.   \\n\\n\r\n                   Shaft has this weird plot device, where the only people in their universe are the actual main characters; you never see a single background character. It's very weird, but it's also very original. Interpret this how you wish.\\n\\n\r\n                    The OST spews directly from the fountain of fuck yeah, I am platinum mad about not being able to find Platinum Disco anywhere though. Each Op is catchy, each ED is catchy, and it\u2019s exactly what you would presume from a fucking show like this. \\n\\n\\n\r\n                       Araragi is the personification of a bad ass, sort of Dracula with an ahoge. Dare I say deconstruction of the harem genre main character? He has his girlfriend, but at the same time, runs all the other girls around his finger. Of course not on purpose, he's not a jerk with a capital fuck you. They all just crave his supernatural cock. He enjoys each of their company, and is not afraid to get his ass cut up into small pieces for their sake. Each girl is god tier, from his imouto's, the Fire Sisters, to Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade and her mister donut obsession, to his deconstruction of a tsundere girlfriend Senjougahara. They all have their quirks and crazy oddities that make them who they are, and I personally find them to be some of the most enjoyable characters in Anime today. \\n\\n\\n\r\n                   Yeah, sure this is fan service. But its enjoyment meter high rating compensates completely its lack of a solid story. But some of the greatest stories ever told, just so happen to be the simplest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari has the courage to be simple.\\n",

            "content": "~ I am Not a Friend of Justice... ~\r\nThe cryptic occult mysteries plaguing Araragi and those around him, continue into this second installment of the highly reputable \"Monogatari\" series...\r\nAs a chronological continuation of Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari is the controversial follow-up to significantly alter the production's overriding tone and focus. In the books of many \"Monogatari\" fans, there was little \"wrong\" with the first season; and so we turn to Nisemonogatari with hopes that it would principally further our knowledge, understanding, and in turn our admiration for the vivid and supernatural world that Bakemonogatari presented us with. While it appears to have retained the distinct presentation styleand curious atmosphere that the initial season adopted and shaped... Nisemonogatari seems to have upstaged (but by no means removed) the focus of \"overcoming personal demons\", to touch more on the delicate topic of morality: the concepts of evil and justice.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Nisemonogatari has stayed true to its branding by gracing us again with the brilliantly expressive and abstract presentation methods; exclusive to the \"Monogatari\" series. We are again plunged into a clean, colourful, well-defined, vivid, and yet minimalist-styled landscape. An establishment of atmospheric and otherworldly virtual lands; the epitome of surrealism. In this sense, Nisemonogatari retains the signature charm of the prior season: the entirety of the presentation is still very expressive, and it continues to make great use of text-based presentation, visual metaphors, and colours. A bold presentation style, with an overwhelming attention to detail; all while straying from being pretentious or preachy. I would in fact go as far as saying that presentation methods have actually improved on Bakemonogatari's high standards. You could say that the atmospheric and depth-inducing cinematic lighting, in combination with the interesting visual representations of the dialogue goes a step beyond; to really vividly and confidently bring meaning to the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nWhile finishing up interestingly beginning with the presentation methods; as they are of critical importance to the \"Monogatari\" franchise... I should also factor in Nisemonogatari's audio: a highly appropriate cinematic score that proves its ability to be delicate when necessary, mysterious and curiosity-invoking when necessary, and even intense towards the climax. I can therefore conclude that Nisemonogatari is pretty much flawless in the audiovisual department, and \"Monogatari\" fans will already be accustomed to these methods.\\n\\n\r\nContrasting however with the first season's nearer-balance between an engaging plot, and character development: the stand alone story behind Nisemonogatari is rather simplistic. We arrive again at the \"Monogatari\" scene of a realistic, and yet occult-influenced world, devoid of certainty. Alike in Bakemonogatari, this season also avoids directly explaining the plot elements: in a way that continuously taunts the viewer with distorted and/or metaphorical elaborations to keep them very curious and engaged.\\n\r\nIt revolves around Araragi's sisters: 2 sisters, 2 arcs, 2 plights, 1 problem-solving brother. I could explain each of these arcs in a single sentence, because Nisemonogatari biases quite noticeably away from story-telling complexity.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to the previous season, a lot of the substance behind the show is imbued into the dialogue. This means that once again we're subjected to a large amount of expressive, intimate, intellectual, and sometimes witty and charming dialogue. It's used throughout to indirectly refer to supernatural plot context and explanations, expression of the characters' feelings, and expression of Araragi's inner-thoughts. Therefore, we're revisiting Bakemongatari's well-crafted style of story-telling and development in which a symphony of vivid documentation and meaning in the dialogue is crucial.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me onto something that's accomplished quite well by Nisemonogatari's dialogue script: Character development. As is typical of an anime like this one where story isn't given the utmost priority, character development is more prominent ingredient. This is evident from the extent of crafting and development of Nisemonogatari's newly developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout these 11 episodes, we're familiarized with a few new faces. From Araragi's sisters: the often frustrated Tsukihi, and the energetic Karen. We even get some development of Shinobu, and her fluctuations between being quirky and playful, to knowledgeable and confident. There is still some building upon previously developed personalities, primarily Hachikuji; to an underwhelming extent if you were looking to build upon the entire cast of Bakemonogatari. There are indeed enough familiar faces to have \"Monogatari\" fans stick about, though Nisemonogatari is most definitely a separated-feeling addition of arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction of new characters has its benefits though. Kaiki is an antagonist among others, and he receives some particularly interesting development. He's a genuinely interesting new personality, whose logical, honest, and upfront to an overwhelming extent. Quite publicly he makes his richly corrupt, money-obsessed personality quite prominent, and this conflicts with how reasonable and humanly relatable he is; having been given an antagonistic role.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari is an example of slow pacing which builds up a variety of richly developed characters: Kaiki, Karen and Tsukihi being prime examples. While it's not the most extensive it or the plot could be, an interesting dialogue floods the limelight to keep things fresh. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I haven't accounted for all of the ultimately rather short expanse of episode-time...\\n\r\nSexual themes were not unheard of in Bakemonogatari, but Nisemonogatari as you might of heard takes this to a somewhat unreasonable and distracting extent. There's no doubt that the argument of \"fanservice or not?\" is fought by personal opinion, and i'm definitely not deterred by it... But when it comes to sacrificing the overall vividness of a great story and characters, I start to think otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari undoubtedly made the fanservice a little too blatant, and I found that besides still enjoying it, it detracted from the show's delicate themes of evil and justice. In this sense, it came across to me as two-faced, and to put it bluntly, this was an ultimately pointless aspect that consumed too much episode time for what it was worth. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result of this time-wasting, comes a few flaws that put this second installment, a little below the prior...\\n\\n\r\nFirst off: \"Struggle\". Unlike in Bakemonogatari, I continuously found myself a little disconnected from the severity of the sisters' plights. They were for the most part poorly elaborated upon, and as a result, there was no real sense of urgency or tragedy regarding the infliction of the supernatural beasts. In the first season, I can remember sympathizing with the supernatural victims, and I can recall a weighty atmosphere that mirrored the weight, urgency, and severity of their plights. Needless to say that Nisemonogatari was comparatively lacking in this department, and so it didn't bring about as much of a \"thriller\" or \"drama\" aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main point: Pacing. As a Slice of Life fan myself, i'm accustomed to slow pacing, and this didn't bother me. I happily accept the slow building and vivid development of the characters and context in Nisemonogatari, but it fluctuates and becomes uneven towards the conclusion. In the last 2 to 3 episodes, there is a notable upwards shift in speed that rushes through the interaction of 2 additional key antagonists, with an interestingly unclear sense of morality themselves.\\n\\n\r\nPrimarily for the subtle added development of both character and context, Nisemonogatari is a genuinely interesting sequel to Bakemonogatari. Given the extra time, and subduing the fanservice, it could have brought forth a lot more qualitative weight. I felt that it was a bit impersonal and lacked passionate expression, though it did bring about a lot of interesting new and substantial dialogue, which in turn aided my admiration of some of the characters through development.\\n\\n\r\nIt probably shouldn't have tried to cover such broad themes in the given time-scale, but Nisemonogatari is nevertheless another result of masterful presentation, and a great build up of spread development. Fans of Bakemonogatari should enjoy this expansion of context, even if they're divided by the initially mentioned shift in focus, and reallocation of ingredients.\\n\\n\r\n~ I am an Enemy of Evil... ~",

            "content": "In this review I am going to focus on the factor of enjoyment the anime provides to me and how the stylistic devices\r\nsupport it and besides the little differences to Bakemonogatari. I'm also trying to avoid any spoilers.\r\nNisemonogatari, the sequel to Bakemonogatari, comes along with the same successive ingredients which made its prequel so entertaining and popular among many animefans.\r\nAraragi Koyomi is still presented as the protagonist, but instead of the main interaction with Senjougahara, she stays a bit more in the background as well as the other characters like Hachikuji, Kanbaru, Nadeko or Tsubasa.\r\nThis provides the space to show the relationship between Koyomiand his younger sisters Karen and Tsukihi.\\n\r\nThe narrator employed in Nisemonogatari is none other than the protagonist Koyomi who is, of course, limited in his knowledge.\\n\r\nWe only get to know his thoughts and feelings which are presented in quick, but very interesting interior monologues.\\n\r\nThe dialogues between the characters are still THE core of the Anime. You may need subtitles which explain some Japanese\\n\r\npuns etc. to understand particular jokes to get the full enjoyment, though.\\n\r\nAdditionally the conversations get well supported by excellent camera adjustments (can you even say that in case of Anime? I do not know at all xD ) like good close ups at tense scenes and superbly choosen camera angles to emphasize the hierarchy of the participants of one of these conversations, for example.\\n\r\nThe artstyle doesn't really differ from Bakemonogatari. The characters are well-drawn, as well as the partly minimalistic abstract backgrounds. The backgrounds are a question of taste I think, but I like them a lot.\\n\r\nFurthermore the ecchiness increased a lot compared to Bakemonogatari and contributes to the enjoyment as well, if it does\\n\r\nnot bother you too much.\\n\r\nLast but not least I have to mention the philosophical question, or if you want message, in this Anime: Does an original have a greater amount of worth than an undistinguishable clone or fake? (even in the case of a human being) \\n\r\nIn the end there are 3 answers given by 3 different characters in the anime which makes one think/consider about what they just said. This was the part I liked the most and is one of the best parts in a frequently released show I watched so far.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it is an entertaining show it's not like that Nisemonogatari is one of the best shows I've ever seen or anything.\\n\r\nIt is fun to watch and it has its good moments, but sometimes it is weaker than the prequel and just above average.\\n\r\nBut you will have your fun while watching if you like this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you liked my review (it's my first one though^^\") and I could make you watch this anime.\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\r\nSincerly, Akira.",

            "content": "--- WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A KAREN BEE SPOILER! ---\r\nDespite not particularly liking its prequel (Bakemonogatari), I still decided that I would like to watch Nisemonogatari. You could say that there\u2019s an unspoken rule that whenever you start a franchise you should finish it - one of the main reasons why I decided not to watch Shakugan no Shana quite yet. There was also the fact that I was excited to finally see Tsukihi and Karen Araragi. \r\nDo not be surprised if you read the same things that where in my Bakemonogatari review. I\u2019m not sure if someone told me that this is better thanthe first, but in reality, I found it worse. \\n\r\n(Note: my review\u2019s structure will be a little different from the norm: plot, characters, art, sound, enjoyment.)\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode started out great. Araragi had gone to see Nadeko, but along the way encountered Hachikuji and thus made a little detour. Of course, as always, he was primarily focused on his mounting desire to see her underpants. While our MC spends some time with my favourite character holding handstands for longer than I, a gymnast as of 6 years, can do, Nadeko dresses a little sluttier than usual in order to impress Araragi and support the harem genre. The whole time they spend together is full of unneeded sexual undertones such as the classic story of playing twister in revealing clothes. When he goes off to see yet another member of the female cast, Sugura, the latter takes the opportunity to strip and so Araragi finds her still in a state of undress. When he\u2019s heading back, he encounters Hitagi, who takes the opportunity to try and act all tsundere are usual but instead comes of as as yandere. We then discover that Tsubasa has cut her hair. \\n\r\nWhy am I telling you this? Because these events are happening in the time which is SUPPOSED to be the Karen Bee arc, but instead tastes overwhelmingly of filler. This personal synopsis is pretty much what happens during the whole anime.\\n\r\nWhen it is just about to say that it is possible to say that the anime resumes on it\u2019s predetermined track, pretty much nothing happens. Once again, we confronted with a plethora of flashbacks to explain the situation, and confronted with the aftermath. We meet the sole villain yet, who is extremely stereotypical. The whole episode when our main characters are dealing with the wreathe fire bee is actually just dialogue and Kaiki going out of character in such a brisk way that I was left dumbfounded - and not in a good way. \\n\r\nOur conclusion? Barely there - we find out a bit of Hitagi\u2019s life and then the lovely Karen Araragi returns to normal all by herself.\\n\r\n{[Repeat pretty much the same events for Tsukihiki Phoenix]}\\n\r\nWe also have the issue of it being, all of a sudden, fan-service laden. Maybe it is not explicitly naked girls (albeit thanks to Suruga there is a bit of that too), but the whole thing is absolutely full to the brim with sexual references, undertones, etc. The only way to describe these, apart from \u2018disgusting' is just \u2018ridiculous\u2019. Since bashing my head against my table is reserved solely for soppy romance, I found myself numerous times leaning back in my chair, rolling my eyes and sighing \"By God.\u201d Thank got there was no one in my room to see what the subtitles read, or perhaps they would have questioned what I was watching. The genre of \u2018Ecchi\u2019 is well deserved, though I would also add \u2018Harem\u2019.\\n\r\nSecondly, whilst I KNOW that this is in the genre of supernatural, some elements which are linked more tightly to real life just cannot be supernatural. For instance, cutting all your hair with a key (I highly doubt this is possible), kicking someone so that they fly five metres back, or smashing walls when someone gets knocked into them. \\n\r\nTo conclude on this, the characters also broke the fourth wall a number of times - not as much as in Bakemonogatari, but nevertheless a notable amount. This could perhaps include the continuation of the random, often long bits of text that flash on the screen along with the classic 'Black - unnumbered cut', inserts of real life photography and way too many cutscenes. I give the story element a \u20184\u2019 because  it was even more painstakingly, tear-jerkingly slow, bland and disappointing than Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that the main flaw with Nisemonogatari, along with it\u2019s almost non-existent plot, is the characters. The characters were no longer quirky but stale and stereotypical. Araragi was no longer a character who could be enjoyed in spite of his Gary Stu-ness, but a full-fledged Gary Stu who is in peak form. In fact, he\u2019s almost as bad as the king of all Gary Stus, Kirito (SAO), except that he is not all that strong. Females, including his own sisters are drawn to him like moths to a bulb. He is al of a sudden also naive (not exactly, but this adjective is the most fitting) to the point of tears. Whenever someone says something that is obviously a joke, or do something strange, a loud VoiceOver will express his feelings of shock. For instance: Hachikuji continues her antics of mispronouncing Araragi\u2019s name, and he will call her out on it. However, upon her second time of insisting that she merely stuttered, Araragi will exclaim something like \u201cShe really did?!\u201d in a very annoying fashion. \\n\r\nHitagi\u2019s character also took a turn for the worse. It seems the producers are trying much too hard to insist on the fact that she is a tsundere. I wonder if they know what the term means? Tying someone up with five handcuffs on every hand to a pile of chair and threatening to kill anyone who puts them in danger is a YANDERE characteristic. To be truthful, she acts like a cross between a yandere and a kuudere. \\n\r\nThe other characters did not change too much, so I don\u2019t have much complaints on them. Shinobu\u2019s promised role of a main characters was not fulfilled. \\n\r\nI give characters a \u20185\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe art continues in the same style as Bakemonogatari - typical Shaft. The art and animation is okay, I guess, but we still have the trademark weird, depressing colours, inserts of real life photography, really weird 'camera' angles and cutscenes which are supposed to indicate the feelings of Araragi but are just confusing instead. Nevertheless, art is enjoyable enough, and apart from the things I just listed, I pretty much liked it, though it is not my favourite art style by any means.\\n\r\nArt gets a \u20187\u2019 - same as Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another thing that didn\u2019t really change. It was a little weird, such as sudden inserts of classical music, and a lot of the themes, although nice, were very repetitive. I didn\u2019t really notice as much music, and personally, I didn\u2019t find the tracks as nice, though the tracks didn't feel as much out of place as before. \\n\r\nIn my subjective opinion, the quality, amount and enjoyment that I got out of the music went down. Thus, I give it \u20186.5\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Nisemonogatari much less than Bakemonogatari. Whilst my expectations had already been lowered thanks to the first title, I was further disappointed. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I\u2019m just not seeing what everyone likes in this anime, because otherwise I don\u2019t know how it got such a high score. I\u2019ve just got to hope that everything drastically improves in Monogatari Second Season or I just might drop it - I\u2019m not going to watch another 26 episodes of something this quality. \\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a \u20184.5\u2019\\n\\n\r\nTo finish up:\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.4/10 (rounded to a 5)\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAs usual, please leave a comment on my review so that I can improve the quality of my reviews!",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is an adequate sequel series to Bakemonogatari. If Bakemonogatari would be described as a world building arc of the Monogatari series, Nisemonogatari would be a character building arc. \r\nBakemonogatari was a series that spent 4-5 episodes introducing a character and resolving their issues. This not only served to introduce the characters, but it established the rules of the world. It established what kinds of things existed and how to deal with them. Nisemonogatari takes a completely different approach. It spends most of its episodes just putting characters together without conflict and letting us watch how they interact. This serves a dual purpose of buildingthe character\u2019s relationships while we simultaneously get to know them better without overtly done exposition. I thought it was pretty well done, elegantly even. After that there's a couple of episodes of conflict similar to a regular arc from Bakemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\nExecution-wise it is the exact same as Bakemonogatari. I LOVE the directing style and shot composition. I'm also still a pervert so I loved the fan service as well. My only comment on the fan service is that there is about 10 times more incest in this than in Bakemonogatari. Whether or not that is a bad thing is up to you. It is a perfect continuation from Bakemonogatari in this aspect. You can read my review of Bakemonogatari for context; but in short, I've only ever given two 10's in art and this is one of them.  \\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari does exactly what I would have wanted it to, as you can read in my Bakemonogatari review. It was great, and a definite must watch for the Monogatari series. \\n",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first review so I'm going to try and make this right.  Forgive any spelling mistakes please, as I type too fast for my keyboard to register.  There are very minimal spoilers in this, I will not reveal the plot though, so need not worry about that.\r\nOKAYSO:\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story of Nisemonogatari is unlike any other that I have ever seen.  There are also many cultural differences that are incorporated into Nisemonogatari, and some of them are hard to pick up if you're a westerner such as I am.  The major one being incest, this anime has an almostpornographic incestuous sense of humour.  I have talked multiple times with friends who live in Japan, and they seem to find it funny while others may find it appalling.  That being said, if you're highly disheartened by such themes, then this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a huge amount of fanservice involved in Nisemonogatari.  Naturally if you're watching this, then 99% of you should have seen the prequel called \"Bakemonogatari\".  If not, then completely ignore this anime until you have, otherwise you will not get the same enjoyment that I did.\\n\\n\r\nNisio Isin is a storytelling genius, there are plenty of amazing dialogues and if you're a fan of witty arguments, then look no further than Nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n This is the most beautiful anime that I have ever laid eyes on, because SHAFT once again provides us with mind-tripping scenic masterpieces to go along with the banter, and you'll find yourself getting lost within the scenes and such.  The artwork also has it's little trademarks that you will notice throughout watching, such as people twisting their heads as they talk and the famous \"black screen\" slide that was commonly found in Bakemonogatari.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n I had no quirks with the sound of this anime, the opening themes always had a nice ring to them and blended well with the artwork.  The ED is addicting, though not to the point that Kimi No Shiranai was in Bakemonogatari.  I think they did a great job with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the many annoyances in various characters, there is one who makes up for them all.  Senjougahara is a goddess, a truly inspiring character who cannot be compared to any other character in any other anime.  I'm probably going to get a lot of negative votes for saying that, but it needed to be said.  Every time she came on the screen and had one of her mindless banters with Araragi, I became so engrossed in the anime that I couldn't' blink even if I wanted to.  Anyone who has watched Bakemonogatari can relate to this, surely.  Treasure her moments, as there are not as many as I would have hoped.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis would have definitely been a 10, but I am very against incest and there were a few scenes that made me feel uncomfortable.  That's my personal opinion, take it or leave it.  Everything else was spot on amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you can overcome the uncomfortable moments, then this anime is a masterpiece in every which way shape or form.  I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who loves character development, and does not place huge value on flashy fight scenes that drone on and on.  Go watch it if you haven't already!\\n\\n",

            "content": "To put things in perspective, I could summarize all of the story in all 11 episodes in a single paragraph, and still not spoil the show for you. This isn't really an exaggeration; quite a number of episodes have nothing to do with the plot of the Karen Bee and Tsukihi Phoenix arc, and those that does are mostly filled with dialogue, Nisio Isin style. Leaning on Bakemonogatari's success, I suppose Shaft realized that the fans don't need the story; they want the beautiful synergy between the animating genius of Shinbo and creative narrative of Nisio Isin.\r\nSo I've gotta say, if it's the story you'relooking for, you're in for a disappointment. The length of the story itself is one thing, but the endings to the two arcs are extremely anti-climatic. And I could also draw a lot of similarities from the arc endings in Bakemonogatari, too. There is actually a single moment where I find our protagonist Koyomi really cool, but other than that, there's not much to offer in this area.\\n\\n\r\nSo in place of story, what did we get? Lots and lots of fan-service. In fact, fan-service is the answer to the question in the post title. The scenes above are just a small bit of what you'll expect in the show, and the amount is outrageous enough to spawn the term \"pornomonogatari\" (I can't remember where I've heard this term, though).\\n\\n\r\nDepending on your tastes, the fan-service can be quite a treat. Unlike the blatant in-your-face fan-service of Queen's Blade and Qwaser no Seikon (which I met with disgust), Nisemonogatari has been very... clever in their deliverance. A lot of them does this without even stripping the clothes of the females; a style I would like to call \"suggestive fan-service\"; and the infamous episode 8 is a good example of that. I actually think that Nisemonogatari is a bid for Shinbo to see how much of his creative juice he can work into this \"suggestive fan-service\", and judging from its reception, there's no doubt it worked.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, like some of the others, I can't hide that I find the show pretty objectionable. It feels that the direction of the show implies that it's totally okay for Koyomi flirting around and groping other girls while actually remaining faithful to his girlfriend. Kanbaru actually has no problem being naked in front of a guy, and Hachikuji actually wants to be groped? Well, at least that's a far cry from the fact that Koyomi actually did kiss both his sisters, groped one of them (without consequences) and (suggested that he) went too far with the other. Not that I don't get the thing Japanese people had for incest forbidden love, but what feels wrong is that all of these seemed completely normal in the show. Perhaps they wanted the controversy to be part of how unique Nisemonogatari is, but come on, if these are true, I'm returning to Japan and never coming back.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, Shaft delivered entertainment that probably only KyoAni's over-budgeted productions can hope to match. I feel like such a sheep for liking a fan-service anime, but Shaft can shut up and take my money.",

            "content": "\"Normally you only need to know what's happening on stage. That's how reality works.\"\r\nFollowing the commercial success of Bakemonogatari came the anime adaptation of the next chapter in Nisio Isin's light novel series, in the form of Nisemonogatari. This is the direct sequel to Bakemonogatari, and takes place some time after the events of Bakemonogatari. As one character pointed out, \"Add too many members, and the story will be hard to follow.\" While there are some new additions to the cast, the majority of the series is centered on familiar faces. In this season, Koyomi's two sisters, the cheerful tomboy-ish Karen and the delicate butshort-tempered Tsuhiki take the spotlight from their previous positions as minor background characters. The \"fire sisters\" become the main focus, although it is well blended with the other heroines from Bakemonogatari, who are still involved but take a backseat in this series.\\n\\n\r\nIf Bakemonogatari were to be considered the main act, then Nisemonogatari is the supporting act that plays on the previous, although that isn't to say one or the other is superior. It's a matter of taste, as the general theme and styles viewers were familiar with are still there, although there are some changes that may or may not be pleasing to you. Although the two sisters are the main focus, we also see familiar faces in various scenes. The series plays on the old interactions with the addition of time to the character's relationships. They are more familiar with one another and their interactions seem a bit smoother to me. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the Araragi siblings, there are a few more new faces to the scene, who bring with them different perceptions on life and justice, which act as a foil to one another, which really highlights the distinctions between each character's outlook on life. While the fire sisters believe themselves to uphold justice, Kaiki is in a whole different class. He could be seen as cruel or evil, but in his mind, he doesn't really belong in the spectrum of good or evil. What he believes in, is only money, and that is the only absolute. I found it to be a very refreshing take on a villain; while it brings in the argument of what is justice and evil, it was also an adult, or maybe pessimistic outlook. The way that the matter was solved was different to most confrontations, and that was also nice, although it might have been a little disappointing to some.\\n\\n\r\nOne major difference I noticed was an increase in fanservice. Although I was fine with it most of the time, it was a little distracting during moments of intense dialogue or plot moments. It did however lead to numerous hilarious sequences so I'm not really sure what to say. I think it would have been better if there was a bit more moderation, as sometimes it just felt excessive. It does show you a bit more about how the characters interact with one another though, such as their toleration or confidence (or lack of it) in themselves or others. This might be a love it or hate it aspect, but I think many viewers out there will enjoy it a bit. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: As a series by Studio Shaft, the animation is very well done. This series in particular was stunning, in my opinion. The animation was smooth and colorful. Each background brings in a different mood or setting, it looks sort of unreal how simple, mundane backgrounds could be made to look unique, from a whole city street or even a regular bathroom. Unlike Bakemonogatari, I felt a spike in animation quality and visuals, as colors just seems to leap off and actions just seems so crisp and clean. One example of this could be seen in the second opening theme of the three in the series. Shaft has its own style and quirks and they ran free in this anime, which I loved. \\n\\n\r\nSound and sound: Solid in every aspect, background tones suited the mood very well and complemented what was going on during the moment. Similar to Bakemonogatari, this series had various opening themes with their own different style and singers, for Senjougahara, Karen, and Tsukihi, in that order. I thought they were all good in their own way, with Karen's being my favorite of the 3, although I do like how cute Tsukihi's theme was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this series, with each episode ending in what felt like only minutes. It mixes together great, witty dialogue with a good amount of action and character interactions and, haha, some fanservice thrown in for good measure, although it is done tastefully.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is a direct sequel of Bakemonogatari, and it tells the story of Koyomi Araragi's Siters, Karen and Tsukihi. \r\nStrory-10\r\nNisemonogatari has more focus with the story same as Bakeomonogatari because of its toned down editing and it helps shines the characters and the ongoing story. Well now i give it a 10 why?, because the story focuses a lot more on the actual storyline. I know there is a bunch of fanservice everywhere...but that's make a major character development. As you can see, i can't stop waiting for the next episode of this series because of the plot that makes me interesting to watch ittwice.Nisemonogatari focused more on Kare Bee which has 7 part, and it gives us a lot of background on Koyomi Araragi's personal life with his little sister(imouto), and it become quite emotional. After that the Tsukihi Arc that tells the other Araragi's sister also intresting, there is a new interesting characters and the story itself become more interesting as some . Yeaah this is a perfect monogatari!!\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nC'mon it's SHAFT!!, and they make another unique art for this franchise. So it's no doubt that this anime franchise has the perfect art and it looks beeatiful and original.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nOhh yeaah the sound...it is really catchy and very unforgettable. For Example, Karen Op was really energetic and interesting, you will hear that opening again and again, and i give it an 10 again..because every sound of the BGM feels right at the moment. The BGM has some variation and not repetitive. As for the new Tsukihi OP is very cute,oriental and original....The ending by CLARiS also great like The ending of Bakemonogatari by Supercell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10\\n\r\nAs i say in the story part, the character has more development. We can see the previous character like Senjougahara, and the others. But the real character development is for the fire sisters.The best is Koyomi's sisters make a unique and complex personalities.But it's too bad that the other character such as Nadeko Sengoku doesn't get too much development in the series, but her personalitites is alrady explained in Bakemonogatari. As you can see, you have to watch Bakemonogatari to understand every part of the character explanation, so you wont get bother with it and you will enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nOhh man..this is the best anime story i ever seen, the character,the humor, the art, and every part of it is so enjoyable and very great.I guarantee if you watch Bakemonogatari and continue with watching 4 episodes of Nisemonogatari, you will addicted to the series, you will be asking more and more, and you always waiting for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -10\\n\r\nHell yeaah!!! it's a perfect Anime series,if you watch Bakemonogatari and continue to this series i bet you will think the same with me. The fanservice it's not ordinary, it's unique and yeah NisiOisin's literary versatility had continued to amaze me with Nisemonogatari. I can't wait to review the movie of the franchise,Kizumonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review...i hope this review will help you and sorry for my bad english XD..\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is part of the most favorited series; The Monogatari series. This Anime is extremely brilliant with many highs and very enjoyable for any Anime viewer.\r\nStory: The story picks up slightly differently than before. In Bakemonogatari the main cycle of the story is about Koyomi Araragi helping out random people he encounters and they are in need of getting rid of apparitions(deities, ghosts, etc). But now it's different. Koyomi is helping out his sisters instead to whom they also have issues of apparitions. We also meet two antagonists along the way; Deshu Kaiki and Yozuru Kagenui. What makes the plot more troublesome is that Koyomicannot have assistance from Oshino(the expert of apparitions) anymore because Oshino has already left the city. Koyomi is now faced with the issue of saving his sisters head on by himself. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The Animation is quite beautiful and amazing. This Anime is a perfect example of what some studios need to take notice of. Studio Shaft did an excellent job at creating this artwork of an Anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I've really never noticed anything significant about the sound. I do however enjoyed the opening and ending songs that appeared in this Anime and I do love the fact that this Anime has different openings and endings so you'll never know what to expect. Overall the sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character Koyomi Araragi really just a very cliche character however that is not a bad thing. In fact those type of characters really fit quite well with Anime's like this and shows us that caring for family and friends is the most important part of life and we should always lend a helping hand. Many female characters(and yes you will encounter a lot of them) are always attracted to Koyomi. Even his sisters. Don't get me wrong, this Anime isn't about incest but more of the lines of strong love in family. Koyomi's sisters(known as the Fire Sisters) are quite the characters indeed. Karen the middle child is one of my favorite characters in this series mainly because of her athletic ability in fighting and she is very hot tempered sometimes. Tsukihi the youngest is the more delicate type. She is very graceful and acts quite lady-like compared to Karen. Now let's discuss about the two so called antagonist in this Anime. The first antagonist we meet is a con-artist named Deishu Kaiki. Kaiki pretends to be an expert of apparitions and cons people(preferably little kids). Yozuru Kagenui is our second antagonist who has issues with one of Koyomi's sisters and would stop at nothing to do what she calls \"the right thing\". \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: I really enjoyed this Anime far too much. I loved every single bit of what the Anime had to offer like the toothbrush scene(which was very random) and it got me hooked on the Monogatari series from here on out. I would strongly recommend this Anime to anyone. Yes this Anime has fan service but if you can look pass on that this is truly one heck of an Anime.",

            "content": "This review is brought to you by Mister Donut(R)\r\nNisemonogatari is the sequel series to the Bakemonogatari series. This installment largely retains the same artstyle and art direction as the previous series, so I won't be going through them here. Instead, I will discuss on the other elements of Nisemonogatari.\r\nNisemonogatari focuses on Araragi's 2 sisters, both of which make up for the main focus of each half of the series. Unlike Bake, each episode does not focus exclusively on each sister, instead taking time to reintroduce previous characters. However, Nise does not handle this quite elegantly, aside from Senjougahara, most of the other characters reintroduce areunneeded and feel like unnecessary padding to lengthen the series. It's filler and at times it's quite uncomfortable to see Araragi act in a flanderized manner than his previous incarnation in Nise. \\n\\n\r\nThe two sisters aren't nearly as interesting as the previous cast. Both of them being fairly annoying and one of the most difficult moments to sit through in the whole anime were the awful brother-sister almost-incest moments in the series which just panders to the creepy fans who enjoy this sort of nonsense. The justifications for these moments are cringe-worthy (but one near the end is so bad it's hilarious). These scenes are completely unnecessary and add nothing to the whole story while alienating viewers who just want to enjoy a simple comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fanservice, the whole series is rifle with unnecessary sequences of fanservice. To the point where it becomes very uncomfortable to watch. This reviewer personally couldn't stand Episode 4 of the series at all due to the absolute vacuousness of the whole episode in question. It's absolutely disgusting and borders on Hentai. While Bake did have its fair share of fanservice, they were mostly brief and didn't interrupt the pacing of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNise's strongest point that differs it from Bake has to be it's two newly introduced characters, Kaiki and Kagenui. While Meme's absence from the series is felt early on by the viewer, these two make really interesting adversaries to Araragi and Friends but are characterized and written so well that any scene where they appear in is a joy to behold. Arguments between them and Araragi are especially fun to watch, though Araragi's childish and immature delusions can get the better of the scene and make certain scenes cringe-worthy to sit through. Still, Kaiki and Kagenui (Kaiki especially due to a larger presence) are easily the best characters in the series, largely due to at times rather clever dialogue that don't wear out their welcome. Indeed, the adult characters in the Monogatari series are very much some of the best characters in the franchise. (then again there's origami man from Tsugimonogatari, but that's for another review)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Nisemonogatari is not worth being a worthy successor to Bakemonogatari. However, of one decides to watch this series, this reviewer would recommend that one skips the first few episodes of each half, at least until the respective antagonist of each half is introduced.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nAll this reviewing is making me hungry, good thing Mister Donut(R) is having a \u00a5100 sale this week!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Cliffnotes for this review: if you haven't seen Bakemonogatari, go watch that, then move onto Nisemonogatari before the fever wears off. If you have seen Bake, Nise is more of the same with triple fanservice.\r\n(Eps seen: 7/11)\r\nNisemonogatari, like its forebear, Bakemonogatari, tends to cast a charm on you. So far, I've really been enjoying this, but more in a guilty fanservice way than anything else.\r\nFor the uninitiated, Nisemonogatari is essentially a bunch of dialog set to different, stylized backgrounds. Usually they are talking about supernatural curses that beautiful local girls tend to fall prey to, and then they help that person in some semi-shintoey way.Due to the dialog based storytelling, very little would be lost in the plot if this were a book-on-tape as opposed to an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork itself is stunningly pretty, but I feel at this point that it's just going through the motions. Every female character in the series leans waaaaaaay back and stretches out her neck sexily in the midst of normal conversation. (Why? Because the animators think chin-shots are hot!) What was edgy and breathtaking in Season 1 is now just ho-hum. It feels like they stopped taking chances, except for the sake of making anime-references (which are awesome when you get it) The animation as a whole has gotten so stylized and choppy that it feels more like flipping through a nudie-magazine whilst listening to that book on tape than watching an anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Nisegatari is one of those animes where I would slam my laptop shut if anyone walked in the door. Bakegatari, on the other hand, is not. While Bakegatari readily addresses the cast's raging hormones (who doesn't appreciate a grope or two?) Nisegatari often borders on soft porn.\\n\\n\r\nAll those criticisms aside, the character development in this series is enthralling, mostly because Bakemonogatari already did the footwork to make you love them. (I just don't like Araragi's sisters. I don't really know them from the more demure Bakegatari and they just aren't working for me under Nisegatari's hyper-sexualized lens)\\n\\n\r\nFor all the other characters in Araragi's harem, my response is a deep, bellowing, YES! They all develop, change, and show other facets of themselves, all while the camera flashes back and forth between their boobs and upskirt views.\\n\\n\r\nI must also mention that the sound has improved in this iteration. Bakemonogatari's music was so quirky that it got repetitive quite quickly. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, I really like this, in the way I liked Higurashi-Rei, as fluffy bonus material. It didn't really hit the mark for me as a sewwious continuation of the original, despite it's attempts to do so.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Bake, watch Nise. If you hated Bake, skip this, you're not missing much. If you didn't watch Bake, go do it because absolutely nothing will make sense in Nise.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari was a great addition to an already phenomenal series, but with too much unnecessary fluff. I was inspired by a friend to try and figure out exactly what it is about the season that felt weak to me, so I guess I'm writing a review.\r\nThe arcs themselves were relatively interesting. Karen\u2019s arc was lacking any real supernatural oddities, but that was okay because it expanded deeply on the universe, including the introduction of Kaiki, and fleshing out of Koyomi\u2019s sisters and the previously stoic and silent Shinobu. There was actually a lot of content there, but I think seven episodes was a little much.\r\nTsukihi\u2019sarc is a little more refined in its length than Karen Bee, but somehow manages to feel even more lacking in content. We find out a huge detail about Tsukihi, but when all is said and done, it\u2019s really of no consequence. A couple new characters are introduced, but one is never seen or heard from again*, and the other doesn\u2019t really add much to this arc one way or another.\\n\r\n*Edit: she does appear, but VERY far down the road, and frankly could still be substituted by any other exposition character such as Meme (who I would much rather see again) or Izuko.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of Tsukihi Phoenix contains no real plot development, instead focusing almost entirely on what could be described as an erotic toothbrushing scene. And you know what? I loved that episode. But it was just another blip on the radar showing a trend I noticed throughout the season. There was just too much fan service.\\n\\n\r\nI think blending fan service in with all of the other elements is one of the things that makes the Monogatari series shine as an anime. A little fan service is great, in the right time and place, but Nisemonogatari just seems to take it too far. A loli panty-flashing Koyomi, Koyomi bathing with a loli, sister-on-sister yuri, a girl molesting Koyomi, a middle school girl trying to seduce a clueless Koyomi... These are just a few things on the list, and I\u2019m pretty confident that no other season has had quite this density of lewd material. I don't know if this was Nisio Isin getting a little overzealous, or if Shaft was taking too many liberties, but it's definitely there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters introduced were mostly okay. Kaiki is perhaps my favorite character, with his charismatic lack of regard for morals which he backs up with clever wordplay. Karen has a deceptively deep personality profile, and is a loveable addition to the lineup of female characters. Tsukihi is a little shallow as a character. It feels like her only traits are her yandere tendencies and devout following of her sister. I don\u2019t love Shinobu the same way a lot of the fandom does, but she is certainly an interesting character, and an adequate replacement for Meme.\\n\\n\r\nMonogatari is my favorite anime series, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t criticize it. Nisemonogatari had better philosophical dialog, character development, and art design you could expect to find in any other medium, but it still has its faults. I don't really like to give \"scores,\" but let's put it this way: Assuming I\u2019m only allowed to give Bakemonogatari and Monogatari Series Second Season a 10 at the most, Nisemonogatari would probably get a 9. It's a great show, but the shoes it had to fill were just one size too big.",

            "content": "Before watching this series, it's pretty helpful to watch the first season, Bakemonogatari. Otherwise all the old characters' acquaintance with Koyomi won't be as understood, but they're not the focus of the story. His two little sisters are going to be the heart of the story. That being said, people who like Bakemongatari will almost certain like Nisemonogatari.\r\nA short idea of what the Monogatari series is about is a mystery comedy and a \"light\" harem with a clear winning girl. A majority of the characters are girls that are afflicted with the supernatural, and the main character just so happens to have Chronic Hero Syndromewhere he has to save every girl that has these problems. Saving the girls are the mysteries and most conversations are comedic acts.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts in medias res, where the main character is being held by his slightly psycho girlfriend with little explanation other than a promise from the last season that she would always protect him. From there, it goes back to the start of his summer vacation antics with various girls. The story is a lot of thinking and exchanges of thoughts as most mysteries are, but there's a lot of comedy thrown in. There is also a big bad that was absent from the first season and will start to explain more of the world the main character has to take care of.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is a very different style. It's extremely stylized like an art student messing around with raster layering and 3D cell shading. Aside from the characters, the backgrounds and objects in the story are all purely computer generated graphics that are heavily stylized. The colors are often very contrasting and have lots of empty space or clutter with weird objects. The environment can often be exaggerated and pretty surreal in its nature. There are no background characters, ever. The art serves to isolate the world that the main character and everyone around him lives him, and it really creates a different atmosphere. The art has been a departure from characteristic animes but done perfectly. There are also various scenes that simply shows a color and the background in that color that help set up the mood. These things may not normally be your cup of tea, but this is all about creating the atmosphere for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really what make the story. Each important character has an affliction with some sort of supernatural being (all animals minus the main character, who is a Vampire and the king of the Supernatural). The main character's job is to free each of these girls of their supernatural problems that usually stem from internal desires that they don't like to admit. None of the girls are truly alike. Each character is deeply explored throughout the story and generally saved when they grow in character. They all have huge emotional burdens that are amplified by the supernatural and must overcome with the help of the main character.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a lot of talk, extremely stylized art, and a deep, rich story, this is a series you should watch. If you watched Bakemonogatari, then you should expect the same girls to be running around Koyomi except that Oshino is no longer with him. There's also much more fanservice starting in the second episode. Either way, this is a great series everyone should watch.",

Why am I watching this?\r\nIs it the girls?\r\nIs it the story?\r\nOr is it because something else?\r\nI don't know!\r\nNisemonogatari is a very special anime, when you watch it you get a feeling of emptiness,  and that something ''strange'' is happening. And you really can't explain what is happening.\r\nStory:\r\nThis is a sequel to SHAFT's famous ''Harem'' anime (if I really can call it that).\r\nAfter Bakemonogatari finished a lot of questions was left out. And this is the countinuation of that story.\r\nYou have the main character Araragi who is a vampire or half(I really don't understand that). Who has to helpwhoever is in trouble, even thought he doesn't know that person.\\n\r\nThe story isn't all that complicated. But that isn't why this anime is as special as it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters in this anime is females and the last one is a male.\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime isn't something you haven't seen in other animes. But everyone is quite likeable, and SHAFT does a fine job trying to make you care about the different characters.\\n\r\nAnd it's how the characters interact with each other that makes this so special, and how they handle the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nArt and soundtrack:\\n\r\nSHAFT really does get the viewer to feel strange when your watching something they make. And that's because what happens around the characters and the areas they make is very special.\\n\r\nIt feels like your watching in another dimension, where all strange things happens and has no meaning.\\n\\n\r\nI really like SHAFT and how they make anime's. It always feels fresh and so does this! And all their anime's have a different feel to one another.\\n\r\nWhile I didn't find the prequel (Bakemonogatari) all that amazing in the end! This has really has really caught my interest!\\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying that because of all the fan-service it provides.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, but i've read plenty of good and bad review so this should be quite accurate. \r\nThe thing that pushed me to write a review was to clear misconceptions about this show. Apparently many people believe that this show is just about fanservice, when in reality, there is not nearly the amount of fanservice you would see in the typical anime. No, this story series deals with the more or less taboo subjects or moral dilemmas that trouble people everyday. So, on with the full review:\r\nStory: First and foremost, this show is put in the slow-paced category, and that means itis SLOW PACED, so don't expect huge plot developments, that's not the point of the show. Like i said before, this series focuses on themes and morals that not many people are willing to go too deep in. Bakemonogatari was split into 4 different arcs focusing on four different characters the main character helps. The way this series is laid out is that it uses supernatural events and problems (like a curse that makes you weightless if you suppress your feelings or having your armed mutated into a monkey's paw through greed and jealousy) and by solving each problem, moral values surface. Nisemonogatari is similar, only it focuses on Araragi's two sisters this time around, thus the series is split into two main arcs. The title literally translates to \"Story of a Fake\" and the main theme that it revolves around is \"What is the true value of a copy, a fake?\" I won't reveal anything, but you should keep this main idea in your head while watching it. This show is definitely not for everyone. If you only like big fights that don't require any brainpower, you will hate this show because you will not understand the meaning and point that the author was trying to put across. You may think that I am the one going to deep and finding meaning where there isn't one, but the author doesn't really hide it, its simply portrayed in a storytelling manner, and if you can't find those themes or have no interest in them, you will not enjoy this show to the fullest extent. Yes, there is fanservice (after watching this, you will not look at a tooth brush the same way), but as I said before, its not really ecchi, its more like a representation of each characters' personal quality that portrays both their strength and weakness (although there are definitely scenes that are there just to please the fans).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is a character driven show. Both seasons revolve around the main character and the times he helps those around him with their personal problems, and each character is unique and memorable. This is due to the fact that each character has their own tremendous, and yet completely relate-able problems that is portrayed perfectly, and how they overcome it, if they manage to do so, and what the consequences of accepting change in their personality will mean. Besides story related aspects, the voice actors themselves are perfect for each role, and flesh out the innocence, cruelty, jealousy, kindness and  hatred of each personality. The character set is definitely the most memorable I have seen in a long time\\n\\n\r\nArt: If you have watched Bakemonogatari, the art is pretty much the same with all of its flashy effects and close up eye shots and exaggerated poses. The quality is top notch even in today's standards and I was very impressed at the amount of detail. It still gives you the feel that you are high, and that is good. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound isn't extravagant or epic, but it is at the same time in its own, unique way to match up with the unique art style. It is what you would hear from a typical slow paced showed with melodramatic tunes that are at the same time, quite dramatic. Its not the most memorable, but the music isn't made to be memorable, it simply solidifies the mysteriousness, and calmness of each scene. \\n\\n\r\nI loved this show and was quite disappointed that it was only 11 episodes. I don't recommend this show to everyone because it's impossible for everyone to like the same thing. But, if you liked the first season, or you're a fan of rom-com, slowpaced, or supernatural, then i would definitely give this show a shot.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari: the only anime that makes you question what being a fake means...and why you should reevaluate your toothbrush. \r\n(Since Nise is the sequel to Bakemonogatari, I would have to say that you definitely need to have watched the first season...or you're really going to wonder why Koyomi puts up with an office supply wielding girlfriend, a yaoi fan/basketball player, board game jailbait, a 'I-only-know-what-I-know' it-all, and a gradeschool pun-master ghost.)\r\nStory (8/10): Even with the focus brought around to Koyomi's little sisters Karen and Tsukihi, they don't always get the focus squarely on them. And truthfully? That's not exactly a bad thing (most of thetime). While we get new material (obviously), viewers that watched Bakemonogatari will get to see our lovely ladies and how their stories continue, with the main one being Senj\u014dgahara and her objective of putting her past behind her. The twists that Karen and Tsukihi's story puts us through are entertaining and helps change how we see the oddities that popped up in the first series. Though, I will say that it feels like Tsukihi got the shaft (no pun intended) with her story arc, since it only seemed to remember she existed halfway through. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of the story is the dialogue. Every conversation is important to your understanding of the philosophy of the story and why characters do what they do. While not every conversation will be clear as to it's meaning (and trust me, they won't), they all make up the whole of the story. With the strength being the dialogue, it can shift more easily between comedy, darker themes, romance, slice-of-life, and anything in between. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): This being a Shaft production, Nisemonogatari looks good. All the character models have changed slightly to reflect the passage of time and look just as nice as they did before. I do have to wonder what prompted Shaft to start adding in some more realistic facial designs (since they look a little...off, I would say?), but since this series tends to thrive off of surreal imagery, it tends to fit more often than not. If anything did bother me, it's that it seems like the colors got washed out for the majority of the show and everything just looks a little too pale, and the backgrounds for the show were either weird architecture or blank walls, with no middle ground. But when that's all I have to nitpick, it just shows how much work went into the whole design of the series and how good it came out.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): All of the songs that appeared in the show are good, with each opening doubling as a character song as well. I liked Karen's and Tsukihi's openings the best, with them just being a lot of fun to listen to (especially Tsukihi's Platinum Disco. Good luck trying to get that out of your head). The ending, Naisho no Hanashi, by ClariS was good, as is all their work, but I will admit that I missed Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): Really, it wouldn't be a Nisio Isin work without the amazing characters from the first show. All of them have matured slightly from our last viewing of them, and I couldn't be happier. They all have strong personalities that make them a huge step up from other harem-esque shows. Koyomi is still his slightly-cynical, pervy, hero self and it just is a lot of fun to watch him take in the events of the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile all of the characters are great, I'll have to be completely honest- the entire show was stolen, for me, by the full introduction of Oshino Shinobu. While we only saw her as a mute, underpowered little girl last time, we get the full monty here. And by God is it glorious. She's just so clever and fun to watch that she became my favorite character (her interactions with Koyomi are really fun and interesting, so check them out for sure, since they reveal a lot about how their relationship evolved from the still unreleased Kizumonogatari). \\n\\n\r\nFor the character that I didn't like, it would have to go to Nadeko. All we really see of her is in one episode, and it was dedicated to her trying to get in Koyomi's 'good graces', so she didn't come off well. (Granted, I have no idea if it's like that in the book, so I can't be too hard on her in that regard). I'm hoping that she get's a little more development soon, though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): From philosophy to fanservice (some welcome, some interesting, some uncomfortable), Nisemonogatari is fun and addicting. You want to see what the characters talk about, what oddity is the main focus of the arc, what more little shout-outs Shaft can cram in. It's just a blast to watch and think about. Plus, you do get some awesome fight scenes (aka Koyomi getting beat to a bloody pulp, but winning the war with words).\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I love the Monogatari series. It's smart, fun, and intricate, making it a real treat to all the viewers who turn in. I highly recommend it, but I will warn you that if you didn't like the mountains of dialogue that made up Bake, Nise isn't going to change your mind (also if you think the infamous Toothbrush Scene isn't your cup of tea).",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari was an interesting follow-up to the cult classic Bakemonogatari, a dialogue-heavy show full of character interactions and a visual presentation unlike any other. For me, the only issue keeping me from viewing the series as a modern masterpiece were some pacing issues, and unfortunately Nise continues the trend of an awkwardly flowing story that never seems to get on the right foot.  \r\nThe eleven episode series is comprised of two arcs, Karen Bee and Tsukihi Phoenix. What stands out is that the Karen Bee arc is seven episodes long, coming in as a very long arc for the Monogatari series, even though theamount of information in the Tsukihi Phoenix arc is far greater than what was conveyed in the Karen Bee arc. While watching the first arc, the pacing is slowed to a crawl, with whole episodes being devoted to mundane, everyday conversations not needed to progress the mission of justice.\\n\\n\r\nEven if these conversations don\u2019t expound the plot, it still is nice to listen to these very fleshed out characters interact with each other and be put into entertaining situations. The real question is if these things can be justified if they are over fifteen minutes long. I can\u2019t really shake the sense of deja vu when I watch these scenes; they seem very similar to situations from Bakemonogatari. Senjougahara verbally abuses Araragi some more, Nadeko flirts some more and Hachikuji makes paedophile jokes. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as these first few episodes feel recycled, the addition of Shinobu actually talking and the Fire Sisters keeps them from feeling like a waste of time, they come off as a poorly executed introduction back to the world instead. Speaking of Shinobu, her voice actor performs excellently and breathes life into every scene that she is in. I also think that the comedic chemistry of the Fire Sisters, specifically Karen, and Araragi is solid, both characters alternating between the straight man and comic role, then moving to serious discussion later in the conversation seamlessly.  \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can\u2019t review this installment without talking about the fanservice. This is the most sexually charged Monogatari series of the bunch, told through the perspective of an already horny Araragi feeling even hornier. A certain bathtub scene comes to mind as the center of libido that this show carries with it, and it quite large amount of libido, mind you.\\n\\n\r\n But the thing that I find the most fascinating is the way that Nise handles treating its\u2019 female characters in terms of presentation of fanservice. A normal, flavor of the week harem that nobody remembers after its airing would use the camera in order to provide panty shots and the like. This method comes off to me as lazy and tired. What Nise chooses to do instead I feel saves it from becoming the weakest in the series. Of course fanservice is often sexist in nature and puts characters in a sexual light that objectifies them. However, this series chooses to stop relying on the camera to peek up girl\u2019s skirts in order to sexualize characters, and decided to instead portray the female characters as they want to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Nadeko invites Araragi to her house in order to seduce and flirt with him, she is seen in a sexual light because she wants to be seen that way. When Araragi is in the bathtub with Shinobu provocative camera angles are used because Shinobu is flaunting her sexuality in order to mess with Araragi. The toothbrushing scene is shot in the way that it is because both Araragi and Karen are feeling the sexual tension in the scene and between them, using the Incest trope in a new and refreshing way.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this up, this new way of presenting sexuality is fantastic and makes the viewer look at a fanservice, a boring and almost necessary trope, in a new way. The way it presents these things provides gratification without insulting the watcher\u2019s intelligence. Double out.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "more. More. FUCKING MORE is the perfect word to comparate Nisemonogatari to Bakemonogatari. More meaningless character's interaction, more action, more suspens, more comedy, more mystery, and, as everyone before me noticed, more ecchi. To me, everything that lacked in Bakemonogatari, is perfectly made in Nisemonogatari.\r\nI consider in the rest of the review, that you saw Bakemonogatari firstly.\r\nAs his prequel, Nisemonogatari follow the supernatural life of Koyomi, fighting every kind of ghosts and spirits. The story principally focuses on his two young sisters, known as the 'Fire Sisters' who want to bring the justice in which they believe. The new thing here, is that, after OshinoMeme's leaving, Koyomi will meet other antities' 'experts', who are radically different from Meme. The first one, named Kaiki, is an impostor only interested in making money on the backs of students, and the second one is a woman fighting against immortal demons. \\n\r\nThe strong point of the story, as Bakemonogatari, is the supernatural part. People being possessed by spirits is not an over-used theme in anime's world, anyway this one developped it perfectly, with amazing plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhile mixing comedy and fan service is something rather common for an anime, you'll never imagine that this can be done so well in this show. Some said that it ruined the series, but for me, it adds something that made me love the serie much more. Of course, you should know that ecchi scene are between Koyomi and his sisters, so it can disturb at first.\\n\\n\r\nIf you saw Bakemonogatari, you should of familiar with the graphism. It's the same under-developped but no less amazing art. This is such a dangerous thing to be so unique. I have to admit that the first time I saw Bakemonogatari, I thought about dropping the anime. Lucky me, I gave a chance to it. This is really well orchestrated.\\n\\n\r\nEvery characters remain to be the same. While Senjougahara and Hanekawa are relegated to supportings roles, Koyomi's sisters and, for the happiness of the viewer, Shinobu get main roles. I really think this is one of the huge lack of Bakemonogatari, but in Nisemonogatari, Shinobu 'the donut's lover' will help Koyomi to fight for his principles.\\n\r\nInteractions between them are, as in Bakemonogatari (if not more), often meaningless, and even sometimes it doesn't result something that can make the story to progress. But this is sooooo pleasurable. Once again, Nisemonogatari used a dangerous development, that can bore, so amazingly that it does just the opposite : it catch the viewer. This is a huge feat.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was at his best, from the beginning, to the end. For a supernatural, mystery and comedy lover I am, this show is the perfect masterpiece. The universe is unique, the art is incredibly sursprising and the characters are very endearing. I really think it can be called a masterpiece, since it mix so many unique things perfectly.",

            "content": "There is something about a sequel of a series that usually causes a great portion of the fanbase to get excited or hyped about that said sequel in a positive light. What happens if that said sequel fails to entertain the fanbase that was hyped for it? A 8.27, much lower than Bakemonogatari happens. Seeing this rating alone instantly made me believe that I would enjoy Nisemonogatari less than the prequel, but boy was I wrong. For the season that is often considered the weak link of the three has become my favorite of the two seasons I have seen. Most of you probably thinkby now that whoever enjoyed Nisemonogatari more than Bakemonogatari loves ecchi and only adored it more for the ecchi, but that is a very unfair claim. Bakemonogatari is a very well made anime and that is just about a fact, but Nisemonogatari deserves as much credit. Now, why does it deserve the said credit? Nisemonogatari deserves credit for being itself and being a semi different experience than Bakemonogatari. While both seasons had ecchi, denying Nisemonogatari had more would be completely absurd. So, why did I enjoy the season with more ecchi and make it my fourth favorite anime of all time? Like I said earlier, most people would say it was the obvious fanservice level increase, but that as said is an unfair claim. Unlike Bakemonogatari, there was never a time in which I got bored. Was it the ecchi that shook lingering boredom away? \\n\\n\r\nThe answer: No. Nisemonogatari in my opinion had more interesting core characters and there was never a time in which I ever felt like looking away. With the core characters me referencing being the \"Fire Sisters\" and Shinobu obviously. Characters are an extremely needed aspect that can either make or brak.... Whoops I flubbered that, \"break\" an interest in something and that is most likely why at times I found myself bored with Bakemonogatari. While a 8.27 is a great rating to have, it is still lower than its prequel which would obviously make any viewer before going into the season with the thought of it being worse in mind. Ecchi haters will obviously not enjoy this series as much which is completely fine and I'm sure there are tons of people indifferent with ecchi that enjoyed it less which is also fine. I'm not here to change your mind, but to give you my opinion on anime and maybe give someone who has yet to watch this and give them that extra push to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of any Monogatari season is complex and makes us who enjoy anime study what happening on screen with each passing second. In Nisemonogatari, we see the bonding of brother and sister which was not yet tackled in Bakemonogatari. It was a story that was extremely well done even if the ecchi did get in the way at times. If it serves any purpose here, I enjoyed it and feel like if you look past the ecchi you may as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Nisemonogatari was as jaw dropping as seen in Bakemonogatari. While I enjoyed the visuals in anime like Ef: A Tale of Memories more, this is still very appealing to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Another great thing about the monogatari franchise. With great openings and endings and a nice set of voices, there is no doubt in my mind that both Nisemonogatari openings would crack my favorite 150 openings of all time. That is opinion if anything, but still worth listening to them if you have not.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Where do I begin? The characters in Nisemonogatari was of the biggest highlights for me. You have an incredible character in Karen and a couple other new (well, already introduced) core characters that made every passing second an amusing one! If anything, this was easily one of Nisemonogataris strongest points. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Is it even a doubt after reading this far that anything other than a 10/10 would indicate how much I enjoyed this? Simply amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm giving this a 10/10 of course. While many people will my opinion it is still a fact that my opinion will not change. It is very possible that I will I enjoy the next season of this even more, but for now this stands as my favorite of the two. \\n\\n\r\nI'm very pleased to have this review read by the community and I'm looking forward to Monogatari second season!\\n\\n\r\nThank you!",

            "content": "*MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS*\r\nThe monogatari series currently consists of 6 different seasons, Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, Nekomonogatari:Kuro, Monogatari Series Second Season, Hanamonogatari, Tsukimonogatari and Owarimonogatari (Kizumonogatari will be released in 3 different parts early on in the next year). \r\nNisemonogatari is the second in the monogatari series. Nise has two different arcs, Karen Bee and Tsukihi Phoenix. \r\nStory: The Karen Bee arc consists of 7 episodes were as Tsukihi Phoenix has 4. Both are arcs were enjoyable. Kaiki Deishu deceives people for a living as a \"Specialist\", he ends up deceiving The Fire Sisters (Karen and Tsukihi, Araragi Koyomi's sisters) and placing an abberation upon one ofthem. As usual Arargi tries to dispose of the abberation but finds it more difficult as Meme, Oshino left town.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Same art as the rest of the monogatari series but hey, i'm not complaing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Nise had 3 different OP themes, \"Futakotome\" by Hitagi Senjougahara (Chiwa Saito), \"marshmallow justice\" by Karen Araragi (Eri Kitamura) and \"Hakkin Disco\" by Tsukihi Araragi (Yuka Iguchi). The ED theme was \"Naisho no Hanashi\" by ClariS an. All of the themes were great but if I had to pick a favourite it would be Hakkin Disco. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Like the last review I will go over one character. That character being: Oshino, Shinobu. In Bakemonogatari, Shinobu was pretty quiet, but that changed in Nise. In \"Tsubasa Cat\" (arc in Bake) she started living in Araragi's shadow. She can sense the emotions in Arargi and does not need to suck his blood to live as she is in his shadow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Something about the monogatari series just puts a smile on my face. The season added a lot more mystery and wonder to my mind which I love.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you watched Bakemonogatari and liked it you will certainly love Nisemonogatari.",

            "content": "The monogatari series is probably the most under-rated series of all time. They have a huge fan base and all, plus they are pretty high rating from most people however a large amount of the anime watching community refuses to put it in the same light as animes such as death note, clannad, cowboy bebop and other such animes that are held in extremely high regard. Perhaps this is because the Monogatari series is not popular among westerners. Perhaps this is because the Monogatari series is in a category completely on its own.\r\nStory- 9\r\nThe story of Nisemonogatari is, in my opinion, an improvement from Bakemonogatari.Unlike Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari had a somewhat fluid story that wasnt so episodic. Characters that were introduced to us in the beggining had parts in the end and were not just forgotten in the dust. Nisemonogatari also felt like a second season as the story actually felt like a continuation of where Bakemonogatari left off.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nIn what is probably the most unique part of the monogatari series, the art really stands out. One part of Nisemonogatari that I really enjoyed was how they didnt have random slides inbetween dialouge that only stayed there for 3 seconds, unlike Bakemonogatari. The character design in Nisemonogatari is for the most part, good. Although I would have prefered some of the characters to be slightly bolder, or have a \"fuller\" colour, it was good. Well...Average. But not a bad average, it was like a good average. Something different from other animes which is always welcome. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nThe Music of bakemonogatari is truly amazing. Nisemonogatari kept a part of Bakemonogatari that i really liked. It has different Openings for some episodes to give the viewer some sort of insight to what the episode was going to be about. You can tell if you watched the anime that the producers really did spend alot of time on the openings aswell, and did not do them for the sake of doing them. Every opening was unique in its own way and it was nice. Nisemonogatari wisely used the same Ending for its series, which might I add sounded *awesome*. Another aspect of the music which was masterful was the use of background music and theme songs, of which one immediately comes to mind. Kaiki's theme. You may not think it but the background music adds so much depth and detail to a scene. The background music in Nisemonogatari had me feeling tense, or sly, or relieved. It did its job, and it truly excelled at doing it as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\r\nSome people may complain about Hanekawa, sengoku, hachijuki or senjougahara not getting enough screen time in Nisemonogatari. They got plenty. Bakemonogatari already built those characters for us. We already feel attached to them. Nisemonogatari furthered the former sub characters. We got to see Araragi's sisters for most part of the season, which gave us two characters that were hot like fire (Dont mind my terrible attempt for a joke). We got an indepth look into who araragi's sisters were and we got to see what araragi deals with at home. We also got to see more of shinobu and Nisemonogatari gave her a profile. We never got to see who Shinobu was in Bakemonogatari. Nisemonogatari did the job of developing those who werent developed in Bakemonogatari. This is and was good\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment and Overall rating.\\n\r\nMy overall rating for Nisemonogatari is a nice sparkly 10/10. Nisemonogatari was an unprecedented success as a second season. In my opinion (of which all that matters in a review written by me) Nisemonogatari was a true masterpiece. People complain about the unnecessary amount of fan service, and while that may be some what a hindrance sometimes, but it overall does not heavily effect the series. However, with all the praise I give this series, I would not recommend the series to very many people. The monogatari series is a series that demands you to give it your full attention. If you are swayed even alittle bit, the series becomes somewhat confusing and dull. If you can pay attention and take a great deal of thought to the series, then you will love it as I did.",

I, Araragi Karen, hadn't been aware of that, not until that day, that morning, and that time, when I felt it.\r\n\"Ow!\"\r\n\"What is it, Karen-chan? My dear sister?\"\r\nMy brother, hearing his sister's scream, came rushing into the bathroom. I pulled the toothbrush out of my mouth and explained myself.\r\n\"I-It's nothing! My back teeth don't hurt at all. I don't have a cavity. So I don't have to go to the dentist.\"\r\n\"So your back teeth hurt, you have a cavity and have to goto the dentist, huh...\"\\n\\n\r\nMy brother looked at me compassionately.\\n\\n\r\nTo look at your sister with such sorrowful eyes...\\n\\n\r\n\"N-No! There's no way I'm going! We don't even know for sure whether I have a cavity yet!\"\\n\\n\r\n\"People with cavities always deny that they have them, for some reason... Just face the reality. I mean, why is someone like you, who's brawling all the time, afraid of the dentist? Being punched in the face is a lot more painful than a cavity, right?\"\\n\\n\r\nMy brother was right, but, but this is just not something you can rationalize.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like something you don't like it, and if you're afraid of something then you're afraid of it. Dammit, how could I get a cavity even though I brush my teeth every morning and evening? I feel like I wasted some serious time and effort.\\n\\n\r\n\"Is that so... well, if you really don't want to go, then I'll respect that, as your brother.\"\\n\\n\r\nHe shrugged, giving in.\\n\\n\r\nHm? What did he mean by that?\\n\\n\r\n\"You might be afraid of the dentist, but you're not afraid of your brother, right? I'll examine you, so come with me.\" my brother said, grinning and turning his head beckoning me.\\n\\n\r\nWow, just as I'd expect of him! So reliable!\\n\\n\r\n\"Okay, so undress your upper body and lie down on the bed.\" demanded my brother, equipping himself with a surgical mask and an apron, just as he had taken me into his room.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? Undress? Why would I have to do that when he's not even going to use a stethoscope?\\n\\n\r\n\"What are you saying, you moron. Spit and blood could fly out while I'm examining your cavity. Your precious tracksuit could get dirty!\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, right! I see! Just as expected of my big bro, you're so clever!\"\\n\\n\r\nHaving heard that perfect explanation that left no room for any further doubts, I quickly took my tracksuit, T-shirt and sports bra off all at once and stretched out on the bed. I folded the pillow and used it as a headrest.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is still a bit embarrassing, after all...\\n\\n\r\nGetting naked in front of my brother again...\\n\\n\r\n\"What are you talking about again, you moron. If you go to a real dentist, they'll take an X-ray. They won't look at your naked body, but right through you, down to your bones! If you think about that, what's the deal with exposing your upper body?\"\\n\\n\r\nHe was right. I really had scales falling from my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI do get the feeling that maybe I should be wearing the apron he's wearing right now, and maybe it would've been better to be honest with myself and go to a dentist rather than getting myself treated by an amateur, but well, my big bro can't do anything wrong!",

I really enjoyed the show so much and now it quickly becomes one of my favorites anime. Putting high expectations on its sequels, Nisemonogatari, surprisingly i very dissapointed with it. I myself dislike ecchi and am really anoyyed by it.  The ecchi things on it make this anime really-really bad.Sure that Bakemonogatari or other monogatari series has some fanservices on it, but their fanservices are just small and minor things, while nisemonogatari's are too much. Some 'really-ecchi' scenes (e.g the tootbrush scene)are definitely unnecesarry. And for me those things really brake the storyline. But others than it are decent, the plot and the soundtracks are rally good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's not-so enjoyable to me, but since i'm a big fan of the series, i'll give it 6/10. Well fanservice could be a hate or love. Some hate it and some love it. In the end it's up to you that it is worse or better.",

            "content": "Ughh.....this anime scarred me for a whole week....because of that one particular episode. That infamous toothbrush scene. You know what? I'm going to try that out with my younger sister. She'll probably slap the hell out of me or me she'll do the same thing as Karen did.\r\n(Deleted and Re-uploaded my review from yesterday due to the amount of mistakes I've made in my previous review)\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nThis is a sequel to the predecessor called \"Bakemonogatari\". Nisemonogatari chronologically takes place after the events of Bake and focuses on Koyomi's little sisters; Karen and Tsukihi. Otherwise known as \"The Fire Sisters\".  The black swindler Kaiki Deishu,who once deceived Hitagi, returns to town and spreads the incantation which cursed Nadeko before. \\n\\n\r\nMan, I really thought Nise was going to be a lot better than Bake. That first episode was so great. The first episode basically shows you that Hitagi kidnapped Araragi and handcuffed him inside an abandoned classroom. At that point, I didn't know what the hell was going on and that's where the mystery part comes in. In episode 2, it shows you why she \"kidnapped\" him in the first place. 2 clever episodes, if I say so myself. \\n\\n\r\nAfter 2 episodes of re-introducing the characters and telling you everything you need to know, Karen's arc comes in. This is where the show actually begins. Unlike Bakemonogatari, the series this time is divided into 2 arcs only. The \"Karen Bee\" arc and the \"Tsukihi Phoenix\" arc. Which means the pacing is a lot better compared to Bakemonogatari. It uses 60% of its time fleshing out the story and the characters. The arc also contains character development for both Karen and Tsukihi. About damn time because Karen and Tsukihi got little to no screentime at all in Bakemonogatari. Their previews in Bakemonogatari doesn't count.\\n\\n\r\nHow do you think the show uses its 40%? That's right, fanservice. If you think the fanservice is horrible in Bake then oh boy, you are going to be disappointed at how Nise handles the fanservice scenes. The fanservices are a lot more excessive than Bake. These fanservice scenes includes molestation, bunch of dirty incest scenes like Karen and Tsukihi lying down together in the same bed naked (presumably having sex or just had sex), the infamous \"toothbrush\" scene and skirt flipping/Araragi \"accidentally\" looking down at women's skirts -- In this case, Karen and Mayoi. Some people thought that Shaft might have taken it a bit too too far when it comes to fanservice because of the scenes I mentioned above and that one episode dedicated to Araragi and Karen. Particularly, that toothbrush scene. If you ask me, I'm going to have to say I'm on the neutral side. I won't say that Shaft have taken it too far nor will I say that I'm ok with Nise's excessive fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nPutting fanservice aside, the show retains its great writing and great storyline and more interesting dialogues. If it didn't, I would have rated Nise a lot lower than 8 because of the fanservice scenes. The story is what really saved Nise but I wouldn't say that Nise's story is better than Bake because it's not. \\n\r\nMy opinions on the arcs are in the \"Characters\" category.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of Araragi groping Mayoi then fear not because the groping scenes are back and it revealed something interesting about how Mayoi feels when Araragi gropes her. Watching that scenes again makes me want to laugh even harder. I can't believe it. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10) \\n\r\nSomeone will probably need to come and correct me on the visuals of the show. After watching both shows on a 1080p quality, I'd say that Bake and Nise looks exactly the same in terms of animation and visuals. The weird animation that I talked about in my previous review (i.e Shaft head tilts, fast-flashing text, etc) is still present in Nise and I highly doubt it will ever go away. Not that I'm complaining or anything. They did take away the fast flashing text that occurs after the opening. Dammit, Shaft..Now I won't have anything to use to give my sister a seizure. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nUnlike Bakemonogatari's outstanding soundtrack, Nise's soundtrack fell a little bit. It's still great but not as great as Bake. The OST version of the OP theme song returns and it is used effectively when there's a dramatic scene playing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Futakotome\" by Hitagi Senjougahara, \"marshmallow justice\" by Karen Araragi and \"Hakkin Disco\" by Tsukihi Araragi. The ED theme song is \"Naisho no Hanashi\" by ClariS. The only OP theme song that I like is the 3rd version because of Tsukihi's cutesy moe voice, the music style used felt like a mix of Japanese and Chinese cultural music and the opening animation also felt the same. I didn't really like the 1st OP because it felt like a recycled version of \"Staple Stable\". To be more specific, a crappy lacklustered recycled version. The 2nd OP sounded decent. Not bad but not great either. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Character]: (8/10) \\n\r\nAfter many complaints that Koyomi's little sisters barely got any screentime in Bakemonogatari, they finally gave us a show dedicated to them. Was the complaining worth it? Ehhh...I don't know. On one hand, the sisters were given screentime, their characters were fleshed out and they gave me a reason why I should care for these sisters. On the other hand, they were also being used for fanservice. That's for you guys to decide. Anyways....\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I'm sure you guys already know the characters except the sisters and part of Shinobu so I'm only going to review the 3 characters. \\n\r\nThe Koyomi sisters are Karen and Tsukihi. Karen is the older little sister and she is a self-proclaimed \"hero of justice\" who often imitates the personality of several characters from a \"tokatsu\" series. She has an energetic personality and a tomboyish lifestyle. Surprisingly, she is taller than Koyomi despite Koyomi being 3 years older than her. Tsukihi is the younger little sister and she is the younger half of the \"Fire Sisters\". She likes to do indoor activities and compared to her older sister, she has a more calmer personality. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's Shinobu, who was first introduced in Bakemonogatari but the show didn't really focus much on her. She was pretty much silent for the entirety of Bake. In Nise, we finally get to see her talk and be lively instead of just sitting on a corner doing nothing for a whole day. They did state why she was silent in Bake and why she's suddenly talkative in Nise so it's not just some random moment that happened for no reason.  \\n\\n\r\nI just love how Tsukihi only got 2 episodes focused on her even though her arc spanned for 4 episodes. The 1st episode of her arc is just Araragi and Karen and the 2nd episode of her arc focuses on Araragi and Shinobu. I'm seriously disappointed with Tsukihi's arc. We did get to see Shinobu and her love for Mister Donuts and it's one of the scenes that I enjoyed in Tsukihi's arc. On the other hand, I enjoyed Karen's arc a lot more than Tsukihi's arc because her arc lasted a lot longer and the story of her arc is better than Tsukihi's arc. What I enjoyed the most in Karen's arc is the fight scene between Araragi and Karen, and the ending of her arc which was pretty great. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also new characters introduced for Nise. First up is Kaiki, the antagonist in Karen's arc and one of the most interesting villians I have seen in years. He's not your typical villain that fights for his ideals or some shit. All he's interested in is money. He is a con-man, after all. He scams people, especially middle-school girls. I mean, I could provide more reasons why I like this villian but writing more will lead up to another paragraph or two. By the time I'm writing this review, I have already finished Monogatari Series: Second Season and Kaiki is now my favourite villian in the series. \\n\\n\r\nSecond and lastly, there's Yozuru and Yotsugi, the antagonist in Tsukihi's arc. Yozuru is a professional onmyouji and an expert in the supernatural, specializing in immortal oddities. Honestly, I don't know much about her yet but what I have seen so far makes me want to hate her. Yotsugi is Yozuru's familiar and a girl who constantly says \"I said, with a posed look\" in the end of her sentences. I don't know much about her either but so far, she's a funny and interesting character and her personality is amazing. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.5/10)\\n\r\nSaying that I enjoyed Nise as much as Bake is an overstatement. I still enjoyed it but compared to Bakemonogatari, it just doesn't feel the same. I mean, if you enjoyed fanservice a lot more than I do then you might enjoy Nise a lot more than Bakemonogatari. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nIt was nice to see Koyomi's little sisters and Shinobu finally getting some screentime but the amount of fanservice in Nise is just insane. I laughed way more than I expected when a fanservice scene comes up but at the end of the day, I was still a bit disappointed with the show's fanservice. I did enjoy the story and the characters of Nisemonogatari. Overall, Nisemonogatari is a good sequel but does not live up to Bakemonogatari. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.2/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Nisemonogatari retains it's great writing and dialogue\\n\r\n+Story is still very good\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Koyomi's little sisters and Shinobu finally got some screen time\\n\r\n+New characters did not disappoint\\n\r\n+Pacing is hugely improved\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Excessive Fanservice\\n\r\n-Incest scenes\\n\r\n-Tsukihi's story is only 2 episodes despite the arc spanning for 4 episodes\\n\r\n-Some might find the \"Toothbrush\" scene disturbing\\n",

Shinobu is the one who gives Araragi advice this time showing shewiser than her appearance.\\n\\n\r\nAraragi and Hitagi's relationship also develops with Araragi showing himself to have grown up from Bakemonogatri not letting Hitagi have everything her own way. and Hitagi proving she is an extremely posessive girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nI have one major dislike from nisemonogatari and that is the fan service of Araragi's sisters. The season where Araragi cleans Karen's teeth and it becomes very erotic  is really uncomfortable to watch and Araragi forceabily taking off  Tsukihi's kimono and checking out her chest is in bad taste. Neither added anything, were completely unnecessary and ruined those 2 episodes.",

I give it a perfect score but it fulfils what I want from the series, I felt like I was writing the script at times, but if you are interested in a more serious take on the monogatari series you would be wise to look at Nekomonogatari, not that you should (or can) skip Nise just that youshouldn't expect it to be more than what it is, fanservice.",

            "content": "Story\r\nAfter Bakemonogatari, this series has a lot to live up to\u2026\r\n\u2026 and this second helping doesn\u2019t disappoint in any way, accentuating characters that were overlooked in the first season, adding a few villain-esque characters, and leaving enough room for tons of creepiness; more creepy, in fact, than the first season. The sexual assaults on Mayoi continue, and Araragi\u2019s unchecked libido is allowed free reign over the bevy of girls, and this includes his sisters. In fact, this entire season focuses on his little sisters and developing them. One of them gets infected by a spirit, much like the girls in the first season, and theother turns out to be something completely different. Meanwhile, a conman is screwing with middle schoolers in order to make a buck and a duo of strangers come to fill in Meme\u2019s place.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series isn\u2019t particularly strong, but I give it a high rating because it\u2019s engaging. It\u2019s not a huge epic. It\u2019s a very inclusive story that works due to smart dialogue and a great cast. There are a few missteps along the way though, mostly coming from the sidelining of key characters to shoehorn the others in. The first season did a good job of focusing on character-specific arcs while still maintaining the importance of the other characters. This season does some of that, though it inevitably decides to focus more on the new characters and throw the others to the side. Despite the fact Senjougahara is Araragi\u2019s girlfriend, we rarely see her this season.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari is also so much more sexual than its predecessor. Which in some regards is okay, and others isn\u2019t. I appreciated the infamous toothbrush scene because it\u2019s pretty much the greatest sex scene ever. Well, minus the fact he\u2019s essentially raping his sister with a toothbrush. And this sister on brother action just keeps going. This is a series that has no qualms with being weird and appealing to every fetish imaginable while creating new ones.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s so difficult to understand this series specifically because of how strange it is. It has this really cool urban fantasy story, but mixes it with an ecchi/harem; it has fantastic animation and style, but it is used on pointless ass or tit shots.\\n\\n\r\nFuck it, who am I kidding? I love this. It has awesome ultra-violence, awesome female characters, awesome writing, pacing, and plot. Monogatari kicks ass.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation is so good. It hasn\u2019t changed much from the first season, continuing the tradition of visual metaphor and tons of gags as well. It doesn\u2019t use the cue cards too much anymore, though still sometimes tells a story within the story. The directing and writing work together so well to create such a unique and artistic series.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOnce again, Nisemonogatari has unique openings for each character. Karen\u2019s gets instant points for being ska, a genre my college white boy sensibilities tends to pick out from anything else and hold in high regards. The other openings are good and the ending is good as well. The music in series is great, especially the tooth brush scene. A lot of people are freaked out by this scene, but seriously, look at how beautifully directed it is. The classical music in the background builds to a crescendo as the climax of the scene approaches. Also, the cartoon sound effects throughout are fantastic and the voice actors and actresses are wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAraragi has become an ultra-pervert. His character downgrades quite a bit with this season. But, the bad guys, especially Kaiki, are fun and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it\u2019s about time to play that little game that requires the utmost attention and dedication.\\n\\n\r\nBEST GIRL: ROUND 2\\n\\n\r\n10. Nadeko Sengoku- A lot of characters in this series are total sluts but Sengoku is unbearably slutty. I\u2019m glad she only shows up in one episode this season. But she makes Araragi play Twister and does all this slutty posing stuff. God, I hate her. If there was a character that deserved to be killed, it\u2019s her.\\n\\n\r\n9. Yozoru Kagenui- I really don\u2019t have any reason to hate her aside from the fact she has very little character and wears high heels that are way too big. She\u2019s a decent bad guy, but she overall isn\u2019t impressive at all.\\n\\n\r\n8. Yotsugi Ononoki- I put her this high, despite being boring and stale, because her character design is really cute and I can see her being a more entertaining character in the future.\\n\\n\r\n7. Tsukihi Araragi- Tsukihi doesn\u2019t have that much character, especially compared to her sister. I didn\u2019t really pick up much from her character in this season that made me care. Her arc was really only two episodes long and she barely had anything to do with it.\\n\\n\r\n6. Tsubasa Hanekawa- From first to sixth? How\u2019d this happen? Well, this season she does very little, cuts her hair, loses the glasses, and is completely uninteresting throughout. While she remained a key player in the last season, this season she is boring.\\n\\n\r\n5. Shinobu Oshino- She\u2019s cute and all, but I really didn\u2019t find any reason to like her much. She\u2019s there for the lolicons most definitely. She\u2019s hot as a teenager though. Otherwise her love for donuts is kinda cute, but her tsundere/yandere thing with Araragi is way too much like Senjougahara.\\n\\n\r\n4. Hitagi Senjougahara- I don\u2019t really like Hitagi in any way. She\u2019s too tsundere/yandere for me and so awkward to watch around Araragi. Which might be part of her charm. But her romance with Araragi doesn\u2019t develop at all this season and all the portions with her in it aren\u2019t memorable enough to care about.\\n\\n\r\n3. Mayoi Hachikuji- Mayoi\u2019s grown on me for being that cute little wanderer who interjects herself into the series every once in a while to engage Araragi in adorable, silly antics. I still maintain Araragi\u2019s treatment of her is kinda creepy, but the fact she likes it and admits she does makes it okay\u2026I guess. This season she\u2019s much more fun and silly, making her move up the list.\\n\\n\r\n2. Suruga Kanbaru- Not much to say here I didn\u2019t say last time. She\u2019s a total pervert, lesbian, yaoi fan girl, and athlete. She\u2019s silly and her portions are fun to watch. She\u2019s barely given enough time to shine in this season, but what little we\u2019re offered is worth it.\\n\\n\r\n1. Karen Araragi- Holy shit is Karen amazing. She\u2019s a martial artist and a complete badass. She\u2019s a lot like Kanbaru in the athletic and kind of perverted department, but she\u2019s also extremely likeable for being an \u201cAlly of Justice\u201d, this skewed vision that she\u2019s a superhero meant to protect everyone. As the season continues she becomes a lot more slutty, especially toward the part with the tooth brush. She seems very incestuous, despite apparently having a boyfriend. Then again, the Araragi family creed must be \u201cKeep it in the Family\u201d. I found her to be the cutest, have the best personality, and be the most fun to hang around. I\u2019m glad she gets the majority of screen time as far as the female characters go.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nNisemonogatari surpasses the original by going at a much faster clip and providing more of what I loved about the original. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s fetishistic, it has a waifu for everyone, and it maintains an interesting story, a great script, and fantastic directing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s a series for guys most definitely, and it\u2019s also a series that you need to go into with a certain mindset. It\u2019s completely different from anything else out there and I appreciate it for that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for Karen. Because Karen is the best girl.",

            "content": "Enjoyment Rating: 10\r\nIm sure we all know that the monogatari series love to talk into the deeper meaning of things, logic (semantics, thought process of an adult vs children, the supernatural etc.), concepts, allusions, sayings and philosophical theories. When i say philosophical theories, i mean that this anime IS the first anime that i've watched so far that mention a well known philosopher or a Chinese Philosopher Mencius and Xunzi (Hsun Tzu). Tackling the idea of the main and other mature character that was presented within the story. And the way their dialogue works... just great. All of them follow an argumentative structure that goesby premise > body > conclusion and vice versa. But just to be clear, there're statement too. Not just a bunch of random or specifics arguments. This is why i enjoy watching it. Every argument are sound and valid. Some maybe vague, but it's just a way of thinking in a way that most skepticism believer does. Aside from that, the parodies and references to anime or different things are great too.\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating And Character Rating: 8\\n\r\nFrankly, i dont really understand how the plot of this anime works. But the story indeed, is about \"Ni-Se\" (NISE-MONOGATARI). And when we translate \"NISE\" into english. It was defined as Bogus, or fake, not genuine. In which, this was the actually story line of this anime. Talking about things that aren't genuine and fake. And giving lessons to the viewers with their indirect and symbolical of the real world's talks and arguments or just a statement about it. \\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari is an introductory series that presented different characters, but mostly female with Oshino being the only male aside from Araragi. Along with their way of thinking, personality, catch phrases, attitude, and behaviors. Most of the time, the anime talks about things.... When i say things. I mean alot of things, including the trivial matters, the supernatural being's traits based from mythologies,  etc.  \\n\r\nAnd Nisemonogatari focuses are on Araragi's intimate people in life (his sisters or Shinobu). And the character, just like in bakemonogatari are the same, repetitive, and unique at the same time. These characters other than Araragi will probably play a big role into developing Araragi into a better Character. But honestly, i see very little character development here lol.  Despite all of that, the character are very interesting and unique. Not only that you can recognize them much easier. But you can see that each characters hold different logic and opinion. Thus, you can also compare it to people in real life who have similar opinion and logic as well, and based from those opinion and logic, the argument flow are similar to the actual thing that those people might behave or argue from their point of view of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating 9: Amazing, creative, hard work, beautiful, metaphoric, visually appealing, mixing both things from unreality (anime, drawing art) and reality (real life object, person 's pictures), implication of how this visuals are connected to a character's feeling, giving you differs vibes, and foreshadowing (ominous depicting environment, atmosphere, colours etc.)\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 9\\n\r\nThere're great music being put on a specific part of the anime's story. Meeting a mysterious or abnormal entity, boom that's the perfect music vibe to give. And chilling or thinking kind of music are well fitted into the anime and the environment of the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8\\n\r\nTo be honest, the anime style is what i love about the series. But it wasn't that interesting. The story was more restricted into Araragi's family relationship than any other intriguing stuff that could've happen. It wasn't bad though, but i cant really find the right word to put as to why i felted this way.",

And I *definitely* dislike when my anime contains incestuous references -- implied, overt, 'it-turns-out-they're-not-blood-related-after-all-so-it's-ok,' or anything along that spectrum.\r\nAnd yet, I LOVED Nisemonogatari. The follow-up to the similarly spectacular Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari (hereafter 'Nise') strikes all the right chords for me, even as it apparently indulges in all three of above tropes I generally don't appreciate.\r\nI'm still not fully clear on *how* Nise managed to overcome my prejudices, but it did so with flying colors. The art and animation is as fantastic and clever as always. Every character from Bakemonogatari and Kizumonogatari ispaid some sort of homage, and most relationships are developed further. The dialogue is thoughtful, purposeful, and devoid of filler even if it's not directly advancing the action. The humor -- be it visual slapstick, non-sequiturs, wordplay, situational, a comedy of errors, etc. -- sends me reeling every time, and even manages to be philosophical at points without taking itself seriously. But perhaps most importantly, the axis on which the show (and series) turns, Araragi, continues to be a complex, nuanced, and extremely likeable lens through which we view or compare all action and character relationships in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot recommend enough that you give Nisemonogatari a shot, whatever your misgivings may be. To appreciate it fully necessitates previous exposure to Bakemonogatari (and preferably the three Kizumonogatari movies), but it is none the weaker for that clause.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

Pese a esto, como dije, las historias centrales de ambos arcos son muy buenas, pero mal desarrolladas, pero la conclusi\u00f3n de ambos, el desarrollo de las hermanas araragi (Karen & Tsukihi) es bueno, y el mensaje que quiere dar tambi\u00e9n. Pero los problemas de la historia son reales y se pierde mucho de las cosas que hac\u00edan tan buena a su antecesora.\\n\\n\r\nArte: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nComo siempre es en 'Monogatari' o con 'Shaft' en general, el arte siempre es destacable no solo en el apartado t\u00e9cnico, si no que tambi\u00e9n en todo el sentido art\u00edstico, pero a pesar de esto, no es tan destacable como en Bakemonogatari, donde se llega a perder la variedad art\u00edstica y ciertos elementos creativos de la paleta de colores, o la mezcla de t\u00e9cnicas, pero a su vez a\u00f1ade cosas nuevas.\\n\\n\r\nSonido: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEl soundtrack est\u00e1 bien, no es tan destacable como 'Bakemonogatari', pero es bueno y funciona.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLos personajes de Monogatari son muy buenos, y eso es un hecho, y eso mismo permite que las historias se desarrollen bien, pero el problema es que el desarrollo de personajes en 'Nise' no es tan potente ni bueno como en 'Bake' qued\u00e1ndose corto a veces en t\u00e9rminos de variedad, y obviamente en la resoluci\u00f3n de cada personajes, dentro de todo son bastante buenos como siempre, pero no tanto como en Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari es el tend\u00f3n de aquiles conocido de la franquicia por estos errores que remarco, y por suerte Shaft los not\u00f3 y asumi\u00f3 para corregirlos, a pesar de esto, Nisemonogatari posee un mont\u00f3n de momentos de relevancia a la historia de todo Monogatari y es algo que se debe ver y que posee elementos que hacen a la serie disfrutable.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari is the sequel to Bakemonogatari, continuing the Monogatari franchise, and despite the good quality of Bakemonogatari, Shaft tried to turn the series into Nisemonogatari to make them less dense, but he could not achieve it without losing much of the quality and solidity that Bakemonogatari holds.\\n\\n\r\nHistory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Nisemonogatari to which the central plot is concerned, is very good, but much of the development and the thread is lost through bad moments of fan-service, and although the fan-service is unique in 'Monogatari', in Nisemonogatari it goes on to shamelessly bring the central story and the development of the characters, becoming involuntarily dense in the sense of a narrative cohesion of the story. Despite this, as I said, the central stories of both arcs are very good, but poorly developed, but the conclusion of both, the development of the araragi sisters (Karen & Tsukihi) is good, and the message that wants to give also. But the problems of history are real and you lose a lot of the things that made the predecessor so good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs always in 'Monogatari' or with 'Shaft' in general, the art is always remarkable not only in the technical section, but also in all the artistic sense, but despite this, it is not as remarkable as in Bakemonogatari , where you get to lose the artistic variety and certain creative elements of the color palette, or the mixture of techniques, but in turn adds new things.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fine, it's not as remarkable as 'Bakemonogatari', but it's good and it works.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Monogatari are very good, and that is a fact, and that allows the stories to develop well, but the problem is that the character development in 'Nise' is not as powerful or good as in 'Bake' staying short sometimes in terms of variety, and obviously in the resolution of each character, they are pretty good as always, but not as much as in Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari is the achilles tendon known from the franchise for these errors that I highlight, and luckily Shaft noticed and assumed to correct them, despite this, Nisemonogatari has a lot of moments relevant to the history of all Monogatari and is something that it must be seen and that it has elements that make the series enjoyable.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari is a follow up to the much-adored Bakemonogatari, but it features several packages that make it a modest departure from the first entry in the series. You can tell pretty immediately that the success of Bakemonogatari along with the time between the two series has allowed for a more involved production, particularly with the art. Moreover, while the dialogue is still fantastic and the girls still stingy, Nisemonogatari moves even further into indulgence, dancing with taboo the whole way through. I don't  think any of these things, in a vacuum, make the series good or bad. Maybe that deserves a discussion.\r\nDoes fan-service, indulgence,and taboo reflect poorly upon a series? How about the audience that chooses the watch it?  I watch because the series is stylish and funny,  not necessarily because of my perverse attractions, but I'll make my case here anyway. Taboo isn't 'bad' for no reason. For instance, incest is 'bad' because it can cause birth defects and can cause friction in the family unit. Idolizing underaged girls is 'bad' because the girls are often unable to support themselves, let alone any kids they may have, both physically and emotionally. Most taboos and social judgments are like this: the taboo itself exists because of the likely negative social implications of the action. However, if the perverse never plan to actually act out these taboos, is indulging in their fantasy bad? If they simply indulge in the fantasy, the negative social implications never come to fruition, and thus there is no need for the taboo. That is, of course, under the assumption that this behavior does not increase the likelihood for the perverse to indulge in the truly taboo behavior. This is a difficult claim to make, but I tend to side with the idea that it generally helps more than it hurts. Now under the idea that indulging in 'simulated' taboo is fine, so long as it doesn't come with any adverse side-effects, we make the same claim about the creation of the simulation as well. Creating a taboo simulation is morally sound, so long as it does not encourage perverse behavior, either outright or implicitly. I think Nisemonogatari probably succeeds at this, but I haven't put too much thought into it and that is just my gut talking. Anyways, that's my take on it. Fitting that we are talking about Nisemonogatari, because we know that the fake, due to its deliberate nature and the skill required to upkeep it, is more valuable than the real thing. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, let's get on to the rating.\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 8]\\n\\n\r\nI mean, I'm not too sure what to think about the Nisemonogatari story, because I'm unsure of how it slots into the story of the series as a whole. Bakemonogatari seems like a really strong introduction, which sets the stage for what kind of world we are living in, what kind of stuff Araragi might be doing, and what his relationships are with the girls. Nise does a little bit more of this, expanding on Araragi's home life with Karen and Tsukihi and on his relationship with Shinobu, but also introduces us to the idea that there are villains in the world. This seems like something the series could continue to revolve around, but I just don't know if that is the case. Beyond that, each arc individually is interesting and well-paced. Each has a sense of tension both with the villains and with Araragi's relationship with his sisters. I trust that these elements will pay off, and my rating is contingent on the assumption that they, in fact, do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 9]\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Nisemonogatari has nice art. It is a pretty serious departure from that of Bakemonogatari, and I think that is for the worse, but it is still quite good. Compared to Bakemonogatari, the art is cleaner and more involved, but I don't consider the latter much of a benefit. Bakemonogatari generally focuses on large forms while Nise has many smaller, accenting prolonged letterboxing doesn't do it any favors. To me, the rest of the series (particularly the dialogue) is busy enough. Less is more, and therefore sometimes more is less. I prefer the simplicity in Bakemonogatari. Moreover, I feel that the style and directing have taken a step down. By no means is it 'bad', but it has a lot to live up to that it does not quite reach. Regardless, the art is clean, and the series still features a great use color palettes, texture, and shot composition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is above average. Compared to Bake, I think the directing-use of sound is a little lacking. The series has a pretty strong score that absolutely shines like the sun at some moments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 8]\\n\\n\r\nThe series only focuses on a few characters. Each of the girls make a small return, but the series is really only about Araragi, Karen, Tsukihi, and Shinobu. There's nothing wrong with this in a vacuum, but Senjougahara and Hanekawa are some of my favorite characters. Having them take such a backseat role in the story is a disappointment. Regardless, Araragi makes great strides as a character (his annoyed, protective attitude towards his sisters is great to see), Karen is awesome, and my curiosity about Shinobu grows even further (note that I am watching in airing order). Tsuhiki is neither here nor there, but that happens sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8]\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari is pretty fun. I miss the romantic moments between Araragi and Senjougahara/Hanekawa, and that totally bums me out. At the same time, it has some of the best moments in anime, like Araragi breaking out of his chains, the final fight scene, and, of course, the sensational toothbrushing scene. Somes the dialogue can be overbearing and lose the audience if they don't feel like something is actually happening, but sometimes the dialogue is spectacular. The fan-service is stronger and more perverse but doesn't really turn me off to liking the show at all. But I am a little perverse so...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 8]\\n\\n\r\nGood series. Art is unique and captivating, and even the audience can glean much on the topic of aesthetics just by watching. Dialogue is a big highlight, and it is more of Bakemonogatari's spice, so if you like that you'll like this. I feel like we are still in the building phase, so I will still be a disappointment if the series just continues in this fashion and the stakes don't raise. But so far the series is well-constructed and that gives me faith in what is to come. \\n\\n\\n",

Not because I like him, or that he has redeeming qualities. No, he's a horrible person, he's a con man that rips people off. That's okay, only novices think that you have to like a character for them to be good. Rather, what makes him good is that the stuff he does is interesting.\r\nIn the Monogatari series most of the characters like to jibba-jabba about stuff that's not even important or relevant to the narrative. But Kaiki is different. He movesthe narrative forward, he does things, he is, as I said, an interesting person to follow.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, chief bitch Hitagi tells him by the end that he needs to stay out of the city or she'll murder him. No idea why he doesn't report her to the police for death threats though. Apparently Hitagi can kill people and get away with it. Although, it's not hard to imagine considering the city, the setting that this show takes place in isn't populated by anyone so they likely don't have a police force.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I missed while I was reviewing Bakemonogatari is that Araragi's pedophilia toward Hachikuji technically is also within the bounds of necrophilia considering she's dead. Araragi is without a doubt the most fucked up character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, he doesn't stop there as there is an actual scene in this show where he brushes the teeth of his little sister and she is moaning hysterically, and it ends with what I can only describe as her having an orgasm. This is so blatantly an allusion to oral sex. So I think that actually happened, and they were trying to find an artsy way around it. I'll just have to add incest to the growing list of why Araragi is the most psychologically damaged person in this series.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, he's the main lead, and he's incredibly offensive as any woman that actually encountered someone like Araragi would claim that he raped her. And there's good reason to believe her accounting of such an encounter.",

Ah.... another Monogatari series to the list.\r\nThis season only consist of two arcs and lots of characters getting their screentime botched up to make way for this season's main attraction, The Araragi's Siblings.\r\nSo, yeah.... you basically going to watch eleven episodes filled with family issues and how our MC, Araragi Koyomi, going to handle them. Some of the previous season characters still getting their screentime here and there but, they are more like a background character here than a main character.\r\nThe art is meta and absurd and illogical sometimes as expected of the Monogatari series. The soundtrack, BGM, and OPare very good indeed. I mean, one of them turns into a meme. What better proof do you need that an Opening is great other than that?\\n\\n\r\nSome newly-introduced character dubbed as \"The Specialist\" (my own calling for them) is not just a backdrop character. They serve as a plot driver and contribute significantly to the previous season even though unknown to most, the specialist here acts as Oshino's replacement for the supernatural info here and there. There's also a surprise character for those who follow the broadcast order.",

            "content": "I'll never be able brush my teeth again, thanks for the trauma.\r\nStory:\r\nBefore watching I was curious if Nisemonogatari was more of what we already got in Bakemonogatari or if it would be a different experience. The answer is: both. We have more weird dialogues and more girls possesed by monsters. On the other hand, this season features actual villains, which we didn't really have in Bakemonogatari. This time we don't get a romance subplot (...or do we?), instead we focus on Araragis relationship to his sisters. Nise felt much slower than Bake, which is a shame seeing how it is only half as long. Ialso didn't like all the incest implications. It was still good enough for me, but not as good as it could have been, seeing how Bakemonogatari was.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing really changed in this department. It's still a little like an acid trip, but not to the extremes of the first season. What we do get more of instead is fanservice. If you didn't like the fanservice of Bakemonogatari (which wasn't that much in my eyes), you will likely not like watching Nisemonogatari. I personally don't mind that, but in combination with the pseudo-incest, it did feel a little disturbing every now and then.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nObviously no real difference except for the openings and ending. While I found the ending a little weaker than the Bakemonogatari one, the openings were better. I especially liked Karens ska-like theme, but the others were nice too. The voice acting was just as good as in season one.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs I already mentioned (multiple times), I really didn't like the incest undertones. They prevented me from enjoying the two new major characters Nisemonogatari introduces to us, the Araragi sisters. I thought they were kinda interesting and especially the dynamic between Karen and Koyomi works well. The two bad guys (yes, one is a girl, I know) were okay, not amazing but acceptable. But the one who stole the show of course was Shinobu. She was a completely different character from what she appeared to be in the first season and now I get we so many people like her so much. I heard she was supposed to be voiced by Aya Hirano, but Maaya Sakamoto is perfect. It's as if she was born to voice Shinobu.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI liked Bakemonogatari a little more, though watching this anime was easier, since it's shorter and less complex. The newly introduced (or rather newly fleshed out) characters were enjoyable and the introduction of villains was interesting. I didn't mind the heavier fanservice, but I did mind all the sister-touching. That really took a lot of fun out of watching Nisemonogatari for me. I don't mind such things in general, but here it was completely pointless and unnecessary. If you liked Bakemonogatari, I'd say the chances you like Nisemonogatari are about 2/3.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.4/10",

To summarize Nisemonogatari, it follows the same plot structure of solving a supernatural mystery involving a girl. This season follows only two girls, Koyomi's sisters Karen and Tsukihi, and each arc was stuffed with a lot more perverted filler.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nDefinitely not as plot driven as the Bakemonogatari. It talked about each of Koyomi's sisters: Karen and Tsukihi. This season was a lot more laid back and really took its sweet time in each sister's arc. Each arc explored a philosophy about the theme of \"falseness\" or what is considered genuine.Each arc had a \"prophet\": Karen's was Kaiki, Tsukihi's was Kagenui, and I guess Oshino was the prophet of Bakemonogatari. It took the whole season for me to be able to see this though, so if you are watching this looking for meaning or symbolism like in Bakemonogatari you will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThis season featured the same style as Bakemonogatari but was less artsy. There was more nasty stuff and less symbolism and less to interpret. The quality was still amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed all the theme songs. I really like how each character has their own theme song that relates to their plot line. \\n\r\nThe music during the show was modern and I enjoyed it the same as Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nAs with the plot, the character development was unfocused. There was minimal development for most of the existing characters, and Karen and Tsukihi's development was less apparent because it was spread thin in comparison to Bakemonogatari.\\n\r\nA character I found interesting was Shinobu. She was pretty important during the Bakemonogatari despite her having about 1% of the screen time and never speaking, but this season I got to meet her properly.\\n\r\nI liked each of the characters a lot before watching this season, so the development wasn't a problem for me. I was perfectly content just watching them run around doing random stuff that didn't progress anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI didn't think I was a pervert before watching this season. You will see how sick Koyomi's mind is and though it seemed so wrong, it was so right. \\n\r\nA fairly common criticism for Nisemonogatari was that it was a cash grab because of its excessive fan service. I didn't find that was the case because I was too busy enjoying the service as a fan.",

So... what do we have from Nisemonogatari. \r\nBasically, happened what I had feared. It's become more haremish. If we were to cut the fanservice part, it would remain like 1\\3. I think it's gone a bit too far. Furthermore, it reminds of a harem even more. Now, when Araragi's sisters so much involved. And now, when Araragi flirts with them throughout the whole show. \r\nThe plot itself here is rather simple, almost nothing significant happens, besides we get to know new characters. Also, Shinobu. Shebegins to transform from the furniture into a remnant of the legendary vampire who at long last finds herself quite bored. \\n\\n\r\nAraragi wasn't that much consistent with his words from the very beginning but here, he feels even more inconsistent. That refers to his actions as well. I don't know, for me he felt more, like, noble in previous shows. \\n\r\nAnother characters feel slightly different as well. Though, I'm all right with it because it may count for their developments. In case with Koyomi it's more like a degradation rather than a development. \\n\\n\r\nVisually it's just great as always. I'm almost got used to it. However, it often manages to satisfy my eye with new undiscovered ways.  It is odd. It is good. Even though, monogatari series concentrates on dialogues, it doesn't prevent it to have ridiculously good fighting scenes. Nisemonogatari isn't an exception. \\n\r\nSame applies to the sound. OP-s and ED-s are great. My personal favourite is the third OP with Tsukihi. \\n\r\nAt least, these two aspects don't upset me. \\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, I might say I don't like the turn monogatari series took. I'm sure it can offer much more, something more valuable than just sisters' fanservice. \\n\r\nI just hope the next show in the series will refrain from it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're alike me watching monogatari series the show after the show I guess there's no point in skipping this one, yet... well, see it and have your own judgment.",

I'm one of the types that understands its appeal but wow the amount of excessive, over the top fan service went way overboard here. What is known as the \"toothbrush\" scene is a clear example of getting really excessive with the fan service.\r\nThis could have been due to covering up the fact that the first arc spanned 7 of the 11 episodes. The first arc went at a snails pace compared to the whole Bakemonogatari. Half of those episodesfelt like filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of almost all the characters felt stagnant compared to Bakemonogatari. Many of the females only existed for fan service compared to Bakemonogatari, when there was a solid balance between character development and fan service. Some of the characters also suddenly change their personality to either fit fan service or to suddenly fit the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe only new characters which are the main character's sisters aren't nearly as polished as many of the characters in the original. The season focuses on them and it doesn't have nearly as much depth. Somehow the dialogue feels shallow, especially compared to Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is above average but actually not up to full SHAFT standards.

            "content": "Sequels are usually a thing that can either make or break a story. Some are intended to fill up the incompleteness its predecessor had, while some are pretty much cash grabs used to milk off the franchise.\r\nThe latter reception is often given to Nisemonogatari, the follow-up to the 2009 cult hit Bakemonogatari, originally based off a light novel series by Nisio Isin. This series covers the second arc of the light novels, running around the theme of what is fake and what is real.\r\nNise consists of two story arcs that are presented in 11 episodes, which cover the aftermath of Bake and the entry ofnew characters to spice up the world of aberrations. Our protagonist, Koyomi Araragi, resident pedophile and harem master, encounters new challenges that would only affect him, but also the inclusion of his sisters Karen and Tsukihi.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, Karen Bee, focuses on his elder younger sister, Karen, and the similarities they have in their resolve. This arc was pretty interesting that it also covers more ground with the other main characters from the previous arc, such as Sengoku, Suruga, and most especially Hanekawa, who ditched the long hair and glasses to disappoint the huge megane fanbase. The introduction of a new character, Kaiki, also brings up some interesting conflict into the philosophies of both Araragi and Senjougahara, and how the latter finally comes into terms with her past. The whole arc is filled with many character interactions, and Shinobu finally speaking after having no voice actress for Bake shows a lot into Araragi and her connection as master and servant.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, the second arc falls short due to its five-episode length and barely brings focus to the youngest sister, Tsukihi, save for the final few episodes. While it is kind of disappointing to have less screen time, her role in the arc cannot certainly be ignored as it puts up a great development with Araragi and Shinobu, and, uh...Karen, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe criticisms often thrown at Nise are its excessive and gratuitous fanservice, to the point that it's really uncomfortable to watch. But to be honest, it was definitely more wholesome than Bake. Nise has this feel of continuity while Bake works on introducing the characters and their traits and connections to the protagonist, giving the former a greater sense to develop these relationships through the classic Monogatari method of lengthy dialogue. The style of artistic narration is a big difference to Bake, which is the reason for its criticism. Nise seemed to appeal more to the audience through sexy camera angles that contrast with the overall theme of the franchise. While I couldn't argue with that, Nise is still more enjoyable to watch, thanks to the existing relationships and inclusion of new people into the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is made by Shaft, already well-known for its surreal and arthouse-like anime such as Bakemonogatari and Puella Magi Madoka Magica. I would like to give a job well done for the studio as they produced according to what they were going for. The thing with fanservice is, it's sometimes really weird to watch, and seeing it on screen emits an awkward effect for the viewers. However, Nise was one of the few times I enjoyed watching fanservice because it handles it in a provocative and different approach rather than just straight-up putting your hormones into overload. Nise has also more action than the previous entry, and while that has never been the focus of the Monogatari series it was a nice addition to the over-the-top style of mish-mash feel the animation has.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nToothbrush Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThe infamous toothbrush scene of Episode 8 may be one of the most controversial scenes in recent anime history, and that is true to this day.\\n\\n\r\nTo put into context, the main character Koyomi's sister Karen demands him that he introduce her to Suruga, who is a known basketball player in their area (Karen is a martial artist, something that's also within the field of sports). In order to test her, Koyomi challenges Karen to survive five minutes of getting her teeth brushed...by him.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't go explaining further, but as much as disgusting it may look on the outside, it was pretty amusing and educational. For one, I learned that brushing someone else's teeth has a psychological effect because you're not the one brushing your own teeth.\\n\\n\r\nAs for implications of incest wincest, eeeeehhhh whatever. It's not like the Monogatari series was mild to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr I liked the scene.\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack adds well to the feel of Monogatari being Monogatari, from the catchy opening songs (of which special mention goes to the third OP, Platinum Disco) and the background music that goes along well with the visual direction of the show. The voice actors were impressive as usual, and Maaya Sakamoto as Shinobu was a welcome addition to the voice cast. The dialogue is one of the strongest points of Monogatari, and it's not just because of the writing but also because of the emotion all these seiyuus put into their characters.\\n\\n\r\nI welcome Nisemonogatari into the franchise as much as the 2009 adaptation. It may be not one of the best entries, but it gave me more reason to love the series as more of its potential is explored. Is it a cash grab? Maybe. But it wasn't that bad of a show.",

            "content": "Compared to it's first season, this anime was a lot lighter, funner and had much more humour. Part of me actually was wondering if they were trying to appeal to a different, younger crowd instead of keeping what made its original so.. unique. \r\nOn that note though, it's not like I didnt enjoy it. It still  had it's witty dialogues and crazy story lines that kept me more than interested... however, I feel like they lost sight of a lot of the characters personalities and went a little over board. Senjogahara, the usual cold, Tsudere type has become more talkative and kinda underwhelming, Ididnt really understand why she would submit to Hanekawa so easily.. but I guess that's just the way they chose to go with it. Araragi, has become more popular with the girls, that was evident in the first season.. however again, his character almost develops into something unrecognizable as he was a lot more perverted and into playing that playboy role.. even though he's in a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nMeeting the sisters were also a nice new fresh touch to this season, but I feel like more time was spent on Karen then the younger sister, when technically the younger sisters story line could have been taken more seriously than the hornet. But that's just my opinion.",

            "content": "Well....where do I start with this one. To get it out of the way, i dont like incest and pedo fanservice. imo, just because its animated doesn't make it better, the idea itself is gross and I feel its meant to be a scapegoat for people so they feel they arent doing anything morally wrong for enojying it because its \"animated\". I also think thisis why the anime community gets a bad rep and I dont blame people for thinking that way.\r\nWith that being said I, like many anime fans, have to a certain extent become jaded to the concepts. So while the monogatari hasthe issue of including these concepts (and yeah I know its mostly there for laughs, but still), that still doesnt prevent me from enjoying the other aspects this show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off with Karen Bee, I think the arc maintained the charm the bakemonogatari series had. Some complained it was drawn out but pacing didnt feel like an issue for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe main issue was Tsukihi Phoenix. Now, I havent read the light novels. I was excited for this arc, as tsukihi as a character interested me. Boy was I dissapointed. Out of the 4 episodes she was given she hardly appeared in 2 of them. I dont need to go into why I didnt enjoy the first episode of tsukihi phoenix, I already explained that in my first para, though admittedly it was....very unique. The second episode was a decent enough introduction to the new characters (though once again, a criminal lack of tsukihi). And to be very frank the last 2 episodes were perhaps the best episodes of the entire nisemonogatari series. Tsukihi Phoenix had the potential of being the more interesting arc had they given time to it like Karen Bee and not rushed it and filled half of it with fanservice (i know it was part of light novels, but there's gotta be more to this arc right?) It really fell short.\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts on both arcs. The dialogue was interesting and quirky as always. The art and animation was fantastic. The music was good. Kaiki is an interesting character and Tsukihi > Karen as a character, I dont make the rules.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it has its flaws but nisemonogatari has its strong points as well",

            "content": "Now, I'll be honest here. I dropped Nisemonogatari when I first watched it. I came in expecting the next Bakemonogatari, what I ended up getting was completely different, and I dropped it. I even went so far as to declare the series dead in my eyes: that nothing would ever come close to the excellence of its predecessor, and it was a waste to even expect something decent anymore.\r\nIt took only one forum thread full of disagreeing people to change my mind. I quickly got my hands on the Blu-rays and got to watching; this time not expecting anything but disappointment. Now that I'm finished,this is my conception.\\n\\n\r\nBakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari are equal. They're just better at some things and worse at others.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari follows our resident high-schooler/pseudo-vampire/pedophile Araragi Koyomi shortly after the events of Bakemonogatari. Having rid five girls of their respective oddities in the last season, Araragi doesn't seem to have any urgent business to attend to. And it shows, especially in the first few episodes, which are nothing but Araragi screwing around with his friends and sisters. The plot only really begins to be explored around the fourth episode, where the first main antagonist (a con man named Kaiki Deishuu), is revealed and introduced. This story structure is why I was initially disappointed. Nisemonogatari, at least for the first few episodes, has almost no sense of urgency, something that was in abundance in Bakemonogatari. A problem is not introduced until at least the fourth episode, and the episodes leading up to this revelation are not full of foreshadowing and anticipation, but sexual comedy and assorted antics. Even after the problem is introduced, the sense of urgency doesn't really return like you'd expect, and the issue itself is approached and solved through more of the same: sexual comedy and assorted antics. The show only truly becomes intense during the final climax, which is where I found the most to love. If you're looking for serious, critical situations for our main protagonist to be thrown into, you will surely be disappointed; at least for a little while.\\n\\n\r\nBut within this weakness of a slow start lies Nisemonogatari's greatest strength: its dialogue. The conversations some of these characters have with each other are insane; employing copious amounts of jokes, wordplays, and references, all at blindingly fast speed. These numerous and extremely entertaining exchanges were not missing in Bakemonogatari, but because Bake focused much more on the mythology behind and ramifications of the respective oddities, there was much less room for these sorts of discussions than there was in the void of happenings that ruled Nise's first few chapters. What it comes down to is that if hilarious dialogues spoken in the oratory equivalent of rapid-fire sounds like something you'd be interested in, I'd implore you to watch this; especially so if you dropped it early because of the fan-service. These interactions will not leave you disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that has not changed from Bake to Nise is the quality of the art and sound. The art, done in the customary SHAFT fashion, with many abstract windows, objects, and designs, is truly a sight to behold in Nisemonogatari. The character art, again, is impeccable, with special mention going to the animation of Araragi's myriad of facial features, which really hit home with me and brought on more than a few laughs over the course of the show. The soundtrack is fantastic, with the OST's multiple styles being some of the highlights of Araragi's numerous fantastical adventures, typically melding to fit the mood of the scene, whether it be serious and pressing or cordial and casual. The voice acting steals the show once more, with exceptional deliveries coming from Kamiya Hiroshi (Araragi), Kitamura Eri (Karen), and Iguchi Yuka (Tsukihi). Once more, the obvious star is Kamiya Hiroshi, whose over the top line deliveries allow Araragi's dialogue to take on nearly a life of its own at some points. My only quip was the lack of catchy opening and ending songs. Naisho no Hanashi, the ending performed by Claris, was fine but not great, and neither of the two openings really appealed to me either. I guess we can't always have a Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari level ending, or a staple stable level opening, but for a highly anticipated sequel such as this, I expected just a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, while not the most deep and developed you will ever see, run the gambit and get the job done. The standout this season is not Araragi, actually, but rather Senjougahara, whose gradual change from tsundere sadist to regular, caring girl, can be seen here, despite her lack of screen-time compared to the last season. Everyone else is pretty much unchanged from Bakemonogatari, with the exception of Araragi's sisters, Karen and Tsukihi (which are developed exponentially and are given a much larger role), and Araragi himself, who has gone from slightly sexually frustrated do-gooder (who is occasionally perverted) to complete pervert, which isn't my favorite character transformation, but allows for many more entertaining and embarrassing exchanges between him and his friends, which, as I argued above, is really the core of this show. So in that regard, the change works, and I think the show is better for it.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari is far from the sexually charged fan-service-y trash I initially labeled it. It is indeed sexually charged, but it takes that charge and applies it to the fastest, most entertaining exchanges I've seen between characters since Hyouka, the funniest characters I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, the most passionate voice acting I've heard since Steins;Gate, and a very beautiful art style that blurs the line between background and abstract painting. If you haven't watched this yet, if you've been putting it off because you've heard unflattering things, or if, like me, you dropped it prematurely... let me be the one to tell you: this show is not Bakemonogatari. Arguably, it is nothing even close. But it is witty, funny, entertaining... and definitely worth your time.",

Offering the audience the most unusual humor from all other animes is what makes this anime stands out. Just like the word  'Courage' throw that in a sentence it will make anything sound righteous, \"Have the courage to waste my time to write a review\" (an example by me, try to understand the meaning of courage behind it that make me sound righteous, and sarcasm. lol, but please do not take it offensive. ).Hopefully that gives you a vague idea of where the show is going, every characters (8 girls so far, exclude the boy) have their own way of sarcasm.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nUnique art style from SHAFT in this anime. The art is also what back up the weird jokes or abnormal conversations, because is related to the meaning of the conversation. Amazing art is what will capture the viewers attention, and if the art is not the taste for you, it work wonderful with everything else.( I love the art)\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nThe 3 OP's is great one is Senj\u014dgahara, one is Karen, and now the latest Tsukihi, each sounded awesome. Now the background music is ... I don't know how to describe it, but it has the power to warp you into the mood of the scene, the music is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9\\n\r\nA lot is going on with the characters or a lots, you will never get tired of the sarcasm of different characters, from elementary school kid Hachikuji  Mayoi (my fav char, and hint 'Courage' is her quote), to the tsundere girlfriend Senj\u014dgahara Hitagi, to the fetish underclassman Kanbaru Suruga, to the \"Koyomi oniichan\" Sengoku Nadeko, to the class rep of the class rep Hanekawa Tsubasa, to the proud justice itself (that's right not the ally of justice) Araragi Karen and Araragi Tsukihi, and finally to the Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade (that's her name) loli vampire Shinobu (in fact she is 500 years old but took the child form).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\r\nDefinitely a prefect 10, it started off strong in Bakemonogatari with the art, the jokes, and now Nisemonogatari  carried the tradition and improve it in those aspect. For myself i have love the show more and more as each episode goes by, plus the light novel as i have finished all, and waiting for the final three novels this year.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\r\nThe Bakemonogatari series (all not one) is a great piece of work, one should not skip out on, because of what so ever reason, and is like trying to picking a red jelly bean out of the 100 green jelly beans (which one stands out). Well since this is my first review i hope you guys don't criticize too much since I need to \"Have the courage to write a review\".",

Since there are only 2 stories instead of 5, there is a lot more \"filler\" than there was in Bakemono. Even the filler is worse. A lot of the filler is fanservice, and there is much much more in this show than the last. The only good fanservice to come out of this show was the toothbrush scene (Don't judge me). The stories themselves are just as good in my opinion, justtoo long. This show probably could have been 6 episodes long instead is 11, which tells you how much filler there is. I liked the ending for each arc, and how they were tied together in the end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 25/35 - Bakemonogatari was good because of it's characters. In Nisemonogatari, all those characters are there, they just take even more of a back seat. My two favorite girls, Hitagi and Kanbaru, are even less important now. Araragi is even weirder than he was before, sexually harassing both his sisters multiple times. Because of this, I found his character to be less enjoyable in this show. His sisters were very fun though, as were the villains. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 12/15 - Because there is only 2 girls, there were less openings. They were still very good, but in this case less isn't more. The background music didn't sound much better than that in Bakemonogatari. Overall there really isn't much to say here. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 12/15 This was a big step up from Bakemonogatari. None of those stupid flashing screens with words anymore. Thank you. It would be perfect if the scenes weren't so oversexualized. Just like how the story had more fanservice than its predecessor, this show had way more sexual scenes. For example, Araragi's sister bent down to pick him up, so of course the show has to give us a close up of her ass and crotch. Things like this arent story related and I feel have more to do with the animation decisions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 72/100 - Both the story and the characters take a hit in Nisemonogatari, while the animation gets a much needed bump. The story here was the biggest letdown. While the Fire Sisters and the Villains keep the characters interesting, the sheer amount of fanservice and filler hinder the story way too much.",

            "content": "The Monogatari series, the story of half-vampire high school student Koyomi Arararararagi (sorry, I stuttered) and his sort-of harem of girls with various magical and spiritual afflictions, is a series of ups and down, containing some of my favorite and least favorite moments in all of anime. On the one hand, it's gorgeously animated and directed, taking full advantage of its medium to constantly keep you entertained with creative colors, cuts, and camera angles. On the other, it's remarkably up its own ass, sometimes to its benefit, sometimes to its detriment. On the one hand, it contains my absolute favorite relationship in all of anime.On the other, it thinks groping elementary-school girls is an acceptable running joke. It's a series of ideas and imagination that spring and explode in every which way, achieving brilliance just as often as it gets tangled in itself. Nisemonogatari, the second installment in the franchise, perfectly embodies this dichotomy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story here is told in two arcs, each one focusing on one of Araragi's sisters: Karen and Tsukihi. The first arc, centered around Karen's classmates suffering at the hands of a magical con man and her desire to take justice into her own hands, is Monogatari firing on all cylinders. The story weaves in Araragi's conflicted feelings about his sister's do-gooding as it relates to his own, Senjougahara's still-festering demons of the past, their constantly evolving, always delightful relationship dynamic, and themes about what the \"true\" way to be just is and what it means to be fake. It hits hard and fast with comedy and drama alike, weaving together complex streams of thought and dialogue into a rich tapestry that deepens Karen and Araragi's sibling bond and enriches both their characters. It even manages to do fanservice alright, aforementioned kid-groping nonwithstanding. It's highly entertaining and always engaging, marking a high point for the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, centered on Tsukihi's newly discovered magical malady, is utter garbage.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of reasons for that, but the biggest one is the fact that the entire first episode of the arc isn't focused on Tsukihi at all. Instead, it's focused on INCEST. That's right, that powerful sibling bond that Karen and Araragi just developed suddenly takes a turn for the perverted, with the whole episode spent on Araragi lusting after her, trying to deny his lust for her, and the show ogling her at every chance it can, climaxing (for lack of a less uncomfortable phrase) with him basically fucking her with a toothbrush. It's not funny, it's not clever, it's not interesting, and it made me want to vomit. To this day, it's the single most unpleasant anime-watching experience I've ever had, and I wish I could scrub it from my memory.\\n\\n\r\nEven beyond that horrible experience, though, the rest of the arc (only 4 episodes compared to Karen's 7) just isn't interesting. Tsukihi isn't even a character in her own story, spending all her time with various characters arguing about and over her while she lies unconscious thanks to her affliction. She's an object, something to be fought over by everyone else, not a character in her own right. There's no investment in it because we don't know enough about Tsukihi to care about her. Oh, but the show does find time for Araragi to strip her naked and grope her breasts before she goes all Sleeping Beauty, because of fucking COURSE it does. Who cares about actually developing her as a character when we can just imagine being her lord and master Onii-Chan?\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I am very divided on this one. Considering it sets up future characters and events, I can't very well recommend skipping Tsukihi's arc. It is part of Monogatari, as much as I wish it wasn't. But that's the give and take with this franchise. You're bounced around between brilliance and bullshit, and you do your best to admire the (admittedly much more frequent) good stuff before it drops you into shit again. In that way, Nisemonogatari is very much the series' standard bearer, for better and worse. But at the very least, it gave me plenty of Senjougahara being the fucking best, so I guess I can't complain too much.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I actually can, but whatever.",

            "content": "*THE RATINGS FOR THIS ARE SPECIFIC TO THE PART, BUT THE REVIEW IS FOR THE OVERALL SERIES*\r\n[STORY: 10/10]\r\nThe Monogatiri series comes together well to create a masterpiece of a story. This show is much deeper than alot of people think. It is filled to the brim with philosophical arguments and great storytelling. The focus isn't mainly on action, though it does have some visually stunning action scenes. Alot of the time, it will just be conversations between characters, but this is the blood that keeps this series alive and flourishing. Without it, you'd have a normal show with above average production. This type of showisn't for everyone, but I personally love it.\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe animators went all out animating this show, as detail and flamboyance embody the artistic direction of this show. Each character's design and set piece is carefully planned out, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 10/10]\\n\r\nThe voice actors become their characters when they act them out, that's how into them they get. They really care about their role, you can tell. And sound effects are well done as well, nothing seems off in that department.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 10/10]\\n\r\nMost every character is important to the main plot of the story and if they aren't a main character, the style of the show makes it seem as if they don't even exist. Whether they be designed as set pieces or outlines, the show really puts emphasis on those we really care about. These characters are no joke either, pretty much none of them are one-dimensional wastes of time, which is very appeciated.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10]\\n\r\nThough some parts of the series are better than others, the series as a whole is truly an amazing body of work that I consider a masterpiece. This story is filled to the brim with beautifully crafted characters, artwork, sound design, and an amazing story that philosophically challenges the observer to think. A masterful work by Isin Nisio.",

            "content": "After waiting what i now know to be far too long. I have finished Nisemonogatari. And wow was that a ton better than Bakemongatari. Like wow.\r\nNot to knock Bake really, but it was very rough around the edges for me. Had a lot of good ideas and laid a lot of solid groundwork, i just felt it didn't do as much as it could've in 15 episodes. Still enjoyed it. Had lot of great moments, Ep 12 and Ep 15 being absolutely amazing. But it still felt like it stumbled hard in those first 6 to 8 episodes.\r\nAnyways, Nise took everything Bake did and everythingBake introduced and made it so much better.\\n\\n\r\nAraragi is now one of my absolute favorite characters in anime, at least top 20 or something like that. He really came into his own this time, in Bake he felt more like a plot device than an actual character in his own right. Like he just served to solve the girl's problems and nothing more. However, in Nise, he actually showed a ton of personality and depth. He had some great wit and sarcasm that was a joy to watch. Then he had some great emotional moments too with his sisters and with Hachikuji and with Shinobu.\\n\\n\r\nHis loyalty to his sisters was amazing. His speech to Karen in Ep 7 was perfect in every way. In fact, any time he spoke to Karen about her ans Tsukihi about the two of them being the Fire Sisters was awesome to see. The dynamic the three of them had was incredible and automatically believable.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the Fire Sisters, i think Nise being focused around them was partially what made it so much more enjoyable for me. As any time they were on screen it was such a treat to watch. Karen was especially cool with her interactions with Koyomi being cute and sweet sibling interactions. Tsukihi was a sweety too. Her arc in the later part was great and worked well.\\n\\n\r\nBut by far Karen Bee was more enjoyable than Tsukihi Phoenix for me. Actually, now i'd call Karen Bee my favorite arc so far as having Kaiki in there mixed things up. Having an actual tangible \"villain\" in there was good. As it wasn't just some random supernatural creature we didn't really see until like the end of the arc or something. Tsukihi Phoenix was fine. Not bad. but not really great either. Ononoki and Kagenui were decent enough \"villains\" but not too noteworthy for me. They were serviceable, which was fine for me at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 4 or 5 eps of Nise were really amazing all the around. The direction, the colors, the dialogue, the cinematography were all amped up it seemed. Like within the first 5 or 10 minutes of ep 1 i know this was going to be much better than Bake. The reintroduction of the previous girls, Hanekawa, Senjougahara, Kanbaru, Hachikuji, and Sengoku was pretty great. All getting a solid scene to put them back into perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOf the previously introduced girls Hachikuji and Sengoku certainly got a step up. The scene were Araragi goes to Sengoku's house was pretty darn adorable honestly. Her crush on him is the cutest thing. Like holy hell. Adorable.\\n\\n\r\nHachikuji had some great conversations with Araragi all throughout Nise really. She was a great confidant for Araragi to have. Her purposely saying his name wrong is equally cute too. Ararararararagi.\\n\\n\r\nHanakawa........Hanakawa......well now. She's like so damn good. Like shit. She may have had only a small bit to do in Nise, but wowzers did she make the most of it really. Helping Karen and Tsukihi out with their problem was sweet and somewhat motherly. She was just as good as Bake for me. Didn't miss a step at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, when it comes to Shinobu...she was so damn good!!!! Love her! She's awesome! Like hell, she's great. The bath scene with her and Araragi was a perfect scene. The conversations she had wit Araragi throughout Nise were all solid scenes. Her little love for Donuts is cute too. Her abundant confidence and absolute belief in herself is admirable and highly rspectable too. She showed a lot this time and i loved it a lot really.\\n\\n\r\nNow i want to come back to Kaiki himself for a bit here. Solid \"villain\", he was great. The scene that introduced him with the backdrop of the red trees and red sky. OMG that was a perfect scene. Then his conversation with Araragi and Senjougahara in ep 7 was some amazing dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the colors this time though. They were so much better too. Red is such a great color to me. Especially crimson and maroon. Of which Nise used both perfectly and to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: i know i rambled a bit here and my paragraph structure isnt the best. But i think that fits Monogatari pretty damn well actually. Personally, i loved Nise. Much better than Bake. I know within about the first 10ish minutes of ep 1 that i'd enjoy this a lot more and i certainly did. Everything about Nise was just plain better. BetterMonogatari is its new name now.\\n\\n\r\nA major step up.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10.",

            "content": "\"In a way, the supernatural is what's behind the curtain. Normally, you only need to see what's happening on stage. That's how reality works. If you don't know, it's best that you don't.\"\r\n--Mayoi Hachikuji\r\nNisemonogatari is the second installment of the now critically-acclaimed smash hit Monogatari franchise. Continuing the exploits of Koyomi Araragi from the first installment (Bakemonogatari), in this one he focuses on a much smaller group of heroines while still spending some time with the characters he and audiences grew to care for over the course of the first installment. \r\nIs it a worthy successor to Bakemonogatari? Well, yes and no. One of thethings that made Bakemonogatari such a smash hit was Shaft's unrestrained use of rapid-fire visual imagery to accentuate the action or dialogue on screen. Nisemonogatari follows through on this tradition, but in an oddly restrained fashion. I found myself genuinely missing the odd visuals and Japanese text scrolling at a ballistic pace across the screen, spicing up the extremely lengthy dialogues that take place throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the art style is a direct continuation of the minimalist work in Bakemonogatari. Every frame feels very clean, and there is a lot of color contrast in just about every frame, making it easy to focus on the important actors on screen. Stark whites, deep reds, and cloying yellows are used the most, and the animation never disappoints either, showcasing Studio Shaft's unique trademarks while wowing the audience.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the first installment of the series, Nisemonogatari is packing a fantastic soundtrack and score. The OPs are all listenable, but the third one, \"Hakkin Disco\", is a real treat. The ED song is a very high-energy, fistpumping sort of song accompanied with all sorts of chaotic visuals. Again, the voice acting is premium, as the all-star cast returns and continues to put forth powerful performances from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of Nisemonogatari's story falls to Koyomi's lovely imoutos: the \"Fire Sisters\", Karen and Tsukihi. While in Bakemonogatari they were barely present, here they take front and center stage, and are both afflicted with supernatural oddities that protagonist Koyomi must help them fend off and overcome. Hitagi Senjougahara, Koyomi's now-girlfriend and one of the \"best girls\" in all of anime, receives a bit of side focus. So too does Shinobu Oshino, the lolita vampire literally shadowing Koyomi everywhere he goes. Each of them gets some fantastic development. I went into this installment expecting to hate Karen, but she turned out to be the star of the show, in my opinion. She's a precocious, ass-kicking, firecracker of a girl, reminiscent of Rin Natsume from Little Busters! in a way.\\n\\n\r\nThe other new character introduced is Kaiki Deishuu, a gloomy, creepy con artist who is himself familiar with the supernatural, and his arrival in Koyomi's peaceful town is what precipitates the events of the series. Enigmatic and sinister, he captures the viewer's attention in every scene. Shinichiro Miki (Bleach, Fullmetal Alchemist) gives the man a creepy voice reeking of disdain.\\n\\n\r\nOne cannot discuss Nisemonogatari without mentioning the fact that yes, the fanservice has been ramped up to an almost insane degree in this installment. At some points it becomes so over-the-top that it almost devours the plot. While I'm all for showing some skin, there's a saturation point where it stops being titillating and starts becoming disturbing, and Nisemonogatari crossed that point with nothing more than a bed and a toothbrush. Make no mistake, this series earns every inch of its R-17 rating, and Koyomi is a man of very few scruples. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nMy experience with Nisemonogatari was truly a mixed bag. It wowed me in a lot of places, bored me a couple times (the first couple episodes are just recap/checking in with characters who don't appear for the rest of the season), and disturbed me a few times (erm... dental hygiene, and the geysers of blood shed in the climactic finale). I did like the philosophical tone of the season. It asks real compelling questions: Who decides what is real and what is fake? What is the value of a fake? And if something that is fake is indistinguishable from the real, is it still inherently inferior? These questions left me thinking, and that's something to cheer about. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they'd spent more time discussing these concepts and a bit less time focusing on Suruga Kanbaru's shapely ass, but that's Nisemonogatari in a nutshell: a quality continuation that excites, frustrates, and imposes some heavy cringe on the viewer, but nonetheless compels the audience to keep watching, to see what's around the next corner. Whenever you feel like you've had enough of Koyomi's perversion, there's always a sudden character appearance, a mystery hook, or a warm and touching scene to keep you invested. \\n\\n\r\nIt's worth watching if Bakemonogatari managed to hold your interest the whole way through. Until next time, remember to always keep your teeth clean and your family close.",

            "content": "This is a particularly challenging series to rate. Nisemonogatari has the signature art, sound, humorof its predecessor. The introduction of the first episode is extremely strong with hilarious signature interaction between Araragi and Senjougahara. Then comes the gradual decent into fanservice.\r\nThe prequel Bakemonogatari was a very enjoyable series and, in all fairness, did contain a fair bit of fanservice. At some points the fanservice even teetered towards particularly distasteful. However most of the time it was fairly innocent or more often than not was used only to the extent that it legitimately supported a joke that was actually funny. I can personally tolerate fanservice eventhough I do not see the need for it - as such I did not let it bother me in the prequel to this series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever in Nisemonogatari it is elevated to excess. While there is nothing particularly graphic there are entire episodes devoted to sexual innuendo, somewhat visual paedophillic insinuations as well as incest. Furthermore it is rarely used to support a joke, if anything weak jokes are used in what appears to be the author's attempt to cover up his warped (and illegal) sexual preferences. The issue goes beyond the inclusion of too much fanservice. The series is in fact dominated by it to the detriment of the story, humor and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said if you don't mind the occasional naked 8 year old being thrown in your face as well as the main character's personality being butchered (which is ignored as if it never happens) and a frequent lack of story progress you may be able to enjoy this series.

Episodes were full of word play, meaningless conversations about sexual themes and lolicon attitudesof Araragi Koyomi. But some viewers neglected this and focused on rescuing girls and fighting supernatural beings.\\n\\n\r\nIn Nisemonogatari there is simply no way to ignore fan service and ecchi dialogues any longer as the action quantity drops. Because of that sequel made full-of-fan-service impression although it just develops further something present in Bakemonogatari. Some scenes of sequel are very close to hentai and even lolicon. But as I tolerable to this I found no problem in completing and re-watching this show several times. Nisemonogatari is outstanding because of synergy of its story, art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nStory is character-driven with postmodernist and abstract style. Nisio Isin - writer of Monogatari series ranobe - is remarkable for his breaking of fourth wall to create illusion of conscious characters. They can speak about anything - IT sector in Russia, pseudo philosophical problems, plans on future, life-long bond, someones past or underwear. They don't follow common sense or any rules and can do pretty much anything. They can reflect hours on meaningless things or make important decision in a second. This makes characters unpredictable in comparison to most of anime or literature characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt is abstract and heavily used to tell the story. Captions on the road, street signs, a strand of hair to symbolize Araragi family - there are a lot of details which are incorporated in story and character design. Mind-blowing architecture, saturated colors, changing lightning conditions - it seems like artists don't wanted to draw same motionless background every frame. Some frames are heavily packed with information which make re-watching even more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack covers several genres but mainly uses minimalistic sometimes multi-layered compositions. Sound perfectly fits the story and amplifies abstract feel of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut main enjoyment of series is seeing thoughtful integration of story, art and soundtrack. I cannot imagine Nisemonogatari without any of this component altered or completely changed.",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari Review: Supernatural Little Sisters\r\nWell I finished Nisemonogatari, taking it much slower than I did Bakemonogatari and I think I liked it more. This may be due to my love for shows like Oreimo and other shows having to do with little sisters, but I liked it a decent amount. So here is the review of Nisemonogatari:\r\nThis season focuses on three characters which got essentially no screen time in the first season:\r\nKaren, Tsukihi, and Shinobu,\r\nNow personally I loved all these characters with Shinobu being my favorite, followed by Karen, then Tsukihi. I was predisposed to Shinobu though because she is the whole reason Ieven watched this show, though I am seeing more and more that I am Araragi though not with such a sense of justice. \\n\\n\r\nThe show begins with the Karen Bee arc and pretty much goes around seeing what all the other girls from Bakemonogatari are up to, and then doesn't address Sengoku or Kanbaru for the rest of the show, with the others having some roles to play. Eventually it finally brings the focus to Karen and then Shinobu, this is where the season really kicks off and gets into the funny over the top scenes lined with beautiful set pieces. All the characters focused on in this season were addressed in the first season but not developed. Karen and Tsukihi were just pushing Araragi at the end of every arc in Bakemonogatari and Shinobu didn't say a word.\\n\\n\r\nKaren is a strong character who constantly tries to better herself similar to Rock Lee from Naruto (speaking of doing too many hand stands). She can at points be tsundere but for the most part is happy go lucky and whimsical in nature. Later in the Tsukihi Pheonix arc is where she really shines as her conflict has been resolved and she is allowed to be herself. She has this fun attitude and just makes me laugh and smile. Though i have noticed a trend throughout this series that characters seem to become so much better once their issues have been addressed, its like your waiting for their issue to be fixed so you can see if you truly like them.\\n\\n\r\nShinobu is the next character I will address as she is the next to be developed, she is just what I was wanting out of her. A character which knows that they have fallen from grace but refuses to accept this and still exudes power and superiority. She does not want to admit she wants to help a human and thus demands that Arraragi command her to do what he wants so that she feels she has no choice and doesn't have to acknowledge that she has fallen to his level. She is a cute tsundere character that admits to being tsundere as most characters in the show do. Her voice actor is great and it fits that role of a vastly superior yet young person. I loved every moment that she was once screen.\\n\\n\r\nTsukihi is the last character I will address, she is funny in the way that she is psychotic in many ways, when she walks in to find Araragi and Shinobu in a bath together she comes back with a knife ready to murder Shinobu and Araragi, when the infamous toothbrush scene comes up she asks what they are doing in a demented way before going to the store to buy an Awl. She is a character that though quite tsundere and just as psycho bitch as Senjougahara still loves Araragi as a brother. Tsukihi was the only character so far that actually was fleshed out as her character really is before and during her arc, save for Hanekawa though she had her issue addressed before the show began.\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a large amount of fan service in it, though in my opinion it was fine because it matched the overall tone of this season. It was happy, awkward, and just plain weird at points\\n\r\nBut that is how the show is, there aren't many other shows where in one episode you can get a philosophical talk, loli fanservice, imouto fanservice, beautiful artwork, amazing fight scenes, and hilarious visuals. There just aren't many out there. Whereas the first season was something you really should sit back and watch to admire the set pieces and the conversations, this season focused much more on fanservice, and hilarious visuals. Which made it a fun ride all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nAlso up for mentioning is the Karen bee opening which I loved on a visual level and an auditory level, to the point that I downloaded the song to my phone and put in my ever growing anime song playlist. \\n\\n\r\nThis show really should be watched, especially if you enjoyed the first season.\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\r\nAnimation: 9 (not as abstract as season one, more grounded)\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (in my opinion the characters were better though I just love these more this go round)\\n\r\nSound: 8 (Just as good as the first season with the only standout track being the Karen bee opening)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (this honestly barely missed going into my top five favorites)\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9.25",

            "content": "Nisemonogatari  review \r\nNisemonogatari is the most bold piece of puzzle from the Monogatari Series  were the author used a visual vocabulary to relay a message for the viewer. That visual vocabulary consists in fanservice and some chaotic fights between Araragi and his sisters.\r\nWhat was the purpose of using such a daring concept in his writing style? Well all the fanservice used had a purpose and meaning to answer Araragi\u2019s doubts and feelings about his two sisters Karen and Tsuki. \r\nThe series portrayed different insights of Araragi\u2019s emotional state starting with Nadeko\u2019s attempt to seduce him with no effect at all in the endto the brother-sister  daring kiss and boobs touch. Believe it or not these actions were well used in nisemonogatari for the plot giving a meaning to the story  and helping with the characterization of Araragi and his sisters Karen and Tsuki.\\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari beside the daring fanservice used to convey a message introduced  new characters that will have a lot of influence in the next series Kaiki ,Kagenui and Yotsugi. The anime also presented a piece of  puzzle from Senjougahara\u2019s past called Kaiki and with the confrontation between them  ,she faced  her past adding a new level to her characterization. \\n\\n\r\nNisemonogatari also puts in discussion the aspect of morals between humans. As a example the dialogue scenes between Kaiki and Senjougahara were they both criticize the naivity of  the middle school students who were exorted for money by a con artist.The breaking of the moral line between incest and brother sister love is put in the spotlight with Araragi\u2019s actions and visual vocabulary used by the author.\\n\\n\r\nNise as the name suggest puts in the spotlight the discussion if the fake is better than the real one. Well with the help of our character Araragi and with Kaiki\u2019s actions the message becomes more like a  lesson of philosophy for the viewer.\\n\r\nThe chaotic fight between Araragi and his sister Karen is another lesson of philosophy about what means to be strong. It\u2019s not all about power and force brute as long as your conviction and mind is weak that\u2019s what the message the fight portrayed .\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Nisemonogatari despite it\u2019s overused fanservice has an important role in creating a bridge that connects the other series to the final destination called Monogatari series. It presented an insight to Araragi\u2019s family and delivered a lesson of morality and philosophy about brother-sister love and contrast between fake and real. \\n",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nAfter re-watching this season multiple times, I have a new understanding of how important this season of Monogatari is to the series as a whole. Some of the most important character development occurs in this season and it unfortunately gets looked over.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI find it very hard to take people\u2019s criticism of this season seriously when all they boil it down to is \u201cthat fanservice season\u201d. I don\u2019t see how you are able to downplay all the extraordinarily important character development moments (Araragi and other characters testing the fire sister\u2019s justice resolve, Shinobu opening up to Araragi for the firsttime since the film, ext) just because there is more fanservice in this season than the others. On top of that, the fanservice involving Araragi\u2019s sisters is revelant to another important plot point to the series; the home environment and relationship between the siblings due to their absent parents. In such an environment where the parent figures are absent, it is very plausible for a relationship like this to occur. To say the show is \u201cbad for having it\u201d is like saying Shawshank Redemption is bad because it takes place in jail.\\n\r\nThis season shows us so many important key moments in character development. These moments help define key actions later on in the series. Yes there is fanservice and if that bothers you then stop watching Monogatari as a whole because it is a part of its identity.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t think I would ever consider something \u201cperfect\u201d, that was until I saw the animation in this show. The animation in this anime is very well done. It\u2019s not only the quality of each scene but also the angle of the shots, the transitions between text to shot, the lighting, everything is just so well done it\u2019s very hard to understand how well the animation studio did. Each scene is drawn and produced so well that if seen from across the room you might think it was on par with a budget of a movie rather than an ongoing show. Each character is very appealing to watch and even the very action orientated scenes flow smoothly. This is by far one of the best looking anime\u2019s I have ever experienced.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about talking (some of the conversations literally last 15 minutes) so you're going to want to enjoy what you are listening to right? Good thing Nisemonogatari has your back. The opening and closing themes are all very enjoyable to listen to as it ranges from j-pop to jazzy songs (I especially liked Tsukihi's opening). The voice acting is also very well done as all the characters had corresponding voices that seemed to fit correctly with the main star being Koyomi's voice actor. He once again brings out Koyomi's every emotion flawlessly without it coming off as fake or forced. For a show that relies so much on just character interaction, the voice acting really helped these long conversations shine. Overall the sound for this anime was well above par.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe recurring characters personalities are just as enjoyable as they were in the previous season. In this season, we are introduced to Koyomi\u2019s sisters and get to know the vampire Shinobu much more in-deph. Koyomi\u2019s sisters range from an athletic tomboy who fights for what\u2019s right to a very clever and masochist girl who aids her sister. I especially loved Karen as the minute we were introduced to her I knew I was going to love her character. Each gets a plethora amount of character development time to fully develop. The vampire Shinobu plays a much bigger role in this season. She also has a masochist-like personality that likes to play tricks on Koyomi. The new characters introduced this season are very well written and a joy to watch interact with Koyomi. I just wished the characters from Bakemonogatari played a bigger roll in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile Bakemonogatari will remain one of my all-time favorites, Nisemonogatari will remind me that something so different can be just as good. With the characters written so well, animation being perfect, and voice acting exceeding my expectations, this is an anime you do not want to miss out on. I do however strongly encourage watching Bakemonogatari first as you might be very lost not doing so when starting Nisemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "So I was 247 characters into this review when i had to stop and go back and re-read my review of Bakemonogatari to confirm the two pretty much said the very same thing. This gave birth to the thought that one really REALLY should watch the first series before watching this one. Not that it's diminished without it, on the contrary; the mark of an anime as brilliant as this is that one need not have any prior information or experience with the series to enjoy either, or any of them as told from a non linear point of view as I've only watched Bakemonogatariand Nisemonogatari as of this review. \\n\r\nWhich, finally, brings me to my point. You already know you're going to watch it. You watched the first series didn't you? If you didn't then you should BUT you don't need to, in case you have some sort of aversion to watching first series or quality anime.\\n\r\nAnd if you did, then you already know you want to see more. The only issue is crunchyroll not having the last three episodes of Bakemonogatari and Nisemonogatari not directly filling those blanks. Which, I kind of liked because it meant I had to pay attention and learn information to fill in said blanks. \\n\r\nMy only real complaint is it's not for everyone, some with triggers that require warnings may have issue with some scenes and subject matter. \\n\r\nOther than that WATCH IT! IT'S GREAT AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY I STILL WATCH ANIME AFTER NEARLY FOUR DECADES!\\n",

            "content": "Bakemonogatari became a massive hit in the anime industry due to just how well-polished it was. Its beautiful animation and catchy music helped elevate the impact of its well-developed storyline, memorable characters, and unusually-captivating dialogue. \r\nThe main series director of Nisemonogatari, Tomoyuki Itamura, worked on a few episodes of Bakemonogatari before tackling this series. It seems like he understood the basics - he made sure we got to see all the old cast and their interactions with Araragi, as well as making sure the art and sound remained above average.\r\nHowever, it seems that Tomoyuki had some fetishes he wanted satisfied as well, letting certain importantelements of Bake take a backseat in favor of his sexual gratification.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing one might notice about Nisemonogatari is that it only covers two arcs over the course of eleven episodes. The first seven-episode arc, \"Karen Bee\", spends its first three episodes reminding us of the main cast of Bake and what they look like naked. The majority of these episodes is entertaining, but really just filler.\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes aren't completely filler or skippable due to some subtle details that add up throughout the episodes, but at least a full episode of this arc could have been knocked off with more tight summarization without the story losing anything. However, once \"Karen Bee\" picks up, it remains as captivating due to its supernatural elements and story as Bake was.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc opens on what is basically fanservicy filler (*cough* toothbrush *cough*) that could be recapped in about five minutes, but since I enjoyed it and it's so infamous to the franchise I'm more forgiving of it then the first arc's filler. I ended up preferring the second arc over the first arc for having less filler and getting right to the point. It distinctively felt more like Bake, which is a great thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I do recommend this second season to anyone who enjoyed Bake. While the focus is lost a bit in favor of sexual deviancy and long chains of dialogue, the filler of the story at least has some entertainment value. Even though the overall story and introduction of our new characters starts out weaker then Bake, you'll come to appreciate them and care about their struggles by the end.",

            "content": "With the release of Bakemonogatari in 2009 Studio Shaft had created an anime that would forever change the way anime fans view the company. Bakemonogatari was very unique in both style and execution. With no other anime doing what it had done or, at least, not in the same fashion. Needless to say, it was a phenomenal success. So the announcement and release of a sequel, should be far from surprising.\r\nNisemonogatari picks up exactly where Bakemonogatari left off. Although, that is to say, with the main character Araragi conversing with many different characters in hilarious ways. The plot in this show is not overarching buttold in many minor arcs. Allowing for most of this show to be seen out of order, although most would probably not recommend it even though it is entirely possible.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters from the previous season are present but more are added while others sacrifice screen time. The largest of these being Nadeko who only shows up for a single five minute scene in one episode. The \u201cnew\u201d characters are Shinobu and the Araragi sisters, Karen and Tsukihi. I say \u201cnew\u201d because while these characters were present in Bakemonogatari they were simply names with a seiyuu. They had no development, practically no lines, and absolutely no story. They were simply just there.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a second season though, so chances are if you enjoyed the first season you will enjoy the second season. Also the extraordinarily increased production and animation quality certainly make this a standout. However, there are a few notable differences from the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost being the plot and structure. Most of the season feels like filler content, with nothing really happening plot wise. These episodes consist of nothing but essentially pointless character interactions. While that might sound negative, it in fact is the opposite. I said in my Bakemonogatari review that the best aspects of the show are it\u2019s characters and dialogue, while it\u2019s plot was it\u2019s downfall. Nisemonogatari seems to fix that for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters introduced are all fun and quirky with Shinobu being the standout in my opinion. Only person more interesting and enjoyable on screen than Shinobu, is Hitagi herself.\\n\\n\r\nI have to make a comment on the fan service. Nisemonogatari seemed to have more fan service in it\u2019s first four episodes than the entirety of Bake. That\u2019s not even including the infamous \u201ctoothbrush scene\u201d. However, all things considered the one thing I will give credit to this series, is how unique it is. Even when it comes to the fan service it\u2019s done in such an interesting an artistic way, you could make up an entirely different name for it. This whole series seems to be in a genre of it\u2019s own already. Despite my complains though, it doesn\u2019t hamper my enjoyment, but at the same time, it doesn\u2019t enhance it either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Nisemonogatari is a fantastic addition to the Monogarai series. It was able to keep the charm of the original series while adding new elements and characters without feeling forced.\\n\\n\r\nSome people disliked the change in direction, but I think it\u2019s heading down a good path.",
