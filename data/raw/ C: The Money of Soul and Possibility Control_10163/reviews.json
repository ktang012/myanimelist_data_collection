I honestly thought it was a good anime!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is very original, the first with a setting and plot like this that I've ever seen. It does get confusing at points, especially near the end, but it really kept me entertained. I think it just needed a few more episodes to develop it more.\r\nArt: 9\r\nI really loved the art, it's just the kind I like ^^ I enjoyed how they made the creepy Midas guy (forgot his name ^^\") kind of 3D, though it was a bitweird in the beginning and took some getting used to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI like how the main character honestly has no idea what the heck he was doing in the beginning, and how he and his asset interacted. I think there should have been more episodes (once again) so that there would have been better character development, and I would've liked to have seen Masyu and Kimimaro interact with each other more and to have seen more of their battles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis was a really entertaining anime. It requires a lot of thought, so if you aren't in the mood for a thinking anime, don't watch it. It has some action, but it's definately not a mainstream battle anime. It's interesting and has some cute little romance going on between the main chara and his asset. The only thing I really have to complain on is the ending. It just cut off. It seemed like a good 30 seconds or so was hacked off of the end. Other than that, I think it was a pretty good anime, and definately worth your time ^^",

            "content": "First I have to say that this is only my second review, and I only write reviews for anime that I think are underrated. This review may be some what one sided, but I honestly feel this anime deserves a lot more respect than what it is given, so I'm here to balance things out a bit. Overall I give this anime a rating of 10, which may seem too high and simply not true, but I guess it all comes down to perspective right?\r\nNot everyone believes in the same thing, not everyone sees things the same way. Some people live for the future andothers live in the moment. That seems to be the basic underling philosophical concept explored in this anime, and the fate of Japan depends on how the main characters handle this question. They certainly could have done a better job at exploring the concept, but for an 11 episode anime you can't really fault them for giving it a good try.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will dislike the philosophical nature of this show, they might even consider it to be contrived and convoluted, and an unnecessary addition to an otherwise great anime. It is of course moderately convoluted and hard to understand at points, with small holes in the plot and a lack of some character development. However, this anime is attempting to explore complex philosophical questions that don't necessarily have one right answer.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of the story is not economics, in fact it would be pointless to criticize the economic theories presented in this anime, because it is after all a fictional show and the validity of the economic reasoning presented herein is far beyond the point of what this anime is really about. To claim the philosophical struggle between wanting a good present and wanting a good future destroys this anime, is to claim the fundamental foundation of this anime should simply be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning it is clear the underlying basis for this story is a struggle between two different paradigms and ideologies about what really matters in this reality. The economic overlay is simply a fitting way to present those philosophical conflicts and create the framework for a story containing characters who are given the chance to accumulate vast wealth and thus wield great power of the state of reality and the future of our reality.\\n\\n\r\nEven if it comes off as nonsensical babble to half the people who watch it, there is always something you can get from an anime like this, even if half of it doesn't make much sense to you. The story isn't as disconnected and structureless as it may first appear, although it certainly isn't perfect either. The spectacular art and gripping action make up for any downfalls this anime may have, and you will certainly not struggle to keep watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe main idea behind this story line involves a hidden world of money and fierce battles (so called \"deals\"). The Financial Districts are other worldly realities where only a select few are granted access. These hidden realities exist in all major economic epicenters of powerful nations, and the people plunged into this world are given an \"asset\" (some sort of creature) with which they must fight for the security of their future. Each \"Entre\", as they are called, have different goals and motives for fighting these battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line of this anime is extremely unique, nothing else like it exists. That alone makes it worth watching, because the majority of anime made these days seem to lack any true individuality and just take from plots that we've seen over and over again. While it does have a few small holes, I feel they did an excellent job at fitting so much into 11 episodes. There was hardly any filler at all and even though there was a lack of character development they used their time wisely.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that they had a goal in mind from the start and reached that goal in a more conclusive and satisfying manner than most animes are able to achieve. If you think they strayed off onto wild tangents and didn't seem to know where they wanted to take it, then I would say you need to watch it again and watch it much more closely this time. Although a bit predictable, they did build up the story in a meaningful way to reach their desired outcome.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is this anime is without fault. The style of the art has some very unique features, such as a sort of digital blocky overlay effect present in certain parts of the anime to facilitate scene transitions and the presence of an asset. It also uses a mind-boggling blend of 3D and 2D visuals that doesn't particularly disturb the overall feel of the artwork, but provides outstandingly detailed and colorful scenery that captures the imagination and jumps out of the screen, particularly in the financial district.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also moderately unique, especially the designs of the two lead assets, Msyu and Q. The character designs of these human-like assets will certainly provide all the cuteness and uniqueness one desires in appearance of certain female character roles. The quality of the art is very high quality and extremely detailed, and is probably one of the strongest features of this anime. It is very fluid and the emotional expressions of most characters are very clear and easy to read.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile I didn't really pay much attention to the sound, it was definitely very good quality and suited the anime very well. The action scenes had gripping and intense dramatic music and the emotional scenes had deep and heavy scores that echo the gravity of each situation nicely. The character voices were actually very good, and in particular I thought the voice of Masakaki was extremely well done, and helped a lot to enforce the ominous insanity of his character.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, they did skip out a bit on character development, but it still deserves an 8 because the relationship development between the main character Kimimaro and his asset Msyu was actually very well done. I don't really get sucked into the relationship aspects of most anime, but I couldn't help admire the way their relationship grew stronger in this show, especially considering the way it started out.\\n\\n\r\nMsyu had an undeniably adorable personality, however I felt like there was a lack of explanation and back story for her and all other assets. Her desires and understanding of the world wasn't very well explained, although I can understand why they avoided that for the most part. They did dive into it a little bit, but it seems like they decided to skip over it and just leave it as a bit of a mystery for viewers to discern on their own.\\n\\n\r\nKimimaro is a rather typical male lead character, the classic ordinary everyday guy constantly conflicted by morals and an inability to do things the right way until he is literally put through hell and finally realizes what needs to be done. While he may be overly stereotypical in a lot of ways, he does have a certain respectable uniqueness about him which seemed to be a necessary and key part in the development of his relationship with Msyu.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kimimaro does have a moderately developed back story revolving around the fate of his father, there is another Entre named Souichirou who attempts to befriend Kimimaro and mentor him on how to reduce any damage done to the real world by planning the outcomes of his battles carefully. Souichirou probably has the most detailed back story, he also has issues concerning his father, and claims to fight for the present reality. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nThere is no denying that the anime has an overall enjoyment factor of the highest degree when all aspects are considered - well it did for me anyway. It had all the necessary features to make a great anime in my opinion, the story was unique and fairly well done, and involved ideas that I really enjoy. The mix of a magical money world hidden away from reality and the philosophical concepts built around that world make for a story that had me on the edge of my seat all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe phenomenal art and the impressive battles only served to push my enjoyment level to the limit, and I finished this anime in less than three days because I just couldn't stop watching it. It could have been a bit longer but I have no real problems with the way they handled the story given the length of the anime. This is certainly an anime that is worthy of reaching my top 10 list of anime. I don't re-watch many anime series but this is one I would consider watching again.",

            "content": "[C] The Lack of Responsible Spending and Viewer Sympathy\r\nIt\u2019s clear from my reinterpretation of the title that I flat out didn\u2019t like it. I sat through the season hoping it would get better as it went along. It didn\u2019t. So to sum up what this show did wrong: Almost everything\u2026 except the central concept and opening/ending scores.\r\nHonestly, this anime didn\u2019t give me anything to justify my watching it. Other than its interesting premise of another world called the Financial District which controls and inevitably destroys the economy of each respective country in the physical world, there\u2019s nothing else to see here. Our protagonist, Yoga, Kimimaro,is a kid with no drive to do anything productive with his life. Right off the bat, we\u2019re presented with the generic \u201cguy with no redeeming qualities\u201d to play with. Mr. Boring here hates his dad, has no girlfriend because he was too much of a wuss to ask out his childhood friend, is an econ major, and works part time at a convenience store to pay for living expenses. His existence is double its original worth once he\u2019s paid a strange visit by a guy named Masakaki.\\n\\n\r\nMasakaki is actually kind of an interesting dude because he represents the law of the Financial District and is a guide to those introduced into this new world. There\u2019s not one of him as each District has their own Masakaki of sorts. Throughout the anime, he pops up several times to inform people of major events going on and announce duels between those involved in the District.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a plethora of supporting characters but I\u2019m getting too long-winded as it is with just the main ones to detail the rest so I\u2019ll tell you now that the show isn\u2019t worth watching for them. Msyu is Kimimaro\u2019s Asset and eventual love interest. Blehh. Jennifer is an exec of IMF, an organization attempting to bring down the Financial District. She, for some reason, is always eating burgers when she\u2019s out investigating. Hanabi is the childhood friend mentioned earlier. Takedazaki is an informant in the District and general creeper with a crazy laugh. \\n\\n\r\nNow, everyone part of this other world uses something called midas money to duel others and spend in the real world which is why it gets screwed over. Apparently, almost all of them are money grubbers who only fight for their own benefit. Of course, bringing \u201cfake\u201d money into circulation in mass quantities throws off the balance of the economy. I won\u2019t delve too deep into the logistics because they don\u2019t matter and I don\u2019t fully understand the system myself. Each person has an Asset which is like\u2026 an astral being?... I don\u2019t know, anyway, they represent their respective owner\u2019s future and they fight in battles (duels) against other Assets like their goddamn Pok\u00e9mon or something. And the whole micro-, mezo-, macro- flation based attacks are just silly. There\u2019s a bunch of other stuff that happens in between the fighting but it\u2019s irrelevant to the overall scheme of things. For example, you don\u2019t find out what C is until the end. The hell?\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t do an adequate job of explaining anything in enough detail to really understand what\u2019s going on at any given time. As the story progresses, it gets more convoluted once you see cities digitizing into nothing along with the people inhabiting them. Countries disappear by ways of economic collapse. Organizations inside and outside the Districts have a hand in abusing midas currency, trying to prevent the future loss of nations, or attempting to preserve the present condition of those same nations. The antagonist, Souichirou, is an advocate for the present. He\u2019s a suave businessman who holds a lot of influence in Japan as he\u2019s at the top of the chain in the Far East District. He blames his father for the death of his sister because he prioritized his company over family. Ironically, Souichirou\u2019s ideals become more like his dad\u2019s after the event in that he starts believing money is power. To me though, he\u2019s just a kid with a lot of toys but wants to play with everyone else\u2019s. A stubborn man who pushes his values onto others because that\u2019s the only way he knows to gain control over everything and mold Japan to his liking because he doesn\u2019t believe in a future anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art and sound department, [C] tries to blend 3D and 2D animation together, like in the case of duels. However, sometimes they don\u2019t blend too well and it just starts to feel disjointed. The character and Asset designs are pretty ordinary. Although, some of the Assets are definitely more out there than others in both looks and abilities. Now as far as songs go, I enjoyed them both. The rock opening paired with the fluid animation of currency falling from the sky and flythrough into the streets of the Financial District got me pumped up for what was to come but obviously the anime itself fell short of what the songs did to hype it up for. And the endings electronic beats, percussion, and great vocals served as a great way to close each episode as the show was in a way an RPG considering how Yoga and Msyu fought tougher opponents each time to eventually end up going against Mikuni, the BOSS if you will. I think partly why I fancied the ending score was because it reminded me of East of Eden\u2019s ending for some strange reason. The voice acting was sufficient when it was in Japanese and god awful when they started speaking English. Seriously, everything was terrible when it came to the English talk. I\u2019ll leave it at that and you can see for yourself if you still feel the urge to hear it firsthand. Fair warning, you could be audibly raped.\\n\\n\r\nMy final grumbles about [C] is that I couldn\u2019t relate to anyone or anything in the show and that made it so every emotional event that was supposed to evoke something out of me just failed miserably. Msyu losing limbs and crying out in agony didn\u2019t even make me blink because I knew that she\u2019d regenerate right once the duel was over. Kimimaro\u2019s attempts to be heroic were not only boring but obvious and as a result I started liking him even less as a character. His existence value started at zero and doubling a zero is still only zero. My indifference towards it all was mostly due to the weak character development as you can tell. Msyu was probably the only one whose character evolved (not a Pok\u00e9mon joke) within the story and that\u2019s only because she didn\u2019t know anything about being human until Kimimaro came around and ate ramen noodles in front of her. I know, right? Eating?! That\u2019s insane!\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, what this anime boils down to is its lack of any real flow to the plot and missed attempt at drawing emotion out of the viewers whilst giving us a crash course in finances which to say it didn\u2019t do a good job of that either. Maybe, and I\u2019m being generous here, if they didn\u2019t do such a horrendous job of mimicking English speakers, I\u2019d give it one score higher. Maybe. But if time was currency, I\u2019d definitely spend it on something else worth my attention.\\n",

            "content": "'C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control' is an apparent response to the current state of business, and the recent global financial crisis.\r\nThe main theme of this series is \"present vs future\", with the main antagonist on the \"present\" side of the argument vying for the control of the financial district against the protagonist's \"future\" argument. This could be a direct criticism to the banking industry for their irresponsible lending for short-term profits (the present), which ultimately led to the subprime mortgage breakdown and Lehman Brothers declaring bankruptcy, subsequently causing economic disaster in Japan as well (loss of future). Using a person's future ascollateral for cash today is also an extreme representation of excessive lending.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins in the generic shounen fashion, with the \"ordinary but chosen\" student suddenly getting an invitation to participate in something greater, and given \"powers\" in the form of money and Digimon \"assets\". The underlying concept of this series is extremely weak, since it's based on an overly complicated battle system akin to 'Yu-Gi-Oh!' or 'Duel Masters', which relies on new rules and abilities introduced out of nowhere in the most deus ex machina manner imaginable to advance battles. We are literally being told that the protagonist is \"blessed with a strong asset\" because that's the only way to explain how he won the first battle, and one minute we're being told the amount of money in possession or strategy decides the outcome, the next minute they somehow manage to defeat the richer Sennoza without strategy (pure guts?).\\n\\n\r\nThis series is also plagued from the presence of too many characters. There is simply not enough time in an 11-episode series to develop 20+ characters, and many of their actions did not make sense. It was especially hard to identify the protagonist's motivation for rejecting the \"present\" view point, and his relationship with Hanabi, if she can even be called a heroine, since she is a non-presence in terms of screen time, and appears to be nothing more than a simple friend the protagonist has a little crush on. Every single opponent the protagonist faced are presented as good-but-misguided people fighting for an honorable purpose, and extremely forgiving towards the protagonist for destroying their lives. This is lazy scriptwriting, there's no excuse for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this series is wonderful. The surreal alternative world, the dynamic presentation, the \"wall\" between the real life and virtual (Msyu sitting beside protagonist, the obtrusive word bubble etc), the action sequence... all makes this series very fun to watch. Character designs are pretty attractive, and other than slightly sloppy CGI in the second half of the show, it was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound was almost equally wonderful, with excellent voice acting that fits well for every main character, especially that of Msyu by Tomatsu Haruka.\\n\r\nExciting battle BGM, and even more impressive was the music in slow scenes with the nostalgic and poignant feeling that they invoke.\\n\r\nThe OP was a good yet ordinary rock song, but the ED 'RPG' by School Food Punishment was an overwhelmingly fitting song for this series, accompanied by arguably the most visually pleasing ED animation since 'Tatami Galaxy'.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the atmosphere in this series. The narration and back-story for characters were also very enjoyable. However, they are too fragmented to make a huge impact to the main story. The single biggest flaw of this series is that the battles are far too superficial. Other money or life-game series such as 'Death Note' and 'Liar Game' had clear introduction of rules, which are enforced throughout the \"game\", using strategy or suspense for entertainment. On the other hand, 'C' used action, which simply does not make sense for a series of this kind. Strategies were superficial, and the consequences of loss (bankruptcy) were extremely vague. It feels like we're being shown a game's replay, rather than playing along with the protagonist. The premise of this series was amazing, with the existence of an alternative market, the Midas money, and the virtual world affecting the real. Unfortunately, the battle system was unable to fully capitalize on the concept. Perhaps the protagonist should've just turned into a stock trader or swindler... anyone using wits to earn money instead of a virtual pet who had nothing to do with money.\\n\\n\r\nIt also wasn't clear how the virtual world functioned, and what purposes they served. SEA financial district bankruptcy that destroyed Singapore sending \"shock waves\" approaching other markets? It was literally depicted like tsunami approaching on screen with a countdown rather actually showing how global businesses are connected and affected by international markets. It got so bad that there was a big stylized letter \"C\" moving across the ocean on a screen to represent the economic effect moving. In the end, nothing was explained, and the protagonist's efforts were in vain. The world turns as usual, and the corrupt financial districts will continue to exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe message of the series was also very conflicted. It started out as blatant criticism of the banking industry and questioning the importance of money, then it was the trust in the currency, and finally the big bad America? I did like how they attempted to show the futility of printing money to fix economic disaster (representing the futile Quantitative Easing), but it makes no sense to use losing face value of a currency as a crisis when Japan's recession today is mostly attributed to the strong yen. It also didn't really make sense to blame the U.S. for the financial crisis, because well, if it wasn't trade relationship with America, they would not have had the money to lose in financial crisis in the first place. Not to mention it was the U.S. that suffered the most in this recession. Like it's mentioned in one episode, you prosper together in a network, fall together too.\\n\\n\r\nRandom business jargons were being thrown out throughout the series, with terms like \"entrepreneur\" (they would usually just say \"Kigyouka\" in Japanese for that), \"collateral\" (\"future\" as \"collateral\" should not be affected until failure of repayment, so why does printing more money using future as collateral instantly destroyed people's future?), and nonsense battle moves like \"Macro/Mezzo/Micro-flation\", \"M&A\", \"Overheated Economy\", and \"Cannibalization\" (this term in business means launching a new product that eats away the sales of existing product of your own company, not eating others) etc. just makes it obvious those terms were being used simply to sound cool and an attempt to appear different from every other shounen battle anime.\\n\\n\r\n'C' is a total failure in addressing real world issues. The setting, story, and character development are disastrous, but visual and audio presentation are very pleasing with good pacing. It's an enjoyable series as long as you don't think too much or take it too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nIt is, after all, a show that has chosen style over substance.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Abbreviated Review: Nakamura, I'm really disappointed.\r\nTo firmly address some basics, this is a response to claims such as \"original story\" and \"original concept.\" I do not believe that C - The Money of Soul and Possibility Control (the title itself a string of nonsensical positively charged words) to be any bit of original. Kenji Nakamura, director of Mononoke and Trapeze, two works I adore, has accomplished nothing with this production. noitominA was also behind this anime, which hyped me for it to be the best of the season. It had all the makings of greatness, but suffers from excessive drama, random side stories, and well,lack of a straightforward plot. This show has no destination, and there have been numerous random twists in the series so far that have completely changed and re-changed what the show was even about.\\n\\n\r\nTo address the original story, I must first note a few productions that have existed before C. The main two I want to talk about are \"Digimon Tamers\" and \"Chobits.\" Digimon Tamers (or Season 3) is about a group of children whose world merges with the digital world, and they gain control over monsters (in case you didn't know). Towards the end of the fifty-two episode series, a monster from the digital world tries to break into the \"real world\" and begins destroying buildings and erasing humans. This exact same concept is being toted by C, for what purpose I have no clue. \\n\\n\r\nBut let me back up.\\n\\n\r\nC starts off with a boy named Yoga, who is taking some sort of economics course at his most likely community college (his friends only talk about keggers, so my guess is that it's a community college - or Harvard). He has a cute friend who tells him he doesn't need to \"do everything by himself.\" Of course, he is a total loner - a real 2D badass in the worst sense. His whole life, he claims, he has done everything for himself. Then suddenly, he is visited by the overly-creepy pink-haired pseudo-mascot with a Chesire-esque smile who offers him infinite monies in exchange for his soul. That's cool and all, but souls are never even mentioned again in the rest of the series so, I think he was lying. So the kid who is really good at yoga says sure thing and then he gets lots of money and starts running around the Financial District (Code word for Digital World) in search of BATTLES. That's right! To get money you have to fight other people and take their star chip- monies! Losing in the Financial District also causes your real self to lose as well (it's not always money, but seeing as there's really no logic that connects how losing money correlates to losing family and friends like some characters in the show do, this aspect really doesn't add anything interesting). He also gets granted, in order to fight, a super desu kawaii persacom! Yeah, here's where the Chobits comes in. He gets a computer girlfriend essentially, and after about two episodes with yoga master she goes from tsundere to dere~dere~love and keeps trying to seduce our professional yoga lead. Spoilers: it is totally unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nHis parents are also missing inside the Financial District, there's disgustingly bad ENGRISH, there's a giant death clock, enormous tentacle monsters appear out of nowhere, people eat money, John Lennon is in a Hawaiian shirt, unnecessarily complex (more so complex by disguise) guild systems exist and much much more useless, pointless, trite, and frustrating material.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of \"epic\" things in this show. I put that word in quotations because they are not epic, they merely lampshade cliches and the inability to weave a coherent and original story with elements of \"epicness.\" The fact his parents are probably dead is used to make the audience feel pity, the end of the world is near is used to give the show some sort of half-assed direction, and the romance between the Asset (persacom thing) and our king of the yoga is used to make the audience feel endeared. This production shouldn't have all of these things going on at once. It's confused as to what it should be doing, so it keeps throwing random things on screen. If you start to discuss the relevance to any of the side characters, it shouldn't surprise that they're confusing too. Most are on screen briefly, die, and C leaves it at that. I'm not sure why, but it happens a lot. Out of say, ten characters introduced from the Financial District in the first five episodes, about four of them are alive. Killing off people doesn't make a show more meaningful! Multitasking is dangerous, especially while driving, and that is where I think C went wrong. Striving to fool the audience with a masked purpose, stripped to it's bare, the story is not original at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the visuals, I really wish they used this style a little better than for monster fights in a money world. I love this art, but I loved it much more in Trapeze and Mononoke where it was used artistically. In C, the animation is used for monster battles. The CGI is atrociously awkward, and the fight scenes between the large computer generated monsters are boring and pointless. Yoga-brotha loses numerous battles but loses nothing important, so even animating these fight scenes so far has done nil. The opening visuals are fantastic, but not new. The same style was used for Eden of the East, and to be perfectly blunt, I think it was better there. The art is not original either.\\n\\n\r\nA good thing about the sound is that school food punishment does the ending theme. The opening is fine too, but I really have no opinion on that. The voice-acting for Mysu (pesrsacom) and Masakaki (chesire guy) are fine, and I rather like them (as chesire was Irabu from Trapeze, I have a nostalgic enjoyment listening to him). I must say though, any respect for voice acting in this show is lost when I mention Jennifer Satou (who is she? let me tell you). The buxom blonde American secret service agent working for the IMF (I think) has one of the most ANNOYING and EAR RAPE voices I have EVER HEARD. You thought Kuroko from Index was bad?! Wait until you hear this chick voiced with a lollipop in her mouth. The awful stereotypical pseudo-American voice speaks volumes for how little this staff actually knew about American speech manner. (It also doesn't help that her character is literally always eating and that her food of choice is often hamburgers.) Then let's address the bad English. Eden of the East used English wonderfully, racial tones even mixed in correctly (African-Americans from DC sounded like such). In C, you have old white businessmen with thick black accents and women who look like Hilary Clinton sound like 21-year-old Asian girls speaking bad English. Actually scratch the \"like,\" portion, they sound exactly the same because the voice acting is simply bad in this regard. The voice acting wouldn't necessarily be bad or frustrating to hear (the English that is) if it actually had a purpose though. The bad voices lead me to the conclusion that the studio did a poor job in their spare time because they wanted to add elements that made the show look more important than it is.\\n\\n\r\nWhich boils right back down to the bad characters. Aside from the previously addressed protagonist who happens to be good at yoga and pointlessly creepy pink-haired guy (Masakaki) there are a huge amount of characters. \\n\\n\r\n[not so spoiler] That all die. [/not so spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nWe still have the psychotic John Lennon character who works under the fabulous rich guy who somehow took a liking to our jerk of a protagonist. The rich guy does a bunch of needless dramatic things like launch giant tentacle monsters at \"world markets\" and wears his fabulous scarf and pimps out a bunch of ASSets (one is named Q. Wicked edgy). John Lennon just runs around and acts eccentric, and his friend with the gold teeth runs around and takes pictures. So there's a lot of eccentricity and running going on in the show, but there once again, is no destination.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't let the idea of a show dealing with money fool you. This show has very little to do with money and it has very little to do with actual economics, financing, and business. What it is stripped bare is a shonen quest to save the world, and there's just a bunch of melodrama introduced along the way. C is not a new concept, it is a re-hash and re-buff of kids shows in a \"dark and gritty\" manner. Nakamura, I thought you of all people could do better than this, but I feel you've fallen for the preteen marketing trap, trying to make a work edgier than it really is. \\n\\n\r\nThus, I've come to the conclusion that C stands for \"Corny.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you found this review unhelpful, please tell me why. Thanks!",

The show reminds me of the game \"The World Ends With You\" & the anime \"Eden of the East\" They have the same feel.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nOriginal title, original story & original art. \r\nIt can easily been said that this is one of the best on-going shows.\r\nThe story centers around a guy named Kimimaro Yoga, who is a normal guy who wants to live a normal life, however he gets this mysterious credit card that can transfer him to a different realm, the financial district.\r\nInthe financial district, People called Entre makes deal with each other which can be compared to a \"dualist\" & \"duels\". I love the concept about the money and the asset(which is like a supporter to the entre's). \\n\r\nI got hooked after the second episode & i hope you will too, cause its a great show so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is stunning!\\n\r\nI love the patterns they used for the money, the shape and designs of the building in the financial district.

            "content": "Prior to the initial airing of [C], I was really hyped for it because the director attached to it was Kenji Nakamura. Other notable anime on his resume were Mononoke and Trapeze (Kuchuu Buranko) and both were really good anime. They were eccentric, visually stunning, well executed pieces of animation. Most importantly it really highlighted Nakamura\u2019s diversity as a director since Mononoke was at heart a mystery series with slight horror elements and Trapeze was an eccentric comedy about people with mental disorders. The only real element they shared was a sense of surreality. Then we got rumors of [C]: The Money of Soul andPossibility Control, a supposed anime that dealt with topics related to the state of the current economy in a battle anime-esque way.  This was totally the kind of anime I thought Nakamura would direct since the premise sounded fresh and original and it was in the noitaminA timeslot which basically meant that the concept of the show wouldn\u2019t be gutted in favor of appealing to a broader audience. The only real notable difference here was that the production studio was Tatsunoko, where Mononoke and Trapeze were done by Toei. I didn\u2019t really think this would be a big factor in the larger scheme of things so I brushed it aside and began getting immensely hyped. And at the end of this little rainbow all I ended up with was a pot of bitter disappointment and frustration. [C] doesn\u2019t fall short of Mononoke or Trapeze, it runs off a cliff and gets impaled on the rocks below. Not only is it disappointing in that regard but it doesn\u2019t even manage to have many redeeming aspects, if any at all. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s deal with the least offensive part of [C] and that\u2019s the plot. The premise involves a student named Yoga trying to tough out the hard times and getting through life in an economy that seems to working against everyone. Cutting corners to save costs, working multiple jobs and getting good grades on top of that, yeah none of us are ever really ready to deal with the hurdles that comes with pursuing tertiary education after high school. Let\u2019s not even deal with romance and finding a girlfriend/boyfriend in addition. This is one of the few things [C] does right and that\u2019s creating an initially relatable main character that the audience can sympathize with. Unfortunately that\u2019s where the good things stop with [C], the premise and the first episode is probably the best part of the show and I\u2019m not kidding at all. We then get to the meat of the story and that involves a magical dimension in the middle of the city called the \u201cFinancial District\u201d where people fight out battles called \u201cDeals\u201d with pokem-err I mean\u201cAssets\u201d. If they win they get some Midas Money and if they lose, their future disappears. Now in terms of actual plot, [C] has a bunch of pacing issues and a narrative that goes nowhere until the last couple of episodes. Everything the audience needs to know is given to us in the first two episodes and the driving force of the plot only shows up at the end. There\u2019s a good flashback episode in the middle but that\u2019s pretty much character related. You have a good chunk of the middle which revolves around Yoga fighting other people and their story but ultimately none of this stuff ever adds anything to the narrative. You could argue that they\u2019re there to characterize Yoga but that\u2019s pointless since Yoga doesn\u2019t grow as a character throughout the show. They play on the redundant \u201cWhat am I fighting for/What do I want to protect\u201d theme that nearly every anime arbitrarily slaps on to characters they don\u2019t know what to do with. There\u2019s also a concurrent plotline that deals with Yoga\u2019s dad but even that is done in a half-assed way. You have Yoga agonizing over several episodes on why his dad supposedly abandoned his family when the whole goddamn answer is so obvious in the first place. The way Yoga treats it as an epiphany is even more annoying, really why would a father ever fight to win money? COULD IT POSSIBLY BE BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY? But nah that answer is too high-brow for the audience, might as well pad it out for a couple of episodes. It\u2019s such lazy way of delivering a frankly boring plot point anyway especially since Yoga doesn\u2019t learn anything from it. To make things even worse, Yoga never ends up doing anything on his own accord. Even at the end, he\u2019s fighting because someone else told him to, not because he reached that answer himself. That\u2019s the problem of creating a character based on a motive like \u201cProtecting something\u201d without any real elaboration. Yoga comes off as nothing but the standard battle shounen lead except it\u2019s played completely straight. He\u2019s barely a character on his own and whatever possibilities there are initially end up being completely wasted. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of other major characters, the only other remotely interesting one is the series antagonist, Mikuni. He contrasts Yoga\u2019s blind sheep idealism with a stark amount of pragmatism. He drives all the action in the plot and has the most characterization out of the entire cast. Honestly I believe that [C] was initially written with Mikuni as the main character instead of Yoga, yet in order to make the anime more appealing they had to shoehorn a younger character in because lol anime. If you check out some of the groundwork on [C], most of the concept art and notes focus on Mikuni. On the other hand Msyu, Masakaki and Jennifer are just walking archetypes with one gimmick they play over and over again in place of actual characterization. The only other memorable supporting characters are the professor and the charity worker but they\u2019re only around for an episode and again, they don\u2019t add anything to overall narrative. This is a problem since the show has an overarching plot yet it tries to be almost episodic and these different narrative structures clash horribly.  Generally the writing is the definition of mediocre. It\u2019s got some good ideas, but never elaborates on them and whatever aspects it does elaborate on are wholly uninteresting.  Also there is virtually no economics in this anime, unless you count naming attacks \u201cMicro, Macro or Mezzo\u201d economics related. It tries to use this angle to cover up just how shallow the entire battles are. There\u2019s a bit with hyperinflation at the end yet it doesn\u2019t make any sense in the context it\u2019s used in. If you\u2019re expecting something like Spice & Wolf, don\u2019t bother since [C] uses fantasy economics because it\u2019s a battle anime that fails at making any relevant or meaningful social commentary.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the most damning aspect of [C] is the animation, composition and general scene layout. Even if [C] has some lackluster and boring writing, it still could have been a decent watch if the visual fidelity was on the level of the Nakamura\u2019s previous works. Yet in the end, [C] had some of the worst cinematography I\u2019ve seen in an anime in quite a while. The cuts and composition for each scene are not just bland or boring, they\u2019re awkward and jarring. You have a cut of Yoga and Msyu fighting someone else and we\u2019re getting to the climactic end yet THE FUCKING SHOW DECIDES TO CUT AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT AND PROCEDES TO SHOW THE AFTERMATH. Really. Now yes, this style was used in Mononoke and Trapeze but it had significance there. The jarring cuts in those shows were there to play off of their quirky and artsy visual style AND most importantly they built tension in Mononoke (because it had strong mystery and horror aspects) and those same cuts really magnified the surrealism and comedy in Trapeze. It has no place being in [C], because this anime\u2019s composition is incredibly plain. You\u2019ll have cuts of Yoga walking across the street yet we see it cut to him being on one side, in the middle than at the other side with not much animation in between. It has no meaning and it\u2019s obviously there to hide whatever shoestring budget this anime was made on. Truthfully Mononoke and Trapeze didn\u2019t have great animation either yet they hid that with clever scene layouts, angles and composition. Mononoke for example still had some breathtaking cuts that were animated beautifully. Just compare the last five minutes of its fifth episode to all of [C], the difference is like night and day. Not only that but [C]\u2019s animation is genuinely terrible, the laughable running cut in the first fight should tip you off, or rather smack you over the head with it. All the fights have bad animation; I cannot understand why they would want to make a battle show if they didn\u2019t want to spend money on it. There were some cuts done by notable animators such as Sushio and Ryochimo but in the end their cuts only exemplified how bad the scene layouts and storyboards were. Even their animation didn\u2019t make any of the fights more interesting or exciting. Ironically enough, it seems all the good animation was saved for the final episode and while it\u2019s alright, it still doesn\u2019t excuse the utter mediocrity of the other 10 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, [C] has some atrocious aesthetics. The character designs are bland and uninspired, and the color palette clashes with the CGI work (incredibly frustrating since Mononoke had just as much CGI but the difference was that [C]\u2019s is a fucking pink elephant in the room). You have entire cuts that are done in CGI, even the characters and it sticks out like a sore thumb. There really is no excuse for such poor visual fidelity, it\u2019s fairly obvious that Tatsunoko did not give Nakamura the creative liberty he had with his previous works and they also gave him a pretty bad staff to work with. The musical score is non-existent except for in the last couple of episodes and the voice-work only makes the characters more lifeless than they already are.  \\n\\n\r\nSo after all those bitter tears, is [C] worth watching? No, especially if you\u2019re watching this because of Nakamura. I admit, I\u2019m being biased against it because I had lofty expectations yet [C] never becomes anything more than mediocre in all of its 11 episodes. The writing is contradictory, the visuals are horrible, and so it doesn\u2019t really do anything that deserves praise. If you want an intelligent fighting anime, you\u2019re not gonna find it here. Hell if you want something quirky and Nakamura-esque, you\u2019ll definitely leave this anime with a bad taste in your mouth. \\n",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control starts off as an interesting enough idea. It is an action show centering around economics of all things; an odd concept but unique, and seemingly well suited for the older audiences that its noitaminA time slot is geared towards. However, the show quickly loses sight of what it wants to be and what it is trying to say. On one hand, it is a sleek action show, on the other economic commentary; yet it also tries to be a profound story about the relationship between the present and the future. The end result is needlessly convoluted, thevictim of too many ideas going in too many different directions.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning, this review contains spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Kimihiro Yoga, an average college student, who just like any other college student is pretty hard pressed for money. That is until a strange ethereal being offers him a way to make a lot more money; it entails fighting battles (which are called deals) in the otherworldly Financial District along side mystical creatures called assets, whom are the embodiment of their owners futures. Though just a newcomer, Kimihiro and his asset, Msyu, draw the attention of a veteran of the Financial District, Souichirou Mikumi, and gets sucked into a struggle that has the fate of Japan hanging on the line.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical-side of things, [C] looks stellar. The backgrounds for this show look fantastic, just brimming with detail and finesse. In particular, the financial district is a sight to behold, looking both majestic and ominous and featuring near flawless integration of 2-D and 3-D animation. The show has a unique digitized look which makes for very good eye candy. Character designs are not really anything special in the realm of anime, but still look very attractive, especially the ones for Msyu and Q. The animation is fluid and the vivid color scheme is eye-popping, which makes the action sequences a joy to watch. Like the visuals, the soundtrack here is impressive. Well composed and attention grabbing, it heavily features electronic beats and chanting vocals that will get your blood pumping in the action sequences, yet still fits the action-less moments just as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith the superb animation and soundtrack out of the way, lets get to brass tax... [C] has a lot of interesting ideas, but struggles tremendously to keep a hold of them. It starts off seemingly as a critique of Japan's economic system (or perhaps just economic systems in general). Kimihiro's financial situation; the high stakes of battles (called Deals) in the financial district; the extremes people are driven to by financial loss, these all fit together into a rather biting commentary. If the show stuck with just that it would have been fine.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show attempts to deepen its impact by giving the money flowing out of the financial district a rather ominous effect, it steels peoples' futures. This is where the show starts running into some major issues. With their futures being stolen, people, buildings, and even countries start vanishing into thin air. This does add a little surreal creepiness to the show, but it also is incredibly contrived. There are some huge holes in logic flaws in the way things vanish, unimportant characters seem not to notice any difference, but Kimihiro and other important characters do. Perhaps it is because of their involvement with with the financial district, but it is still a flimsy explanation. Far more problematic, however, is what this plot device does to the story thematically. First off, one must wonder why the writers found it necessary to even include this device to begin with... isn't the threat of financial crisis threatening enough, a quick look at today's economic situation will tell you that it is. By adding the whole 'mystical future stealing money' angle, the show actually downplays the severity of an economy in crisis.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is the 'present vs. future' debate between Kimihiro and Mikuni that is caused by the future stealing money. Both characters start spouting philosophical babble about the nature of the present and future, and which is more important. What had started off as economic commentary becomes something completely different, with economics playing only a minor role in the story. This debate about the present and future is not developed well enough to be impactful, which isn't surprising because the show is only 11 episodes long, and culminates in a Dues Ex Machina ending that feels pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of [C] are not anything remarkable either, but they do offer just enough to win some of the audience over. Kimihiro for his part is a pretty typical male anime lead, flickering between being meek and heroic as a lot\\n\r\nof anime leads do nowadays. Still, the way he struggles to do the right thing gives the audience something to latch on to. His relationship with his asset, Msyu, is more interesting than his personality; in fact one of the best moments in the show is Msyu reflecting on their relationship. Probably the best developed character in the show is Mikumi, whom actually has a fairly interesting back story (which is of course tragic) which serves as his motivation. The rest of the characters are a bunch of walking plot devices, and don't develop into anything more than that.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it pains me a little to be so hard on this show, because it is not terrible. The ideas behind the show are interesting enough, and it is certainly easy on the eyes. However, the plot is poorly executed, ending up as a lot of sound and furry with little substance behind it. If you are interested in the subject of economics, watch Spice and Wolf instead. It does a better job of incorporating economics into its plot, has better developed characters, and is not contrived like [C].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The phrase that immediately comes to my mind is \"bizarre but unique\".  \r\nC: The Money Of Soul and Possibility Control have a comprehensive plot that rarely founded in 11 episode (only in Higashi no Eden). The level of originality of the story is above average. The anime proves that to appear different it's not a bad thing. The battle really looks like a kid battle for me, which a little dull because the poor execution that given. The problemis the story weighed so much that sometimes feels overloaded for a short anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and unique, the character has a unique design that rarely seen. The background is amazing. There are several scene and frames using CG, its add another attraction of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, all of the sound aspects is decent. Not much to say in this section, but the ending tune kinda reminds me with Persona songs, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character, we have a poor character development. Our character division is quite typical as well. We have our dull male leader, Yoga Kimimaro. He is another typical male lead that usually appear in shounen series, and we have Msyu the hero's partner. The most massive character development centered in Mikuni (because he has some interesting back story). Other character did not have a proper development.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, C is another enjoyable series. Although the battle scene is not the main interest of this anime, but the enjoyment level of this anime is high. It is highly recommended for those who seeks unique settings, and for those who enjoy a short but good anime...",

            "content": "*There is minor spoilers. Read at your own risk*\r\nMoney. You can use it to buy anything. Even your future. C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is what i consider, a very good anime. I was disappointed at some of the negative reviews out there, and even though there were flaws i believe that the flaws did not change my overall enjoyment of the series. \r\nSo here are some pros and cons that i will go in depth later.\r\nPros:\r\n+Original idea\r\n+Interesting Plot\r\n+SUPERPOWERS\r\n+Awesome fight scenes\r\n+Great animation and art quality that never dropped each episode\r\nCons: \r\n-Awkward cuts between scenes.\r\n-Pacing sometimes to fast.\r\n-To little episodes. More episodes neededto go in depth about something like characters for instance.\\n\r\n-Characters aren't very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nSo on with the review. Overall, I believe that the plot, art, and sound were the strongest points that made this anime enjoyable. But with a lack of character understanding, this anime can not get higher than an 8 objectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is, as i said before, is very intriguing. Since the anime description of the series above is pretty accurate i wont go into plot summary. However, i will start with the negative aspects with the plot first. From my opinion, the plot was paced to fast which means less episodes and i honestly believe that they could make more episodes and could go more in depth with the characters, whom i believe lacked memorability. In addition, there were also many awkward cuts within the episodes, and to some people, it bothers them a lot. However, the plot overall is very interesting and original. Being a huge fan of superpower animes, this show really attracted me because it had awesome battles, cool power moves, and i really like the idea of spending money in order to use a move and with no money you basically lose and go bankrupt, which would impact your future. So all you superpower fans out there, you should give this show a chance.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, pushing away the negatives sides of the plot, i do find that C does have a lot of positive aspects which has made me enjoy this show, especially the animation and art which i believe was one of their strong points. Each episode has never dropped the quality of animation and art which is awesome if i say so myself. They also tried to incorporate and blend in some 3-D which is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, I believe that C does a extremely good job in this department and is one their strong points. Besides the fact that they have an awesome opening and ending, C has amazing songs that especially fits well in battles and with the mood. In addition, they take advantage of AMAZING sound effects which is the reason why i believe sound is a strong point of C.\\n\\n\r\nAhhh, now the characters. The characters is, as mentioned before, the weakest point in C. When i say weakest point, I'm not saying it was super bad, but i do prefer better character development. One issue i had has that the characters were not very memorable. For example, at the end where the two main characters parted ways and never saw each other again, i was just like whatever, because i wasn't really attached to either character and none of them gave me the impression that they were special or worth remembering. However, i do personally enjoy each of the character's personality. Each character interacted with each other well and it affected the plot by making it more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, despite the minor flaws, i found this show to enjoyable. True, it is not perfect, nor it is neither bad, but i believe that people should give this anime a chance. If superpowers, amazing artwork, and a really cool theme appeals to you, then C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is worth a shot.\\n\r\n*This is my second review and I will always appreciate feedback. Thanks for taking your time reading this!",

They could be aliens? :P), the title makes it a little clear and the plot becomes evident from the first five minutes; which is all you need to know.\\n\r\nStill, dispite seemin straightforward, it's quite the opposite; the first episode leaves you asking yourself plenty of questions, a clever method of easily gripping an audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPotential...\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this is an original anime, you're not going to find a spoiler, so there's no cutting corners via skipping forward or even to the end and seeing if the serise is worth it (I have done this before), or checking out manga reviews. We have no choice but to venture in with an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the story is both quirky and realistic; it's likely to stand out, in the eyes of adventure lovers and 'slice of life' fans.\\n\\n\r\nI'm an individual, in my early 20s, who has watched countless anime over the years and I'm a huge fan of the supernatural, however, since I have seen so much, I'm seeing similarities in many recent serise's that makes them fail to stand out. \\n\r\nA serise gets plus points when it receives praise from people like myself; individuals who feels they've \"just about seen everything\".\\n\\n\r\n11 episodes is a decent length, even if you don't like it, atleast you haven't wasted too much of your life on the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere's endless potential for fanfiction too.\\n\\n\r\nArt...\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery seems quite well though out, yet the couloring is fairly neautral, which can be a good thing; not obnoxiously bright and not so dark production are trying too hard to crete atmosphere; a good balance for the mellow mood so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs seem to simply follow what is popular at the moment; fairly box and triangle 2Desque with little expression in the face, however, the extras have distinguishing features (basically, the mains are plain, which equals flawless, which equals cute) the clothing designs are flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters...\\n\\n\r\nSo far, what you would expect; the quiet, the eccentric and the mysterious, the type that seem to be staples in al anime. Though it's only been one episode and it seems atleast one main character has yet to arrive.\\n\\n\r\n*This is a review based on what the series gives out initially, i.e. ep' one, I'll leave the opinions up to you if you consider following the series, to avoid spoilers*\\n\r\n*Since it's now finished, I look over the series as something many will fnd generic, some will find fun; depending on your views and the time period you have been watdching anime in general - this should say it all*",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is an original anime.At first i got interested in this anime because of its theme of economy, since im economist myself.It  is kinda similar to the Eden of the East though because the main theme is \"the money\".\r\n[Story: 6]\r\nSo, what is money? Money is something we use in our lives and basically can not live without. Now there is plenty of ways to use money, but what if you attract a demon which offers you infinite amount of money for your future?\r\nStory so far includes a  unknown man with no money gaining access to FinancialDistrict, where he got engaged in a battle with Mikuni, fought with strange monsters and lost. He then committed suicide the following day. The main character of this story is Kimimaro and he works part time and tries hard to get scholarship. He of course(as expected) has no money, and then, the mysterious man Masakaki approaches him and offers him a deal to become and entrepeneur at a mysterious bank. Some time later on,  he is once again approached by Masakaki, who places him in a taxi going for the Financial District and gives him limitless amounts of money. In exchange, he asks for Kimimaro\u2019s future as collateral.\\n\r\nIt may look interesting in the begining but later it becomes really boring :(\\n\\n\r\n[Art:9]\\n\r\nthe art is great so far. Actually i myself am not a fan of little boys and girls but i can't say they are not well drawn. Colors are well balanced and not the eye killers.\\n\r\nThe animation for now looks really amazing and  the only thing i like is awesome animation when it comes to fighting. Also, the opening and the ending have nice animation and i give one big + for them :D\\n\r\nThere are also digital side bars whenever the contractor is talking to his asset. \\n\r\nNot to mention that art got somehow 3d-ish in the second episode, but i dont have anything against that ad, because it gives depth and somehow it makes difference between parallel world people[bank] and normal world people.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound:6]\\n\r\nOpening and ending songs are really well done, and are fitting. Also i think they chose the right voice actors for the characters and they dont feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\n[Character:7]\\n\r\nnothing is explained, except there are seemingly few characters we need to set eyes on: the main characters Kimimaro Yoga & Mashu[presumably his demon]. Also in the first episode they introduced mysterious Masakaki & the girl Kimimaro has his eyes on: Hanabi [sadly she has a boyfriend, as expected :(] but this show didnt work on characters as much as i wanted it to have.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment and overall:6]\\n\r\ni can't say im both impressed and not impressed, but like i said before it just has interesting story. Some things are left unexplained and that is a big minus.",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control has a pretty original hook: It's a story starring economics college-student Yoga Kimimaro who only wants to acquire a job with income stable enough to support a family. One day he meets some eccentric dude named Masakaki (who looks a fusion between Willy Wonka and the Cheshire Cat) who offers him a large sum of money, asking in return that he put up his future for \"collateral\". From that day forward, Yoga is transported to a realm known as the Financial District where he must engage in battles known as \"deals\" in which he must offer notonly his money, but his future as well. It doesn't just stop there since the money printed in the Financial District is different then your average bills. \"Midas money\" as it's called not only has adverse side-effects on the economy, but on the fabrics of reality as well\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything [C] does that's remarkable, it's that the series tackles issues you never see tackled and gets off to fairly strong start because of it. The idea of a financial crisis being the core conflict in a series sounds pretty cool. The main character is pretty easy to relate to (college student with money issues), the Financial District looks pretty neat, and Masakaki is awesome. Why did it all have to go so wrong?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the battles. To expand further on the above synopsis, people who engage in deals within the financial district are known as entres (short for entrepreneurs), and they are given ass kicking super-powered sidekicks called assets to do most of the fighting for them. The creators try to make these showdowns seem complicated by giving them a ton of rules and financial terminology that imply depth, but the way the battles are actually executed resembles pretty much every proxy battle series out there. They are often rather short and resort to run-of-the-mill beam-spam where characters yell out the name of their attacks before firing in true Digimon fashion. Strategies are limited to mostly deus-ex machina and straight-up luck, so don't come in to expecting any sort of complex mind-games. They look pretty, but the deals are mostly brain-dead affairs. You don't really need to understand the terminology or rules really, whoever has the biggest blast wins. Strangely enough one of the most hyped battles of the entire series is also skipped over right in the middle of the action to have the characters simply spend time explaining the results, just thought that was worth tossing out there. \\n\\n\r\nWhen they're off the battle field our central duo isn't particularly interesting either. Yoga is a pretty dull and passive lead character. His involvement in the story is really little more then an excuse to introduce the viewers to the premise since we learn about the Financial District at the same time he does. He has no real involvement with the main plot going on under his nose until the final episodes. He's not a completely terrible lead though since his ideologies make for a decent foil for the ideologies of the people he meets and battles within the Financial District, especially the last boss. The real problem here is his asset Msyu. She's basically a loli-tsundere who develops into a loli-tsundere waifu. Her interactions with the Yoga as she slowly falls in love with him are cringe-inducing, and eat up far too much time. I figured a show with such a deep setting that only has eleven episodes to work with would know not to spend time on teaching your pet waifu how to eat or what a kiss is, but there's always  enough time for otaku-bait I suppose.The nature of the relationship between entres and assets is something I won't go into much for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but it's where I was hoping this show would differentiate Yoga and Msyu from all the other dull male/female leads out there, but it's a sub-plot that pretty much gets dropped right before giving us any kind of meaningful answer. \\n\\n\r\nI feel no need to mention most of the other entres for the reason that they are mostly one-note entities who fail to amount to something memorable due to short screen-time. I will give props to show for the antagonist (though you could also call him an anti-hero) Mikuni, who is far more interesting to follow then our boring lead and his digital waifu. He understands the effects that losing deals has on other entres (not only do they lose money, but a part of their lives will suddenly vanish). His motives were rather interesting and understandable. I applaud the show for not giving us a main antagonist solely driven by greed which is something that I was expecting from a series where money is behind everything. His plot to is analogous to the idea of quantitative easing, wherein he tries to inject Midas Money into the Japanese economy. His role in the story was a pretty interesting one that provided some interesting criticisms to the practice.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show are probably as unique as the show's premise, but are about as mixed overall as the show's execution. The Financial District is pretty cool to look at with it's distinctive red/white color pallet and the battles that take place are often well animated. The character art however does this bizarre thing often goofily switches between 2D designs and 3D models. It was sort of cool at first since Masakaki was the only one doing it in episode 1 and it sort of fit in with the rest of his bizarre characteristics. However, eventually you get shots of characters walking down the streets in 3D sometimes and the occasional scene where both 2D and 3D characters are interacting on screen at the same time. The actual character designs themselves are also kinda weird in a sometimes derpish way sometimes but is otherwise average. The actual acting is alright on both sides. Funimation's dub doesn't really have much young blood so if you're well acquainted with their previous works, the English version will end up being a rather simple game of \"spot the voice actor\". Scott Freeman as Masakaki was excellent though. I'd still recommend the Japanese version since it has the highest ratio of Engrish to Japanese speaking (a result of having the International Monetary Fund pop up from time-to-time and the attacks and terminology used during deals) since the likes of Black Lagoon and Beck. It's weird in this since some of the Engrish sounds almost convincing too.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot would've benefited greatly benefited from another cour, but as is the show bites far more then it can chew. I'm not sure if the series had it's episode count slashed or not, but it certainly feels that way (just as much as it did with Angel Beats! too). Much of the series focus on Yoga/Msyu adventures in the Financial District, yet all of a sudden in the final episodes the show forces a doomsday climax with no build up. It would've been great to get a better understanding of how the show got there and how Mikuni figured into it all. Instead it feels as if people woke up one day only to find out that they suddenly have an enormous financial crisis that threatens to plunge the world into \"Great Depression \" tier misery. These episodes feel to quickly paced and even though the final deal itself is pretty awesome, the show resorts to what I can only call a ridiculously ass-pully resolution that felt much too cheap.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[C] is most definitely a textbook example of neat premise being ruined beyond all recognition. The unnecessary focus on boring leads you've seen before combined with a plot that didn't get the time it needed to develop alongside the weak character development hamstring the show's potential badly. It's an interesting affair still simply because of the bizarre premise and visuals and won't take up too much time.That's not enough to prevent [C] from being a failure of forgettable proportions. Come for the cute assets and explosions, it won't disappoint too much if that's the fix your looking for.",

            "content": "C felt like a series that seemed better suited to run for at least two dozen episodes considering the elements it tried to cover with the Financial District. The show introduced a multiple number of characters with differing motivations for their involvement in the Financial District and features an elaborate battle system that involves dwellers of the District battling one another with their futures as collateral and bankruptcy having a huge negative effect on the person's life in reality. Kimimaro, as the central character of C, tries to figure out what purpose he has in his involvement in the Financial District and gaining Asset Mashuwho supports him in his battles in the Financial District.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of C was spent covering the various adversaries that Kimimaro would be up against while the second half covered a much darker element to the Financial District that influenced reality, which I felt the quality of both differed quite a bit. The first half was reasonably paced where Kimimaro adjusts to activity in the Financial District and slowly realizes just how much of a radically life-changing influence activity from the Financial District has on reality through the opponents that he fights. The opponents he encounter are fleshed out enough where you get enough sense of how being in the Financial District has influenced their lives, particularly Mikuni who becomes both mentor and rival to Kimimaro as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series is where I found things to be a mixed bag and what led me to think the series should have been at a greater number of episodes. The Financial District's influence on reality shows a darker side which results in Mikuni and Kimimaro taking differing views on how to manage things. This could have made for a better half if not for the fact pacing started to advance at a more rapid pace compared to earlier episodes thus preventing any sort of build up with the mounting tensions between the two. It especially doesn't help when there were only 4 to 5 episodes left to build up on such shocking developments and create character tensions that could have been better laid out in a 24-episode series.\\n\\n\r\nOther prominent issues as a result of the show's limited episode count include the series not exploring other elements to the Financial District and plot elements, particularly the higher power that the Masakakis follow, what Mashu represents with Kimimaro's future and the specifics of what led Kimimaro's father to his demise.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, C is one of the best-looking titles I've had a chance of seeing for the year thus far. Scenery and character designs are packed with bright colors and have a good amount of detail to them with the art highlight going to the rendering of the Financial District with its highly colorful and abstract environment, doing well at conveying itself as being a whole different world from our reality. Action scenes are well animated with a good amount of movement and some moments of impressive animations in the battles that occur within the Financial District.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy seeing C, I can't help but nitpick at the fact that the series could have worked out better if given a higher episode count as not everything to it was explored and it had a second half that couldn't click for me due to the lack of proper build-up and rushed pacing that developed thanks to its eleven episode count.",

That\u2019s pretty much the entire point of the showin a single sentence. The thing that actually makes this concept of fighting interesting, is that when one of the fighters lose, as in utter annihilating defeat, they lose their future as well. Meaning if they were going to have kids or something, they won\u2019t have those kids anymore. That risk alone makes the battles interesting as hell. I don\u2019t really know what else to say other than its unique and the fights are weighted with risk.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (6/10): The characters in this show aren\u2019t anything special, I will say that the character you think is going to be a tsundere isn\u2019t going to be a tsundere, not entirely anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKimimaro Yoga: The protagonist and major in Social Economics.\\n\\n\r\nSouichirou Mikuni: The one trying to manipulate the entire global market and owner of a literal cash hungry asset.\\n\\n\r\nMsyu: Asset to Yoga and probably my favourite character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show are mostly forgettable, and there\u2019s only two other characters that actually do something in the entire show, everyone else is inconsequential.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art & Sound (6/10) & (5/10): The art in this show is pretty standard, apart from the MC\u2019s neck looking like it\u2019s about to give with the slightest force. The rest of the art is CGI, and if you absolutely can\u2019t stand CGI, turn back now because you aren\u2019t in for a good time. I didn\u2019t really mind the CGI that much and I actually think it lended itself to some scenes, apart from any scene involving Masakaki, every time he popped up on screen I wanted to skip a bit forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show was entirely forgettable the OP, ED & OST flew right over my head. The voice acting was standard, no single person stood out, and I can\u2019t really say much else about the sound at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this show?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a unique show and I think I\u2019ll buy it, but only if I see it in the shop, not going to look for it.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nYeah it\u2019d kill a fair bit of time, if that\u2019s what you need, otherwise you won\u2019t miss out on much.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "It is quite clear to me that C is by far the worst anime ever to have come out of the notamina block airing spot. Initially, with the director of Mononoke behind the steering wheel, and interesting premise of the show, I honestly thought I was in for intriguing series. However, despite this, there were clearly some things wrong with this anime from the start.\r\nWhat was clear to anyone watching this was how dreadful the animation, art, and editing was. Now it would seem that C never quite received the budget it needed, but still there is no excuse for the choppy editing that waspresent from episode 1 (And got much worst as it reached its conclusion). The show jumped form scene to scene without establishing much context, the transitions were very unnatural, and the character actions were always very hard to trace out.\\n\\n\r\nBut regardless of what was going on in the technical department, I was still interested at the start. The story focused on people who participate in a place called the financial district where they would wage duels in which they would use beings called assets to fight. Each participant would put their \"future\" on the line and the winner would gain more money while the loser would lose his future, and essentially their life would be ruined. The money of the financial district, called midas money, is only visible by people who have been to the financial district. Normal people can't see it, and it's everywhere in the real world. When people lose their \"future\" the real world has lots of changes in it happen too.\\n\\n\r\nBut without rambling too much about the setting, the anime seemed to be some sort of commentary on how money is used everyday, what it means to people, and the impact it has on our everyday lives. There were different things flying around about whether we should value the future over the present or the present over the future (Similar to some of the latest bail out talks surrounding governments), so there were plenty of interesting thing underneath the surface.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why it is just so disappointing that this anime had to train wreck so bad with its plot. Throughout the whole show they traveled through the plot points at blinding speed. Character development was hardly given at all, and the main character's development ended up making no sense due to this. Not to mention that the events towards the end seemed incredibly random, and the only reason you couldn't pause to ask yourself what the hell is going on is because every damn second a new ridiculous thing was happening.\\n\\n\r\nC is pretty much a case of nice idea, but horrible execution. Few animes ever get everything so wrong on the production side of things, stuff you can control, that i ends up ruining the show, but that is definitely what we have here. However, if you don't care much for the story it is very entertaining in its own right to see an anime such as this fall apart in such an epic fashion that you would have to see it to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, don't take this story seriously as I did, otherwise you're in for quite the disappointment.",

Tempting? Then again what is Money? How much is your future really worth? Would you stake your own future for the sake of others? These topics are attached to the story of \u2018C: The money of Soul and Possibility Control\u2019 meaning the anime is mainly about the Economic side of the Stock market! Don\u2019t worry the concept is really stimulating, the world building is set to its own style thus segregating itself from other shows. I like seeing astory about the Economics of the world since it involves all of us even though it\u2019s a confusing topic to grasp for most of us. And the story goes something like this where Yoga (who\u2019s the MC) is a College student who\u2019s broke as hell and after meeting an eccentric individual, is selected as an entrepreneur to a place that exists in the supernatural dimension where he can make a lot of money by betting his future. A player\u2019s future is conjured up to a Familiar being that acts as an Asset and both shall participate in a deal (battle) with other players on a weekly basis where winners are rewarded with more money (Black money of special kind that are only visible to the players of Financial District yet they work as normal money) while the loser nervously calculates the magnitude of loses since their future depends on it! (Losing your future entails losing your meaning of existence!) In addition, the players that go bankrupt are immediately kicked out from the Financial District for eternity! Yoga\u2019s Familiar predictably turns out to be a demoness named Msyu and while new players lose in their first match, in a typical fashion, Yoga manages to survive his 1st battle with the help of Msyu. And this anime gets interesting when we discover that the corroborative from the district actually has alarming ramifications on a worldwide scale which makes sense since more use of Financial district currency (Black Money) in the market naturally will lead to the fall of the country\u2019s actual money! Early on the plot captures your undivided attention regarding the struggle of what\u2019s more important, sustaining your present or shielding your future! The introduction of this concept elevates the show to new heights due to its interesting and challenging memo. Yet the message was poorly delivered due to the overall repetitive nature of this arc and generic direction in which the finale took place, lazily putting the end to this stimulating plot and replacing it with a predictable fight between the good and bad guy!\\n\\n\r\nI will start with Mikuni who\u2019s the most interesting character of the anime since he was the most fleshed out and he kinda happens to be a villain, even though he isn\u2019t, no matter how hard the anime tries to make him one though! He was one of the rare ones to win in his debut at the District and later went on to build his own guild which reached to the top in no time, making him and his guild very rich. We also see that Mikuni\u2019s yearning for money isn\u2019t driven by selfish desires unlike most of the District players, he\u2019s rather arranged himself in a powerful political position by constantly working towards regulating the tide of District money by helping the government and its partners from reaching total bankruptcy during their Economy\u2019s meltdown! And the aforementioned continued arc comes into play here where Mikuni is all in for jeopardizing the future just to enhance his presence while Yoga eventually goes against this \u2018vision\u2019, hell bent on protecting the future. What\u2019s brilliant here is that both sides aren\u2019t exactly wrong nor correct. They just happened to choose a side and since you can\u2019t have both, you can side with either of them without feeling guilty! While Mikuni\u2019s portrayal as a character was great, Yoga\u2019s development was that much boring! You swiftly lose interest in him since he comes across very generic. His wins never counted as wins for me since he won his battles just because he was the MC of the show, not cause of sheer skills or strength! Also, he prides himself on wanting a Normal life yet easily gets abstracted by others without weighing out his actions or penalties, this just proved that he had no real ambitions. Msyu doesn\u2019t get a lot of screen time but she\u2019s pretty generic too and she\u2019s present just for the romance! The romance came across very clich\u00e9d and unreal and misplaced! From what I saw, Yoga treated Msyu more as a friend than a master unlike the other players and she mistakenly takes this act as encouragement for feelings which just made Yoga look bad cause he\u2019s only doing this out of his naivety! Plus, Yoga has eyes on his future only and maybe Hanabe (another girl). To make matters worse, an effort for the Romance sprung up in the last 2 episodes and the anime failed at prospering their relationship so everything felt very forced! The rest of characters are mediocre as well who rarely get any screen time, making them forgettable and hurting the show\u2019s momentum. I mean I can only remember 2 of the side character faces, a lady and a guy. All I know is that the Lady eats all the time while working for some secret government branch and the Photographer guy can basically do anything! You can either get by with Awesome Secondary characters + Weak Leads or Stellar Leads with Average Supporting characters and this anime gets by none! Hanabe is another student character but her arc was really weird cause she goes from a typical friend of Yoga to a sorta potential love interest to a depressed girl all in 1 episode! After which she\u2019s barely mentioned at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe overall animation is well lit with bright colours but the quality remains inconsistent throughout and while the design of characters and the Financial district were all well done, their execution turned out to be messy with sloppy use of 3D. But Top marks to the visual department for brilliantly displaying the Best and Worst of both worlds! I particularly loved the visual representation of the Black border which were used to distinguish between the 2 worlds, perfectly doing their job whenever Yoga and Msyu were together on a single screen. In addition, the fights were nicely displayed by showcasing the different type of magic used and the use of Black money as a replacement for blood was cleverly shown! But then again, the editing in some episodes were very jarring. As for Voice Acting and the Soundtrack, it was pretty generic with nothing really standing out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime oddly finds itself in a unique category of its own by explaining its story too much yet you understand very little of it! I found the main reason to be the inconsistencies with the rules of the world, the fights and the story itself! Despite dedicating a few episodes for explaining the mechanisms of the Financial District, you are still hazily unclear with some parts. For instance, you use Black money to use magic during a fight so powerful magic means Big bucks but none of the characters every showed any type of concerns when using massive magic spells. Some players had more than 1 Asset which wasn\u2019t explained either or tricks like boosting you up during a battle by letting other players to your stock were never brought up or used again. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t agree with the justifications given! It\u2019s also pretty apparent the Studio were running out of money for the quality drops in spite of the anime\u2019s 11 episodes run time. This also means a rushed ending where too many things happened in the last 2 episodes thus ruining the finale. And just like the quality of the show falls as you proceed further, so does the writing! The major events towards the end were introduced just to raise the stakes for they were flimsily explained by glossing over many vital points. The anime would have benefited with a slightly bigger budget and more episodes to fill in the plot holes. Still it manages to leave an impression for here I am writing a review about it! It\u2019s a mix bag, not exactly bad nor good, but somewhere in the middle.",

            "content": "How much is your future worth?\r\nThat\u2019s a great concept question to start a series off before it proceeds to insult your intelligence.\r\nFrom the outlook C may appear to focus on economics, witty dialogue, and perhaps even action. Well, it\u2019s a trap.\r\nC is actually a series that consists of plot holes which builds on plot holes so as to continue with plot holes. There is actually no element in this story that is properly developed enough to truly attain a genre label. For example this series puts on a facade that it is based on economics using words like micro, macro, mezzo, inflation and even phrasessuch as \u201coverheated economy\u201d while it doesn't encompass the actual meaning of these words.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do that?\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m convinced that the writers opened economic and business textbooks and took out and used every cool sounding bolded term without understanding the definitions. That or they have no idea what they're writing about or how to write.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is some sort of action, mystery, and what even looked like romance; none of these were suitably developed and expanded on as the series tried to do too much with too little commitment.\\n\\n\r\nComing to this series off a recommendation from Spice and Wolf I could not be any more disappointed or insulted. I tried hard to give this series every chance possible to be liked and as a 19 year old second year university accounting student I thought I could relate to the protagonist Kimimaro, who is a 19 year old second year university economics student.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the studying and lifestyle that every student stereotypically has I couldn\u2019t relate with him. Actually Kimimaro is a character not to be messed with. This isn\u2019t because he wears impenetrable plot armour but because he can\u2019t grasp the opportunities in front of him nor justify any of his actions through a logical thought process; it\u2019s frustrating. He is a character that manages to lose focus of his values early on in the story and fails to establish new values as he lallygags his way through the story.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly how did he make it to university?\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist Mikuni however is a far more mature character with believable ideals and justifiable actions. As the overlord of the Financial District he does his best to minimize its damage and save Japan. However as the plot was so poorly formulated all his hard work and sacrifice is wasted as the magical rule that the protagonist is always right (even when he isn\u2019t) and always wins was enacted.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spoil the ending for you but the scheme that was implemented would in reality have crippled a country\u2019s economy permanently and ceded its control to another nation; in other words, economic suicide was the solution of choice. Ridiculous right?\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have any knowledge of economics and business stay away from this series as you will have headaches from the ignorance of the writers. The story was so disastrous that the rules that it established are changed in a moment\u2019s notice for the sake of continuing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt's as if playing a game without rules. It's just no fun if you don't know how to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe one saving grace for this series was its animation. It\u2019s beautiful like Bakemonogatari with great landscapes that are plain yet marvelous. Though really if you wanted beautiful animation you could just watch Bakemonogatari right?\\n\\n\r\nUltimately C is a series that forgot the original concept that drew in its viewers and develops in the wrong directions. Had it truly focused on dialogue, economics, and business this would have been a great niche series that would have likely fascinated a mature audience. Sadly this series tried to do too much and ended up being a badly developed battle anime with a hint of mystery and a poor excuse for romance.",

Overall, I\u2019m not impressed but relieved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 10\\n\r\nThe protagonist is, surprisingly, a simple university student, thinking about getting by and, but as the time flows, he is really growing up, changing himself and his perception of the world around him\u2026 Even though he is a slowpoke when it comes to making a decision, he does everything it takes to choose the best answer, shaping the reality the way he wants it to be. Moreover, each other character has their own detailed background and their own reasons as well, and I can\u2019t help but sympathy them, even if they have completely different ideals. \u201dI\u2019m a businessman first, then I\u2019m a parent\u201d, as one implies\u2026 personally, I know a lot of people thinking this way too, that\u2019s why I can tell the characters are more that realistic and interesting, without lots of clich\u00e9s (That cabin driver\u2026 what are you? Cain from VtM? Igor from Persona? Really cool, you know). Plus there\u2019s no certain villain amongst humans in series, which is rare and great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 5\\n\r\nAfter all, it was\u2026 plain. I have almost started yawning by the last episodes. Like, the authors couldn\u2019t come up with more breathtaking moments then the beginning had. And if you want to about economics in an entertaining way, you may receive the same joy off a simple textbook. An anime full of adventures must be more\u2026 lively. And seriously, the opening is full of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 7\\n\r\nThis anime has as many interesting ideas as borrowing from other series and stuff like that. Is it bad? Who knows. It resembles me of a bunch of things I like, though, and I can\u2019t help but say this anime is worth seeing once in awhile, if you don\u2019t mind watching something truly unusual. The end is really a something too.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that economy is an inseparable and indestructible part of our life. Can one prove this wrong?\\n",

I honestly thought it was a good anime!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is very original, the first with a setting and plot like this that I've ever seen. It does get confusing at points, especially near the end, but it really kept me entertained. I think it just needed a few more episodes to develop it more.\r\nArt: 9\r\nI really loved the art, it's just the kind I like ^^ I enjoyed how they made the creepy Midas guy (forgot his name ^^\") kind of 3D, though it was a bitweird in the beginning and took some getting used to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI like how the main character honestly has no idea what the heck he was doing in the beginning, and how he and his asset interacted. I think there should have been more episodes (once again) so that there would have been better character development, and I would've liked to have seen Masyu and Kimimaro interact with each other more and to have seen more of their battles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis was a really entertaining anime. It requires a lot of thought, so if you aren't in the mood for a thinking anime, don't watch it. It has some action, but it's definately not a mainstream battle anime. It's interesting and has some cute little romance going on between the main chara and his asset. The only thing I really have to complain on is the ending. It just cut off. It seemed like a good 30 seconds or so was hacked off of the end. Other than that, I think it was a pretty good anime, and definately worth your time ^^",

            "content": "First I have to say that this is only my second review, and I only write reviews for anime that I think are underrated. This review may be some what one sided, but I honestly feel this anime deserves a lot more respect than what it is given, so I'm here to balance things out a bit. Overall I give this anime a rating of 10, which may seem too high and simply not true, but I guess it all comes down to perspective right?\r\nNot everyone believes in the same thing, not everyone sees things the same way. Some people live for the future andothers live in the moment. That seems to be the basic underling philosophical concept explored in this anime, and the fate of Japan depends on how the main characters handle this question. They certainly could have done a better job at exploring the concept, but for an 11 episode anime you can't really fault them for giving it a good try.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will dislike the philosophical nature of this show, they might even consider it to be contrived and convoluted, and an unnecessary addition to an otherwise great anime. It is of course moderately convoluted and hard to understand at points, with small holes in the plot and a lack of some character development. However, this anime is attempting to explore complex philosophical questions that don't necessarily have one right answer.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of the story is not economics, in fact it would be pointless to criticize the economic theories presented in this anime, because it is after all a fictional show and the validity of the economic reasoning presented herein is far beyond the point of what this anime is really about. To claim the philosophical struggle between wanting a good present and wanting a good future destroys this anime, is to claim the fundamental foundation of this anime should simply be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning it is clear the underlying basis for this story is a struggle between two different paradigms and ideologies about what really matters in this reality. The economic overlay is simply a fitting way to present those philosophical conflicts and create the framework for a story containing characters who are given the chance to accumulate vast wealth and thus wield great power of the state of reality and the future of our reality.\\n\\n\r\nEven if it comes off as nonsensical babble to half the people who watch it, there is always something you can get from an anime like this, even if half of it doesn't make much sense to you. The story isn't as disconnected and structureless as it may first appear, although it certainly isn't perfect either. The spectacular art and gripping action make up for any downfalls this anime may have, and you will certainly not struggle to keep watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe main idea behind this story line involves a hidden world of money and fierce battles (so called \"deals\"). The Financial Districts are other worldly realities where only a select few are granted access. These hidden realities exist in all major economic epicenters of powerful nations, and the people plunged into this world are given an \"asset\" (some sort of creature) with which they must fight for the security of their future. Each \"Entre\", as they are called, have different goals and motives for fighting these battles.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line of this anime is extremely unique, nothing else like it exists. That alone makes it worth watching, because the majority of anime made these days seem to lack any true individuality and just take from plots that we've seen over and over again. While it does have a few small holes, I feel they did an excellent job at fitting so much into 11 episodes. There was hardly any filler at all and even though there was a lack of character development they used their time wisely.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that they had a goal in mind from the start and reached that goal in a more conclusive and satisfying manner than most animes are able to achieve. If you think they strayed off onto wild tangents and didn't seem to know where they wanted to take it, then I would say you need to watch it again and watch it much more closely this time. Although a bit predictable, they did build up the story in a meaningful way to reach their desired outcome.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is this anime is without fault. The style of the art has some very unique features, such as a sort of digital blocky overlay effect present in certain parts of the anime to facilitate scene transitions and the presence of an asset. It also uses a mind-boggling blend of 3D and 2D visuals that doesn't particularly disturb the overall feel of the artwork, but provides outstandingly detailed and colorful scenery that captures the imagination and jumps out of the screen, particularly in the financial district.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also moderately unique, especially the designs of the two lead assets, Msyu and Q. The character designs of these human-like assets will certainly provide all the cuteness and uniqueness one desires in appearance of certain female character roles. The quality of the art is very high quality and extremely detailed, and is probably one of the strongest features of this anime. It is very fluid and the emotional expressions of most characters are very clear and easy to read.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nWhile I didn't really pay much attention to the sound, it was definitely very good quality and suited the anime very well. The action scenes had gripping and intense dramatic music and the emotional scenes had deep and heavy scores that echo the gravity of each situation nicely. The character voices were actually very good, and in particular I thought the voice of Masakaki was extremely well done, and helped a lot to enforce the ominous insanity of his character.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, they did skip out a bit on character development, but it still deserves an 8 because the relationship development between the main character Kimimaro and his asset Msyu was actually very well done. I don't really get sucked into the relationship aspects of most anime, but I couldn't help admire the way their relationship grew stronger in this show, especially considering the way it started out.\\n\\n\r\nMsyu had an undeniably adorable personality, however I felt like there was a lack of explanation and back story for her and all other assets. Her desires and understanding of the world wasn't very well explained, although I can understand why they avoided that for the most part. They did dive into it a little bit, but it seems like they decided to skip over it and just leave it as a bit of a mystery for viewers to discern on their own.\\n\\n\r\nKimimaro is a rather typical male lead character, the classic ordinary everyday guy constantly conflicted by morals and an inability to do things the right way until he is literally put through hell and finally realizes what needs to be done. While he may be overly stereotypical in a lot of ways, he does have a certain respectable uniqueness about him which seemed to be a necessary and key part in the development of his relationship with Msyu.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kimimaro does have a moderately developed back story revolving around the fate of his father, there is another Entre named Souichirou who attempts to befriend Kimimaro and mentor him on how to reduce any damage done to the real world by planning the outcomes of his battles carefully. Souichirou probably has the most detailed back story, he also has issues concerning his father, and claims to fight for the present reality. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nThere is no denying that the anime has an overall enjoyment factor of the highest degree when all aspects are considered - well it did for me anyway. It had all the necessary features to make a great anime in my opinion, the story was unique and fairly well done, and involved ideas that I really enjoy. The mix of a magical money world hidden away from reality and the philosophical concepts built around that world make for a story that had me on the edge of my seat all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe phenomenal art and the impressive battles only served to push my enjoyment level to the limit, and I finished this anime in less than three days because I just couldn't stop watching it. It could have been a bit longer but I have no real problems with the way they handled the story given the length of the anime. This is certainly an anime that is worthy of reaching my top 10 list of anime. I don't re-watch many anime series but this is one I would consider watching again.",

            "content": "[C] The Lack of Responsible Spending and Viewer Sympathy\r\nIt\u2019s clear from my reinterpretation of the title that I flat out didn\u2019t like it. I sat through the season hoping it would get better as it went along. It didn\u2019t. So to sum up what this show did wrong: Almost everything\u2026 except the central concept and opening/ending scores.\r\nHonestly, this anime didn\u2019t give me anything to justify my watching it. Other than its interesting premise of another world called the Financial District which controls and inevitably destroys the economy of each respective country in the physical world, there\u2019s nothing else to see here. Our protagonist, Yoga, Kimimaro,is a kid with no drive to do anything productive with his life. Right off the bat, we\u2019re presented with the generic \u201cguy with no redeeming qualities\u201d to play with. Mr. Boring here hates his dad, has no girlfriend because he was too much of a wuss to ask out his childhood friend, is an econ major, and works part time at a convenience store to pay for living expenses. His existence is double its original worth once he\u2019s paid a strange visit by a guy named Masakaki.\\n\\n\r\nMasakaki is actually kind of an interesting dude because he represents the law of the Financial District and is a guide to those introduced into this new world. There\u2019s not one of him as each District has their own Masakaki of sorts. Throughout the anime, he pops up several times to inform people of major events going on and announce duels between those involved in the District.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a plethora of supporting characters but I\u2019m getting too long-winded as it is with just the main ones to detail the rest so I\u2019ll tell you now that the show isn\u2019t worth watching for them. Msyu is Kimimaro\u2019s Asset and eventual love interest. Blehh. Jennifer is an exec of IMF, an organization attempting to bring down the Financial District. She, for some reason, is always eating burgers when she\u2019s out investigating. Hanabi is the childhood friend mentioned earlier. Takedazaki is an informant in the District and general creeper with a crazy laugh. \\n\\n\r\nNow, everyone part of this other world uses something called midas money to duel others and spend in the real world which is why it gets screwed over. Apparently, almost all of them are money grubbers who only fight for their own benefit. Of course, bringing \u201cfake\u201d money into circulation in mass quantities throws off the balance of the economy. I won\u2019t delve too deep into the logistics because they don\u2019t matter and I don\u2019t fully understand the system myself. Each person has an Asset which is like\u2026 an astral being?... I don\u2019t know, anyway, they represent their respective owner\u2019s future and they fight in battles (duels) against other Assets like their goddamn Pok\u00e9mon or something. And the whole micro-, mezo-, macro- flation based attacks are just silly. There\u2019s a bunch of other stuff that happens in between the fighting but it\u2019s irrelevant to the overall scheme of things. For example, you don\u2019t find out what C is until the end. The hell?\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t do an adequate job of explaining anything in enough detail to really understand what\u2019s going on at any given time. As the story progresses, it gets more convoluted once you see cities digitizing into nothing along with the people inhabiting them. Countries disappear by ways of economic collapse. Organizations inside and outside the Districts have a hand in abusing midas currency, trying to prevent the future loss of nations, or attempting to preserve the present condition of those same nations. The antagonist, Souichirou, is an advocate for the present. He\u2019s a suave businessman who holds a lot of influence in Japan as he\u2019s at the top of the chain in the Far East District. He blames his father for the death of his sister because he prioritized his company over family. Ironically, Souichirou\u2019s ideals become more like his dad\u2019s after the event in that he starts believing money is power. To me though, he\u2019s just a kid with a lot of toys but wants to play with everyone else\u2019s. A stubborn man who pushes his values onto others because that\u2019s the only way he knows to gain control over everything and mold Japan to his liking because he doesn\u2019t believe in a future anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art and sound department, [C] tries to blend 3D and 2D animation together, like in the case of duels. However, sometimes they don\u2019t blend too well and it just starts to feel disjointed. The character and Asset designs are pretty ordinary. Although, some of the Assets are definitely more out there than others in both looks and abilities. Now as far as songs go, I enjoyed them both. The rock opening paired with the fluid animation of currency falling from the sky and flythrough into the streets of the Financial District got me pumped up for what was to come but obviously the anime itself fell short of what the songs did to hype it up for. And the endings electronic beats, percussion, and great vocals served as a great way to close each episode as the show was in a way an RPG considering how Yoga and Msyu fought tougher opponents each time to eventually end up going against Mikuni, the BOSS if you will. I think partly why I fancied the ending score was because it reminded me of East of Eden\u2019s ending for some strange reason. The voice acting was sufficient when it was in Japanese and god awful when they started speaking English. Seriously, everything was terrible when it came to the English talk. I\u2019ll leave it at that and you can see for yourself if you still feel the urge to hear it firsthand. Fair warning, you could be audibly raped.\\n\\n\r\nMy final grumbles about [C] is that I couldn\u2019t relate to anyone or anything in the show and that made it so every emotional event that was supposed to evoke something out of me just failed miserably. Msyu losing limbs and crying out in agony didn\u2019t even make me blink because I knew that she\u2019d regenerate right once the duel was over. Kimimaro\u2019s attempts to be heroic were not only boring but obvious and as a result I started liking him even less as a character. His existence value started at zero and doubling a zero is still only zero. My indifference towards it all was mostly due to the weak character development as you can tell. Msyu was probably the only one whose character evolved (not a Pok\u00e9mon joke) within the story and that\u2019s only because she didn\u2019t know anything about being human until Kimimaro came around and ate ramen noodles in front of her. I know, right? Eating?! That\u2019s insane!\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, what this anime boils down to is its lack of any real flow to the plot and missed attempt at drawing emotion out of the viewers whilst giving us a crash course in finances which to say it didn\u2019t do a good job of that either. Maybe, and I\u2019m being generous here, if they didn\u2019t do such a horrendous job of mimicking English speakers, I\u2019d give it one score higher. Maybe. But if time was currency, I\u2019d definitely spend it on something else worth my attention.\\n",

            "content": "'C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control' is an apparent response to the current state of business, and the recent global financial crisis.\r\nThe main theme of this series is \"present vs future\", with the main antagonist on the \"present\" side of the argument vying for the control of the financial district against the protagonist's \"future\" argument. This could be a direct criticism to the banking industry for their irresponsible lending for short-term profits (the present), which ultimately led to the subprime mortgage breakdown and Lehman Brothers declaring bankruptcy, subsequently causing economic disaster in Japan as well (loss of future). Using a person's future ascollateral for cash today is also an extreme representation of excessive lending.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins in the generic shounen fashion, with the \"ordinary but chosen\" student suddenly getting an invitation to participate in something greater, and given \"powers\" in the form of money and Digimon \"assets\". The underlying concept of this series is extremely weak, since it's based on an overly complicated battle system akin to 'Yu-Gi-Oh!' or 'Duel Masters', which relies on new rules and abilities introduced out of nowhere in the most deus ex machina manner imaginable to advance battles. We are literally being told that the protagonist is \"blessed with a strong asset\" because that's the only way to explain how he won the first battle, and one minute we're being told the amount of money in possession or strategy decides the outcome, the next minute they somehow manage to defeat the richer Sennoza without strategy (pure guts?).\\n\\n\r\nThis series is also plagued from the presence of too many characters. There is simply not enough time in an 11-episode series to develop 20+ characters, and many of their actions did not make sense. It was especially hard to identify the protagonist's motivation for rejecting the \"present\" view point, and his relationship with Hanabi, if she can even be called a heroine, since she is a non-presence in terms of screen time, and appears to be nothing more than a simple friend the protagonist has a little crush on. Every single opponent the protagonist faced are presented as good-but-misguided people fighting for an honorable purpose, and extremely forgiving towards the protagonist for destroying their lives. This is lazy scriptwriting, there's no excuse for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this series is wonderful. The surreal alternative world, the dynamic presentation, the \"wall\" between the real life and virtual (Msyu sitting beside protagonist, the obtrusive word bubble etc), the action sequence... all makes this series very fun to watch. Character designs are pretty attractive, and other than slightly sloppy CGI in the second half of the show, it was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound was almost equally wonderful, with excellent voice acting that fits well for every main character, especially that of Msyu by Tomatsu Haruka.\\n\r\nExciting battle BGM, and even more impressive was the music in slow scenes with the nostalgic and poignant feeling that they invoke.\\n\r\nThe OP was a good yet ordinary rock song, but the ED 'RPG' by School Food Punishment was an overwhelmingly fitting song for this series, accompanied by arguably the most visually pleasing ED animation since 'Tatami Galaxy'.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the atmosphere in this series. The narration and back-story for characters were also very enjoyable. However, they are too fragmented to make a huge impact to the main story. The single biggest flaw of this series is that the battles are far too superficial. Other money or life-game series such as 'Death Note' and 'Liar Game' had clear introduction of rules, which are enforced throughout the \"game\", using strategy or suspense for entertainment. On the other hand, 'C' used action, which simply does not make sense for a series of this kind. Strategies were superficial, and the consequences of loss (bankruptcy) were extremely vague. It feels like we're being shown a game's replay, rather than playing along with the protagonist. The premise of this series was amazing, with the existence of an alternative market, the Midas money, and the virtual world affecting the real. Unfortunately, the battle system was unable to fully capitalize on the concept. Perhaps the protagonist should've just turned into a stock trader or swindler... anyone using wits to earn money instead of a virtual pet who had nothing to do with money.\\n\\n\r\nIt also wasn't clear how the virtual world functioned, and what purposes they served. SEA financial district bankruptcy that destroyed Singapore sending \"shock waves\" approaching other markets? It was literally depicted like tsunami approaching on screen with a countdown rather actually showing how global businesses are connected and affected by international markets. It got so bad that there was a big stylized letter \"C\" moving across the ocean on a screen to represent the economic effect moving. In the end, nothing was explained, and the protagonist's efforts were in vain. The world turns as usual, and the corrupt financial districts will continue to exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe message of the series was also very conflicted. It started out as blatant criticism of the banking industry and questioning the importance of money, then it was the trust in the currency, and finally the big bad America? I did like how they attempted to show the futility of printing money to fix economic disaster (representing the futile Quantitative Easing), but it makes no sense to use losing face value of a currency as a crisis when Japan's recession today is mostly attributed to the strong yen. It also didn't really make sense to blame the U.S. for the financial crisis, because well, if it wasn't trade relationship with America, they would not have had the money to lose in financial crisis in the first place. Not to mention it was the U.S. that suffered the most in this recession. Like it's mentioned in one episode, you prosper together in a network, fall together too.\\n\\n\r\nRandom business jargons were being thrown out throughout the series, with terms like \"entrepreneur\" (they would usually just say \"Kigyouka\" in Japanese for that), \"collateral\" (\"future\" as \"collateral\" should not be affected until failure of repayment, so why does printing more money using future as collateral instantly destroyed people's future?), and nonsense battle moves like \"Macro/Mezzo/Micro-flation\", \"M&A\", \"Overheated Economy\", and \"Cannibalization\" (this term in business means launching a new product that eats away the sales of existing product of your own company, not eating others) etc. just makes it obvious those terms were being used simply to sound cool and an attempt to appear different from every other shounen battle anime.\\n\\n\r\n'C' is a total failure in addressing real world issues. The setting, story, and character development are disastrous, but visual and audio presentation are very pleasing with good pacing. It's an enjoyable series as long as you don't think too much or take it too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nIt is, after all, a show that has chosen style over substance.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Abbreviated Review: Nakamura, I'm really disappointed.\r\nTo firmly address some basics, this is a response to claims such as \"original story\" and \"original concept.\" I do not believe that C - The Money of Soul and Possibility Control (the title itself a string of nonsensical positively charged words) to be any bit of original. Kenji Nakamura, director of Mononoke and Trapeze, two works I adore, has accomplished nothing with this production. noitominA was also behind this anime, which hyped me for it to be the best of the season. It had all the makings of greatness, but suffers from excessive drama, random side stories, and well,lack of a straightforward plot. This show has no destination, and there have been numerous random twists in the series so far that have completely changed and re-changed what the show was even about.\\n\\n\r\nTo address the original story, I must first note a few productions that have existed before C. The main two I want to talk about are \"Digimon Tamers\" and \"Chobits.\" Digimon Tamers (or Season 3) is about a group of children whose world merges with the digital world, and they gain control over monsters (in case you didn't know). Towards the end of the fifty-two episode series, a monster from the digital world tries to break into the \"real world\" and begins destroying buildings and erasing humans. This exact same concept is being toted by C, for what purpose I have no clue. \\n\\n\r\nBut let me back up.\\n\\n\r\nC starts off with a boy named Yoga, who is taking some sort of economics course at his most likely community college (his friends only talk about keggers, so my guess is that it's a community college - or Harvard). He has a cute friend who tells him he doesn't need to \"do everything by himself.\" Of course, he is a total loner - a real 2D badass in the worst sense. His whole life, he claims, he has done everything for himself. Then suddenly, he is visited by the overly-creepy pink-haired pseudo-mascot with a Chesire-esque smile who offers him infinite monies in exchange for his soul. That's cool and all, but souls are never even mentioned again in the rest of the series so, I think he was lying. So the kid who is really good at yoga says sure thing and then he gets lots of money and starts running around the Financial District (Code word for Digital World) in search of BATTLES. That's right! To get money you have to fight other people and take their star chip- monies! Losing in the Financial District also causes your real self to lose as well (it's not always money, but seeing as there's really no logic that connects how losing money correlates to losing family and friends like some characters in the show do, this aspect really doesn't add anything interesting). He also gets granted, in order to fight, a super desu kawaii persacom! Yeah, here's where the Chobits comes in. He gets a computer girlfriend essentially, and after about two episodes with yoga master she goes from tsundere to dere~dere~love and keeps trying to seduce our professional yoga lead. Spoilers: it is totally unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nHis parents are also missing inside the Financial District, there's disgustingly bad ENGRISH, there's a giant death clock, enormous tentacle monsters appear out of nowhere, people eat money, John Lennon is in a Hawaiian shirt, unnecessarily complex (more so complex by disguise) guild systems exist and much much more useless, pointless, trite, and frustrating material.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of \"epic\" things in this show. I put that word in quotations because they are not epic, they merely lampshade cliches and the inability to weave a coherent and original story with elements of \"epicness.\" The fact his parents are probably dead is used to make the audience feel pity, the end of the world is near is used to give the show some sort of half-assed direction, and the romance between the Asset (persacom thing) and our king of the yoga is used to make the audience feel endeared. This production shouldn't have all of these things going on at once. It's confused as to what it should be doing, so it keeps throwing random things on screen. If you start to discuss the relevance to any of the side characters, it shouldn't surprise that they're confusing too. Most are on screen briefly, die, and C leaves it at that. I'm not sure why, but it happens a lot. Out of say, ten characters introduced from the Financial District in the first five episodes, about four of them are alive. Killing off people doesn't make a show more meaningful! Multitasking is dangerous, especially while driving, and that is where I think C went wrong. Striving to fool the audience with a masked purpose, stripped to it's bare, the story is not original at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the visuals, I really wish they used this style a little better than for monster fights in a money world. I love this art, but I loved it much more in Trapeze and Mononoke where it was used artistically. In C, the animation is used for monster battles. The CGI is atrociously awkward, and the fight scenes between the large computer generated monsters are boring and pointless. Yoga-brotha loses numerous battles but loses nothing important, so even animating these fight scenes so far has done nil. The opening visuals are fantastic, but not new. The same style was used for Eden of the East, and to be perfectly blunt, I think it was better there. The art is not original either.\\n\\n\r\nA good thing about the sound is that school food punishment does the ending theme. The opening is fine too, but I really have no opinion on that. The voice-acting for Mysu (pesrsacom) and Masakaki (chesire guy) are fine, and I rather like them (as chesire was Irabu from Trapeze, I have a nostalgic enjoyment listening to him). I must say though, any respect for voice acting in this show is lost when I mention Jennifer Satou (who is she? let me tell you). The buxom blonde American secret service agent working for the IMF (I think) has one of the most ANNOYING and EAR RAPE voices I have EVER HEARD. You thought Kuroko from Index was bad?! Wait until you hear this chick voiced with a lollipop in her mouth. The awful stereotypical pseudo-American voice speaks volumes for how little this staff actually knew about American speech manner. (It also doesn't help that her character is literally always eating and that her food of choice is often hamburgers.) Then let's address the bad English. Eden of the East used English wonderfully, racial tones even mixed in correctly (African-Americans from DC sounded like such). In C, you have old white businessmen with thick black accents and women who look like Hilary Clinton sound like 21-year-old Asian girls speaking bad English. Actually scratch the \"like,\" portion, they sound exactly the same because the voice acting is simply bad in this regard. The voice acting wouldn't necessarily be bad or frustrating to hear (the English that is) if it actually had a purpose though. The bad voices lead me to the conclusion that the studio did a poor job in their spare time because they wanted to add elements that made the show look more important than it is.\\n\\n\r\nWhich boils right back down to the bad characters. Aside from the previously addressed protagonist who happens to be good at yoga and pointlessly creepy pink-haired guy (Masakaki) there are a huge amount of characters. \\n\\n\r\n[not so spoiler] That all die. [/not so spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nWe still have the psychotic John Lennon character who works under the fabulous rich guy who somehow took a liking to our jerk of a protagonist. The rich guy does a bunch of needless dramatic things like launch giant tentacle monsters at \"world markets\" and wears his fabulous scarf and pimps out a bunch of ASSets (one is named Q. Wicked edgy). John Lennon just runs around and acts eccentric, and his friend with the gold teeth runs around and takes pictures. So there's a lot of eccentricity and running going on in the show, but there once again, is no destination.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't let the idea of a show dealing with money fool you. This show has very little to do with money and it has very little to do with actual economics, financing, and business. What it is stripped bare is a shonen quest to save the world, and there's just a bunch of melodrama introduced along the way. C is not a new concept, it is a re-hash and re-buff of kids shows in a \"dark and gritty\" manner. Nakamura, I thought you of all people could do better than this, but I feel you've fallen for the preteen marketing trap, trying to make a work edgier than it really is. \\n\\n\r\nThus, I've come to the conclusion that C stands for \"Corny.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you found this review unhelpful, please tell me why. Thanks!",

I love the concept about the money and the asset(which is like a supporter to the entre's). \\n\r\nI got hooked after the second episode & i hope you will too, cause its a great show so far.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is stunning!\\n\r\nI love the patterns they used for the money, the shape and designs of the building in the financial district.

            "content": "Prior to the initial airing of [C], I was really hyped for it because the director attached to it was Kenji Nakamura. Other notable anime on his resume were Mononoke and Trapeze (Kuchuu Buranko) and both were really good anime. They were eccentric, visually stunning, well executed pieces of animation. Most importantly it really highlighted Nakamura\u2019s diversity as a director since Mononoke was at heart a mystery series with slight horror elements and Trapeze was an eccentric comedy about people with mental disorders. The only real element they shared was a sense of surreality. Then we got rumors of [C]: The Money of Soul andPossibility Control, a supposed anime that dealt with topics related to the state of the current economy in a battle anime-esque way.  This was totally the kind of anime I thought Nakamura would direct since the premise sounded fresh and original and it was in the noitaminA timeslot which basically meant that the concept of the show wouldn\u2019t be gutted in favor of appealing to a broader audience. The only real notable difference here was that the production studio was Tatsunoko, where Mononoke and Trapeze were done by Toei. I didn\u2019t really think this would be a big factor in the larger scheme of things so I brushed it aside and began getting immensely hyped. And at the end of this little rainbow all I ended up with was a pot of bitter disappointment and frustration. [C] doesn\u2019t fall short of Mononoke or Trapeze, it runs off a cliff and gets impaled on the rocks below. Not only is it disappointing in that regard but it doesn\u2019t even manage to have many redeeming aspects, if any at all. \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s deal with the least offensive part of [C] and that\u2019s the plot. The premise involves a student named Yoga trying to tough out the hard times and getting through life in an economy that seems to working against everyone. Cutting corners to save costs, working multiple jobs and getting good grades on top of that, yeah none of us are ever really ready to deal with the hurdles that comes with pursuing tertiary education after high school. Let\u2019s not even deal with romance and finding a girlfriend/boyfriend in addition. This is one of the few things [C] does right and that\u2019s creating an initially relatable main character that the audience can sympathize with. Unfortunately that\u2019s where the good things stop with [C], the premise and the first episode is probably the best part of the show and I\u2019m not kidding at all. We then get to the meat of the story and that involves a magical dimension in the middle of the city called the \u201cFinancial District\u201d where people fight out battles called \u201cDeals\u201d with pokem-err I mean\u201cAssets\u201d. If they win they get some Midas Money and if they lose, their future disappears. Now in terms of actual plot, [C] has a bunch of pacing issues and a narrative that goes nowhere until the last couple of episodes. Everything the audience needs to know is given to us in the first two episodes and the driving force of the plot only shows up at the end. There\u2019s a good flashback episode in the middle but that\u2019s pretty much character related. You have a good chunk of the middle which revolves around Yoga fighting other people and their story but ultimately none of this stuff ever adds anything to the narrative. You could argue that they\u2019re there to characterize Yoga but that\u2019s pointless since Yoga doesn\u2019t grow as a character throughout the show. They play on the redundant \u201cWhat am I fighting for/What do I want to protect\u201d theme that nearly every anime arbitrarily slaps on to characters they don\u2019t know what to do with. There\u2019s also a concurrent plotline that deals with Yoga\u2019s dad but even that is done in a half-assed way. You have Yoga agonizing over several episodes on why his dad supposedly abandoned his family when the whole goddamn answer is so obvious in the first place. The way Yoga treats it as an epiphany is even more annoying, really why would a father ever fight to win money? COULD IT POSSIBLY BE BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY? But nah that answer is too high-brow for the audience, might as well pad it out for a couple of episodes. It\u2019s such lazy way of delivering a frankly boring plot point anyway especially since Yoga doesn\u2019t learn anything from it. To make things even worse, Yoga never ends up doing anything on his own accord. Even at the end, he\u2019s fighting because someone else told him to, not because he reached that answer himself. That\u2019s the problem of creating a character based on a motive like \u201cProtecting something\u201d without any real elaboration. Yoga comes off as nothing but the standard battle shounen lead except it\u2019s played completely straight. He\u2019s barely a character on his own and whatever possibilities there are initially end up being completely wasted. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of other major characters, the only other remotely interesting one is the series antagonist, Mikuni. He contrasts Yoga\u2019s blind sheep idealism with a stark amount of pragmatism. He drives all the action in the plot and has the most characterization out of the entire cast. Honestly I believe that [C] was initially written with Mikuni as the main character instead of Yoga, yet in order to make the anime more appealing they had to shoehorn a younger character in because lol anime. If you check out some of the groundwork on [C], most of the concept art and notes focus on Mikuni. On the other hand Msyu, Masakaki and Jennifer are just walking archetypes with one gimmick they play over and over again in place of actual characterization. The only other memorable supporting characters are the professor and the charity worker but they\u2019re only around for an episode and again, they don\u2019t add anything to overall narrative. This is a problem since the show has an overarching plot yet it tries to be almost episodic and these different narrative structures clash horribly.  Generally the writing is the definition of mediocre. It\u2019s got some good ideas, but never elaborates on them and whatever aspects it does elaborate on are wholly uninteresting.  Also there is virtually no economics in this anime, unless you count naming attacks \u201cMicro, Macro or Mezzo\u201d economics related. It tries to use this angle to cover up just how shallow the entire battles are. There\u2019s a bit with hyperinflation at the end yet it doesn\u2019t make any sense in the context it\u2019s used in. If you\u2019re expecting something like Spice & Wolf, don\u2019t bother since [C] uses fantasy economics because it\u2019s a battle anime that fails at making any relevant or meaningful social commentary.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the most damning aspect of [C] is the animation, composition and general scene layout. Even if [C] has some lackluster and boring writing, it still could have been a decent watch if the visual fidelity was on the level of the Nakamura\u2019s previous works. Yet in the end, [C] had some of the worst cinematography I\u2019ve seen in an anime in quite a while. The cuts and composition for each scene are not just bland or boring, they\u2019re awkward and jarring. You have a cut of Yoga and Msyu fighting someone else and we\u2019re getting to the climactic end yet THE FUCKING SHOW DECIDES TO CUT AWAY AT THE LAST MOMENT AND PROCEDES TO SHOW THE AFTERMATH. Really. Now yes, this style was used in Mononoke and Trapeze but it had significance there. The jarring cuts in those shows were there to play off of their quirky and artsy visual style AND most importantly they built tension in Mononoke (because it had strong mystery and horror aspects) and those same cuts really magnified the surrealism and comedy in Trapeze. It has no place being in [C], because this anime\u2019s composition is incredibly plain. You\u2019ll have cuts of Yoga walking across the street yet we see it cut to him being on one side, in the middle than at the other side with not much animation in between. It has no meaning and it\u2019s obviously there to hide whatever shoestring budget this anime was made on. Truthfully Mononoke and Trapeze didn\u2019t have great animation either yet they hid that with clever scene layouts, angles and composition. Mononoke for example still had some breathtaking cuts that were animated beautifully. Just compare the last five minutes of its fifth episode to all of [C], the difference is like night and day. Not only that but [C]\u2019s animation is genuinely terrible, the laughable running cut in the first fight should tip you off, or rather smack you over the head with it. All the fights have bad animation; I cannot understand why they would want to make a battle show if they didn\u2019t want to spend money on it. There were some cuts done by notable animators such as Sushio and Ryochimo but in the end their cuts only exemplified how bad the scene layouts and storyboards were. Even their animation didn\u2019t make any of the fights more interesting or exciting. Ironically enough, it seems all the good animation was saved for the final episode and while it\u2019s alright, it still doesn\u2019t excuse the utter mediocrity of the other 10 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTo top it all off, [C] has some atrocious aesthetics. The character designs are bland and uninspired, and the color palette clashes with the CGI work (incredibly frustrating since Mononoke had just as much CGI but the difference was that [C]\u2019s is a fucking pink elephant in the room). You have entire cuts that are done in CGI, even the characters and it sticks out like a sore thumb. There really is no excuse for such poor visual fidelity, it\u2019s fairly obvious that Tatsunoko did not give Nakamura the creative liberty he had with his previous works and they also gave him a pretty bad staff to work with. The musical score is non-existent except for in the last couple of episodes and the voice-work only makes the characters more lifeless than they already are.  \\n\\n\r\nSo after all those bitter tears, is [C] worth watching? No, especially if you\u2019re watching this because of Nakamura. I admit, I\u2019m being biased against it because I had lofty expectations yet [C] never becomes anything more than mediocre in all of its 11 episodes. The writing is contradictory, the visuals are horrible, and so it doesn\u2019t really do anything that deserves praise. If you want an intelligent fighting anime, you\u2019re not gonna find it here. Hell if you want something quirky and Nakamura-esque, you\u2019ll definitely leave this anime with a bad taste in your mouth. \\n",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control starts off as an interesting enough idea. It is an action show centering around economics of all things; an odd concept but unique, and seemingly well suited for the older audiences that its noitaminA time slot is geared towards. However, the show quickly loses sight of what it wants to be and what it is trying to say. On one hand, it is a sleek action show, on the other economic commentary; yet it also tries to be a profound story about the relationship between the present and the future. The end result is needlessly convoluted, thevictim of too many ideas going in too many different directions.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning, this review contains spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Kimihiro Yoga, an average college student, who just like any other college student is pretty hard pressed for money. That is until a strange ethereal being offers him a way to make a lot more money; it entails fighting battles (which are called deals) in the otherworldly Financial District along side mystical creatures called assets, whom are the embodiment of their owners futures. Though just a newcomer, Kimihiro and his asset, Msyu, draw the attention of a veteran of the Financial District, Souichirou Mikumi, and gets sucked into a struggle that has the fate of Japan hanging on the line.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical-side of things, [C] looks stellar. The backgrounds for this show look fantastic, just brimming with detail and finesse. In particular, the financial district is a sight to behold, looking both majestic and ominous and featuring near flawless integration of 2-D and 3-D animation. The show has a unique digitized look which makes for very good eye candy. Character designs are not really anything special in the realm of anime, but still look very attractive, especially the ones for Msyu and Q. The animation is fluid and the vivid color scheme is eye-popping, which makes the action sequences a joy to watch. Like the visuals, the soundtrack here is impressive. Well composed and attention grabbing, it heavily features electronic beats and chanting vocals that will get your blood pumping in the action sequences, yet still fits the action-less moments just as well.\\n\\n\r\nWith the superb animation and soundtrack out of the way, lets get to brass tax... [C] has a lot of interesting ideas, but struggles tremendously to keep a hold of them. It starts off seemingly as a critique of Japan's economic system (or perhaps just economic systems in general). Kimihiro's financial situation; the high stakes of battles (called Deals) in the financial district; the extremes people are driven to by financial loss, these all fit together into a rather biting commentary. If the show stuck with just that it would have been fine.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show attempts to deepen its impact by giving the money flowing out of the financial district a rather ominous effect, it steels peoples' futures. This is where the show starts running into some major issues. With their futures being stolen, people, buildings, and even countries start vanishing into thin air. This does add a little surreal creepiness to the show, but it also is incredibly contrived. There are some huge holes in logic flaws in the way things vanish, unimportant characters seem not to notice any difference, but Kimihiro and other important characters do. Perhaps it is because of their involvement with with the financial district, but it is still a flimsy explanation. Far more problematic, however, is what this plot device does to the story thematically. First off, one must wonder why the writers found it necessary to even include this device to begin with... isn't the threat of financial crisis threatening enough, a quick look at today's economic situation will tell you that it is. By adding the whole 'mystical future stealing money' angle, the show actually downplays the severity of an economy in crisis.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is the 'present vs. future' debate between Kimihiro and Mikuni that is caused by the future stealing money. Both characters start spouting philosophical babble about the nature of the present and future, and which is more important. What had started off as economic commentary becomes something completely different, with economics playing only a minor role in the story. This debate about the present and future is not developed well enough to be impactful, which isn't surprising because the show is only 11 episodes long, and culminates in a Dues Ex Machina ending that feels pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of [C] are not anything remarkable either, but they do offer just enough to win some of the audience over. Kimihiro for his part is a pretty typical male anime lead, flickering between being meek and heroic as a lot\\n\r\nof anime leads do nowadays. Still, the way he struggles to do the right thing gives the audience something to latch on to. His relationship with his asset, Msyu, is more interesting than his personality; in fact one of the best moments in the show is Msyu reflecting on their relationship. Probably the best developed character in the show is Mikumi, whom actually has a fairly interesting back story (which is of course tragic) which serves as his motivation. The rest of the characters are a bunch of walking plot devices, and don't develop into anything more than that.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it pains me a little to be so hard on this show, because it is not terrible. The ideas behind the show are interesting enough, and it is certainly easy on the eyes. However, the plot is poorly executed, ending up as a lot of sound and furry with little substance behind it. If you are interested in the subject of economics, watch Spice and Wolf instead. It does a better job of incorporating economics into its plot, has better developed characters, and is not contrived like [C].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The phrase that immediately comes to my mind is \"bizarre but unique\".  \r\nC: The Money Of Soul and Possibility Control have a comprehensive plot that rarely founded in 11 episode (only in Higashi no Eden). The level of originality of the story is above average. The anime proves that to appear different it's not a bad thing. The battle really looks like a kid battle for me, which a little dull because the poor execution that given. The problemis the story weighed so much that sometimes feels overloaded for a short anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and unique, the character has a unique design that rarely seen. The background is amazing. There are several scene and frames using CG, its add another attraction of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, all of the sound aspects is decent. Not much to say in this section, but the ending tune kinda reminds me with Persona songs, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character, we have a poor character development. Our character division is quite typical as well. We have our dull male leader, Yoga Kimimaro. He is another typical male lead that usually appear in shounen series, and we have Msyu the hero's partner. The most massive character development centered in Mikuni (because he has some interesting back story). Other character did not have a proper development.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, C is another enjoyable series. Although the battle scene is not the main interest of this anime, but the enjoyment level of this anime is high. It is highly recommended for those who seeks unique settings, and for those who enjoy a short but good anime...",

            "content": "*There is minor spoilers. Read at your own risk*\r\nMoney. You can use it to buy anything. Even your future. C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is what i consider, a very good anime. I was disappointed at some of the negative reviews out there, and even though there were flaws i believe that the flaws did not change my overall enjoyment of the series. \r\nSo here are some pros and cons that i will go in depth later.\r\nPros:\r\n+Original idea\r\n+Interesting Plot\r\n+SUPERPOWERS\r\n+Awesome fight scenes\r\n+Great animation and art quality that never dropped each episode\r\nCons: \r\n-Awkward cuts between scenes.\r\n-Pacing sometimes to fast.\r\n-To little episodes. More episodes neededto go in depth about something like characters for instance.\\n\r\n-Characters aren't very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nSo on with the review. Overall, I believe that the plot, art, and sound were the strongest points that made this anime enjoyable. But with a lack of character understanding, this anime can not get higher than an 8 objectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is, as i said before, is very intriguing. Since the anime description of the series above is pretty accurate i wont go into plot summary. However, i will start with the negative aspects with the plot first. From my opinion, the plot was paced to fast which means less episodes and i honestly believe that they could make more episodes and could go more in depth with the characters, whom i believe lacked memorability. In addition, there were also many awkward cuts within the episodes, and to some people, it bothers them a lot. However, the plot overall is very interesting and original. Being a huge fan of superpower animes, this show really attracted me because it had awesome battles, cool power moves, and i really like the idea of spending money in order to use a move and with no money you basically lose and go bankrupt, which would impact your future. So all you superpower fans out there, you should give this show a chance.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, pushing away the negatives sides of the plot, i do find that C does have a lot of positive aspects which has made me enjoy this show, especially the animation and art which i believe was one of their strong points. Each episode has never dropped the quality of animation and art which is awesome if i say so myself. They also tried to incorporate and blend in some 3-D which is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, I believe that C does a extremely good job in this department and is one their strong points. Besides the fact that they have an awesome opening and ending, C has amazing songs that especially fits well in battles and with the mood. In addition, they take advantage of AMAZING sound effects which is the reason why i believe sound is a strong point of C.\\n\\n\r\nAhhh, now the characters. The characters is, as mentioned before, the weakest point in C. When i say weakest point, I'm not saying it was super bad, but i do prefer better character development. One issue i had has that the characters were not very memorable. For example, at the end where the two main characters parted ways and never saw each other again, i was just like whatever, because i wasn't really attached to either character and none of them gave me the impression that they were special or worth remembering. However, i do personally enjoy each of the character's personality. Each character interacted with each other well and it affected the plot by making it more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, despite the minor flaws, i found this show to enjoyable. True, it is not perfect, nor it is neither bad, but i believe that people should give this anime a chance. If superpowers, amazing artwork, and a really cool theme appeals to you, then C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is worth a shot.\\n\r\n*This is my second review and I will always appreciate feedback. Thanks for taking your time reading this!",

They could be aliens? :P), the title makes it a little clear and the plot becomes evident from the first five minutes; which is all you need to know.\\n\r\nStill, dispite seemin straightforward, it's quite the opposite; the first episode leaves you asking yourself plenty of questions, a clever method of easily gripping an audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPotential...\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this is an original anime, you're not going to find a spoiler, so there's no cutting corners via skipping forward or even to the end and seeing if the serise is worth it (I have done this before), or checking out manga reviews. We have no choice but to venture in with an open mind.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the story is both quirky and realistic; it's likely to stand out, in the eyes of adventure lovers and 'slice of life' fans.\\n\\n\r\nI'm an individual, in my early 20s, who has watched countless anime over the years and I'm a huge fan of the supernatural, however, since I have seen so much, I'm seeing similarities in many recent serise's that makes them fail to stand out. \\n\r\nA serise gets plus points when it receives praise from people like myself; individuals who feels they've \"just about seen everything\".\\n\\n\r\n11 episodes is a decent length, even if you don't like it, atleast you haven't wasted too much of your life on the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere's endless potential for fanfiction too.\\n\\n\r\nArt...\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery seems quite well though out, yet the couloring is fairly neautral, which can be a good thing; not obnoxiously bright and not so dark production are trying too hard to crete atmosphere; a good balance for the mellow mood so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs seem to simply follow what is popular at the moment; fairly box and triangle 2Desque with little expression in the face, however, the extras have distinguishing features (basically, the mains are plain, which equals flawless, which equals cute) the clothing designs are flawless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters...\\n\\n\r\nSo far, what you would expect; the quiet, the eccentric and the mysterious, the type that seem to be staples in al anime. Though it's only been one episode and it seems atleast one main character has yet to arrive.\\n\\n\r\n*This is a review based on what the series gives out initially, i.e. ep' one, I'll leave the opinions up to you if you consider following the series, to avoid spoilers*\\n\r\n*Since it's now finished, I look over the series as something many will fnd generic, some will find fun; depending on your views and the time period you have been watdching anime in general - this should say it all*",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is an original anime.At first i got interested in this anime because of its theme of economy, since im economist myself.It  is kinda similar to the Eden of the East though because the main theme is \"the money\".\r\n[Story: 6]\r\nSo, what is money? Money is something we use in our lives and basically can not live without. Now there is plenty of ways to use money, but what if you attract a demon which offers you infinite amount of money for your future?\r\nStory so far includes a  unknown man with no money gaining access to FinancialDistrict, where he got engaged in a battle with Mikuni, fought with strange monsters and lost. He then committed suicide the following day. The main character of this story is Kimimaro and he works part time and tries hard to get scholarship. He of course(as expected) has no money, and then, the mysterious man Masakaki approaches him and offers him a deal to become and entrepeneur at a mysterious bank. Some time later on,  he is once again approached by Masakaki, who places him in a taxi going for the Financial District and gives him limitless amounts of money. In exchange, he asks for Kimimaro\u2019s future as collateral.\\n\r\nIt may look interesting in the begining but later it becomes really boring :(\\n\\n\r\n[Art:9]\\n\r\nthe art is great so far. Actually i myself am not a fan of little boys and girls but i can't say they are not well drawn. Colors are well balanced and not the eye killers.\\n\r\nThe animation for now looks really amazing and  the only thing i like is awesome animation when it comes to fighting. Also, the opening and the ending have nice animation and i give one big + for them :D\\n\r\nThere are also digital side bars whenever the contractor is talking to his asset. \\n\r\nNot to mention that art got somehow 3d-ish in the second episode, but i dont have anything against that ad, because it gives depth and somehow it makes difference between parallel world people[bank] and normal world people.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound:6]\\n\r\nOpening and ending songs are really well done, and are fitting. Also i think they chose the right voice actors for the characters and they dont feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\n[Character:7]\\n\r\nnothing is explained, except there are seemingly few characters we need to set eyes on: the main characters Kimimaro Yoga & Mashu[presumably his demon]. Also in the first episode they introduced mysterious Masakaki & the girl Kimimaro has his eyes on: Hanabi [sadly she has a boyfriend, as expected :(] but this show didnt work on characters as much as i wanted it to have.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment and overall:6]\\n\r\ni can't say im both impressed and not impressed, but like i said before it just has interesting story. Some things are left unexplained and that is a big minus.",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control has a pretty original hook: It's a story starring economics college-student Yoga Kimimaro who only wants to acquire a job with income stable enough to support a family. One day he meets some eccentric dude named Masakaki (who looks a fusion between Willy Wonka and the Cheshire Cat) who offers him a large sum of money, asking in return that he put up his future for \"collateral\". From that day forward, Yoga is transported to a realm known as the Financial District where he must engage in battles known as \"deals\" in which he must offer notonly his money, but his future as well. It doesn't just stop there since the money printed in the Financial District is different then your average bills. \"Midas money\" as it's called not only has adverse side-effects on the economy, but on the fabrics of reality as well\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything [C] does that's remarkable, it's that the series tackles issues you never see tackled and gets off to fairly strong start because of it. The idea of a financial crisis being the core conflict in a series sounds pretty cool. The main character is pretty easy to relate to (college student with money issues), the Financial District looks pretty neat, and Masakaki is awesome. Why did it all have to go so wrong?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the battles. To expand further on the above synopsis, people who engage in deals within the financial district are known as entres (short for entrepreneurs), and they are given ass kicking super-powered sidekicks called assets to do most of the fighting for them. The creators try to make these showdowns seem complicated by giving them a ton of rules and financial terminology that imply depth, but the way the battles are actually executed resembles pretty much every proxy battle series out there. They are often rather short and resort to run-of-the-mill beam-spam where characters yell out the name of their attacks before firing in true Digimon fashion. Strategies are limited to mostly deus-ex machina and straight-up luck, so don't come in to expecting any sort of complex mind-games. They look pretty, but the deals are mostly brain-dead affairs. You don't really need to understand the terminology or rules really, whoever has the biggest blast wins. Strangely enough one of the most hyped battles of the entire series is also skipped over right in the middle of the action to have the characters simply spend time explaining the results, just thought that was worth tossing out there. \\n\\n\r\nWhen they're off the battle field our central duo isn't particularly interesting either. Yoga is a pretty dull and passive lead character. His involvement in the story is really little more then an excuse to introduce the viewers to the premise since we learn about the Financial District at the same time he does. He has no real involvement with the main plot going on under his nose until the final episodes. He's not a completely terrible lead though since his ideologies make for a decent foil for the ideologies of the people he meets and battles within the Financial District, especially the last boss. The real problem here is his asset Msyu. She's basically a loli-tsundere who develops into a loli-tsundere waifu. Her interactions with the Yoga as she slowly falls in love with him are cringe-inducing, and eat up far too much time. I figured a show with such a deep setting that only has eleven episodes to work with would know not to spend time on teaching your pet waifu how to eat or what a kiss is, but there's always  enough time for otaku-bait I suppose.The nature of the relationship between entres and assets is something I won't go into much for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but it's where I was hoping this show would differentiate Yoga and Msyu from all the other dull male/female leads out there, but it's a sub-plot that pretty much gets dropped right before giving us any kind of meaningful answer. \\n\\n\r\nI feel no need to mention most of the other entres for the reason that they are mostly one-note entities who fail to amount to something memorable due to short screen-time. I will give props to show for the antagonist (though you could also call him an anti-hero) Mikuni, who is far more interesting to follow then our boring lead and his digital waifu. He understands the effects that losing deals has on other entres (not only do they lose money, but a part of their lives will suddenly vanish). His motives were rather interesting and understandable. I applaud the show for not giving us a main antagonist solely driven by greed which is something that I was expecting from a series where money is behind everything. His plot to is analogous to the idea of quantitative easing, wherein he tries to inject Midas Money into the Japanese economy. His role in the story was a pretty interesting one that provided some interesting criticisms to the practice.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show are probably as unique as the show's premise, but are about as mixed overall as the show's execution. The Financial District is pretty cool to look at with it's distinctive red/white color pallet and the battles that take place are often well animated. The character art however does this bizarre thing often goofily switches between 2D designs and 3D models. It was sort of cool at first since Masakaki was the only one doing it in episode 1 and it sort of fit in with the rest of his bizarre characteristics. However, eventually you get shots of characters walking down the streets in 3D sometimes and the occasional scene where both 2D and 3D characters are interacting on screen at the same time. The actual character designs themselves are also kinda weird in a sometimes derpish way sometimes but is otherwise average. The actual acting is alright on both sides. Funimation's dub doesn't really have much young blood so if you're well acquainted with their previous works, the English version will end up being a rather simple game of \"spot the voice actor\". Scott Freeman as Masakaki was excellent though. I'd still recommend the Japanese version since it has the highest ratio of Engrish to Japanese speaking (a result of having the International Monetary Fund pop up from time-to-time and the attacks and terminology used during deals) since the likes of Black Lagoon and Beck. It's weird in this since some of the Engrish sounds almost convincing too.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot would've benefited greatly benefited from another cour, but as is the show bites far more then it can chew. I'm not sure if the series had it's episode count slashed or not, but it certainly feels that way (just as much as it did with Angel Beats! too). Much of the series focus on Yoga/Msyu adventures in the Financial District, yet all of a sudden in the final episodes the show forces a doomsday climax with no build up. It would've been great to get a better understanding of how the show got there and how Mikuni figured into it all. Instead it feels as if people woke up one day only to find out that they suddenly have an enormous financial crisis that threatens to plunge the world into \"Great Depression \" tier misery. These episodes feel to quickly paced and even though the final deal itself is pretty awesome, the show resorts to what I can only call a ridiculously ass-pully resolution that felt much too cheap.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[C] is most definitely a textbook example of neat premise being ruined beyond all recognition. The unnecessary focus on boring leads you've seen before combined with a plot that didn't get the time it needed to develop alongside the weak character development hamstring the show's potential badly. It's an interesting affair still simply because of the bizarre premise and visuals and won't take up too much time.That's not enough to prevent [C] from being a failure of forgettable proportions. Come for the cute assets and explosions, it won't disappoint too much if that's the fix your looking for.",

            "content": "C felt like a series that seemed better suited to run for at least two dozen episodes considering the elements it tried to cover with the Financial District. The show introduced a multiple number of characters with differing motivations for their involvement in the Financial District and features an elaborate battle system that involves dwellers of the District battling one another with their futures as collateral and bankruptcy having a huge negative effect on the person's life in reality. Kimimaro, as the central character of C, tries to figure out what purpose he has in his involvement in the Financial District and gaining Asset Mashuwho supports him in his battles in the Financial District.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of C was spent covering the various adversaries that Kimimaro would be up against while the second half covered a much darker element to the Financial District that influenced reality, which I felt the quality of both differed quite a bit. The first half was reasonably paced where Kimimaro adjusts to activity in the Financial District and slowly realizes just how much of a radically life-changing influence activity from the Financial District has on reality through the opponents that he fights. The opponents he encounter are fleshed out enough where you get enough sense of how being in the Financial District has influenced their lives, particularly Mikuni who becomes both mentor and rival to Kimimaro as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series is where I found things to be a mixed bag and what led me to think the series should have been at a greater number of episodes. The Financial District's influence on reality shows a darker side which results in Mikuni and Kimimaro taking differing views on how to manage things. This could have made for a better half if not for the fact pacing started to advance at a more rapid pace compared to earlier episodes thus preventing any sort of build up with the mounting tensions between the two. It especially doesn't help when there were only 4 to 5 episodes left to build up on such shocking developments and create character tensions that could have been better laid out in a 24-episode series.\\n\\n\r\nOther prominent issues as a result of the show's limited episode count include the series not exploring other elements to the Financial District and plot elements, particularly the higher power that the Masakakis follow, what Mashu represents with Kimimaro's future and the specifics of what led Kimimaro's father to his demise.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, C is one of the best-looking titles I've had a chance of seeing for the year thus far. Scenery and character designs are packed with bright colors and have a good amount of detail to them with the art highlight going to the rendering of the Financial District with its highly colorful and abstract environment, doing well at conveying itself as being a whole different world from our reality. Action scenes are well animated with a good amount of movement and some moments of impressive animations in the battles that occur within the Financial District.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy seeing C, I can't help but nitpick at the fact that the series could have worked out better if given a higher episode count as not everything to it was explored and it had a second half that couldn't click for me due to the lack of proper build-up and rushed pacing that developed thanks to its eleven episode count.",

That\u2019s pretty much the entire point of the showin a single sentence. The thing that actually makes this concept of fighting interesting, is that when one of the fighters lose, as in utter annihilating defeat, they lose their future as well. Meaning if they were going to have kids or something, they won\u2019t have those kids anymore. That risk alone makes the battles interesting as hell. I don\u2019t really know what else to say other than its unique and the fights are weighted with risk.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (6/10): The characters in this show aren\u2019t anything special, I will say that the character you think is going to be a tsundere isn\u2019t going to be a tsundere, not entirely anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKimimaro Yoga: The protagonist and major in Social Economics.\\n\\n\r\nSouichirou Mikuni: The one trying to manipulate the entire global market and owner of a literal cash hungry asset.\\n\\n\r\nMsyu: Asset to Yoga and probably my favourite character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show are mostly forgettable, and there\u2019s only two other characters that actually do something in the entire show, everyone else is inconsequential.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art & Sound (6/10) & (5/10): The art in this show is pretty standard, apart from the MC\u2019s neck looking like it\u2019s about to give with the slightest force. The rest of the art is CGI, and if you absolutely can\u2019t stand CGI, turn back now because you aren\u2019t in for a good time. I didn\u2019t really mind the CGI that much and I actually think it lended itself to some scenes, apart from any scene involving Masakaki, every time he popped up on screen I wanted to skip a bit forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show was entirely forgettable the OP, ED & OST flew right over my head. The voice acting was standard, no single person stood out, and I can\u2019t really say much else about the sound at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this show?\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a unique show and I think I\u2019ll buy it, but only if I see it in the shop, not going to look for it.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nYeah it\u2019d kill a fair bit of time, if that\u2019s what you need, otherwise you won\u2019t miss out on much.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

            "content": "It is quite clear to me that C is by far the worst anime ever to have come out of the notamina block airing spot. Initially, with the director of Mononoke behind the steering wheel, and interesting premise of the show, I honestly thought I was in for intriguing series. However, despite this, there were clearly some things wrong with this anime from the start.\r\nWhat was clear to anyone watching this was how dreadful the animation, art, and editing was. Now it would seem that C never quite received the budget it needed, but still there is no excuse for the choppy editing that waspresent from episode 1 (And got much worst as it reached its conclusion). The show jumped form scene to scene without establishing much context, the transitions were very unnatural, and the character actions were always very hard to trace out.\\n\\n\r\nBut regardless of what was going on in the technical department, I was still interested at the start. The story focused on people who participate in a place called the financial district where they would wage duels in which they would use beings called assets to fight. Each participant would put their \"future\" on the line and the winner would gain more money while the loser would lose his future, and essentially their life would be ruined. The money of the financial district, called midas money, is only visible by people who have been to the financial district. Normal people can't see it, and it's everywhere in the real world. When people lose their \"future\" the real world has lots of changes in it happen too.\\n\\n\r\nBut without rambling too much about the setting, the anime seemed to be some sort of commentary on how money is used everyday, what it means to people, and the impact it has on our everyday lives. There were different things flying around about whether we should value the future over the present or the present over the future (Similar to some of the latest bail out talks surrounding governments), so there were plenty of interesting thing underneath the surface.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why it is just so disappointing that this anime had to train wreck so bad with its plot. Throughout the whole show they traveled through the plot points at blinding speed. Character development was hardly given at all, and the main character's development ended up making no sense due to this. Not to mention that the events towards the end seemed incredibly random, and the only reason you couldn't pause to ask yourself what the hell is going on is because every damn second a new ridiculous thing was happening.\\n\\n\r\nC is pretty much a case of nice idea, but horrible execution. Few animes ever get everything so wrong on the production side of things, stuff you can control, that i ends up ruining the show, but that is definitely what we have here. However, if you don't care much for the story it is very entertaining in its own right to see an anime such as this fall apart in such an epic fashion that you would have to see it to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, don't take this story seriously as I did, otherwise you're in for quite the disappointment.",

Tempting? Then again what is Money? How much is your future really worth? Would you stake your own future for the sake of others? These topics are attached to the story of \u2018C: The money of Soul and Possibility Control\u2019 meaning the anime is mainly about the Economic side of the Stock market! Don\u2019t worry the concept is really stimulating, the world building is set to its own style thus segregating itself from other shows. I like seeing astory about the Economics of the world since it involves all of us even though it\u2019s a confusing topic to grasp for most of us. And the story goes something like this where Yoga (who\u2019s the MC) is a College student who\u2019s broke as hell and after meeting an eccentric individual, is selected as an entrepreneur to a place that exists in the supernatural dimension where he can make a lot of money by betting his future. A player\u2019s future is conjured up to a Familiar being that acts as an Asset and both shall participate in a deal (battle) with other players on a weekly basis where winners are rewarded with more money (Black money of special kind that are only visible to the players of Financial District yet they work as normal money) while the loser nervously calculates the magnitude of loses since their future depends on it! (Losing your future entails losing your meaning of existence!) In addition, the players that go bankrupt are immediately kicked out from the Financial District for eternity! Yoga\u2019s Familiar predictably turns out to be a demoness named Msyu and while new players lose in their first match, in a typical fashion, Yoga manages to survive his 1st battle with the help of Msyu. And this anime gets interesting when we discover that the corroborative from the district actually has alarming ramifications on a worldwide scale which makes sense since more use of Financial district currency (Black Money) in the market naturally will lead to the fall of the country\u2019s actual money! Early on the plot captures your undivided attention regarding the struggle of what\u2019s more important, sustaining your present or shielding your future! The introduction of this concept elevates the show to new heights due to its interesting and challenging memo. Yet the message was poorly delivered due to the overall repetitive nature of this arc and generic direction in which the finale took place, lazily putting the end to this stimulating plot and replacing it with a predictable fight between the good and bad guy!\\n\\n\r\nI will start with Mikuni who\u2019s the most interesting character of the anime since he was the most fleshed out and he kinda happens to be a villain, even though he isn\u2019t, no matter how hard the anime tries to make him one though! He was one of the rare ones to win in his debut at the District and later went on to build his own guild which reached to the top in no time, making him and his guild very rich. We also see that Mikuni\u2019s yearning for money isn\u2019t driven by selfish desires unlike most of the District players, he\u2019s rather arranged himself in a powerful political position by constantly working towards regulating the tide of District money by helping the government and its partners from reaching total bankruptcy during their Economy\u2019s meltdown! And the aforementioned continued arc comes into play here where Mikuni is all in for jeopardizing the future just to enhance his presence while Yoga eventually goes against this \u2018vision\u2019, hell bent on protecting the future. What\u2019s brilliant here is that both sides aren\u2019t exactly wrong nor correct. They just happened to choose a side and since you can\u2019t have both, you can side with either of them without feeling guilty! While Mikuni\u2019s portrayal as a character was great, Yoga\u2019s development was that much boring! You swiftly lose interest in him since he comes across very generic. His wins never counted as wins for me since he won his battles just because he was the MC of the show, not cause of sheer skills or strength! Also, he prides himself on wanting a Normal life yet easily gets abstracted by others without weighing out his actions or penalties, this just proved that he had no real ambitions. Msyu doesn\u2019t get a lot of screen time but she\u2019s pretty generic too and she\u2019s present just for the romance! The romance came across very clich\u00e9d and unreal and misplaced! From what I saw, Yoga treated Msyu more as a friend than a master unlike the other players and she mistakenly takes this act as encouragement for feelings which just made Yoga look bad cause he\u2019s only doing this out of his naivety! Plus, Yoga has eyes on his future only and maybe Hanabe (another girl). To make matters worse, an effort for the Romance sprung up in the last 2 episodes and the anime failed at prospering their relationship so everything felt very forced! The rest of characters are mediocre as well who rarely get any screen time, making them forgettable and hurting the show\u2019s momentum. I mean I can only remember 2 of the side character faces, a lady and a guy. All I know is that the Lady eats all the time while working for some secret government branch and the Photographer guy can basically do anything! You can either get by with Awesome Secondary characters + Weak Leads or Stellar Leads with Average Supporting characters and this anime gets by none! Hanabe is another student character but her arc was really weird cause she goes from a typical friend of Yoga to a sorta potential love interest to a depressed girl all in 1 episode! After which she\u2019s barely mentioned at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe overall animation is well lit with bright colours but the quality remains inconsistent throughout and while the design of characters and the Financial district were all well done, their execution turned out to be messy with sloppy use of 3D. But Top marks to the visual department for brilliantly displaying the Best and Worst of both worlds! I particularly loved the visual representation of the Black border which were used to distinguish between the 2 worlds, perfectly doing their job whenever Yoga and Msyu were together on a single screen. In addition, the fights were nicely displayed by showcasing the different type of magic used and the use of Black money as a replacement for blood was cleverly shown! But then again, the editing in some episodes were very jarring. As for Voice Acting and the Soundtrack, it was pretty generic with nothing really standing out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis anime oddly finds itself in a unique category of its own by explaining its story too much yet you understand very little of it! I found the main reason to be the inconsistencies with the rules of the world, the fights and the story itself! Despite dedicating a few episodes for explaining the mechanisms of the Financial District, you are still hazily unclear with some parts. For instance, you use Black money to use magic during a fight so powerful magic means Big bucks but none of the characters every showed any type of concerns when using massive magic spells. Some players had more than 1 Asset which wasn\u2019t explained either or tricks like boosting you up during a battle by letting other players to your stock were never brought up or used again. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t agree with the justifications given! It\u2019s also pretty apparent the Studio were running out of money for the quality drops in spite of the anime\u2019s 11 episodes run time. This also means a rushed ending where too many things happened in the last 2 episodes thus ruining the finale. And just like the quality of the show falls as you proceed further, so does the writing! The major events towards the end were introduced just to raise the stakes for they were flimsily explained by glossing over many vital points. The anime would have benefited with a slightly bigger budget and more episodes to fill in the plot holes. Still it manages to leave an impression for here I am writing a review about it! It\u2019s a mix bag, not exactly bad nor good, but somewhere in the middle.",

            "content": "How much is your future worth?\r\nThat\u2019s a great concept question to start a series off before it proceeds to insult your intelligence.\r\nFrom the outlook C may appear to focus on economics, witty dialogue, and perhaps even action. Well, it\u2019s a trap.\r\nC is actually a series that consists of plot holes which builds on plot holes so as to continue with plot holes. There is actually no element in this story that is properly developed enough to truly attain a genre label. For example this series puts on a facade that it is based on economics using words like micro, macro, mezzo, inflation and even phrasessuch as \u201coverheated economy\u201d while it doesn't encompass the actual meaning of these words.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do that?\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m convinced that the writers opened economic and business textbooks and took out and used every cool sounding bolded term without understanding the definitions. That or they have no idea what they're writing about or how to write.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is some sort of action, mystery, and what even looked like romance; none of these were suitably developed and expanded on as the series tried to do too much with too little commitment.\\n\\n\r\nComing to this series off a recommendation from Spice and Wolf I could not be any more disappointed or insulted. I tried hard to give this series every chance possible to be liked and as a 19 year old second year university accounting student I thought I could relate to the protagonist Kimimaro, who is a 19 year old second year university economics student.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the studying and lifestyle that every student stereotypically has I couldn\u2019t relate with him. Actually Kimimaro is a character not to be messed with. This isn\u2019t because he wears impenetrable plot armour but because he can\u2019t grasp the opportunities in front of him nor justify any of his actions through a logical thought process; it\u2019s frustrating. He is a character that manages to lose focus of his values early on in the story and fails to establish new values as he lallygags his way through the story.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly how did he make it to university?\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist Mikuni however is a far more mature character with believable ideals and justifiable actions. As the overlord of the Financial District he does his best to minimize its damage and save Japan. However as the plot was so poorly formulated all his hard work and sacrifice is wasted as the magical rule that the protagonist is always right (even when he isn\u2019t) and always wins was enacted.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spoil the ending for you but the scheme that was implemented would in reality have crippled a country\u2019s economy permanently and ceded its control to another nation; in other words, economic suicide was the solution of choice. Ridiculous right?\\n\\n\r\nNow if you have any knowledge of economics and business stay away from this series as you will have headaches from the ignorance of the writers. The story was so disastrous that the rules that it established are changed in a moment\u2019s notice for the sake of continuing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt's as if playing a game without rules. It's just no fun if you don't know how to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe one saving grace for this series was its animation. It\u2019s beautiful like Bakemonogatari with great landscapes that are plain yet marvelous. Though really if you wanted beautiful animation you could just watch Bakemonogatari right?\\n\\n\r\nUltimately C is a series that forgot the original concept that drew in its viewers and develops in the wrong directions. Had it truly focused on dialogue, economics, and business this would have been a great niche series that would have likely fascinated a mature audience. Sadly this series tried to do too much and ended up being a badly developed battle anime with a hint of mystery and a poor excuse for romance.",

Let\u2019s say money rules the world, and there\u2019s a parallel space where all the money flows are controlled and resolved by a Persona-style fighting, ain\u2019t this sounds cool? The plot also is about settling what is more important \u2013 the present or the future? The story develops somehow similar to the one in Guilty Crown, bringing up more and more questions\u2026 making the viewer think and jump to their own conclusions. But the logic is leaking a bit, and hence 9/10.\r\nArt \u2013 7\r\nThefirst episode is marvelous, with all that great artwork and animations; the battle scenes are fascinating too\u2026 the characters lack originality (except for some figures, to be honest), alongside with the backgrounds. I was expecting to get more detailed images, really, but the current level will do too.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8\\n\r\nThe music is just fine, and it does help creating the right mood. The sounds, however, are somewhat lame, as well as the bright and optimistic ending song. Overall, I\u2019m not impressed but relieved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 10\\n\r\nThe protagonist is, surprisingly, a simple university student, thinking about getting by and, but as the time flows, he is really growing up, changing himself and his perception of the world around him\u2026 Even though he is a slowpoke when it comes to making a decision, he does everything it takes to choose the best answer, shaping the reality the way he wants it to be. Moreover, each other character has their own detailed background and their own reasons as well, and I can\u2019t help but sympathy them, even if they have completely different ideals. \u201dI\u2019m a businessman first, then I\u2019m a parent\u201d, as one implies\u2026 personally, I know a lot of people thinking this way too, that\u2019s why I can tell the characters are more that realistic and interesting, without lots of clich\u00e9s (That cabin driver\u2026 what are you? Cain from VtM? Igor from Persona? Really cool, you know). Plus there\u2019s no certain villain amongst humans in series, which is rare and great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 5\\n\r\nAfter all, it was\u2026 plain. I have almost started yawning by the last episodes. Like, the authors couldn\u2019t come up with more breathtaking moments then the beginning had. And if you want to about economics in an entertaining way, you may receive the same joy off a simple textbook. An anime full of adventures must be more\u2026 lively. And seriously, the opening is full of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 7\\n\r\nThis anime has as many interesting ideas as borrowing from other series and stuff like that. Is it bad? Who knows. It resembles me of a bunch of things I like, though, and I can\u2019t help but say this anime is worth seeing once in awhile, if you don\u2019t mind watching something truly unusual. The end is really a something too.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that economy is an inseparable and indestructible part of our life. Can one prove this wrong?\\n",

            "content": "Exactly what it says on the title, the theme of this anime is about Corruption done by \u201cThe Money\u201d in modern times for \u201cSoul and Possibility Control\u201d of the ignorant masses to turn them into mindless animalistic puppets to be toyed with by the government and businesses. \r\nThat is probably a stretch and a bad joke. \r\nAs interesting as the theme is, it is looked from a foolish naive perspective through the main lead Kimimaro Yoga, a member of the ignorant masses.\r\nThere are spoilers so read at your own risk. \r\nOur main lead is an over-used archetype, present in the majority of anime titles aimedfor youths, which is designed to \u201crelate\u201d his entire life to the majority of the lives of its audience. He is an average student who has a crush on his friend Hanabi Ikuta and works as a part-timer in a convenience store. He has a bad unexplained childhood. He believes in living in the present. He is very OPEN towards anyone that doesn\u2019t challenge his ideology of life. Without it, there would not be any clash of the titans in the last episode that was suggested in the last scene of the opening. Ignorance of opposing forces and the fate of our future is bliss after all. He only starts developing after hearing extreme opposing views from different parties which ends up horribly until a Total Deus Ex Machina came to \u201csave\u201d its audience from the truth behind the ending (Masakaki stated that the future is a collateral). Without other people, he is screwed. \\n\\n\r\nLike Ganta Igarashi from Deadman Wonderland, he is given his own avatar for Deus Ex Machina in the form of a younger, cute, powerful, childlike or immature Asset Msyu who eventually falls for her owner. The number of times and the situations when he is saved by Msyu are incredible. Every time he is screwed, Msyu just does some unexplained OHKO that miraculously got them out of ANY hopeless situation. However, please take note that she herself brought up Kimimaro from a useless stick figure to a reasonable fighter with a clear belief system. Her character development is typical and predictable but interesting nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nWhat about the \u201cantagonist\u201d suggested in the opening before the start of the first episode? He is Souichirou Mikuni, the smart pragmatic businessman counterpart of our protagonist and the saving grace of this show. The emphasis on his characterization, development, and behaviour is a major influence to the entirety of the show. Without this character, there is no [C] and opposing organization to the Financial District. Midas Money is less controlled so its effects are amplified, resulting in grave losses such as loss of loved ones and/or one\u2019s life. There is absolutely no major conflict for the protagonist to resolve. Why he is not the main character is left to your interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast, don\u2019t need much attention because they are written to FORCE the two main male leads to fight in the end. Jennifer Satou and Kou Sennoza represent the core contrasting beliefs of Souichirou. Both have unique lives and better reasons to be the main protagonist than Kimimaro because they have logical justifiable explanation for staying in the alternate world. Still, they are wasted because a puppet that eventually becomes them is more interesting than them gaining the same strength as Souichirou.\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, only the Financial District is of any value but lacked focus on its psychological and philosophical aspects. Its origins, purpose, effect on the business world, MMORPG setting with weird characters ranging from Eldritch Abominations to cute humanoid tsundere or kuudere loli characters, Midas Money, [C], unique concepts, etc. are the only reasons why anyone is watching this but all is not present in the first half. [C], the destroyer of bankrupted financial districts, is shown in the later portion of the second half. There are also certain questions left unanswered. \\n\r\nHow does the battle system work? \\n\r\nWhy are certain characters significantly stronger than others regardless of experience? \\n\r\nWhy are governments not cooperating together from the very beginning to prevent [C] from removing countries of existence? \\n\r\nWho are the people above according to Masakaki? \\n\r\nWho is the \u201cGod\u201d figure in the last episode?\\n\r\nIs the ending another version of Instrumentality (Neon Genesis Evangelion)?\\n\\n\r\nWhatever. Let's just focus on the visuals and sound.\\n\r\nProduction values are medium at the very least. They are not outstanding but unquestionably (YMMV) fitting. The opening and ending themes brought me out of my misery whenever I watch this so I never skipped them and watch the preview of preceding episodes. They both start and end the show well every time. Voice acting is fair as well. The style and quality of the art are normal with certain use of CGI. The resulting presentation though is quite good but aesthetics alone don't make any show good ... unless it's porn.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, this is not recommendable.",

            "content": "Story (3/10)\r\nI imagine the executive meeting that inspired this dull, jabbering insult to my intelligence went a bit like this.\r\nDirector: I\u2019ve been thinking lately we should do something deep and relevant about today\u2019s global financial situation. It\u2019s been all over the news and I think the kids would appreciate someone really bringing it down to their level.\r\nExec: Uhh, really? But finance is like so BOOOOOORING.\r\nDirector: Well, of course we could spice it up a little, you know, give it a representational hook or gimmick. I have one or two ideas that I think would really -\r\nExec: Oh oh oh! I\u2019ve got it, I\u2019ve got it!MASCOT BATTLES!\\n\\n\r\nDirector: What?\\n\\n\r\nExec: Write this down! It\u2019s not often I get such inspirational flashes. I can see it now - economic conflicts figuratively enacted through pet monsters! \u2018Cause everyone likes Pokemon, right??\\n\\n\r\nThe result, ladies and gentlemen, is this show, the worst possible marriage of everything that shouldn\u2019t exist in anime. Dry, abstract exposition about money combined with utterly mindless battles between metaphorical creatures that have no real-life relevance. Burrow deep enough and C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control appears to contain a human tale about taking huge financial risks for the sake of loved ones. That this is mere veneer becomes clear the moment we ask why the characters don\u2019t just work overtime, get a second job, or aim for promotion, considering any of these require less effort for more guarantee. The financial battles are vehicles for an impending apocalypse caused by some\u2026 thing that gets no explanation. All we know is, at some point, a digitised whatsit begins to sweep through Japan and the hero has to do stuff in the ether to make it go away.\\n\\n\r\nNot that the fights are any good either. Occurring without reason or logic, they generate about as much friction as a limp dick. Just as one combatant summons giant balls of fire, the opponent blocks with an inexplicable beam of sparkling blackness, all the while an electronic voice yells nonsensical financial jargon not even the Wall Street folk would enjoy piecing together (how to counter sensibly when your enemy has just thrown a hail of MACROFLATION!!?). There are no recognisable dimensions to the battles, no identifiable limitations that tell me \u2018this person is highly skilled compared to that person\u2019. Thus we must take for granted that Souichiro Mikuni, the cool, mysterious rich guy, is unbeatable because everyone says so; when he fights, I can\u2019t actually tell.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10)\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to put a message out there for the kids growing up on a diet of C-like atrocities: animated backgrounds full of feeling, atmosphere, and texture do exist. For evidence, look to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica or Eden of the East. The polygonal edifices we get in C bring to mind the artistic sensibilities of a McDonalds restaurant - cold, garish, and above all cheap. Effects happen, shapes and colours and patterns zoom past but none of it serves any discernible purpose except to distract us for another five seconds.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nIn moments when the plot wholly eluded me, the score managed to restore some of the potency of the situation. Unfortunately, sandwiched between unmemorable opening and closing themes, and voiced over by a crap script, the courageous cinematic soundtrack gets entirely lost.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (3/10)\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything anime needs more of, it\u2019s teenage boys trying to get stronger. I\u2019m being sarcastic, of course. What anime needs more of are characters I can tell apart from all the others. C\u2019s cast melts into a giant pot of tokenism and archetype that effectively abandons the audience to apathy. I\u2019m surprised, for instance, that the bland, pineapple-haired protagonist (had to look up his name, Kimimaro Yoga) was thought qualified to be one when his only notable features are being nice and harbouring angst about his long-lost father. The only vivid performance belongs to Masakaki, the guide of the alternate dimension in which the battles take place; he is a nod to Willy Wonka that strips away all the child-friendly veneer and replaces it with a chilling pitilessness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10) \\n\r\nColour me spoiled if you will, but I like to spend my time watching things that I understand. I like characters for which I feel empathy doing things I could imagine myself doing if I were in their situation. Most of the financial jargon the target audience will struggle to relate to and anyone who does will snooze simply at the banal abstractedness of it. Instead of a poignant metaphor on the dangers of economic risk-taking, we get a discombobulated mess that farts a host of vague concepts. The only emotion this show inspires in the process is boredom.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way would of been a three and was really willing to as well, but seems its an overall and the overall comes to a total of 4.5, I have to round it up to 5, so C got lucky this time. C you round!",

It is great how you can start off with a small amount of money and easily turn that into millions within an hour or two. Sadly, it is fake money and money isn\u2019t that easy to obtain. Besides that, don\u2019t you feel like the guy wearing a suit, a top-hat and have a fancy cane is mocking you? The possibility of being wealthy is endless. With money, you can go out drinking, you can go traveling, you don\u2019t have to work for the rest of your life, you can own property along with having a family and you can buy a nice car or two. The problem is what can\u2019t you do with money? Money to some provides happiness, but for me, I don\u2019t think so. I would rather live an honest lifestyle and not depend on anyone, but myself. This shows that you are independent and reliable. Money is just a leisure thing to have. You can still be happy if you\u2019re poor, but won\u2019t be living in a better lifestyle like the rich. Society splits into the rich and the poor. Isn\u2019t it hilarious that money splits society in half? Everybody is able to climb the ladder to become wealthy. We all have arms and legs right?\\n\\n\r\n\u201cC \u2013 The Money of Soul and Possibility Control\u201d is where you give your future for money. To break it down, it is similar to slavery. It sounds dumb since if you give up your life, you have no control, but will be a human with a collar. The protagonist, Kimimaro Yoga, was chosen to be an entrepreneur. He is a humble person and works really hard to achieve what his goal. Yoga\u2019s goal is to work in a private job, have a family and a house. Soon, his world is flipped upside down when he was chosen. There is an alternate world where he can travel to and fight to gain more money. Since Yoga was forced to join this game, he is given a cash card that has a large amount of money and also contains an asset. An asset is like a companion that fights for you except the asset resembles the owner\u2019s future. This is one of the aspects that I like about the anime. It is like your future is brought out and is able to communicate with you. Yoga\u2019s asset is Msyu. Compared to other assets, she is unique considering she has a body close enough to a human and is interested in the real world. Every week, there is a battle waiting for Yoga. It is a fight to win situation. If Yoga lost, he would be bankrupt and face consequences in the real world. As the anime progresses, I have to say that the consequences are pretty grave no matter what. Seeing both world collapses just because of money is crazy. My opinion of this plot would be that it is pretty clich\u00e9. It reminded me of those situations of either you win or die. Other than that, the plot is alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is clear and crisp. I have no problems with it and it is pretty cool. I guess you can say a modern version of this anime would be Devil Survivor 2. The animation is quite good and I definitely enjoyed it. The lighting and coloring is also beautiful. It displays the scenery and depicts the mood of the situation. What I like the most would probably be the fighting scenes. They are well made and use a unique style. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pleasant. It isn\u2019t annoying or dull. To be honest, they weren\u2019t that high of a quality for me to download. The OST is fitting for the scenes they were used in. This anime uses suspense and brought it out pretty well. The opening is well made. It shows what the anime portrays. Money isn\u2019t everything and shows how corrupt the world is at the moment. The music in the OP is alright, but the lyrics are outstanding. It shows an underdog trying to fight his way to stop the horrid game. The ending is alright too. It is similar to the opening and shows a guy running. The lyrics used encourage fighting over the darkness and getting to know the bond between Kimimaro Yoga and Msyu more. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is great, but not spectacular. It should definitely be seen as for those who wanted to see those \u201cwhat if\u201d in action.\\n",

What is future? What defines the present?\r\n Its about time, and money, its about relationships, and potentially love (i not really sure, it hasn't gotten there just yet) But its also about cause and effects, The smallest action can have a catastrophic change in the future.\r\nIts deep, well atleast so far. Sometimes the relationships help you realize that its not always about the physical power or just winning. The relationships that develop between the characters can be deep, but also conflicting, its hard to explain but understandable once you see it. Despite the lacking description you can always feel an assets power despite them looking or acting innocent.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, up to episode 9 everything has been tied together to give such an interesting experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual effects are good, and the characters, they are very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was average, i didn't mind it, it fits well, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything remarkable either.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot!?

            "content": "C.\r\nJust from the title of the anime, we can see that this anime is highly abstract. But perhaps, it was too abstract. While this anime is good at creating questions, it never really answers them. \r\nThere exists another dimension (for lack of a better term) called the \"financial district\" where people get to battle for money - at the expense of their future. While an interesting and original concept, the anime fails to account for all of its key plot devices. \r\nFinancial District. With a financial district, entrepreneurs and loads of cash, one wouldn't expect duels to be like Yugioh. Why would entrepeneurs and theirassets fight physically? It totally defies the point of calling this the financial district. Other than randomly using fancy terms such as mergers and acquisitions, there is absolutely nothing financial about this anime. Having a keen interest in finance, I am deeply dissappointed by the lack of effort to expand on this concept.\\n\\n\r\nAssets. The embodiment of one's future. Another interesting concept, but again, failed to be developped fully. Why are assets the way they are? The only one that was vaguely explained was Mikuni's asset. None of the other ones made sense.\\n\\n\r\nCollapse. The main cause of conflict in this story was that an influx of midas money is destroying the economy, driving down stocks. Yet the anime does not explain why this happens; with such an influx of money, it would be much more likely to result in a hyperinflation.\\n\\n\r\nMorals and ideals. Perhaps the anime would've been a masterpiece even if the above were less than perfect; however, even the most basic part of a story; its morals were not clearly told. None of the main characters had a good result; who was right? Is it really as the clown says, that everyone is striving for good and making the world better? But why then, is the futue disappearing? \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime fails to deliver in every single way. It managed to ruin such a promising setting, such a promising idea for a story. Instead of presenting it's philosophical ideas as is, the story is dumbed down with yugioh like battles and unrealistic depictions of the effects of financial disturbances. One finishes this anime with a sense of confusion; nothing in the anime is answered, and no moral value is presented.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime; however, I am giving it a 7 because of the ideas that could've been; perhaps this anime is best left for us to imagine an ending; to imagine what sort of a future this anime would've had.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I said I was planning to watch this show, my friends told me not to; that it wasn't any good. While I did find it enjoyable overall and don't think I wasted my time, it certainly had its share of flaws. If you're interested in a story that revolves around the nature of money and the meaning of future though, this might be for you. \r\nThe thing I found most irritating was the characters, particularly the protagonist, Kimimaro Yoga, who was just incredibly cliche in his role as a naive university student who never really accomplished anything important, and has strong feelings about what'sright and wrong, who of course was unexpectedly paired up with a hot-tempered, scantily-clad cliche female character, Msyu. Of course, Kimimaro is the only person who is like this in his world, as many of the supporting characters were incredibly selfish with no obvious reason for their behaviour. \\n\\n\r\nThe story involves Kimimaro being drawn into a secret parallel world of money, promising the possibility of riches in the outside world in exchange for his future as collateral. Of course, being the cliche male anime protagonist, he tries to refuse, but ends up getting drawn in anyway. In this world, he is paired up with an \"asset\", Msyu, to do battles (or \"deals\" in the series' terminology) in order to take money from the opponent, which I found highly predictable in outcome and lacking in explanation. Of course, Kimimaro is the only person who cares about the feelings of his \"asset\", which everyone else merely regards as property, in accordance with his cliche personality. \\n\\n\r\nNow, what's interesting about this story is how it explores the manipulative nature of money in reality; what sort of effect it has on people's lives, both positive and negative; and how the very wealthy behind the scenes inadvertently affect others through their actions. In this series, the outcome of the deals can produce serious negative changes in the life of the loser (particularly if they lose everything) as reality of their life in the outside world suddenly shifts to a different one, where things their money influenced simply vanish. This is not explained very well in the series, but will probably make sense to anyone familiar with the Many Worlds Hypothesis. \\n\\n\r\nThe other aspect it explores is the nature of the future. Kimimaro is seeking stability in his life and doesn't want to deal with an uncertain future, but after watching the antagonist wreak havoc on the world for the nominal goal of stability, his views on what the future really is begin to change. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the artwork is lovely although some of the scenes are dizzying in orientation. I found the opening and ending themes somewhat bland, but this is highly subjective and you might love them, and otherwise the soundtrack is fairly decent. There are some random amusing moments in the series, such as side character Jennifer Satou's (the IMF woman who's name is rarely mentioned) love of junk food or Msyu's lack of understanding of humans, which did make it more enjoyable. Overall, it could have been better, but I still liked it.",

Also this kind of anime should be more than just 11 episodes; I think the plot is to big just for 11 episodes.\r\nCharacters: 5\r\nThis is the major low point of this anime, the characters is you askme are really forgettable and kind plain for example the main antagonist is a bit better that the typical talented insecure and sometimes cocky kid, he doesn\u2019t react to much to the things around him and honestly I like it but I doesn\u2019t find him interesting in any way, the antagonist is the typical young adult who is also mysterious and show new things to the most young protagonist, the fan service part was Satou, Jennifer. You don\u2019t see much about her, she start to take an important role finishing the anime and the concept of \"Fan service\" is totally lame.\\n\\n\r\nEffects: 8\\n\r\nThe effects are pretty good, the battles and the items the used is really good also, also the financial district is really interesting to see, and this is one of the best things of the series\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7\\n\r\nI liked the opening and ending theme, the soundtrack were also good, not only good composed but the correct one used in every part of the anime\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good if you ask me, I really liked the design of the characters, also the way the financial district is done was pretty good, maybe the characters can\u2019t be that interesting but they for sure looked really good\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.2 >>> 7 (since MAL doesn\u2019t use decimal or 100 to rate the amines)\\n\r\nThis is a good and interesting anime, if you are related in some way to the finance are I really suggest you this anime. the main problem was it was too short for that kind of plot and also the characters were not interesting at all, but at the end is an enjoyable anime, I suggest (but not strongly) this anime to anybody if you are looking for a short anime or doesn\u2019t know what to see next.\\n\\n\r\nRespectfully,\\n",

Unlike other animes, where the main character is clear cut and knows what they want, Kimimaro is indecisive. He isn't quite sure what is wrong or right.\r\n3. As the story story develops you begin to see how things relate and it's really interesting.\r\n4. The hook: This series pulls you in by really making you think, and with all the questions it brings up. There isa constant feeling of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWell those aren't all the reasons but those are the ones i think other people would want to watch this anime for. I really hope that they continue this anime past 11 episodes. It's been going at a nice and steady pace but i'm afraid that they're going to be forced to make a quick wrap-up near the end, i think this anime would prosper from getting another season or 2.",

            "content": "While life teaches us that there are greater things in life than money, C tells us a story of a world where money is all that matters.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story focuses on a 19 years old boy, Kimimaro Yoga who is forced to fight in a different world in order to survive in the real one. Yoga is our tipical teenager who suddenly finds himself involved in some kind of a supernatural issue and has no idea what is going on. That's when Msyu, his \"asset\", comes and rescues him from the very first fight. Later he meets Souichirou Mikuni, one of the most powerful characterswho ends up becoming his enemy.\\n\r\nThis whole show is not only about fighting, but also about not changing yourself after you've become rich and never forgetting where you've come from. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is really outstanding. I have nothing to complain about. The characters are well defined, with fine features and many details. Even the assets differ very much from one to another.\\n\r\nThe view from Financial District is a little dull, coloured only with white, red, black and yellow but I guess that is just the atmosphere that place should suggest: boring, with no trees or flowers, filled with people who care only about power and nothing else. So, like I said, I love the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe sound overall is pretty much ok, again, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Yoga tends to be the kind of the character that doesn't want to follow the \"game\" rules, which are: fight or die, and he wants to make a change although he is weak and it is impossible. Starting with episode 3 or 4 as I recall, he accepts everything and and begins to take each duel seriously. On the other hand, Mikuni is that sexy badass character, the strong one who is pretty much used to this way of living. Despite the fact that his morals turned out to be wrong and he became the bad guy in the end he still remains my favourite character. He was raised in a family where the word \"family\" was just a word with no meaning, his sister was very sick and his father was concerned only about money. Thus, Mikuni had to give up on his dream and follow his father's steps without becoming cold-hearted like him. I kind of understand how he felt and however, he just wanted to live for the present because of his sister who might not wake up the following day.\\n\r\nI was really glad that episode 6 (I think) was all dedicated to presenting our main characters' lives so that we could find out more about their past, way of thinking and personality.\\n\r\nAnother thing I want to mention is the relationship between Yoga and Msyu. Msyu slowly falls in love with Yoga from the second she met him but unfortunately, when she finally has the chance to show her love, she disappears. I'm kind of sad that this romantic part of the series was overshadowed by other events.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nSometimes I found it pretty difficult to keep up with this whole economy-management thing but in the end I guess I got the main idea of this anime :D. The fights were so and so. Some of them were great with lots of action but some of them were boring, when Yoga would win with a single attack (and let's be serious-he was a beginner, he couldn't have been that strong). I must admit, I really enjoyed seeing how badly money can influence our lives and how would a world where everything depends on money would look like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nLike I said, sometimes things get really complicated and move too fast and you just can't keep up with them anymore. I wished there weren't only 11 episodes, 2 more would've been great because the most interesting part which was the end, wouldn't have been occuring so fast. I found C a little different from the other \"fight for survival\" animes and I recommend it to all of you.",

What is it, or more accurately how different people see it, how the world handles it and how it truly affect our future. (symbolic, no asset for you! sadly)\\n\r\nIt tells us that our world is living in debt, and what is taken now for the present will be needed to pay with our future and that there will always be people that will try to fight it or take advantage of it.\\n\r\nIt will tell you the importance of protecting your future, but will not tell you how or if it will ever be worth as much as the actions you are currently taking.\\n\r\nSo do I recommend [C]? Yes without a doubt. True you will need more than one run to understand it fully, and true the anime will leave you with lots of questions and not many answers, and yes this might all just be loving to many economies and seeing my own life story in this anime so I imagine some kind of deep symbolism in this anime that you might feel it didn't quite live to your expectations.\\n\r\nHowever if after all of this you kept reading through this review, go and watch it. I am willing to fall for the risk that the majority of you will return to here just to click on \"unhelpful\". But for if there is one like me that will see what I saw, and still seeing in this anime. Then it is all worth it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading my review, pleasent anime watchtime :)",

            "content": "C is an anime combining economics and pokemon (-like) fights, I kid you not. Economics must be the most unexciting subject in the world and this anime tries hard to overcome that detail.\r\nStory: \r\nKimimaro is a dirt-poor student who for some reason is given the opportunity to enter a psychedelic dimension called the Financial District and compete with his pokemon, er, no, asset, Msyu (creative spelling here I see, sounds like a sneeze). If he wins he is given creepy black Monopoly money to use in the outside world. If he loses he loses his entire future. \r\nThe threeway struggle between present, future vs. moneyis the selling point in this anime. Despite the fact that this point is being subtly bludgeoned into your brain every episode by every character, it is by no means too corny. For a twelve-episode anime, the story progresses amazingly well. No episode is wasted with filler or useless events. Structurally, this anime is impeccable. Logically, not so much. A lot of things are never really explained but that's okay, you can live with a little-- no, make that a lot-- of mystery. There is a lot of economic jargon thrown around; hell, even the pokemon-ish fights read like a frigging textbook. My advice is, don't take it too seriously, it doesn't make any sense even in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWell, first of all, we have Kimimaro, who is as interesting as a plank of wood. Even when he finally overcomes his passive nature he still is a boring character. \\n\r\nThen we have Msyu, his scantily-clad pokemon-asset girl. She is a tsundere at first and we all know how that goes, don't we? \\n\r\nMoving on to Mikuni, number one player in the psychedelic money arena, looking very much like he escaped from a sparkly shojo. Much more interesting as a character since he's actually motivated to do something. Even if it is the wrong thing to do. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are quite interesting and distinct. For shame, the main character is so generic and the rest of the cast are totally interesting. Y U do that, writers?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nWell done. Consistent and imaginative. The psychedelic dimension scenes really do make you wonder if the animation staff were on drugs just to come up with all of that stuff. CG does not claw your eyes out despite being obvious and there is no deterioration in quality as the anime progresses. In fact, the final episode is very fluidly animated. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s there. Seriously, I did not pay much attention to either the background score or the OP/ED which means that they are simply functional and nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nThis is worth a watch but it definitely is not a keeper. There is more talking than action and requires the viewer to engage their brain a little bit. It also throws moral dilemmas at you.  If that sort of thing appeals to you then give it a go. If not and you are looking for just action and fights go watch Pokemon.\\n",

            "content": "[C] The Money of Soul and Possibility Control has a pretty original hook: It's a story starring economics college-student Yoga Kimimaro who only wants to acquire a job with income stable enough to support a family. One day he meets some eccentric dude named Masakaki (who looks a fusion between Willy Wonka and the Cheshire Cat) who offers him a large sum of money, asking in return that he put up his future for \"collateral\". From that day forward, Yoga is transported to a realm known as the Financial District where he must engage in battles known as \"deals\" in which he must offer notonly his money but his future as well. It doesn't just stop there since the money printed in the Financial District is different than your average bills. \"Midas money\" as it's called not only has adverse side-effects on the economy but on the fabrics of reality as well\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything [C] does that's remarkable, it's that the series tackles issues you never see tackled and gets off to a fairly strong start because of it. The idea of a financial crisis being the core conflict in a series sounds pretty cool. The main character is pretty easy to relate to (college student with money issues), the Financial District looks pretty neat, and Masakaki is awesome. Why did it all have to go so wrong?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the battles. To expand further on the above synopsis, people who engage in deals within the financial district are known as entres (short for entrepreneurs), and they are given ass kicking super-powered sidekicks called assets to do most of the fighting for them. The creators try to make these showdowns seem complicated by giving them a ton of rules and financial terminology that imply depth, but the way the battles are actually executed resembles pretty much every proxy battle series out there. They are often rather short and resort to run-of-the-mill beam-spam where characters yell out the name of their attacks before firing in true Digimon fashion. Strategies are limited to mostly deus-ex machina and straight-up luck, so don't come into expecting any sort of complex mind-games. They look pretty, but the deals are mostly brain-dead affairs. You don't really need to understand the terminology or rules really, whoever has the biggest blast wins. Strangely enough, one of the most hyped battles of the entire series is also skipped over right in the middle of the action to have the characters simply spend time explaining the results, just thought that was worth tossing out there. \\n\\n\r\nWhen they're off the battlefield our central duo isn't particularly interesting either. Yoga is a pretty dull and passive lead character. His involvement in the story is really little more than an excuse to introduce the viewers to the premise since we learn about the Financial District at the same time he does. He has no real involvement with the main plot going on under his nose until the final episodes. He's not a completely terrible lead though since his ideologies make for a decent foil for the ideologies of the people he meets and battle within the Financial District, especially the last boss. The real problem here is his asset Msyu. She's basically a loli-tsundere who develops into a loli-tsundere waifu. Her interactions with the Yoga as she slowly falls in love with him are cringe-inducing and eat up far too much time. I figured a show with such a deep setting that only has eleven episodes to work with would know not to spend time on teaching your pet waifu how to eat or what a kiss is, but there's always enough time for otaku-bait I suppose. The nature of the relationship between entries and assets is something I won't go into much for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but it's where I was hoping this show would differentiate Yoga and Msyu from all the other dull male/female leads out there, but it's a sub-plot that pretty much gets dropped right before giving us any kind of meaningful answer. Thus leaving us with yet another lead couple who won't do much for anyone not wanting another cliched central couple. Meh.\\n\\n\r\nI feel no need to mention most of the other entries for the reason that they are mostly one-note entities who fail to amount to something memorable due to short screen-time. I will give props to show for the antagonist (though you could also call him an anti-hero) Mikuni, who is far more interesting to follow then our boring lead and his digital waifu. He understands the effects that losing deals has on other entries (not only do they lose money, but a part of their lives will suddenly vanish). His motives were rather interesting and understandable. I applaud the show for not giving us the main antagonist solely driven by greed which is something that I was expecting from a series where money is behind everything. His plot too is analogous to the idea of quantitative easing, wherein he tries to inject Midas Money into the Japanese economy. His role in the story was a pretty interesting one that provided some interesting criticisms to the practice.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show are probably as unique as the show's premise but are about as mixed overall as the show's execution. The Financial District is pretty cool to look at with it's distinctive red/white color pallet and the battles that take place are often well animated. The character art, however, does this bizarre thing often goofily switches between 2D designs and 3D models. It was sort of cool at first since Masakaki was the only one doing it in episode 1 and it sort of fit in with the rest of his bizarre characteristics. However, eventually, you get shots of characters walking down the streets in 3D sometimes and the occasional scene where both 2D and 3D characters are interacting on screen at the same time. The actual character designs themselves are also kinda weird in a sometimes derpish way sometimes but is otherwise average. The actual acting is alright on both sides. Funimation's dub doesn't really have much young blood so if you're well acquainted with their previous works, the English version will end up being a rather simple game of \"spot the voice actor\". Scott Freeman as Masakaki was excellent though. I'd still recommend the Japanese version since it has the highest ratio of Engrish to Japanese speaking (a result of having the International Monetary Fund pop up from time-to-time and the attacks and terminology used during deals) since the likes of Black Lagoon and Beck. It's weird in this since some of the Engrish sounds almost convincing too.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot would've benefited greatly benefited from another cour, but as is the show bites far more then it can chew. I'm not sure if the series had it's episode count slashed or not, but it certainly feels that way (just as much as it did with Angel Beats! too). Much of the series focuses on Yoga/Msyu adventures in the Financial District, yet all of a sudden in the final episodes the show forces a doomsday climax with no build up. It would've been great to get a better understanding of how the show got there and how Mikuni figured into it all. Instead, it feels as if people woke up one day only to find out that they suddenly have an enormous financial crisis that threatens to plunge the world into the \"Great Depression \" tier misery. These episodes feel to quickly paced and even though the final deal itself is pretty awesome, the show resorts to what I can only call a ridiculously ass-pully resolution that felt much too cheap.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[C] is most definitely a textbook example of a neat premise being ruined beyond all recognition. The unnecessary focus on boring leads you've seen before combined with a plot that didn't get the time it needed to develop alongside the weak character development hamstring the show's potential badly. It's an interesting affair still simply because of the bizarre premise and visuals and won't take up too much time. That's not enough to prevent [C] from being a failure of forgettable proportions. Come for the cute assets and explosions, it won't disappoint too much if that's the fix your looking for.",

            "content": "The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is a very complex and original story with two little time to flesh out the characters, and here's what I mean:\r\nIn the story, we have several different characters, including the protagonist, fighting over two goals that are the same. This fact feels as if it's an allusion to reality, and it makes the conflict between characters seem extremely real. In real life, you'll often see people take sides fighting over different ways to hopefully get to the same goal, and there is no right answer. You see this in politics, in social scenarios, absolutely everywhere. I never haveseen a realistic conflict like this in any anime, so this show will always have a place in my heart for how well written it is. However, due to the 11 episode time span for the complex plot and conflicts to occur, it may get a little confusing for some and you might not ever be emotionally attached to the characters, making the conclusion seem dull in comparison to the show's bright colors and animation.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that the two most fleshed out characters were the protagonist, and the antagonist, which was enough for me personally. The plot, which was original as hell and extremely well written, has plenty of foreshadowing, allusions, and conflicts. It also doesn't have an issue with \"showing and not telling\" which I find that many anime do. It is one of the best anime I've ever had the fortune to view. This will always be one of my favorite anime simply due to multiple layers that the story has.\\n",

            "content": "About the work:\r\n            [C] is more an anime original, specially made for block Noitamina Fuji TV channel. The work was produced by Tatsunoko studio and directed by Kenji Nakamura. The history of anime is set in a time of financial crisis in Japan, where suicide rates soared and people have lost their life goals. The main character is Yoga Kimimaro, student common economy that shows no eagerness to have a lot of living. One day Kimimaro is visited by a strange man named Masakaki, who inviteshim to be part of a place called \"Financial District\" and, Kimimaro, seduced by the promised money, accepting the offer of Masakaki. When it comes to the Financial District, Yoga discovers a parallel world where humans (lent) fight each other next to the embodiments of their future called Assets. Kimimaro and its Asset, Msyu, participate in fights where they try to earn a good amount of money, but without many gains, not to compromise the real world. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I saw:\\n\\n\r\n            I was very excited about the comments before the anime to start, then kept it with great fondness on my list. He hoped that [C] would be the best anime of the season, because, besides being bold, there seemed to have their match. The story actually started badly; were discouraging the characters, the story was designed not as expected and the Financial District was too abstract. But time passed and the story was better, until it reached the remarkable quality of the block Noitamina. The character designs are really good and the individuality of the characters is very interesting, also the costumes of the characters and the details of the scenario are other strengths of the anime.\\n\r\n            The ending itself is divided into two episodes: the 10, where everything is known about C and what happened before the story itself, as the disappearance of the District of South America, and 11, where the fight takes place between Mikuni and Yoga . We really expected more from the end, but it was not easy to end an anime with a story so complicated and yet the end and managed to finish a short anime that does not disappoint, but remained in expectations. \\n\\n\r\nStrengths:\\n\\n\r\n            Perhaps the biggest plus point is the creativity of the anime also has a beautiful design and detachable three characters: Msyu, Jennifer Satou and even Yoga Kimimaro, who is the best male character of the season. The opening song is very good.\\n\\n\r\n            Negative Points:\\n\\n\r\n            The delay in developing the story and the terrible closing song are perhaps the only weak points, but are very important.\\n\\n\r\n            NOTE: 76/100 (above average. Creative, but normal)\\n\r\n            IMPORT: No way, is short and does not belong to the Brazilian public lay in manga and anime\\n\r\n            Season 2? : By leaving gaps for a second season, but should not occur\\n\r\n            SIMILAR: No, his style is a novelty. \\n\\n\r\n              Original Text in portuguese: http://animeluchos.blogspot.com/2011/06/c-money-of-soul-and-possibility-control.html",

What midas money is, what is Financial district is, or What kind of the game is, All of these was still mystery at that time. Although i was confused, but i quiet enjoyed this anime. Because i didn't know about, it made this anime more interesting. Remember, that anime should not only great in art, sound, but it must be interesting. :D\r\nI like the character in this anime. Kimimaro is university student in economics, it is matched with this anime. Hewant to live normal, he is a scholarship students. He also works in supermarket. He was left by his parents because they died, so he live alone. He also sometimes visit his aunt. His background makes him matched become the main character in this anime. You'll surprised when you hear about his parents. The OP and END is good. I like the separation scene in the middle episode that shows \"C\" and says \"C\".\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting from this anime is its title \"Control: The Money and Soul of Possibility\". We will understand this title in episode 4-5, because previous episode, it will tell about the game. What is deal and the effect in the real world. :D\\n\\n\r\nSo this idea from this anime is mixing two world by mixing its money. Financial district is place for dealing with people, so the people will got more money. But exactly it has impact in real world. You can find this when you watch this anime. :D\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, you also will hear some conversation in English. This conversation is used by an organization, I actually still don't know, what kind organization is. So, it makes this anime interesting again. But for English conversation, i think the pronunciation is not clearly said. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end, i recommend you to watch this anime for this season... :D",

            "content": "I didn't know a lot about C when I started it and I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it only took one episode for me to realize how complex and interesting it was. I'll get right into it...\r\nStory 7/10\r\nMaybe it's just me, but this anime really reminds me of Inception. There's a lot of thinking the viewer has to do. I had to rewind fairly often to understand what was going on. However, the constant search of wanting to figure out more kept me interested. I think the plot was very well thought out and I really enjoyed it. I only gavethe plot a 7 for two reasons. 1: the confusion was rather frustrating at times and 2: it would've been much better had the series lasted longer; they crammed a lot of story in too few episodes. I was left with many unanswered questions and a feeling that I missed out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nI say it all the time, but what's really important to me is that characters with bigger roles are the ones who should be given more backstory. I wish I could've known a bit more about Kimimaro's past, but they did a pretty good job considering there's only 11 episodes. Besides that, I found it very hard to dislike the characters. The two main girls are tough and hard-working instead of whimpy and annoying, Kimimaro has a compassionate personality, and Souichirou has a story you just can't hate him for. Lastly, I really liked how I had to choose sides during the final few deals. I found it hard to choose favorites and it really got to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is incomparable to any I've seen. The Financial District is really futurist with the architecture and it's really beautiful. Everything was so colorful and bright-just the right amount to not be too busy. One of my favorite parts of C is Masakaki. He was drawn in 3D and that really amazed me.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI sometimes find it hard to review the music and effects of an anime because I'm usually too focused on the story to think about the background song. However, I kinda think that's how it should be. Music used in movies/tv shows should compliment the mood of the scene. I shouldn't be distracted by some weird music that has no business being in that scene. So not recalling much of the music is a good thing in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI jump all over the place in anime genres. At one point I was watching Ghost Hunt and Ouran Highschool Host Club at the same time X) ! C really caught my attention because it combined a lot of genres into one anime. There was tons of action (shounen), definitely drama with some heart-jerking moments, and even a tiny bit of romance! So for those like me who just can't stick to one or two genres, this anime is definitely for you!",

            "content": "Perhaps one of the worst anime series I have ever had the displeasure of watching to the bitter end. My recommendation is to just skip it. \r\nAllow me to explain why.\r\nStory 3\r\nEconomic crisis, fiscal instability, human greed coupled with the money battles via a form of avatars. The whole idea seems interesting in a sense but the end result is not. The whole conceptualization is faulty. The story progression is full of plot holes and gaps, irrelevant information and please let us not forget several overdramatizations of actual things. It is highly ridiculous when at some point the story tries to portray that the IMF(Yes the actual organization) is responsible for the global financial crisis due to its activities and inactivity. I mean who had that brilliant idea. Fiction and reality are two different things of course, but damn just because you have an exceptionally weak plot you can't just fill it up with pure randomness. The end result will be, as in this case, a horrible series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5\\n\\n\r\nWell the art was not bad or good. I have to admit that the artists had their moments (primarily in the creation of the main characters) bu there were also times that I thought that they should not be allowed to work under the influence of mind altering substances. The whole financial district seemed rushed and ugly . Furthermore given that the financial district is some form of parallel universe or another dimension or something of the sort it lack any similarity with the actual world. \\n\\n\r\nSound 3\\n\\n\r\nOther than a couple of songs that were utilized in specific scenes ( after the last battle the song was magnificent) all other music associated with this series is at best poor. Not only nothing that would fascinate and excite you but the exact opposite. Most of the music was bad and not connected with the scenes. The opening and ending songs were more like noise to me and not something to get me fired up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1\\n\\n\r\nAll characters were horrible. Even the ones you think are awesome in the beginning end up horrible. First of all there is NO character development. Apart from the two 'main'characters which we know less than 1% of their identities,ideologies, thought patterns etc. all others are complete mysteries. It is like they do not exist to the viewer cause simply they have no reason to exist. There are cases where a character is repeatedly part of the 'action' and you do not even know their name. Simply PATHETIC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 3\\n\\n\r\nFor me 3 is quite generous. I had hoped that the series will reward me by sticking with it and that it would prove me right to have devoted my time but in the end all my fears came to be real. This series is a huge waste of time. It is not fun, interesting, intriguing and it does not entice me to find the original mange/light novel or whatever else created this world to begin with. For me it has failed on all fronts.",

I liked how each country's financial district had a serperate color that is themed with it and I personally liked everything else about the financial district.\r\nSound:6\r\nThe sound in any anime doesn't usually jump out at me. This was the case with C: Control. The reason I gave it 6 instead of a 5 is because I liked the opening song butit wasn't amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\r\nI haven't read any reviews for this show but I'm assuming people though were a low point in the show which I think is fair. I thought the characters were well developed and likeable for how short this anime was. If the show was longer and the characters weren't more developed I would of rated it lower but for its length it could've done much worse and not much better. Plus I related to the main character because of the choices he had to make in the show, I feel like I would've acted similarly\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong this show had it's faults and it is short but things like the ending didn't feel rushed and the show wasn't being dragged out. The show moved fast but not do fast it felt rushed so I wasn't confused, and it wasn't dragging itself out so it wasn't boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nIt gets a 9 out of me because I rate any show based on characters, enjoyment, and story. This one had a really good balance especially for its length. The story was a little weak to me but I think it could've been a lot worse.",

            "content": "Continuing on our tradition of providing a concise, no-frills, and no sugar-coating review, here's what we thought about this series.\r\nAn original idea. Surely that's what comes to our mind when we first watch this series. It explores about the possibility of \"selling\" your future for some amount of money now. Honestly, we rarely encounter such series tackling a rather off-the-beaten-path storyline, yet this particular series executes it rather well. However, due to this as well, we think that this kind of series are somehow underrepresented in effect, slightly underrated.\r\nWe start by analyzing the first episode of the series. From the beginning, we are presented withthe main protagonist that is clearly an ordinary college student. However, our attention are rather quickly shifted when he was provided the ability to take his future as collateral for a certain sum of money. We can clearly see that the writer executes this crucial moment, the first half of the first episode, by providing the audiences with a very compelling and prospective storyline. On top of that, the executions was rather fine, although there could use some more storyline rephrasing to better accentuate the whole plot, therefore more likely to captivate audiences.\\n\\n\r\nNext, from this point onward, we are presented by a storyline that revolves around the said protagonist, Kimimaro, and his Asset (the terminology used in the series) coming to the understanding of how the global financial world works, the massive secrets that it holds, and various individuals that are trying to force their ideals to the real world via this series particular mechanism. Truth be told, this is also rather a deviation from a commonly held traditions that this series does not emphasis a certain pattern, but instead letting the storyline flows as it should. This is a welcome change, a refreshing air of some of the audiences, although we also encounter quite a handful of audiences that cites the lack of backward flow in this series.\\n\\n\r\nNearing the end, we however, note a certain comeback to the time-proven method used by a lot of series, namely the action of the protagonist that eventually saves the entire country, if not the entire world. This may be a setback to what has been the status quo before, but we feel that it is rather necessary because it would be quite difficult to provide other ending that the protagonist failed to saves the country, due to the already established convention set by the preceding episodes of this series that Kimimaro works for the betterment of his country. In our global vantage point, the entire storyline provides a rather good dynamicity, attributed somehow to the aforementioned original idea. And with this, we finally conclude the review regarding the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, we would like to go over the intra- and inter-characters developments, especially focusing on several implied details. Starting from the first episode, the conventions for the main protagonist, Kimimaro, was rather nicely set and overall giving us and the audiences the necessary material to hold on and develop to. Over time, however, we feel that this development is somehow slowed down rather significantly and instead focusing on other side characters which from the beginning were set as condiments to the main storyline. This particular judgement also applies to the main protagonist's Asset, Msyu. Nevertheless, when we consider the pairing between Kimimaro and Msyu, we clearly see a rather progressive joint characters development, which is a good thing to have.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing a bit more on the side characters, we actually feel that all of these developments are actually rather necessary because the consensus of the game in this series is that when you lose, you lost your future, hence the necessity to actually proves to the audiences that the characters who lose do actually lost their future. We, however, stay on our previous judgement that these kind of developments ought to be rephrased so as to be able to develop itself alongside the main protagonist pairing, Kimimaro and Msyu, without interfering each other.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we arrive at our discussion regarding the ending. We clearly see that Kimimaro saves the day once again and the country in which he resides able to stand on its own after a very radical change to the economic system. Also, we would like to redirect the attention so as to read between the lines. From the moment we are introduced to the pairing, Kimimaro and Msyu, we can clearly sense and palpate that there was actually an atmosphere of intense like, probably also love, to each other from Kimimaro to Msyu and vice versa. On top of that, we can clearly feel the surmounting frustrations Msyu has due to the different realms that Kimimaro and she resides in, hence the inability of Kimimaro to stay forever with her. This is actually very welcome and significantly improves the entire mood of the series. Fortunately, we see that in the very end, no character is left behind and each one of them actually contributed to the progress of the story, one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control is a recommended series to watch for everyone without exception. It provides a long overdue original idea, although still somewhat needs more time to develop and mature more. The technicality, visual, and audio aspects are all very good and well composed. The soundtracks are a good listening material.\\n\\n\r\nWe hope that you enjoy this review, do share your thoughts, comments, and even ramblings.\\n\r\nBest regards.",

            "content": "What happens when a poor college student working to stay afloat receives an invitation to the Financial District? C is the adventure of a boy, as he ventures to save people from the horrors of money. Of course, this is no normal money we are seeing here; all across the world, fake 'Midas money' is being put into circulation. This money is taken in exchange for the futures of the district's members. By fighting, the value of these futures can be taken and lost.\r\nThe setting of C is slightly confusing at first, as there is very little explanation about what is going on. It isan interesting idea though of how our futures can be controlled by money, and this over exaggeration of that. Despite being a 11 episode series, the story decides to take an unfortunate turn into a worldwide scale. \\n\\n\r\nNot that the idea itself is particularly bad, but overall the story felt really rushed. Our character becomes acquainted with one of the tycoons in the Financial District, Mikuni Souichirou, whom through good intentions tries to use the midas money to save Japan. Of course, there are outsiders whom think that the Midas money is no good, and want to stop it. Hence, or male lead is placed in-between these factions as he tries to find the answer for himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting is actually pretty cool in this show as each member's future is turned into an Asset, a devoted companion whom will fight for their entre. While nobody dies, if one loses all of their money in a deal they will lose their future. Ones family, friends, jobs can all be gone.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the story is good, and it does have a lot of impact at times. However, I didn't find myself very into the story. The main character did not feel like he belonged among the other prominent characters, and was an average kid finding himself in the middle of a less than average situation. There is also a lot of episodic storylines that always end up showing the dependence society has on money.\\n\\n\r\nC was a very interesting watch. It wasn't incredibly strong, but the idea and concept was relatively original. If you are looking for something different, I think C could be the perfect fix.\\n",

            "content": "C: Control for short is probably one of the most misunderstood, under appreciated shows in anime. Many people gloss over the show, since it is slow moving, very psychological and introspective, and most of all very economically founded, so that the terminology is alienating for those with no background in economics. So, to set the record straight, here I am with my take on the show C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control.\r\n*This review contains NO SPOILERS. Please read on at NO RISK*\r\nStory: C: Control has a unique story, I will avoid describing it as it is one of the biggest strengths the showpossesses, and really draws the viewer in. The fact that there is no simple battle between good and evil, but a struggle of viewpoints, makes it complicated and intricate, tying the story in well with the characters and setting. The only issues that one can have is that it is too complex, which makes it difficult to fully understand (my advice is to rewatch it, it is only 11 episodes), and that there are several questions left unanswered at the end, to which I say that they are the right questions, all of the major issues are resolved and only irrelevant questions of personal interest remain. Story in C: Control gets a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art in C: Control is very appropriate for the other-worldly setting, especially the shapes and subtle designs mimicking the stock market and other economic symbols. The color palette is very limited, however, as well as certain scenes seeming very poorly animated as the show was clearly made with a very limited budget, which I cannot overlook. Even so, the show's use of what it has is very ingenious, and earns an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack in C: Control is very forgettable, especially on the first watch. Having rewatched the show several times, certain tracks really stick, and at minimum it blends very well with the setting and plot. There are no bad tracks on the soundtrack, something that can kill a show for me personally. Sound gets a 8.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in C: Control are another strong point of the show. You have a very inexperienced, naive main character that has some of the best growth for said stereotype in all of the shows I've seen. There is of course an antagonist, but not out of evil or malice, but out of a different mindset on the solution to the issue they are faced with. All characters get a good amount of development, and the amounts of development fit perfectly with the character's role in the show, so that the main and important characters get large amounts of development, and the lesser characters get less development. The characters themselves are slightly bland, but the show will take your initial conceptions and smash them, leaving you loving many of the characters, or disliking them, by the end. Character gets a 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally very much enjoyed C: Control a lot, so much that I am horribly disappointed at the lack of enjoyment by the anime community. The main thing to keep in mind with C: Control is that the genres are not what they seem. I would describe it more as a drama, psychological, with hints of action and supernatural. DO NOT WATCH IT if you are looking for an action show, or a superpower show. You will not enjoy it. For me, enjoyment gets a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, C: Control is a show that, if appreciated fully, can easily be liked and even loved, and claim a good spot on a list of favorite shows. If not properly watched, it can seem to be a very mundane, unenjoyable show. It is a great example of taking many risks and making them work marvelously. My final, overall rating of C: Control is a 9 out of 10.",

Though i had to read the synopsis multiple times to understand what was going on, i found that this series was rather a bit rushed and if given more episodes or time, would be easier to understand and more appealing to it's audience.\r\nThere is not much to write about this series because it gets straight to the point, which therefore led to its let down. As mentioned before, more time would have madethis anime a bit better and easier to understand. That being said, [C] was very intriguing and was a good pass time anime to keep away my boredom.

            "content": "\u201cWhy hello there...  I\u2019ve been watching you for quite a while.  You work so hard, balancing your responsibilities at work with your responsibilities at home...  I can\u2019t imagine having to deal with the crippling irony of spending so much time pulling overtime for extra money to support your children, only to have them complain that you\u2019re not home enough to spend time with them.  What\u2019s that?  Oh, right, I forgot.  My name is Masakaki, and I\u2019ve come here to offer you a wonderful opportunity.  How would you like to have all the money you could ever need?You\u2019d never need to work a day in your life again...  Well, maybe a little, to keep up appearances.  If you\u2019d like to solve all of your problems and improve your quality of life once and for all, then come with me to the Financial District, a world where an ambitious soul such as yourself can earn as much money as you want with little effort...  Oh, but of course, there\u2019s a catch.  You\u2019ll have to succeed at the expense of your peers, putting your money up against theirs...  And offering up your future as collateral.  So, my new entrepreneur...  What will it be?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNow, if I were you, I would think twice before taking Masakaki\u2019s offer, because this entrepreneurial El Dorado really isn\u2019t what it seems at the outset.  As a resident of the Financial district, a separate plane of reality whose influence on our plane is disturbingly obvious, you\u2019ll be gambling with more than just your net worth, or even just your life.  You\u2019ll be given a small fortune right at the start, along with an asset...  Your own personal battle monster to fight other entrepreneur\u2019s battle monsters on your behalf.  They\u2019ll be the ones taking a Stand for you as you encounter a wide array of both entrepreneurs(called Entres for short) and their Assets as well.  One such Entre is Yoga Kimimaro, a college student who works himself to the bone to support himself, paying for tuition and rent with his wages.He seems to have developed this weird idea that Assets are people too, and he has a hard time making decisions as he seems compelled to do the right thing, and yet he\u2019s proven himself a force to be reckoned with.  Will he be able to defend Japan against the District\u2019s secret threat, or will this Entre receive his just desserts?\\n\\n\r\nToday\u2019s anime offering is brought to us by Tatsunoko Production, a company that\u2019s somehow been around since the sixties without making much of an impact along the way.  That\u2019s probably an exaggeration, seeing how I\u2019m not personally up to date on the history of Japanese pop culture, but with the exception of Speed Racer, Irresponsible Captain Tylor and the Gatchaman franchise, I haven\u2019t heard of almost any of their properties.  Maybe it\u2019s all just too obscure for me, and for that reason I really can\u2019t get a grasp on what their work tends to look like on average, but C is one of their more high-profile titles, even if it\u2019s name makes it really frustrating to look up online.  At the very least I\u2019ve seen Gatchaman Crowds, so I feel like I do have some idea of what their modern works look like, and that\u2019s a good comparison to make, as the visual aspects of Crowds were one of it\u2019s major redeeming factors after it started to get bogged down by all of it\u2019s deeper problems.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Crowds, C tries out a blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation and art styles, The traditional animation is your standard fare...  It\u2019s a little above average, the animation is just smooth enough to please the eye with clever editing to act as a crutch whenever it can\u2019t.  There\u2019s a lot of attention to detail in the characters\u2019 movements, and while I couldn\u2019t really point to any of it being flashy, it carries a very subtle level of quality.  Tatsunoko clearly know how to utilize shadows, and they seem to have a gleeful time proving it with a lot of smart lighting choices.  As for the 3D animation, it\u2019s really going to come down to a matter of personal preference.  I\u2019ve heard some people say that CG animation in anime is really jarring, and it makes the characters look really creepy, but personally, I love it.  I loved it in the dancing scenes in Love Live, and I especially love it here.  \\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, the divide between 2D and 3D animation is drawn very deliberately, to highlight the differences between the real world and the financial district.  When we see Masakaki talking to someone to entice them into signing over their futures, you can immediately tell that he\u2019s not of this world due to the uncanny valley effect of his animation.  It\u2019s a little stilted, but that just adds to the effect.  It\u2019s also a little inconsistent, but not to a majorly noticeable or bothersome degree.  There are some shots in the Financial district that look a little odd, but for the most part, the visual effects in this alternate world are stunning, like the slow pixelated dissolves and the digitized action sequences.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the backgrounds and set pieces in the real world are highly detailed, but the interior of the District is immaculate and brimming with creative design, even though I personally didn\u2019t see any big drops in quality to compensate for it.  I haven\u2019t seen very many shows that offered such a seemless blend of the two styles, which is pretty impressive considering this show came out in 2011.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, composed by Taku Iwasaki, is a bit hard to pin down, and from what I\u2019ve heard, that\u2019s pretty common for his work.  That\u2019s not to say C has a bad score, but it can get pretty distracting when you have techno effects in a track that also includes a greek choir.  The worst part is probably when he tried to emulate his previous success with the soundtack to Gurren Lagann by including English rap tracks...  Yes, actual English...  But even though it doesn\u2019t sound like it has any translation issues, it still sounds pretty bad.  The opening, Matryoshka by Nico Touches the Walls, is a lot simpler and easy to listen to, although that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it the best track in the series.  Is\u2019 a traditional J-rock track with beautiful visuals that depict not only the plot and characters of the series, but the importance of currency throughout the history of humanity and our culture.  The closing theme, RPG by School food Punishment (Seriously, how do they come up with these band names?), is more true to form for the series, even though the visuals are a bit bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub was produced by Funimation, and since it had a good writer on staff, the apt Monica rial, it\u2019s a pretty damn strong one.  Brina Palencia and Todd Haberkorn don\u2019t have that much to do in the main roles of Yoga and Mashu, as they really don\u2019t have to tweak their voices or anything strange like that, with the exception of all the voice effects for battle that they had to do.  For the rest of the show, they keep to a grounded and subtle register, and it isn\u2019t until the stakes are raised in the second half of the series that they really have to do anything dramatic, and of course, being seasoned veterans, they\u2019re more than prepared for this.  They\u2019re likeable and speak naturally for the remainder, so I really don\u2019t have any complaints about either of them.  Far more impressive is J Michael Tatum, playing a veteran entre with a dark past motivating him to some mysterious goal.  We get the standard Tatum performance, that sly, smooth voice that\u2019s almost enchanting enough to make an exposition dump sound palatable, but there\u2019s also a barely disguised sense of malice and righteous vengeance lying under the surface.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Brina and Todd, Cherami Leigh doesn\u2019t have much to do, but she\u2019s still perfectly likeable as Yoga\u2019s initial love interest, and while you won\u2019t be expecting much from her, there are dark turns she has to take towards the end, and Cherami portrays it all flawlessly.  Monica rial does her Monica Rial thing, and it is of course nice as usual, and Sonny Straight has a lot of fun sliding into the slithery shoes of Takedazaki, a bat-shit crazy information exchange broker.  The star of the dub is...  Well...  Fuck, I really don\u2019t want to talk about this guy again, but it\u2019s Scott Freeman.  I remember praising this actor before in Yamada\u2019s first time(the DVD of which he actually autographed for me at a convention), and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve mentioned him in some other reviews I don\u2019t feel like looking up, but all of that was BEFORE he got arrested for possession of child porn, a charge he plead guilty to.  It pains me to say this(but not as much as the fact that I actually shook his hand), but he put on an undeniably solid performance as the otherworldly Masakaki, playing him as a sort of joker-esque fop.  Yeah, if you don\u2019t want to have to face the moral dilemma of enjoying the work of a pedophile, stick to the sub.  Otherwise, the dub is pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve heard of this anime, who\u2019s full name is actually C: Money of Soul and Possibility Control(even though Edgy Digimon would have been easier to google), you\u2019re probably aware that it doesn\u2019t have the best reputation.  That\u2019s one of the reasons I was wary to try it out, until it was requested by a friend of mine in a roleplay group.  Honestly, though, I thought it got off to a pretty good start.  It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that this is a concept anime, one that\u2019s built around a central idea, and to it\u2019s credit, that concept is pretty strong.  In an alternate plane of existence, specially selected people are given fighting avatars and are able to take control of a secret economy that directly effects that of the real world by letting them both win and lose massive amounts of what might be the world\u2019s most well-disguised counterfeit money.  There are a lot of rules that go along with this game, as well as a lot of details, conditions and repercussions, and I had a lot of fun learning about all of it.  If you\u2019re going to explain a concept in a story, it\u2019s best to have a cypher character to stand in for the audience, and this was done pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nYou can draw a lot of metaphors out of this concept, although I doubt very much of it was intentional.  The stock market comparison isn\u2019t a subtle one, but it\u2019s still pretty smart and insightful with how it\u2019s used.  You could also draw out an allegory for the temptation of magical solutions over hard work, but if I\u2019m being honest, Key the Metal Idol did this way better, and that was just in a single scene.  If you were to REALLY stretch it, you could also draw some comparisons to bitcoin, but that would mostly be for fun, as I highly doubt they had that in mind.  It\u2019s not dripping with depth, but it has just enough substance to make the concept feel appealing, and of course all of the action and fight scenes don\u2019t hurt either.  The details we\u2019re given about this world are given out at a nice, pleasant pace, even as the series goes to some darker places than you were expecting, and several of the assumptions you\u2019d been making about this world and it\u2019s rules turn out to be disturbingly incorrect.  When you first get a glimpse of what happens when someone\u2019s collateral future gets taken away from them is crushing to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it SHOULD have been crushing, but the lack of impact you\u2019ll feel over it is almost as disquieting as the lack of impact the characters feel about it.  The major drawback from focusing so much time and story on the inner workings of the Financial district turned out to be a distinct lack of emotional resonance, part of which is the show\u2019s underwhelming characterizations.  The most obvious example of this is the main character Yoga, whose usage as a cypher never really evolves into anything else other than good-guy boy scout who wants to do the right thing.  The only interesting element of his character is his frugality, as he takes every opportunity to save his money in order to invest in his future, but this element fades after only a few episodes.  His asset is even worse, as she pretty much plays the egregious female role of love-interest-doggy, her entire character revolving around growing more trusting and bonded with Yoga over time, which is a common archetype in anime, but it\u2019s particularly awful here.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Asuna from SAO, whom I also compared to a dog, Mashu\u2019s only defining characteristic is her relationship with a more important male character, but it\u2019s even worse here because she also took a dose of magical girlfriend fluid to the arm.  \u201cMaster, what is food?  What is taste?  What\u2019s a kiss?  Master, I think I love you!\u201d  Yeah, they tried to do a romantic sub-plot for these two, and it\u2019s about as painful as the tsundere vibes between Rika and Renamon would have been if they\u2019d been fully realized and not just hinted at.  Yoga does nothing to earn Mashu\u2019s feelings other than bring her a cup of instant noodles, because apparently it\u2019s SO weird for Entres to be nice to their assets.  Not only is the evidence for this really weak, but hey, not everyone has an Asset that looks like a half-naked teenage girl.  Nobody\u2019s flirting with their ogre and giant wolf Assets, but that doesn\u2019t make you a hero for having a sexy demon to talk to.  Oh, and I don\u2019t want to spend much time on this, but the reveal involving her and Yoga\u2019s Dad goes absolutely nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d but I hear you say, \u201cwhat about Soichiro Mikuni?\u201d  Well, what about him?  Everything about him, from his motive to his plan, was fucking stupid.  We\u2019re given his backstory in the worst possible way, as he dumps a ton of exposition on us, talking to literally us to explain everything, which is lazy and unimaginative at best.  I get that his father was being a dick, and that the nature of his dickishness COULD give somebody a cynical attitude towards the economy, but his story honestly feels weakened by the fact that his sister doesn\u2019t actually die...  She\u2019s just in a coma, but Mikuni\u2019s attitude is so vengeful it\u2019s like he already lost her.  You would think that with all the money he\u2019s making in the district he\u2019d be happy just to use it to keep her on life support and in the best conditions possible in hopes that she\u2019d wake up someday, but no, that\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing at all.  Get this:  The last thing she said before going into her coma was that she wished this moment could last forever, so his idea is to destroy the world and stop time.  Except no, that\u2019s not how time works.  Tomorrow is still tomorrow, and shouldn\u2019t sacrificing decades of your future work against the idea of your sister waking up?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I don\u2019t recall if that\u2019s exactly if that\u2019s how everything went down.  I did finish this show way back in...  Three fucking days ago.  All things considered, i\u2019m surprised I remember as much as I do.  You can\u2019t really blame me, though, as this anime goes completely off the rails about halfway through, raising it\u2019s stakes to unbelievable levels that you will literally not believe.  Yeah, someone losing their future might make their children disappear, or ruin their friends\u2019 lives, but as an economical crisis begins to loom in the last few episodes, people begin dropping like flies, disappearing into digital nothingness.  Their ties to the futures of different Entres pretty much turns them into vaporware.  I found a lot of this hard to follow, so it might be my fault for not being smart enough to piece everything together...  I\u2019m no economics expert, after all, and a lot of the more important details about the Financial District are left intentionally vague, but there was something that happened towards the end that makes me think I\u2019m not actually mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nFor a while, I was planning to look up a detailed explanation of how everything worked, how the ending was built up, what was happening with the money, etc.  It couldn\u2019t all be superfluous made-up bullshit, could it?  But then I realized that yes, yes it fucking could.  Not only do people and buildings start getting erased from reality, but also ENTIRE LAND MASSES.  We see a few island countries getting erased from the map...  Nothing that exists in our world, of course...  But the logic of this is just mind-boggling.  So the Financial District was able to alter the geography of the planet?  How?  Did it add water to fill in the voids left by the land it took?  Did the sea levels change?  Did the entire history of those land masses dating all the way back to Pangaea get rewritten?  Did the prehistoric creatures that roamed them get erased from the fossil record, also erasing anything they evolved into?  And hey, why not take away any land-locked countries?  Didn\u2019t want to stretch the suspension of disbelief too far?\\n\\n\r\nC:  Money of Soul and Possibility control is available from Funimation.  You can watch it for free on their website, as well as for a decent price on Amazon as part of the S.A.V.E. collection.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d just like to take a moment to once again emphasize that this show did get off to a fairly good start.  I could tell right from the beginning that it wasn\u2019t destined for greatness, but it was at least interesting when it wasn\u2019t trying to do anything other than provide a Digimon rip-off with a cool backdrop.  Unfortunately, it\u2019s ambition far outpaced it\u2019s brain.  It\u2019s biggest problem is easily the fact that it wanted you to think, but it was way better off if you didn\u2019t.  The laws of cause and effect are thrown out the window in favor of increased stakes, and if that\u2019s not bad enough, I haven\u2019t seen a main character that was this disconnected from the tragedy they were supposed to prevent since Evangelion.  It\u2019s a nice enough looking show, and I did enjoy it for a little while, but at only 11 episodes, I feel like things could have been set up and developed to the point where I could have actually cared about it.  As it is, it\u2019s pretty bad, but it\u2019s a unique enough idea that I can understand why people still remember it six years later.  It\u2019s just too bad that it lost control of the positive qualities it had.  I give C:  money of Soul and Possibility Control a 4/10.",

On the whole, too fast-paced and rushed. I couldn't empathize with almost scenes. If this show was made by 2-cour, it could be better.\\n\r\nSettings are well done for sure.

But foreign countries are pros and cons include this site. Probably different values against money are main cause.\\n\r\nIf I was told to can recommend this show, I'll answer YES...somewhat. Wasteful quality, but you can learn important thing if you watch this show.\\n\r\nAs my thoughts, money is not mere property, but to ask yourself. Because of we can understand what we are using that for, and for someone.\\n\r\nDirector spoke about containing various meaning for this show's title. Meaning of this show for me is \"CONSTRUCTION\".",

By the end, you understand just as little as when things began. Nothing comes together neatly, the main character is utterly forgettable and unrelatable, it seems as though nowhere near enough happens in each episode and none of the 8432943 concepts in this show, that are constantly talked about, are ever expanded upon or made clear. A good example of this is the way the show bothers to introduce mezzo, macro and micro attacks, terms which clearly mean alot in the world of C, but mean nothing at all to the user, as nothing is ever explained. In fact, as the show goes on, more and more things are added on that only confuse the viewer further. Eventually, whole cities are being swallowed up by the midas bank without proper explanation. The artistic direction of the show has a nice style to it but the forgettable characters drag that down and the blending of CGI and traditional drawing in battle scenes is hit or miss at best. I found the whole thing very boring. Which is sad, because since the premise was an interesting one, I honestly wanted to like it.",

Do watch this if you have nothing better to do anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWhy shouldn't watch this? There characters are somewhat shallow, the story doesn't go into depth, the fighting isn't intersting to watch, the concept of the whole financial district isn't too clear, there is no real growth, the protagonist is kind of overpowered but not in an interesting way, everything is rushed.

            "content": "Money is the most powerful thing that exists in this world. This green thin paper has the power to change and destroy many lives depending on the person who uses it and with the government controlling the money, there's no telling what will happen next to our society that waste a lot of resources for nothing. This is where the show C-Control: The Money and Soul of Possibility comes in and asks the question; What will you do if you have all the money in the world and how will you use it on your life to make it better or worse.\r\n\"C\" is about Kikimaro,a 19 year old college student who's studies economics and is trying to have a normal life by getting enough money to live by every day. That is until a mysterious figure named Masakaki offers him a deal that allows him to make more faster money if he allows his future to be collateral. He accepts and gets sucked in The Financial District, a parallel world where each week, he must compete into battles known as deals. If he wins these deals, he gets more money and if he loses, he loses everything form his future to his friends and even his existence will be erased. Now Kikimaro is on the fight of his life to uncover the dark secrets behind his father's disappearance and the district itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this show is really engaging. It's a story about money and how man's obsession with money can affect their outcome of their future. Can the money that you won on these \"deals\" save your future or will it just make your life worst than it is before? It asks a lot of questions about our use of money and it's up to the viewer to figure those questions out for themselves. I also like the world of The Financial District, where members fight on these deals with their \"assets\" in order to win battles (kinda like Pokemon but way cooler =P). The characters are pretty good. Mikuni is a man that owns Japan's financial district and would do anything to save his country from disappearing from reality while risking something more precious that he never thought before on his life, while Kikimaro is a normal kid trying to deal with the situations around him and doing his best in battle to save himself and his future and Jennifer is a woman on an investigation in The Financial District and finding out if the Midas Money (the currency in The Financial District and it's all black) makes it out of the real world and affects the worlds economy and there are other characters that I forgot to mentioned, they felt disposable, serving no purpose in the story (minus the teacher of course). The biggest problem with the story is that it rushes a lot of unresolved plot holes into the final episode and it ruins the whole point of following these characters throughout the whole story, despite what was going for in the beginning of the show. Also, it's a short series with only 11 episodes. Goddamn it! Why does every show with a very cool concept has to be fucking short?! This show has potential to be an excellent story but with 11 episodes only, it's not enough to expand the concept to big lengths. What a letdown.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I have to say, the animation by Tatsunoko Productions is a visual stunner, even on Blu-Ray. Watching this on Blu-ray made my eyes melt with how much vibrant and colorful detail there was in the art, but the real show-stealer is The Financial District. The style of that place is like TRON meets Wall Street and it's a pretty slick place. The art is creative  and the overall luxurious design are excellent. Character models are well drawn and they had their unique looks but the model for Masakaki is the one I loved the most. It just looks like a cool anime style version of The Joker but in a more demented way. The dub by Funimation was hit and miss. The actors that steal the show are Scott Freeman on his over the top but chilling performance as Masakaki and Brina Palencia's rough but at times cute performance as Msyu, Kikimaro's asset. Michael J. Tatum's performance as Mikuni is bland as hell and it feels very shallow in the emotional scenes of the show. Todd Haberkorn's performance as Kikimaro was Ok, but very typical and nothing outstanding on his performance. Funimation could have hired some unknown actors to voice these roles instead of using only famous people over and over but hey and while It's a decent dub, it isn't anything amazing to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nC-Control is a good series. It has it shares of big problems like huge plot holes that never get resolved and some issues with mediocre secondary characters, but it offers an interesting story to keep you interested, some nice action scenes and some top notch visuals that will look glorious on your HDTV if you have one. However, if you get too focused on these plot-holes in the show, then your enjoyment on this show will wear thin on you.",

Is there a way to buy back the future that has already been stolen from us do to the mistakes of our fathers? Those are just a few of the questions posed by this genuinely intelligent piece of work. \r\nWith a mass amount of anime falling short, missing the mark, or getting by with the same old, tried and true methods,  this anime shines through with originality, and brilliance. The plot mirrors the very real problem that our world facesnow, and shows us that no matter what we do, we must do it for the betterment of the future, and nothing else. The one thing I would say about the plot, is the real world love interest didn't get enough screen time, but what can one expect when so much is being done in just 11 episodes?\\n\\n\r\n The rest of the show is well done as well. The Animation is crisp, the explosions are fiery, the punches are explosive, and the blood is... money. Symbolism my friends, the word you are looking for is symbolism. (Forgive the Boondock Saints reference. I know not what I do.)\\n\\n\r\nThe music score is pretty generic and unobtrusive, and the sound is fine. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack, but it definitely didn't take anything away from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9/10 simply because I believe it could have been just that much better with a little more attention paid to some of the support characters, especially, as stated above, the real world love interest. 13 episodes would have done it I think. That being said, I strongly recommend this anime to anyone who is into economics, virtual/parallel realities, epic battles, cute flying anime girls, explosions, moral dilemmas, and, or cheesy romance. \\n\\n\\n",

The focus of the story is never lost. The pacing is decent. Most of all, there are no major plot holes in this anime. For an anime that focuses deeply on conceptual ideas, this is already well done. \r\nTo get the bigger picture, though, C portrays some potential problems that we might face regarding modern capitalismin a fantastical form, as Midas Money created by the Financial District. This anime is thought-provoking, as it raises many economics issues. Granted, this is not for everyone. However, anyone interested in current events of today's world should be able to appreciate some of the questions asked in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI watched this anime on animefreak, so I didn't really enjoy the extremely high art quality. However, I have no major problems with the animation or arts.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound is decent. When there is fight scenes, the background music really does bring out the inspiringly awesome feel. However, the other aspects of music is banal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nFor an 11 episodes anime, the portrayal of central character(s) are not too shabby. One of the things I really liked about this anime is that characters are not automatically characterized as good and evil. Everyone has his or her own ideals because everyone comes from different backgrounds. Numerous characters are likable. None are hated throughout of the anime even though technically they are all against each other. \\n\r\nHowever, our protagonist has quite a bland personality, which is the biggest flaw.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also took the right approach in not adding unnecessary romance scenes, random comic reliefs, ecchi scenes, or any other distractions from the main story progression. Furthermore, as I mentioned before and want to emphasize, this anime ended in a respectable manner.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nBecause I am an Economics student in a college, I really enjoyed many economics related ideas in this anime. Personally, the questions asked in the anime isn't far-sketched and is actually relevant to our society today. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nGood anime. Though if you are expecting any ecchi, romance, lot of action,or amazing plot twists and turns, forget it.\\n\\n\r\n*This review has been reedited, after I realized that the previous review have overrated this anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nC: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control (will be referred to as \"C\" from now on), definitely had an interesting story. In terms of an interesting concept of a world controlled by money and a world giving profits through battle. If anything, the way the world was constructed help tell an interesting story of one kid and his growing understanding of both worlds and the story of a man who seeks to preserve the present by destroying the future. If anything, C gave out a pretty straightforward conflict of the future vs. the present as well as giving some pretty fleshed out charactersto interact with an interesting world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThis was probably the shows weakest point, but not a very weak one and the score should give credit to how strong / moderately strong the other points were. If anything, the actual character designs, animations and background felt wonky or not as top-notch as the concept was. In fact, it'd be slightly jarring to immerse into either the real world or the Financial District due to how awkward some of the artwork / animation was. However, it was't so bad to the point that it would detract from the actual story or anything else. It was something that could've been better, but it does not completely destroy the series in any way. \\n\\n\r\nSounds : 9\\n\r\nNow this might seem like an interesting score, but I'm giving this score in the sound department not just because of both the amazing opening and ending, but because of the actual sound effects. If anything, this series did not hold back on any beautiful battle sounds. The sound of \"Direct\" by the feminine robotic operator as well as the amazing effort of Msyu (can't remember the seiyuu at the moment) of giving out distressed screams whenever she was harmed just added to each battle scene. On top of that, the English was pretty spot-on and the entire seiyuu cast should be given at least an honorable mention. The cast really kept the characters well-cemented in a series that I might have otherwise hated. At the least, the sound effects from the fight scenes really sold me on a great sound score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nIt was a little hard to rate this because of two factors: I hated the protagonist for awhile and minor characters seem to just disappear whenever. While some may argue the latter is the actual nature of the show, but I can't help but feel it was due to time-constraints / rushing / bad-pacing. But the Character score gets a higher score than what I would have normally given just because of the fact that the protagonist went through change. If anything, the main cast was not completely static! If a series has a non-static cast, or even a semi-dynamic one, then it's already a better series than at least half of the shows out there. While that last bit is a slight exaggeration, I'm just emphasizing the importance of such dynamic character development. That's also why I can't completely bash on the protagonist either; he doesn't just stay a brat who cries.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall :8\\n\r\nThis show wasn't quite an emotional roller coaster as Clannad After Story, nor was it quite an adventure / fantasy / romance ride like Guilty Crown or Legend of Legendary Heroes, but it had it's own merits. It isn't something ground-breaking, but it is definitely in it's own league. \\n\\n\r\nI'd imagine that this series would quench the thirst for some Spice and Wolf fans as well as maybe some Guilty Crown fans. Or, at least in non-meta terms, fans who enjoy some moderate romance (or slight, I should say), combat, fantasy, and some seinen-esque level of reflecting on the world. A little lighter than Psycho Pass, but definitely darker than Legend of Legendary Heroes. \\n\\n\r\nGreat show through and through, and one show you wouldn't want to miss in the future.",

I'm really not sure what to expect from that since Tatsunoko has been involved in both good and really bad productions before. Of course, their most notoriously bad project was made about thirty years ago (Superbook) so there's no reason to expect that kind of miserable performance here, but I also haven't seen much of their modern work, so I don't know what to expect. Let's take a look and find out. \r\nOur story proper begins with a poor student named Kimimaro Yoga beingapproached by a strange humanoid by the name of Masakaki. Masakaki offers Kimimaro the chance to earn money in a strange place outside of normal time and space known as the financial district. All he has to do is become an entrepreneur and battle against other entrepreneurs with the help of a being called an \"asset\", with his future as collateral. So if he loses, he has no future. Kimimaro quickly discovers that the battles in the financial district are distorting the real world. All he has to do is figure out what to do about it. That's about all I can give away without moving into spoilers. The idea is quite fascinating and the themes of the future and economics are both handled pretty well. My biggest issue with the series story-wise is that it moves too fast. To be fair, it's kind of necessary when you look at how short it is, but it really could've used at least another episode or two, if not an entire season to explore the concepts that it introduces more thoroughly. This leads to my more minor but still pretty big issue, they introduce far too many sub-plots. The series is eleven episodes long and they introduce several major sub-plots, which they end up either rushing through or leaving incomplete. The story is still well done and it is intriguing, but they tried to do too much with too little time and it does hurt the anime a bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are done really well, overall. Initially it looks like Kimimaro is going to be your typical angsty and somewhat whiny protagonist, but he moves beyond that pretty quickly. They also do a really good job of making the main antagonist a developed and even sympathetic character. Kimimaro's asset, Msyu, is also really interesting. I do have one issue with her character, but I can't go into it without giving away spoilers. All I can say is that it has to do with her dynamic with Kimimaro. The supporting characters don't fare as well. Most of them have pretty basic personalities. Although, I'm honestly not going to hold that against the series too much since it is doing a lot with very little time and it would be unreasonable to expect them to fully flesh out a bunch of characters. That being said, they could've done more with their major supporting characters if they hadn't spent so much time on unnecessary sub-plots.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this are fantastic. The financial district and the assets have really unique, otherworldly looks. The regular world is nicely detailed and the characters look good. That being said, I did have two issues with the art. The first is that there's some unnecessary fan-service. The second is the final battle scene. It's done in this really hectic style that's obviously supposed to convey intensity, but it fails. Instead it's just bizarre and distracting. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is competently done, except for the scenes in English. They have some really awkward and stilted dialogue. The music is really good, especially the track that they use for really intense scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1.3/10. There's one scene where it looks like they might go that route, but they end up not. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for C for Control is a 7/10. It's an entertaining anime with lots of good ideas. It does have some issues but they don't stop it from being a good anime.",

            "content": "'Rule of Cool' a TV Trope that can be summarized as \"Any logical faults in a work can be forgiven if the end result is cool enough\" (see: 'Gurren Lagann') . C-Control lives and dies by this trope, but this story of dueling financial wizards starts running out of tricks towards the end.\r\n-Story-\r\nThe story is stuck in an awkward middle ground. It takes itself too seriously to be simply, casually enjoyed the way one might enjoy say 'Rurouni Kenshin'. But it is riddled with too many inconsistencies and unexplained questions to be taken completely seriously. For example, the Bank of Midas seems to have noclear goal. They offer 'Entrepreneurs' large loans if they'll give their future as collateral, and when an Entre goes broke the Bank collects their future. But WHY do they want those futures? Does the lifespan they take get added to their own? Are they using those lives to create a Philosophers Stone? Are they hoping to sell that collateral on the futures market? (bada-boom). And where do they get their ability to print colossal amounts of money that's indistinguishable from the real stuff? Questions of 'Why' and 'How' are asked but never answered, the Bank just exists to drive the Faustian Bargain that creates the drama of C-C. And why do the battles even exist? If Midas is actually supposed to operate anything like a real bank the battles don't make sense. 'Deals' practically guarantee that some Entres will go broke rather than repay their loans, and there doesn't appear to be any way the Bank profits from the Deals themselves unless their intention is to collect on the collateral (but again, why they would want the collateral is never addressed). The Bank operates as the plot demands, nothing more. I've heard this series described as an allegory for the debate over Austerity Vs Bailouts, but the inner workings of C-C are so divorced from reality that it seems just as fair to say the climactic fight in 'Rocky IV' symbolized Ronald Reagan's strategy of defeating the USSR by putting in under more financial strain than its command economy could handle. (And without spoiling too much, the entire final arc can be described as \"Wait, what the what?\")\\n\\n\r\nThe 'Deals' that are the center of the action don't seem to operate according to any strict rules either. For example, early in the show there are couple times where a character will sell 'stocks' in their Asset to get the funds needed to launch a major attack, but after that stocks aren't mentioned again. What are the implications of selling stocks? If somebody owns 10% of your Asset, do they get to use them every tenth Deal? It's just a cheap power-up to excuse main character Kimimaro getting an early win against a much stronger and more experienced opponent. And while Entres are implied to have different classes of cards and Assets that supposedly lend themselves to different fighting styles, the concept is never explored. The second episode has a brief mention of 'Professional' and 'Amateur' Entres, but THAT is never explored either- it's just used to emphasize that our main character is an underdog because he's an 'Amateur'. I haven't found any tactical logic to the fights, just 'Make a big special attack at the right time'. Because the story wants to develop drama it doesn't have enough time to properly develop the fights, but because the fights are underdeveloped it undermines the drama. C-C needed to simplify its concept and focus more attention on how Deals work, or go fully serious and tell a dramatic story of a character trying come out ahead in a deal with the Devil. Even the length of the story seems stuck in an awkward middle ground. At 11 episodes there is just enough time for cracks to start showing in the plot without having time to address them. I've heard many say C-C needed more episodes, but I say it actually needed to be shorter- given what I've seen of the writing I'm more inclined to think C-C would have just dug itself deeper and deeper with more time. As a movie, however, this might really have worked since there wouldn't have been time for plot holes to pile up or the initial cool factor to wear off. As it stands, C-C has just enough rope to hang itself. Premises are cheap, execution is critical.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nThis series may have a Yugo's engine in a Ferrari's chassis- but a Ferrari's chassis is still beautiful. The Real World is drawn excellently, particularly Tokyo at night when the bright neon lights bounce around in the darkness. Ironically, it's Financial District that looks cheap. The buildings are nearly all boring white squares, and painting everything else red doesn't help either. And then there's the CGI. It's perhaps forgivable in the the District to emphasize its otherworldly nature, but when the art randomly swaps between 2-D characters and their CGI models (even during close-range shots) I've got to call it out. The CGI is poorly integrated, and given that C-C was released in 2011 it's just a bit too new for the 'Good for its time' excuse. Excellent aesthetic, but hit-and-miss art quality. Still, I enjoy just looking at this series.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong showing. The OP 'Matoryoshika' has a punk rock sound I really enjoy- I looked it up on YouTube, which is the second-highest level of praise I can give a song short of buying it. The soundtrack is solid and able to convey the tone well. The ED has a techno beat that isn't really a personal favorite genre of mine, but I can't say it was of low quality or didn't fit the series. Voice actors are very solid, J. Michael Tatum dominates just about every role he ever plays and here in C-C it's no exception, he can play 'suave but dangerous' with the best of them. Brina Palencina nails the Tsundere archetype beautifully, and Todd Haberkorn gives Kimimaro a good does of innocence and naivety. Funimation shows why there the poster boys for English dubs with this series.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nMeet Kimimaro, the world's least ambitious college student. His original goal of getting a guaranteed salary as a government bureaucrat and living thriftily with a wife and family doesn't exactly inspire cheers. I'm not saying those are bad goals by any stretch, but for a 19-year-old college student to hold them? From my experience even college students that know they're getting into careers with lower salaries are doing it for the love of what they would be doing. He just wants the sure money. This just seems like aiming low for aiming low's sake. He does get some development to explain why he might take the sure thing over the big gamble, but it still doesn't really inspire the audience. The highlight of the cast is batscat crazy Masakaki, his sheer lunacy and ability just teleport around at random makes him highly entertaining.  Character designs are overall good- I could definitely recognize Msyu and Masakaki if I saw them outside of this series, and the rest aren't bad either. Much like the plot however, the cast is around long enough for the novelty of their initial gimmick to wear-off, but not enough to create truly memorable or well-developed arcs.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nIt looks cool and has cool concepts, but takes itself too seriously (every time we visit the Real World we're reminded that Japan is in deep recession and everybody is struggling to get by, there are numerous reports of suicides and crimes- yes C-C is meant to be taken seriously) for its inconsistencies to be shrugged off. If C-C would just let you turn your brain off it would be much more enjoyable, but as it stands it wants you to keep it on, and when you do the faults start to really stick out. For max enjoyment you need to take C-C less seriously than it takes itself.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nWhat could have been a fun proxy tournament battle show or an intriguing financial thriller ends up not quite being either due to a failed attempt be both.  A large dose of 'cool' manages to keep C-C from being crap ( If thought this show was pure junk I would have let it have it) but if it had picked what it wanted to be it could have excelled in that area. C-C is like a company that tried to expand out of its core business and got burned. Enjoyable, and cool to look at and listen to, but the story attempted a risky merger that failed to excel.",

            "content": "To start with, this anime concept isn't quite what you're usually bond to see. It has so many in only 11 episodes and it is still not even nearly enough! Prepare to experience very odd romance thing, colorful yet so dark and creative world, incredible fights and big, BIG amounts of money included.\r\n\"C\" is very unique one, sometimes hard to understand, sometimes having different feelings and a pack of whole different genres included. It has so many hidden subliminal messages that you must watch every, even the smallest event. Every character is portrayed (in graphical, emotional and subjective means) like all the basic trends ahuman can act and coexist with anothers (there goes the first subliminal message of the anime). Though the economy part is pretty much nonsense, there's no need to be advanced in economy to get the facts and happenings though.\\n\\n\r\nBasically it is about the world made for money and of money, a bank created by gods/god (fuck, another subliminal message, but it's kind of revealed in the end). The users are picked up randomly and are given a creature called \"asset\" which helps user to win immense amounts of money. The fights are nicely odd, a game-like style; I'm even thinking they created or will create a game based on this anime. Fights can be picked randomly or by will, but the winning user may either completely destroy another one in financial terms as well as his future (asset) or create a lot less problems but win a lot less money. This is what's the most entertaining: a user has completely free will though he's required to fight or give out half of his funds. Moreover, an asset is the user's future in direct meaning of the word.\\n\\n\r\nNow the weak points of the anime. I didn't like how compressed the story was. They could have at least made 24-26 episodes, that'd explain a lot more, but whatever... Another weak point is the fights are very short and a bit repetetive - the protagonist uses way too much same moves. But at least the fights aren't boring because each and own asset is different (as well as the user). Also I myself didn't get some of the parts, maybe need to rewatch it, and the ending is too damn abrupt.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. OP is very well done in both graphical and sound parts. The art is astonishing, a perfect pleasure for eyes. The characters are well done, with a good thought and their looks are connected with their personalities as well as their assets. The story would be awesome, but the lack of episodes made it a bit hard to understand on some parts as I mentioned before and some parts which I'd find entertaining, interesting and useful are missing. But considering all pros and cons I think it's a great choice if you want to watch something COMPLETELY different than you already did. Highly recommended from me.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a strong 8/10, mostly because of the highly compressed and unfinished plot. Cheers.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: If you ever decide to watch the thing, I recommend [gg] group release, you'll find out why.",

            "content": "I really liked this show, regardless of what  others say. I thought this story was rather unique. It had to do entirely with the economy, and a part of which questioned morals. It touched upon the subject that in order to achieve what you want, in order to reach your goal, sometimes, more often then not, you will have to trample over someone to get there. In this particular case, you would trample over that someones future. The vagueness of this toll becomes apparent throughout the show, as you see just how variant the tolls are between all the people, though they are allfutures. I will say though, go into this doing some minor research on how economics works or just have a basic understanding of stocks, inflation, currency, shares, value, and how economies deal with private industry. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPretty unique if you ask me. Thats not to say that the characters, but this is the only show that I've seen that deals entirely on the economy and the effects on the character world. It may get confusing in some bits, but even an average joe should make it through the show understanding every concept and just what was being done when. Again, many moral questions are asked to the characters that (at least in one situation) you may find tantilizing. Aside from that, youve got the financial district in this weird otherworldy realm, where money must be made lest the district go bankrupt and...well, youll see.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nConsidering the year, and the shows that have been produced in the past, this art is average. Its not the art that makes the story though, so I dont weigh this too heavily in the score. Regardless, it could have been a lot better, but no complaints. I think it was fine as it was.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe op and ed  were okay. Not particularly exciting nor anything special to take note of. However, i think what got me crazy was the voices and the assurance you got when you heard the whole \"micro-mezzo-MACROflation\" and the whole \"you have gain\" or \"you are bankrupt\" thing. I really liked it, and i think it added extreme effect to what little thrill the fight scenes had. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis was by far the pillar that fell short in this show. And when i say fall short, i mean it barely made it off the ground. The characters where cliche and overused, especially the somewhat smart, poor, living-alone, hard-working, caring, but above all weakminded and loveless character, who didnt have the grapes to tell his childhood friend that he likes her (or so is presumed). Its a character used too many times by too many shows. It feels like this character is just jumping around from show to show with a different face but the same story. The character that really jumped and saved this section from like...a 4 was Masakaki. Just watch the show. You'll understand. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nI say watch it. Its short, and I think itll be a good watch. I know that this will definitely be a show ill remember for a good while.  It wasnt the greatest show in the world but i think that if anything its a better show then half of the crap that is being released today. BS shows like seikon no qwaser, which (because idiots will be idiots) got renewed for a second season are disgusting. There is no story, no plot. just boobs jiggling around for another painful season where, lets face it, if you notice the guy amidst the sea of boobs, ive got some news for you...",

            "content": "\"C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control,\" although quite the mouthful, was actually a pleasant surprise.  \r\nStory: 6\r\nThe premise is interesting and the writers have a lot of fun with it.  This is definitely a thinking show though.  It may have battles, but this is still intellectual stuff.  I applaud the writers for not spreading themselves too thin while taking on some pretty deep ideas in only an 11 episode show.  Sadly, even though it holds together well for the first 10 episodes, the last episode ended up being a mess that was a story failure.\r\nArt: 7\r\nBad stuff first,there is some pretty bad CG and the human characters are particularly unremarkable.  The half of the show that takes place in the real world is super blah art-wise, save for the main character's awesome jacket and pink shoes.  In the financial district however, things get interesting.  80% of the assets (monsters humans use to battle) are really cool, original designs and translate well into battles.  Little flourishes like substituting black money for blood work really well.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nBGM is decent, opening is meh, ending is good, but the star here is the voice acting.  A really great dub cast was assembled.  This is honestly one of the best overall dub casts I've heard.  I actually think the characters held up better because their actors sound so genuine.  Except for gold tooth guy.  He sucked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWith an 11 episode show that also has grand story ideas, it's hard to really dive into the characters, but the important ones were at least given a really good try.  Highlight is probably the main character, even though he became a little muddled near the end.  The relationship between the main character and his asset is interesting at points, but doesn't resolve very well.  I wish there could have been more with the main character and his love interest at the beginning, as well as more backstory and motivation for the secret agent girl.",

            "content": "Would you be willing to trade your future in order to better your situation today? What about the future of an entire nation? C is an opinionated take on this political (and philosophical) topic that is on everyone's mind thanks to mass media.\r\nI really had no idea what to expect from this series, a series about money and finance? Only minimally so. There exists a realm called the \"financial district\" in which people can bet their future as collateral in exchange for \"black money\", which looks like ordinary money to people not involved with the financial district. Members of the district, called entrepreneurs (or entrefor short), take advantage of this money for reasons ranging from personal gain to utilitarian purposes. Money is \"exchanged\" between entre through \"deals\", which are really battles with black money as hit points and bank cards that remind me of the pokemon/yu-gi-oh days. What is the catch? The fine print is that if an entre loses all their black money, they become bankrupt and the chaos bank that runs the financial district takes its collateral, the entre's future. Depending on the individual, this could have a catastrophic chain effect on the real world, up to and including the disappearance of people and entire nations.\\n\\n\r\nC is a funny watch, if just because of the ironic reference to the debt crisis of many nations in the early 2010s and the ridiculous usage of business terminology including attack names of assets (think a trainer's pokemon; and also a play on words). All in all, it was a fair watch that leads to some interesting philosophical questions, but also along with a lot of unanswered plot holes and questionable story elements. This is a fairly involved watch with a lot of dialogue and concepts to digest. It's very fast paced but won't be of interest to everyone. There's some action, a touch of romance, and a lot of politics and internal character conflict. That being said, those looking for good action or deep romance will be thoroughly disappointed. Not much real comedy here either unless you count the irony behind the whole theme.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is quite well done, though not without flaws. There's an interesting contrast between the normal world and the eerie, red-colored financial district. The characters are well drawn though some of the assets can only be described as bizarre. And Mashyu, well, it's pretty hard to draw her wearing anything less w/o putting this as an H series. Facial expressions are average and the main character tends to hide under his hoodie. The action scenes need better choreography as certain scenes deteriorate to flashes of colors clashing against each other, which is disappointing. Battles are typically won through using attacks of mass destruction such as \"overheated economy\"(*chuckles*). There is considerable blood/dismemberment though assets (and the buildings in the district) apparently have very rapid regeneration. There's a lot of CGI used such as flowing black money and when people disappear but these are done well and aren't distracting. Finally, what was Yoga thinking when he bought those shoes?\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNeither the OP nor the ED impressed me. The OP is a rock-based piece whereas the ED is a more minimalist light-rock piece. The BGM is also not very memorable, except for a piece in episode 10 after the OP. The most memorable part in this category would be the usage of English words and inclusion of English-speaking VAs (the kind I can understand w/o subs).\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs do a good job as this is a dialogue-heavy series. There are some scenes that require pausing as there is just too much sub to read/screen time. However, the secondary VA staff wasn't as convincing, though their performance is also less critical to the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe underlying theme in this series, and probably original concept, lies with money. What exactly is money? Is it a means to glory, a means to exert power, a form of trust? And underlying even money, what is really important in the world?\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, the world is in pretty poor shape with many countries on the verge of collapse. There are multiple groups trying to gain control of the financial district; most with reconcilable ideologies and means but an equivalent goal, to save the real world; not terribly off as a parallel to the US government as of July 2011. Yoga is thrown into this mess as a randomly-chosen entre. Whether by luck or some other unstated reason, he's saved by his strong asset and he soon is in contact with all the leaders of the multiple groups, all trying to influence him. What path will the college student, with a humble goal of an average life with an average family, choose?\\n\\n\r\nWhile C successfully creates a compelling setting in the early episodes, it leaves too many unanswered questions and elements. Certain relationships and elements are used early on in the show but not later on, when they would have been useful. As others have noted, the second half of this show felt rushed; the series should have been a bit longer. I also get this feeling from characters that had more explication than they needed considering their usage in the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of recycled elements from other shows used here leading to a predictable plot progression, which is not helped by an overly-revealing OP (skip it if you don't want to be spoiled). In all honesty the plot progression wasn't terribly good, and outright confusing at times near the end of the series. The climax is exactly what you'd expect it to be though calling the falling action brief is a huge understatement. It's not a very satisfying closure and leaves way too much unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nYoga is a poor guy. His parents are either dead or missing and he barely makes enough through two part time jobs to pay for his education and living expenses. Furthermore, his love interest has been stolen by a guy who has more money than him. Due to his past, he wants an average, secure life with an average family. However, unlike most average anime guys, he actually has guts and a willingness to take action. He's often suffering from internal conflict as he wrestles with multiple ideologies. While I wouldn't call this outright character growth, he eventually finds \"a\" path and sticks with it till the end. Assets are supposedly a personification of a person's future (not sure what it means when a person's future is a giant bee...), Yoga's asset Mashyu is unique in that she behaves much more like a human than other assets, to the extend of harboring feelings for her entre (though this aspect is underdeveloped).\\n\\n\r\nThe major shortfall in this series is the underdevelopment of the secondary characters; though it is true that many of them end up as victims of losses in the financial district, you never have a change to grow attached to them so their loss doesn't leave much of an impact. Finally, you don't get any final resolution as the falling action is just way too short.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis show is packed full of interesting political and philosophical questions, however the team should have paid a bit more attention to the actual execution. Certain elements are overused while other things are introduced but then never really utilized (stocks?). The plot line was predictable and supporting characters were beyond shallow. The show's primary redeeming characteristic is the irony of using \"black money\" to finance further debt and the concept that you can take something as unpredictable as the \"future\" as collateral, let me know if you find any bank that actually takes that. It is a decently enjoyable watch if you're willing to sift through the dialogue and terminology associated with the setting.",

A anime based around the concept of money which has never been done before makes it quite unique combined with the battle style of other anime.

The battle and action scenes are well done and is overall is an interesting.\r\nHowever the only problem is that the story felt rushed having only 11 episodes and couldhave been better if it had more.

We've all heard of the \"money doesn't buy happiness\" line and this anime takes an interesting spin on that idea.\r\nEnter the world of Yoga Kimimaro. It's Japan, and the economy is going down, real fast. So many people are suffering, and inevitably, people driven by their greed in desperate need of money will give up their future for money. And that's what the financial district is. \r\nA MIDAS financial district is connected to every area's economy. And like anything, nothing's free, even when it comes to \"free\" money. In order to earn MIDAS money, dealers,can earn millions, even trillions, but it comes at a cost. Every time Midas money enters, the future is lost.\\n\\n\r\nNow add in the antagonist, Mikuni. However, he's not all that evil. He's driven by good intentions, that we need to preserve the present in order for the future. He sees promise in saving \"today\", unlike Kimimaro, who tries to save the \"tomorrow\". Now, this is where I was conflicted. It was a good plot, most are bland, and are just like one choice is obviously correct, but here, it was a paradox. Saving today is just as important, right? Without today, there's no tomorrow. But having millions of futures dying is just as bad. SO HOW DO YOU BEAT THIS PARADOX?\\n\\n\r\nWatch the anime. There's your answer. Paradoxes are far more interesting to watch, and the art was ok and unique, not the familiar anime style we're used to. The characters were also pretty cool, considering the assets-(sort of like pokemon in a way) were your futures.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the unique storyline and as an 11 episode anime, it deserves more episodes. Definitely an anime worth checking out!",

            "content": "Now this show was a very unique take on the business world. Entrepreneurs (irl) are all just members of this crazy 'other world' which they bet their futures on winning in the 'deals' or fights. Definitely not what i was expecting an anime named C to be about.\r\nBut, onto the review: Bear in mind, I watched this all within a 24 hour timespan, so my review may be a bit off due to that.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nAs i stated before, this was a very unique story. I'm very happy about the pacing of the show, every episode seemed to pull you into the next; every episode settingup the next change; every episode bringing up new questions and awnsers. It actually was quite enjoyable to learn about this other world along with the MC. The love affair between MC and his 'asset' was not exactly the most unique, but served its purpose. The only reason I would rate the story NOT a 10 is because near the end, the story posed SO many questions yet never bothers to answer them or even hint at them. Then ultimate ending (while not bad) was somewhat predictable and was awful unfulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (because CGI)\\n\r\nWow, this show had some nice designs for characters. The humans, while not the prettiest, are each unique and designed typically with their character in mind, which I respect. The 'assets' are where the show really shines in its character designs. Each one was really unique and looked quite good. Everything in the financial district (while sometimes bland af) was really quite amazing to look at and had unique looks to it\\n\r\nEnvironments were not much to be talked about tbh, the 'real world' (not in financial district) locations were pretty cool, and the art over all was quite good, but the environments in and out of the real world seemed to always lack interest... IDK how else to explain it. \\n\r\nI understand this was made in 2011, but the CGI really, really, is just bad at times. Or rather, its not bad as in it looks 'bad' but rather sometimes makes the characters limbs and body act really oddly and fake. The CGI environment (which there was quite a bit of in the 'financial district') was.... meh.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is actually one of my favorite anime OST's. While some of the english lyrics to a couple songs are, without a better explanation, very japanese (and may not make sense), they are still pleasurable to listen to. I think a considerable amount of work was put into this OST.\\n\r\nVoice acting. Japanese i cant really say how good it was, due to me not speaking it, but I will comment on the english acting. There are portions where they lead to the IMF or UN for various story points, and each time the english voice acters seemed so lifeless. This could be because they want clear pronunciations for japanese viewers, but it is a point that must be touched on\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\r\nHonestly, the MC is forgettable and stereotypical to the isekai genre; the main villian is archetypal and pretty forgettable (Mikuni), honestly from the second he was introduced I could already predict he'd be the final boss (also the OP totally spoiled that for me, but thats OK); the MC's (first  -- second? idk even) girl (Mashu) throughout the series is probably the most developed character. The side villians had some potential, but ultimately the show skipped over them. The main 'good' side that wanted to destroy the 'financial district' (I think Satou?) was actually a decent character and her motivations were decently recognized.  Masakaki fulfilled his 'godlike' role in the series and did quite a good job while at it. Overall though, the MC's other love interest (maybe its my ship idk), Hanabi, really was underdeveloped and the creator seems to have tracked off from their original plan to force a relationship between Mashu and MC.\\n\r\nBasically DEVELOP THE CHARACTERS; MORE MORE MORE DEVELOP; DONT DEVELOP THE VILLIAN AND SIDE CHARACTERS MORE THAN MC.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character flaws can be overlooked, the bad cgi (at times) can be ignored. Ultimately this show had a really good premise, a nice art team, a dank sound team, but completely average character writers. In the end the majority of the issues I have with this show (beside characters) are really small",

            "content": "[My own notes]\r\nBefore I start, I'd like to say that I am not an anime enthusiast. In fact, I rarely have time to watch it, so my choice in anime is very important to me. If I don't like it, I'm quick to drop it, as is evident from my list. If I love it, I'll finish it quickly, but I rarely care enough to voice my opinion on it. That being said, it's somewhat impressive for someone like me to be moved enough to actually write an entire review about something. Take that however you want, but it's the truth.\r\nI will, however, say this:I don't write reviews often, but when I do, I'm very analytic. If you don't want to see this show broken down and dissected to bits and pieces before you've even had a chance to watch it, this is the wrong review for you. If you like that pragmatic, realistic approach to choosing what titles you watch, keep reading.\\n\\n\r\nWarnings aside, it's really difficult these days for an anime, book, show, movie, or any other form of storytelling for that matter to be original. It's a common complaint and I hear it a lot: there's no more originality. But there's actually a reason for this, and a point I've made many times to others: all the great ideas have already been used. It's all about rethinking these ideas and looking at them in a new light. To stand out nowadays you can't just be \"original\" in the sense that your particular blend of vampire/zombie/werewolf/harem/romance anime hasn't existed in the past, but rather that you can take that idea and make it into something entirely different, something that can't be compared to anything else. People will forget what the show's actually about, simply because your storytelling is so captivating. That's what modern storytelling is about. Take Steins;Gate for example. I know a lot of people didn't like it, but to me, it was an amazing show. There's nothing new about time travelers, paradoxes, conspiracies, moe, and romance, but the exact way that show put it all together, told the story, and developed the characters is what made it so great. And there's nothing new about action, mystery, conspiracy, and \"morality\" shows either, but C has found a way to make it new regardless. It takes the idea of a super power running things from behind the scenes and turns it into something awesome. The fact that such an old combination of topics and genres could be so enthralling is the reason why I've decided to write this review, and I hope that you too will soon see why as well.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story - 8]\\n\r\nThe story is typically the most important part, so I'll start there. When I wrote this review, I wasn't done watching the series yet, so I have a different perspective than most reviewers. \\n\r\nFrom my angle, I'm using my past experiences to try and figure out how exactly things are going to pan out. The plot is more or less obvious at this point, though I won't say exactly what it may be. I've watched a lot of different types of anime and TV shows, and can usually spot that professional touch that certain writers have that lets you know it'll have an actual ending. I see that here, and so my hopes are high for this one.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it's nothing too original. Broke university student trying to live a normal life. We all can relate to that, and I'm sure that's why the writer chose this character. Why does it matter that we can relate? Because I feel the writer isn't just telling a story, but is trying to warn us of something, or convey a moral. I can't tell exactly what yet, but that's the vibe I'm getting. I generally like these types of shows.\\n\r\nThe reason I point that out is because it shows the integrity behind the story. Though it may twist, turn, and fall off into different side paths, it still has a single theme tying it all together, and that's what keeps the plot moving. In a way, it could be compared to the episodic nature of Cowboy Bebop, though the over arching story line is definitely prevalent in the filler-less series of C. While Bebop never seemed to have a definite plot up until the end, there was still a sense that everything was happening for a reason (aside from the fillers) throughout the entire series. That's what I get here: no definite plot yet, but there's definitely one developing.\\n\\n\r\nMoving forward, the story unfolds much like any other. First we're introduced to the grand stage: Midas, the Financial District, and Deals. We also see the consequences of Bankruptcy, and how one enters into the game to begin with. Then we're introduced to our main character, who of course enters into the game, and is thrown into this mad world of money and power with little to no clue as to what is happening. He is saved by his apparently experienced partner, called an Asset, who helps guide him through life in the Financial District. \\n\\n\r\nNot too bad, a couple cliches, but enough originality to keep things interesting. To be honest, cliches are actually okay to me. Just like tools in a toolbox, different plot elements are used to accomplish different tasks. When things go wrong is when inexperienced writers (much of today's manga writers, honestly) use the wrong element in the wrong place, making things seem awkward or forced. A good writer can take all cliches and make it feel natural to fit them together, or choose to use no cliches at all. Just like a mechanic picking and choosing which tools to use on a particular car, an experienced writer knows exactly when and where to place certain elements. And just like an experienced driver can take leisure with his driving style, choosing one or the other at will with little to no reason needed to do so, a good writer can quickly and naturally shift between different writing styles with no difficulty at all. C's writer is evidently good at what he does, since some of the cliches are self-evident when thinking about it, none of them jump out and interrupt the natural flow of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs our friend finds his way through this new world, we get to see how he handles the changes to his daily life, as well as to himself. While I haven't seen how everything pans out yet, it's only natural to make some assumptions. So far from what I've seen though, I must give the story an 8. Why an 8, and not a 9 or a 10? Because while the writer is great and experienced, he fails to bring out some of the more interesting aspects of the story, and struggles at some points to develop the plot properly. However, it's my own impression that this is more a fault of the adaption process than anything else. Even turning a straight screenplay into a TV show requires sacrifices, though sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between honest mistakes and oversights.\\n\\n\r\nWhy an 8, and not a 6 or a 7? Because this anime does well one thing many others fail to: it takes advantage of its medium. This was also one of the notable features of Bakemonogatari, and one of the reasons that I liked that show. C uses its animation to explain a lot about the story that would have otherwise needed to be told in monologue. One thing that stood out to me in particular were the dialogues people had with their Assets, with the words to the left or right of the screen. While it added no new information, it was a nice touch that emphasized that these conversations were important to the viewer. Other such things were the usage of visuals to convey emotions. While this may better fall under the Animation category, I still believe it's important to the story to know how the characters feel. Also, many anime would have shouting matches, introspective arguments, or nervous breakdowns at this point, with the emotional characters spouting nonsense and generally being melodramatic. While good in some cases, this is obviously a side effect of the manga adaption process, where writers try not to throw out much dialogue and choose instead to sacrifice screen time in order to explain things that could've just as easily been explained in images.The fact that C, which I don't actually think was adapted, didn't fall into this trope (it's a common trope in anime, and even straight-to-anime stories fall into traps like these) really impressed me. Will there be such scenes further on? I don't know yet, and my rating might change depending on the outcome. For now, though, this is what I think.\\n\\n\r\nObviously a number of other things influenced my rating, but those were the major points.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 7]\\n\r\nThis show uses a very interesting art style. It tries to blend together 3D and 2D seamlessly, but doesn't quite pull it off. It's not jarring by any means, so I don't believe it detracts from the enjoyment at all, but it's still noticeable. Ever play Borderlands? The 3D characters look kinda like that, while the 2D characters look like your standard anime companions. It's unusual, but again, it's not bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the drawn art, it's above average. The colors they use, the emphasis they place on certain character's features, and the backdrops all help to add to the atmosphere the show is trying to build. The line art isn't perfect, but continues to improve over the course of the series, hinting that it's a budget issue and not laziness on part of the studio. That, to me, is always the most important factor when rating art. If the studio is doing the best they can, I feel no reason to degrade them for the quality they produce. They're simply working with what they have, and usually it turns out good.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did notice, and the reason why I only rated a 7, is the 3D environments. At some times, it's good, seamlessly blended in with the 2D characters. At other times, it's pretty bad, obviously standing out and being a nuisance. The textures are the most noticeable problem: from a distance, they look fine, but up close, they blur unnaturally. Either they simply didn't take the time to make good textures, or they didn't bother to rent decent computers to do the rendering. However, I will note that the 3D quality increases dramatically during fight scenes, making them very pleasing to watch. This is a good plus for me, and while I wish they'd focused more on ambient scenery as well, it saves the rest of the show from looking too bad.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the 3D, the color palette they chose was beautiful. Stark, desaturated colors contrasted with bright, vibrant colors to create an amazing landscape inside the Financial District while the outside world is dark and gloomy, reflecting the overall atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character emotions, as I mentioned before, they did a great job. Body language flows naturally, dialogue scenes actually have movement, and facial expressions do a good job of conveying what they are feeling.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the art is above average, and so I give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 8]\\n\r\nAs with most shows, sound isn't something considered too important. Bad sound stands out and just makes things unenjoyable, but good sound is fairly easy to do so it's considered an expectation rather than a luxury. As for this show specifically, the sound quality was great. The wide range of noises and effects they used help contrast different scenes and convey the temperament of the characters. The background music was appropriate and the intro and outro songs - while something I don't typically pay attention to - were actually something other than J-Pop and enjoyable to listen to. They also did a good job of setting the mood for the series, which is always a plus.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, they did a great job orchestrating this series, and so I must give them an 8. Why no 9? Because while good, the music and sound effects weren't outstanding, but they did exceed my expectations, and so they are above average.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 7]\\n\r\nThe characters in this series don't seem to get much attention. Background and personal history are lightly touched upon just enough so that we can understand their motivations and personalities. In a way this is nice, as too much character development prevents the plot from developing if the plot doesn't center around characters, which it typically doesn't in an action show. Some characters have 2D motivations, but most have good - and multiple - reasons for the things they do, and the way they act. \\n\\n\r\nAs for character interactions - something many reviews seem to gloss over in favor of talking about \"Development\" - the dialogues are quite natural and well written. Characters go into conversations with clear cut goals and reasons and no time is really wasted on nonsense. Some idle talk is heard here and there, but only enough to convey a sense of casualness in scenes where it's appropriate. The writer seems to remember a bit from General Education, as he makes good use of the RMO dialogue method, \"Reason - Motivation - Outcome\". As I've said before, it's more important to focus on the type of media being used rather than what the original story was supposed to be. RMO is for film and animation, and DDRAC (\"Discuss, Decide, Review, Act, Casual\") is for books and manga, which spare much more room for dialogue. The fact that the writer used the proper dialogue method is great, because it means we don't get entire episodes full of nothing but dialogue, or fight scenes where the characters don't actually fight but instead talk about their deepest darkest secrets and motivations.\\n\\n\r\nFor character development, we do see a good amount of it. While some characters are static (and they should be - some characters are simply meant to be staples for the main characters to work with) many - and especially the protagonist - do change over the course of the series. Some people confuse development with envelopment - that is, the difference between seeing a character develop, and learning about a character that's already developed or a character's past. We don't really see much history in this show, but we do see a lot of active development, which is really what we should be seeing.\\n\r\nThink about it: when was the last time you went through a chapter in your life, constantly talking and wallowing over the last chapter? If that's really how you handled it, it probably wasn't very exciting, and wouldn't have made for a great story. The point of a story is to tell of a person or group of peoples' journey through a particular period, not to reflect on what happened before that, unless it's naturally relevant to the story. So in that regard, the writer again did a great job.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 9]\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment for this series was high. While there isn't too much to analyze about enjoyment - it's purely a subjective experience - I can say it was mostly the story itself and the characters involved. Most of the characters were interesting and seemed real enough, despite their unusual circumstances. The story was well paced and the plot developed smoothly. Those two things interacted in such a great way that it managed to keep me captivated throughout each episode, and always left me wanting to see what happens next. The other factors - art and sound - while neither being outstanding - were good enough to provide a solid backbone for everything else to play out, which is what I think the developers wanted us to see.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall - 8]\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a great show. It's fairly abstract, intellectual, and not exactly groundbreaking, but still original enough to be considered new. It's dumbed down enough so that the masses can enjoy it too, and it's got its bright moments that really make you scratch your head and think. It's got a bit of philosophy, a bit of action, and a bit of conspiracy, and not too much of any one element. It emphasizes its strong points and does good to compensate for its weaknesses. The writer and studio both played their cards right with this one and it came out great.",

            "content": "What do you choose, the future, or the present?\r\n*contains spoilers*\r\n**very long and in depth review, so bear with me**\r\nGuess i finally reached it - the point where i can review this anime with full understanding... And it only took me like what, 4 years to get the knowledge to be able to do so after my initial view of it? \r\nSo yeah, as you understand, it isn't your average nut and takes some special tools (mainly proper understanding of economics, the worldwide economy model and Japanese economy in particular) to crack and get to the core.\r\nSo then since i mentioned that, its easier to startwith the negatives, since there are very few of them so it won't take long. First of all, i consider the fact that its so unavailable as a minus, since a person without the proper understanding of what i mentioned above will lose a lot of the meanings behind the actions, and some of what's going on. I consider it a slight minus since it takes away from the availability of the show, and the audience enjoyment and appreciation of it if watched unprepared. The other minus about it is that 3d graphics are often used, and sometimes make things look a tad awkward... Also there are a few things story wise that don't satisfy me since they go to waste and could be used to strengthen the symbolism and anime's message. And my final problem with the anime is the lack of the 12th episode (at the very least) that would allow to expand on the important scenes a little, and perhaps make the ending a tad more satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, i think the anime is next to perfect. From the likable and colorful characters (especially the main assets), to the story, art and even sound, its all pretty brilliantly put together to immerse the viewer and not just for the fun of watching, but also as a word of warning and enlightenment on what is the world and its current state from an economical view point. Through the metaphors and the perhaps slightly exaggerated events, C points out the dangers of the world we live in as an economical unit (individual) and even as countries as a whole, using the magical influence of the alternate universe of the district on the real world to draw exaggerated pictures of economical catastrophes and their direct effect on individuals. \\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nThe story mainly deals with two people, who in turn represent two different life styles and their matching economical strategies (oddly enough those could even be projected into politics and political approaches, but i won't go there since it will take too much time and will probably cause some flaming, but feel free to make the parallels yourself)... Note that none of the two is portrayed as the \"right\" one, as each has its pluses and minuses, and both of the characters are portrayed as heroic and positive.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off - Mikuni Souichirou. Previously a rebellious rocker that quit that dream of his because he understood that he won't be able to sustain himself with that profession, leading to the breaking up of his band before a major contract was established. He moved to become the adviser for his father who owns a large company. His father puts the said company before everything, leading to unavoidable neglect of his son Mikuni and daughter Takako, and when an economical crisis strikes, he chooses his company over funding a low chance surgery in America for his daughter, leading to her death. This event is what forms, and finalizes Mikuni's personality.\\n\\n\r\nMikuni is understandibly furious over this, and after becoming a very successful Entr\u00e9 uses the money to buy out his father's company - the thing he cares about the most as a form of vengeance. Later, after noticing the effect Midas money is having on reality, he forms the Mukudori Guild that is directed to minimizing those harmful effects, and throws everything he has at that cause, hoping to help people in the here and now (which is the ideology he adopted after the death of Takako, for the obvious reason that she needed immediate help), even while disregarding their future and his own along with his very life (as seen in the end where he sacrifices fractions of his lifespan and eventually even his whole life to print money). \\n\\n\r\nHis asset is resembling his sister and contains her soul (as seen in the end), and he is shown to care for her even as an asset, probably guessing, or feeling the truth at some level. She is shown to eat exclusively black Midas bills, further symbolizing the fact she needed money in the here and now to survive, no matter what the cost and origin of that money was, strengthening Mikuni's ideology. Since assets are said to represent an Entr\u00e9's future, the fact she looks like Mikuni's sister Takako who is long dead, can be also taken as a hint that he has no future.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nThe second character and the protagonist is Yoga Kimimaro, an orphan that lost his father who was also an Entre to the financial district after he went bankrupt there and was probably forced to hang himself, or did so to protect his son from the effects of the district. The death of his mother isn't explained, but was probably linked to her husband going bankrupt in the financial district as well.\\n\\n\r\nKimimaro is a student at a financial university (and that somewhat ironic since the anime deals with economics, plus a little odd since his knowledge of economy is never brought up later, making it somewhat pointless to make that as his background), and works two part time jobs hurting his studies somewhat (some sources say he's a scholarship student, but i don't believe it since he barely can make ends meet even with the two jobs, and is shown to make nearly no personal expenses, to the point he can't allow himself to go out with friends, and is mostly forced eat cup Ramen).\\n\\n\r\nBeing an orphan and probably wanting nothing more than a family (having been raised by his aunt), he overworks himself and disregards his present (though that is not directly stated, but shown from his hard work and control of expenses), hoping for a stable job in the that will allow him to support his future self and family. After being lured in (and somewhat tricked) by a small sum of money and ending up as an Entr\u00e9, he quickly shows promise and catches Mikuni's eye by defending his asset which is apparently a rare act that Mikuni himself was recorded doing before, and reminding him of his younger self later. He takes a liking to him, even to the point he plans to make him his heir in the future. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, after witnessing and being shocked by the catastrophic consequences the financial district has on reality, Kimimaro accepts Mikuni's system of minimizing the impact on Midas money on reality and help protect people's present by joining his guild, however, soon the true meaning of Masakaki's (the jester like being that guides Entr\u00e9's) words is witnessed - right in front of him, children (that represent the future, obviously) disappear off the street and other people instantly lose their future in the forms of their jobs and homes, even whole businesses and buildings vanish when a large sum of Midas money is printed in order to sustain the people in the here and now. It is at this point Kimimaro's personality is formed and finalized - he decides to protect the future instead of the present, leading to his duel with Mikuni. \\n\\n\r\nKimimaro's asset is Mashyu, and since assets are said to represent an Entr\u00e9's future, she is speculated to be his daughter but it is uncertain and somewhat awkward if it would really be the, given their slightly romantic relationship in the anime. Another speculation on my part is that she may be Kimimaro's unborn sister (since his father seemed to have had a similar asset, and bankruptcy in the district WAS shown to lead to make children disappear from existence, and that, again, may have been the reason his father hanged himself, to prevent his son from vanishing as well), although again, the romantic relationship makes it somewhat unlikely, but not impossible. The anime's ending also brings something sort of unusual to the table - a vision of japan without the yen (every price is in dollars since Kimimaro helped devalue the yen in order to destroy the local Midas money district that was based off of said yen, and bring, bargain, or buy everyone's futures back), what normally you'd think the Japanese pride would never allow to imagine...\\n\\n\r\nOverall i think C is an excellent anime and a must watch for all those who have the required knowledge to process it, and maybe even those without it, since i did enjoy the anime on my first view even though i missed a lot of what is mentioned above.",

Throughout the anime there are some keywords: \"Future\" , \"Present\" , \"Midas bank\" , \"Bankrupt\" , \"Assets\" and \"Deal\". \r\nIn this anime there are different aspect of \"Future\" and \"Present\" . Which one is more important? The main characters are fighting for what they think is right. \"Deal\" is something more of a battle where your \"Assets\" which is your \"Future\". This \"Deal\" is compulsory. It will occur every week, it is 1 V 1. The \"Deal\" will end it the person, not \"Asset\" is\"Bankrupt\". Which means they use money to battle, the more the person is injured, the lesser the person have. \\n\r\n If you lose in a \"'Deal\" your \"Future\" will be gone. They will literary disappear. Which means that IF you are a very influential person in the reality, your \"Future\" will be gone and it has a very huge impact on the society. Hence a balance is needed.\\n\r\nThat's all what i understood about this anime.  Up to this point, the plot seems interesting right? But NO, in the later episode nothing goes in to my head. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (5/10)\\n\r\nReally nothing special. It's just normal. But i do hate the design of character where the face is weird and limbs too. The limbs are too skinny and long which i find it irritating and unrealistic. Although i know the fact that this IS anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (6/10) \\n\r\nThis songs are alright. But i do like the ending song a bit. As when the ending song comes, there is this \"Epic\" kind of feeling which ends the episode. But i just like the first few seconds of it. So, nothing special in particular. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nI find the main character Kimimaro irritating. Why? First few episode i thought of him as \"Nao Kanzaki\" from \"Liars Game\". They both seriously have a loose screw in their brains. They are too naive. It really piss me off. I will not give example as it will spoil you. \\n\\n\r\nNext \"Masyu\" or \"Msyu\" the \"Assets\" of Kimimaro. It is stated that \"Assets\" will recover from injuries very fast but they will still feel the pain from 'Deals\". But when she have her hands, legs and body slashed she could still battle. Seriously what is this... I know this is \"Super power\" anime but since   the \"Asset\" is already badly injured where in the earth she got the power to win the \"Deal\" . \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (5/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime for the first half. But then it started to get more and more complicated. Which i really have know idea what is going on. But still, i survived. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (5/10)\\n\r\nIt is good for the first half only. Second half is as complicated as a maze. But try to watch it! Despite the fact that the second half is boring and complicated , the first half is really interesting and unique. \\n\\n\r\n*** Take note that what i've written is just a part of the anime. I did not wrote in detail. For more details, go watch it.\\n\\n",

It's a strange combination blend that somehow worked. \r\n- The music and art reminds me of the older Anime style, which was very nostalgic. The character designs are plain with the exception of Masakaki, the mysterious host of the Financial District. However, the setting of the FinancialDistrict had a very artistic feel that Salvador Dali would have felt comfortable in. \\n\\n\r\n- Mikuni Souichirou and Yoga Kimmimaro had the most character development. Kimmimaro was always searching for an answer and a way. On the surface, he seemed like a lost boring character, but that's why he's a philosopher and why he was able to develop. Watching Kimmimaro and Mashu (his Asset) interact was entertaining. I also found myself paying close attention to Masakaki since he's the ticket into understanding what the Financial District really is.\\n\\n\r\n- Despite not understanding how the battle system worked (I don't think the writers understood it either) and the other majority of things left unanswered, neglected, or misunderstood; in the end, it was enjoyable which is all that really matters.",

As someone who would gladly escape the real world for anime, I thoroughly engaged with [i]C[/i]'s fictional economics. Now, if only real life were as simple as blowing up your rival entrepreneurs with giant laser beams.\r\nLet me start with the fight scenes. They are sometimes too short, but always feature fluid and detailed animation. You will get your freaking laser beams of death. In addition, a good quantity of blood gets spurted, so make sure you're ready for some gory action. The main problem is, to reiterate,the fight scenes are too short. One fight scene even ends halfway, and the viewers never get to see the outcome. Way to skimp your fanbase!\\n\\n\r\nStill, the art is decent. Not too extravagant or colorful, and a little bit shady.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest point of this anime is probably character development. Kimimaro, the main character, has none of it. Mikuni, the main antagonist, has none either. Mashu, Kimimaro's fighting \"asset\", becomes a little bit more human, but not really. If these people weren't blasting themselves half to death with cute little girls, I wouldn't have been able to forgive such pathetically written characters.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the overarching story makes up for character deficiencies. While simplistic, [i]C[/i] deals with the monetary debate between present and future. Should we give money to those who need in the present, or save up money for a better future? An interesting question to ask, and many of the entrepreneurs give different responses based on their experiences. And while they engage each other in deadly duels, their actions have negative consequences on the real world. You can't help but feel very sorry as the stories of those affected by greedy entrepreneurs are fleshed out in full detail. With both philosophical and emotional elements, the story of [i]C[/i] should be enough to satisfy most viewers.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the ending sucks. Enjoy the anime!",

            "content": "Every season, I can always find an anime that fits into the \"great everything, fail story\" category. For the Spring 2011 season, it was this. \r\nSTORY:\r\nNope, I don't think [C] was originally planned for more than 11 episodes and cut short eventually, just to let some of the supporters of the show know. The writers themselves should have known that anime in the noitaminA slots, for the past few years, have always been 11 episodes long (what a strange number). \r\nSo what contributed to the subpar story quality of the series? Lack of proper planning. The writers were too ambitious and tried to incorporate toomany things into such a short span of time at once without thinking how are they going to write all of them out. And what do the audience receive at the end? A show with a magnificent setting but bad pacing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I am not kidding here. The first few episodes were indeed good, the flow of the story was smooth and make you want to watch more and more. But came the infamous Episode 8, where one of the protagonist of the series suddenly turned to the evil side and the story was suddenly rushed. Most of the loose ends earlier in the series were not explained, a lot of time was devoted to the 'main plot' which started from that episode and left viewers with a big question mark on their heads at the end of Episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nUNLESS, and I say unless, that the writers are planning to pull a Eden of the East on us and make a movie expansion to explain everything in this 'social commentary + Yu-Gi-Oh' series. I would probably forgive them for these loose ends then. But judging by the ending in Episode 11, it would be difficult to elaborate more on the story anymore.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNeed I say anymore about this? Oh, I shall then.\\n\\n\r\n[C] has probably the most fail story of all anime in 2011, but its art is probably the best of the year. Msyu's attacks, the skyscrapers of Tokyo, even every inch movement of the convenient shop colleague who our main protagonist works with, were animated with great effort. Not to mention the awesome CGI that keeps the battle scenes rolling on. It keeps me wondering how the hell did the sponsors come up with the animation budget...\\n\\n\r\n...until the very end when I realized that they sacrificed the money from the screenwriter part for this. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAgain, [C] shines at this. I particularly love those few soundtracks used during the battle scenes. Made the tension during the duels even more nerve-wracking. The OP and ED, not to brag, are really superb. \\n\\n\r\nYay for Haruka Tomatsu as Msyu too. Her voice acting deserves a mention.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThroughout the whole series, the only characters who really had any development were Msyu and Kimimaro. Oh, you may argue that they are the main characters and deserved more development, but mark my words: devoting all the time for main characters and none for the supporting ones is normally not a very good idea. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's proven. The other characters had so much potential to be great characters, but were shoved away at the very end. Soichirou, for instance, was doing nothing until Episode 7, when we finally see a bit of his backstory, and at Episode 8, when he had a bit of development at least. But that only lasted for 3 episodes. The blonde chick was another fail example. She was also doing nothing until Episode 10. Heck, need I mention my favorite character Masakaki? He could have made such a good antagonist!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI won't force you not to watch the series if you want to watch it, but for me, [C] is an anime that I would probably recommend it to those who were only watching it for the art and the music. Let's hope that the writers would know better what to do next time when they are planning a new anime series.",

That could lead to a disaster, by the time the main characters understood this it was almost too late. The anime was depressing for me but it reminded me about the heavy price we must pay for our decisions. My advice - next time you make a decision think aboutit carefully, you must not  live for the moment, tomorrow may be your last day or it may be not it depend on your decisions that's what the anime had in mind.",

That be said, the creators did, in fact, accomplish what they had set to achieve.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe biggest factor that helped this anime is the story. Now, how many anime do we see that revolve around financial matters that could destroy the world? Not many. The story has a solid background and a defined structure. However, some elements were left out of the plot line, although they are implied (How exactly is Mashyu the main character's future? A suggestion as to what shemeans/will be is implied).

            "content": "While still watching this anime I was tempted to give it a 10 just because other people have rated it so poorly. \r\nNow I know I am right to give it a 10.\r\nThe first episode wasn't too convincing, I wasn't too sure what was happening. Ep 1 is also the reason why I rate the art with 9. The backgrounds look nice and I've nothing to complain about those but the characters really needed more details. They look like they are cut-out from some other anime. Or they just don't blend in. other than that, they are okay and look quite pleasant.\r\nI'm not going tomake a summary since I consider MyAnimeList already did that, I'm just gonna give some reasons to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea is absolutely original and personally I enjoyed it a lot: the whole series is a metaphor for the market and economy; the market is a battleground, the rich people always win while the poor struggle for their lives.. In this case, the battleground is the Financial District, a sort of parallel reality to the real world, where the Entrepreneurs (our characters) fight against each other, helped by their Assets (cute fairies with superpowers). Theor money, future and present life is at stake. This is why I think they done a great job setting motivation for the characters in this anime. I mean we've seen a lot of war/military/SF series where people just fight against each other just because they are \"enemies\", they take sides, they hate each other. Well in [C] things aren't really like that, while in appearance they fight just for money and they don't really die, if they lose, depending on the amount they lost in battle, things do happen in their real lives. They are driven in duels because of greed. And I guess that is a very nice parallel between FInancial District and real world: greedy people get blinded, risk everything and lose. They sell their soul basically and the need to make more and more money enslaves them to a system that they can't afford to let go of.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose not all age ranges can be entertained by such a theme as money and economy. You do need to take your time watching this and try to see behind scenes. The characters don't really develop but that is not really necessary here: I think the idea still is that of a metaphor, every character represents something. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding this, I have to say that this time, picking an average ollege student as main character is not really a cliche, it's simply the best choice there is if you want to picture the situation: he doesn't yet have a future, he needs to pick a side, to decide what he wants to do further in life. He has to be the aggressive one because he must find his path. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is related.The relation between Kimimaro and Msyu reflects upon what the asset actually has to be to an entrepreneur: taking care of your resources is the best way to fight your way to the top. Financial District is the place where is better to be safe than sorry. Every character, in this respect, has its own way of fighting and I think that is great: I've never actually seen different fighting strategies developed for characters depending on their pattern anywhere else. It's a good action anime but if you don't take the time to read behind the lines I guess this is not for you.",

            "content": "WARNING: This review is going to be really boring. \"Why?,\" you ask. Because [C] is really boring, and it's boring to talk about. I can get excited over a good thing because I can find creative ways to express my like for it. I can get excited over a bad thing because I can think of different ways to tell it to eat the ass-end of a north-bound cow. However I can't get excited over [C] because of how fucking boring it is. You have been warned, so don't complain about that if you're going to.\r\n[C] is about a kid named Yoga, who gets transportedto an alternate dimension after accepting a mysterious cash fund in his bank account. In this alternate dimension, he has to fight different people in order to secure his future, which the dimension has as collateral. Every other fighter there does so as well, making this a fight to secure Japan's future as a whole. Each victory or loss has an adverse effect in the real world. As he battles, it becomes apparent that all is not what it seems to Yoga, and different people have different ideas about how to manipulate this dimension to affect theirs.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with this story is that it's not original at all. What it is is a Frankenstiened mess of other anime; most notably Death Note, Serial Experiments Lain, and Soul Eater. From Death Note, we a get a moral dilemma tailored in a similar fashion, only handled so poorly that we don't know entirely what it's asking until the very end of the series. From Lain, we get an alternate dimension that controls the real world, only less awesome because the impact left on the real world is known from the start and the way they raise the stakes at the end is laughable at best. From Soul Eater, we get a fighting system with someone at your side that's humanoid but not actually human that acts as your weapon, but less cool each battle is boring and predictable. The staff even know that because one of the battles cuts off in the middle of it and they declared Yoga the winner because they couldn't think of a way for Yoga to predictably win it. Aside from making the aspect that they stole from each anime pathetic, the idea that these three anime can mix together is not a solid one. I can see someone connecting Death Note and Lain, but adding Soul Eater into the mix is just ludicrous. These three anime are so different from each other it doesn't make sense to mix them all up; But, if you're determined to do so, don't string them onto a boring plot that thinks it's better than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story is one that's been done before and better. An under dog-type character finds himself in an odd situation and begins to rise through the ranks, which is seen by the characters in it as shocking and which isn't seen by me, because I dosed off five minutes in. That is the entire extent of the plot, except when it tries to be deep. I say \"tries\" because each \"deep situation\" is bland as hell and something people could see coming from miles away. Most of it talks about about how this dimension is affecting the real world, and when I say \"talks\" I mean \"drones on pointlessly, while alienating the audience.\" I know Darker than Black did something similar, but the universe in that set up in is in some way interesting and has a colorful cast of characters, which links me neatly to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat of a paradox. They're incredibly bland and uninteresting, but to the degree where they're so bland they're unforgettable. Yoga is the under dog hero of the anime, who stumbles around the series, trying to decide which moral side to take. His fighting partner is Mysu. Her role consists of bitching to Yoga and harboring a secret crush on him. The main villain is Mikuni, not that they want you to know that. The series tries to hide that fact very clumsily. His fighting partner is Q, a stoic character that hardly talks, probably in fear that whatever she says has to come from the same snooze-worthy script that everyone else's dialogue comes from. Other characters include a pessimistic teacher, a secret agent girl, an information broker with gold teeth, and a few others I can describe in whole using simple terminology. The only two interesting characters are Masakaki, who works for the alternate dimension, looks like the nephew of The Count from Gankutsuou, and consistently has fun in his own little way, and Sennoza, a rich charity worker, who's incredibly strong and tries to make the script more interesting. Seriously, the rest of the characters sound like their actors knew this was going to be boring going in and didn't even bother (I watched it subbed, by the way). These characters as a whole though are just as bland as the plot, except Mysu who is annoying as hell, and I would sooner leap from The Eiffel Tower than consider her likeable in any way shape or form.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's bland as well. For the alternate dimension, it looks like they tried to fix the artwork of Gankutsuou and fucked it up. At least Gankutsuou's art look interesting in some way and had some feeling behind it. The art here looks like it was made by a robot programed to make something interesting without any reference material at all. The real world artwork also looks boring, but without any specific thing to rip off of, so it looks like that robot's programing was set to \"generic.\" Still, the artwork here is just boring and not smug, like the story, or annoying, like the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also generic as hell. Uninteresting in every way. Even the opening theme, which is by Nico Touches the Walls, the group that did the second opening for FMA: Brotherhood, which was an awesome song. What happened here? Did you guys agree to make a generic song for the anime, or did you look at the anime and make a song to match? My money's on the latter. Still, there is one saving grace for the music, the end theme. It's bye the same people that did the end theme for Eden of the East, another great theme, and this group decided to take the Sennoza route and tried to make the series interesting. As it stand though, the music is the least bland part of the series only because of that.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry that I've been repeating myself, calling [C] boring, bland, generic, uninteresting and such. It's just that there's no other way to describe the series. However, if I talk about the end, that might give me some wiggle room in my vocabulary. So, Spoiler Alert here. If you don't wish to be spoiled, just skip to the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe Death Note styled moral dilemma centers around the choice of living for today or living to live again tomorrow. This is an interesting concept, but it doesn't come up until very late in the series, as I've mentioned before. It doesn't get addressed until the fate of Japan is at stake, which is a sloppy way to raise the stakes, which I've also mentioned before. The last few episodes of [C] have plot points that fly past faster than a caffeine addict in a race car and are never explained, and things begin to happen for no reason. Or maybe there is a reason, I just didn't pay attention to the boring dialogue long enough to make it coherent. This is all in effort to make [C] look tough and edgy enough to play with the big boys in the anime crowd. A hopeless effort I might add, because it makes it look incredibly silly and not serious at all. The ending of [C] is rather bullshit. It resets itself so that it leaves off where it began, and no effort has been made to offer some form of closure. I guess that was a little more interesting, but not by much. It was worth trying anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [C] is just an extremely boring anime with less substance than an empty jar. It thinks too highly of itself and is unoriginal in almost every way. It's not a bad anime though, just very inorganic. Something that you could make by putting a bunch of better anime into a blender and mix in some sludge. Don't watch it, unless you are suffering from insomnia is basically what I'm saying. 4/10",

However, the 11 episode limit here is what really limits the potential for this anime as a whole, where there simply wasn\u2019t enough time to fully explore the characters and setting. The results of this lack of time was a poorly executed pacing and a lot of dangling plot lines that have yet to be resolved.\r\nThe main thing that really catches your attention towards the beginning is the setting. The creators placed atremendous focus on the mysterious Financial District, and did a great job at building and fleshing out the setting. There was a sense of exoticness to the setting, with the rules and regulations to the battles and such rather intriguing at times.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this explicit focus on the setting pulled away a lot of screentime from the characters, leaving behind a cast of characters that are really bland and difficult to sympathize with. Seriously, Kimimaro remained a passive onlooker until the very end, Jennifer got little to no development until the last two episodes of the series, any mentioning of Kimimaro\u2019s father just disappeared, and Souichiro\u2019s mentioning of the conflict between different factions in the district (starlight guild vs whatever) completely vanished into thin air. The only real character worth noting here is Mikuni Souichiro, and even he ended up not doing anything exceptional for this series.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, [C] was a series that was just too outright ambitious. It had a lot, and a lot, of interesting ideas and a well built setting. However, the serious lack of time in being able to flesh out these aspects to the show is what caused this series to falter.\\n",

I think a good way to sum up this anime is as an analogy for real life. It has a great story, appealing artwork, and interesting characters. I think it could have done with more episodes but achieved a lot in the few it had.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story hooked me before anything else, while steadyish of pace and riddled with financial jargon, it iscaptivating and had me eager for more. If you are to watch this make sure to stay focused as it would be easy to miss important parts that would be detrimental to your viewing experience. While not really an issue I feel I should point out that the story ends rather abruptly and in my opinion it deserved more episodes. More romance and action scenes would well received.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a little bit different to what I am used to but there was certainly nothing wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nEasily the biggest thorn in this shows side. While for the most part it is fine there are some parts where a sort of blurred sound technique was used and since I was watching a dub without subtitles, I found myself having to replay some of these parts to catch what was said. This is likely not to effect everyone but for me it's a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there were any characters that I disliked in this show. All of the characters seemed strong in their own ways (Shown or implied) and the way that they reacted with one another is what made this anime enjoyable for me. The story goes into depth about some of the characters which is nice but a few extra episodes about Yoga's \"asset\" Mysu would have hit the spot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nSet aside 5 hours because your about to be roped into some binge watching!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall C was a great anime. While I am bias to this genre, this anime has definitely landed a spot on my top 10 and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. There are so many parts to it that I would like to write about but your time would be better spent watching this great show!",

            "content": "This review is for individuals who are planning to watch this anime a.k.a. SPOILER FREE!\r\nLet's first begin with the storyline. C is an anime that is unique in its own nature due to its complex storyline in addition to its abstract concepts. A simple viewing of the 1st episode will indefinitely pique one's interest due to the authentic interactions between unknown characters. In retrospect, this anime is definitely unique with its abnormal storyline; by creating a world that is unlike any other anime, this thriller definitely piqued my interest. \r\nIn contrast, many viewers will find the first couple (1-3) episodes confusing, and I will admit,I was confused myself. It is completely up to you to decide whether you want to invest your time learning about this complex system or simply drop the anime. My recommendation is to suck it up and watch the god damn show, because every anime is essentially unique, and it takes time for someone to get used to its character. Since C is so abstract and authentic, it WILL take a while for you to get used to it, but once you are comfortable with the storyline, everything becomes a beautiful art of work. Overall, the storyline IS INDEED confusing, but only because it is so unique and different when compared to other works that it REQUIRES you to take time and understand everything. Story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at art and sound, all I can say is that these two elements are profoundly emphasized. The fight scenes are exquisitely drawn in detail, while the entire show is highlighted with majestic artwork. When looking towards sound, I am not that big of an observer, but I did not find major flaws regarding voice acting/ sound effects, so I'll give both these elements a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in my opinion are overall great, but not perfect. I find that the show leads you to assumptions that you really shouldn't even be thinking about. I'm not going to spoil anything so I will leave you to decide what I am referring to. However, I will admit that the character development is genuine and graceful. As you progress through the show, you will find emotions changing, mindsets shifting and even notice your own heart swaying. The time invested in character development in C is limited due to its requirement of helping the viewer understand fundamental concepts of the show, but the subtle shifts in the personalities of the characters are clearly evident, and the outcome of this evolution is sincerely beautiful. Characters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this? HELL YEAH.HARAMBE! Truly, given the tag of 'thriller', if I did not feel hyped or wanting another episode, then this anime obviously failed. I sincerely enjoyed the episodes, sometimes leaving me at cliffhangers that made me envy more. Although I will admit that there are certain aspects of the show that leave me bored or confused, as I finished the entire anime in a span of 2 days, I felt relieved that I didn't waste my time watching a worthless show. In all honesty, I found this anime truly wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.5/10\\n\r\n(A 9 wouldn't be enough to highlight my enjoyment but a 10 is a bit high...9.5 it is!) I hope all you guys enjoy this anime as much as I did. Thanks for reading :)!",

This review will basically help you to decide if you should watch this anime. \r\nStory 7/10: A refreshing story that serves to differentiate itself from the rest of your overused cliche story line. Deciding that it should try to stimulate the average viewer with some economics, finance and values. It too manages to cater itself to both the mature and younger viewers with its well executed story-telling that highlights the darker side of our capitalist societythrough the story's economic recession. Despite the well executed story-telling, the main story line was only introduced nearing the last few episodes, making the whole journey choppy, rushed. The lack of explanations for the sudden twists also didnt help its viewers to understand better.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: Well drawn, realistic scenes of Tokyo and Singapore. some CGI, 3D modeling. Definitely no complains.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10: Although several characters were introduced, their thoughts and emotions were not fully explored other than the MC and his antagonist, Definitely a lot more could be done with its fantastic story telling to explore \"the girl\" and other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall + Enjoyment 7/10: The story's refreshing settings and art, with its wonderful OP and voice acting makes the whole ride pretty enjoyable, despite the fact that the story felt a bit rush, making you feel that there the writers have missed out something. Fight scenes were mediocre, but the fantastic art makes up for it.

That's summary I can say after watching it twice. \r\nStory:\r\nStory is focused on one characters, good thing is that there aren't other girls loving him, I could even say there is no love, almost. I'm bit dissapointed with ending, I hoped it would turn other way however it is reasonable if creators doesn't want to continue this series. \r\nRating 9/10 \r\nArt:\r\nArt isn't strong side of this anime, instead of red, nervous world I would like to see rather calmer and more \"normal\" world. Also everywhere you can find devilnumbers etc. which also isn't realy good for young audience. Character design wasn't bad however i didn't enjoy it that much like in SAO orSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo\\n\\n\r\nRating 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters were enjoyable and interesting, I have nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nRating 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters",

I often feel a lot of different anime are not for everyone. However, this show is for everyone because its for no one. Now you may think that sentence a bit contradicting because it is, but this show had nothing about its main plot that sounded interesting to me. An anime that revolves around currency and has strong economic impacts that effect the story. Though in the end I think this is one of the best anime ever! Just ignore the summery ofthe anime because it doesn\u2019t matter you have no idea what kind of trip you are about to go on watching this show. I do feel its plot is a bit better for a more mature viewer but a younger viewer can still watch and enjoy the show just the same. The only gripe about the show I have is near the end it gives me a headache trying to understand what exactly was happening since I don't have a degree in Macro or micro economy. Though maybe I'm just stupid cause this ending may resonate a lot better with a different person. Also it has best girl and I will fight you.",

The concept/plot of this anime is very intriguing and it makes you keep on thinking that if you were is a situation likes this then what would you do? \r\nFor e.g. I think most of the people here must have had some time in their life where they were short on money and that moment in life is the worst, you can\u2019t do nothing and if you don\u2019t have someone close (family/friends/relatives) to help/comfort you then that becomes one of the most miserable moment inone\u2019s life \\n\\n\r\nWell moving on this anime is without a dought a must watch series, this anime just depicts that money can literally turn the world we live in upside down and more the money one has the more influential and powerful that person becomes. There is also another thing that I want to mention is that that pacing of the anime is done exceptionally well, when I first read it\u2019s plot synopsises I thought it\u2019s quite hard to believe that such a complex plot was fit within 11 episodes, so they might have skipped a lot of things and yeah they did skipped some fights however it didn\u2019t affect the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things that i really liked about this anime, first being the music (it really fits the mood and is quite good) and the second being character development yeah, this one was the most important thing for me because we actually god to see the evolution of Yoga, Kimimaro , and that\u2019s it if you haven\u2019t watched the series then please go and watch immediately because it is truly amazing, Thanks You   \\n",

If you like any of the top 5 or so recomendations, you probably will not like this show as much as you should. The overall plot, story art, and characters are well done. One other thing I wanna mention is that i really enjoyedthis show. Some things you cant explain, and one of them is how i could watch this show over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nOne negative is the fight scenes, they are few and far between, and they aren't very good.

This anime is original and smart, I enjoyed every episode of it's short series, the main 5 or so characters are very memorable, however the supporting characters do not leave much of a footprint in the sand. This series deals with adult and understandable themes such as an individuals present moment and their future, love and the changing of the world before someone's eyes. The character relationships grow in a fantastic way which leads to you not wanting the series to end. The pacing of the show is pretty bad however, it feels like they were shoving too much Into each episode, I believe it could have been even better if they stretched the series over more episodes or made some of the less interesting (still interesting just not as interesting as the main) story lines shorter.\\n\\n\r\nThis series definitely deserves a season two or light novel expansion, it is under rated and deserves more praise than it has received. \\n\\n\r\n*minor spoilers*\\n\r\nThe ending is fairly open ending leaving you too choose your own ending, there are two highly discussed ones, and there is relevant evidence for both, I'm not sure if this was done on purpose to allow for both parties to enjoy the ending or whether neither of them fit the writers ending at all and the ending is what it is.",

Though this bothered me it  still kept me entertained.\r\nArt: 6\r\nI really was touch and go with the art, it seemed like the characters would change every other episode. Though some could see this as a plus, I think it's a negative here. Though there were some pretty epic looking monster/characters in the fights and background though. (The guy up stairs,as he was called.) Though the fights were extremely lacking and had so many dull moments, I think they did fine on the art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5\\n\r\nI love how the main character has no idea what he was doing in the beginning, and how that was portrayed him doing right from wrong.  I also loved how him and his asset were in love but acted as only friends. You could see a lot of this during the battle scenes.  I do think there should have been more time or episodes for better character development. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5 \\n\r\nThis was a enjoyable anime. It requires a lot of thought and attention. A huge issue I had with this series is how all over the place it was towards the end, it seemed like they packed all they could in to each episode leaving major plot holes and undeveloped talent. The ending battle just wasn't a end battle if you know what I mean. To sum it up, If they would have made it a 15 to 20 episode series it would have gotten a better review.

For its citizens, however, life has not improved andunemployment, crime, suicide, and despair are rampant. The mc is a scholarship student whose only dream is to live a stable, ordinary life. One day he meets a man who offers him a large sum of money if he will allow his \"future\" to be held as collateral. From then on his fate is radically altered as he is brought into a mysterious realm known as the Financial District, where he must compete in regular tournaments called \"deals\" in order to keep his money, avoid bankruptcy and survive into the future. \\n\r\nSounds good right, but it gets confusing and when it does, its not a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: Not bad, beautiful in the real world but in the financial district almost everything is in red. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Decent opening and yeah thats pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6: The mc boy needs to get a grip and learn to make decisions and grow up and get a real girl not an avatar girl in the financial district LOL.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: Fell asleep 3 times, drooled 11 times and punched my screen 69 times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: Good plot portrayed badly, please explain better and dont confuse the audience and i GUARANTEE you will get a higher rating than 7.5. \\n\r\na",

I feel like I wanted to defend it or rather give my side as to why it should be given a chance.\r\nThe plot of the story starts off with an interesting premise, not so unique but it showed potential. However, it is not the story line that damaged the show--it is actually quite consistent with the facts--the problem for me is it lacked depth. It was too fast-paced that it didn't give emphasis onsome matters that could've helped supplement the viewer's understanding of the story. There were a lot of times I had to pause and ask \"how did he come to that?\" then recall previous scenes in my head to fully grasp the situation. I did get to understand it because, again, all the facts you need to comprehend the story is there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's not the best there is but I actually like it. How the financial district was drawn reminded me of Gankutsuo, but to those who tend to look at the symmetry of the drawing, especially the eyes, might find it disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was okay for me. Not so memorable.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the story lacked depth, it affected the characters. It was confusing how Kimimaro learned to use direct. Wished there was more fighting to show that Kimimaro actually got better enough to stand up to Mikuni. The pace of the story also affected the connection of the viewer's to the character. One of the best way to see whether a character is successful or not is when they were able to elicit empathy from the audience. In most scenes, it just didn't for me.\\n\\n\r\nEven if I gave it a 6, I did learn a few from this show. It's philosophical so it might target your values. It's refreshing to look back at yourself sometimes to check what you put on weight more. If you did not understand where the story is going I suggest you to re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's not the story in itself that's the problem, it's the depth--but everything is in there for comprehension. I wouldn't say that the story is rushed, it's more like they tried to fit in everything on those 11 episodes. But do try to give this series a chance. I'd still recommend it.",

            "content": "SPOILERS BELOW: PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THIS SERIES!\r\nAlright so I'll say this right away: my argument will most likely be biased because of my love for this series (but then again who isn't biased to some extent).  I've seen quite a few people post about how [C:] tried and failed to upkeep things they created, tie in Economics properly, ect.  Personally, I feel that if you think these things that there is either a reason or you're not looking hard enough.\r\n[C:] is very much about Economics.  I'll try to keep the symbolism explanations simple:\r\nMidas Money = Loans\r\nThe reasonfor this is because Midas Money gives you purchasing power in exchange for your future.  Ultimately, that's what a loan does.  When you take out a loan, you enter a legal contract saying that you will receive temporary money in exchange for the thing you spend it on (since the money you spend using the loan isn't really your money, it's the banks).  Ex.) You take out a loan on your car.  If you fail to repay that loan, the bank will then own your car.  In [C:]'s case, they are trying to invest in their futures.  If they can't pay back the loan (the Midas Money) then they lose their future as part of the contract.  When people go bankrupt within the Financial District, they have lost all their Midas Money, and can't pay back the loan.  The future that they invested in (whatever it may be, for the teacher it was his children and wife) will be taken as compensation.\\n\\n\r\nThe Financial District = The Capitalistic Economy \\n\r\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, there were not many \"businesses\" so to speak.  For the most part it was part of what you grew up in, and it was what you lived on for basic needs.  However, after the Revolution, the topic of Business became very appealing and profitable, but to start a business you need money.  In our modern day economy, most entrepreneurs start up their businesses on loans (in [C:]'s case - Midas Money).  The life blood of most businesses are formed and thrive off the loans that they obtain.  The Financial District is a representation of this new economic structure.  New Entres borrow Midas Money to start up then fight in  \"deals\" to basically take the money of the person they're fighting.  Note how ALL the money in the Financial District is Midas Money.  That's because what they are doing is fighting with the financial power form their loans to take the financial power of other Entre's loans.  It's somewhat odd, and it's why it's questioned in the series if the Financial District is good or evil.  After all, business keeps the world going and goes towards the future, but the entire Financial District uses money that really doesn't even exist (loans - Midas Money)  \\n\\n\r\nAssets = Entre's Future\\n\r\nThe assets of a business really are the potential future of the business.  They are the entirety of power, so to speak, the business has.  If a business loses all it's assets, the business has no future, it is dead.  In [C:], the assets can be \"invested\" in.  Likewise, in reality, you can invest in your own assets to hopefully gain some type of progression (such as technological advances) to improve your assets ability.  In [C:], that \"ability\" is portrayed as supernatural abilities to win deals.\\n\\n\r\nMasakaki = Personification of the Will of the Economy\\n\r\nI know Masakaki isn't a term, but he does represent something.  The economy isn't something that can be fully managed, controlled, understood, ect.  Masakaki shows this time and time again by refusing an offer that would seem logical (such as when Yoga tries to buy back his teacher's future), appearing at random intervals (surprising people), giving Yoga a \"Black Card\", ect.  Although, Masakaki didn't necessarily GIVE the Black Card.  The \"one from above\" did, the laws of the economy did.  Masakaki is simply a servant of this \"economic god\".\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm off the terms, and I'm onto complaints that I've heard before:\\n\\n\r\n\"The mystery of the Financial District is never solved\" - It was never meant to be solved.  The viewers are called to see the connection between the economy of the modern day and the Financial District.  Even though you see mythological guesses at what it could be in the series, you should see that they're meant to be only as such, guesses.\\n\\n\r\n\"What's with the Deus Ex Machina at the end with Yoga and the Black Card?\" - The ending isn't supposed to be displayed as the main character using his \"main character powers\" to somehow beat the odds or to gain something to beat the odds.  Like I said previously, The \"one from above\" that Masakaki refers to is the law of the economy.  The economy is volatile and unpredictable so when Yoga gains the Black Card, it was because it's sending a sort of message that \"you can never be too sure\".  I know it may sound odd, but when this scene occured, I realized and recreated on my own face, the smile that Masakaki is always seen with.  The idea that the economy is just a game.  Now, I understand that the economy isn't purely chance nor is it purely a game, but it does have those aspects to it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Some of these asset attacks don't make sense at all.  They don't fit in with what's happening.\"  - The asset attacks aren't supposed to \"work\" with their actual physical form and context.  They are meant to just perform a \"move\" that sounds like what it's name could be used for.  Mashyu used fire-type attacks so they found a few economic terms that could be used with fire (Scorched Earth and Overheated Economy).  The argument could be made that these moves represent the asset's personality, goal, ect. and through them the entre's personality, goal, ect.(due to the asset being the entre's future).  For example, Mashyu's Macroflation is Overheated Economy.  An Overheated Economy is caused by huge amounts of spending and leads to inflation.  To reduce spending, loans are sometimes reduced in availability.  This means less people can borrow money, and less amounts of money can be borrowed.  The Financial District runs on loans (Midas Money) so Yoga and Mashyu could represent the enemy of the Financial District in that sense as well.\\n\\n\r\nsubcategory: \"How is Q's cannibalization and economic term?\" - A simple search for economic terms with cannibalization in it can solve this problem.  The one that seems to be the one Q is using is called \"Market Cannibalization\" which is when someone produces a product that ends up harming the entire market.  \\n\\n\r\n\"What's all the random stuff with the Future and the Present?  It doesn't relate to the economy at all.\" - The main thing is the use of Midas Money (loans)  it's a philosophical  battle to determine if loans are something that should exist or not, how the economy should be operated, and the reasons why.  My friend compared this battle to the arguments between Kaynes and Hayek who are very intelligent economic philosophers who had very opposing views.  Kaynes being played as Mikuni, and Hayek played as Yoga.  Even more than the Future-Present battle, Mikuni believed that having a ton of money to influence the economy is what should be done while Yoga just wants to live an average life involving no forcing the economy to steer in the way you want.(also opposing views with Kaynes and Hayek)  Mikuni wanted to completely hold the Financial District.  By preventing deals and businesses competing, there would be no reason to invest since you don't need to compete.  You're all in one giant business so to speak.  Because no investments are made, the future isn't being aimed towards.  There will be no future advances because of no investments thus leading to a present standstill - only caring for the present and consumption now instead of later.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more complaints, but none that I can think of immediately.  Finally, I just have some side-notes of [C:]:\\n\\n\r\nWhenever the world \"changes\", it represents the business going bankrupt just like in our economy, but in [C:], these changes are not only instant, they never existed in the first place.  For example, let's say that in real life there's a shoe store and it goes out of business.  In a few days/weeks, the spot/building where it once was will be replaced by a new business; in this case let's say it's a shirt store.  People will remember the shoe store, and the shoe store employees will have lost their jobs.  In [C:], the shoe store immediately becomes the shirt store, the shoe store never existed, the employees of the shoe store did something other than working at the shoe store (possibly being jobless during the entire time), and no one notices the change.  This aspect of [C:] really is meant to be an eyeopener to the horrors of bankruptcy, and also, near the end of the series, the horrors of a recession. \\n\\n\r\nTo further explain my point about the entre's losing their future, I want to use Ko (the angelic charity guy) as an example.  He was funding a charity program for many poor children.  Once he went bankrupt, his money never existed.  He never spent it on the charity, and all the lives that he saved were never saved in the first place.  The future that he invested in with the Midas Money was taken from him because he couldn't pay back that loan.  The same goes for Yoga's teacher who lost his wife and children.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I loved this series.  It's my number one anime tied with Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.  This series has a hell of a lot of connections through symbolism which is very admirable.  Simply put: the creators didn't half-ass this work.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "I decided to watch this anime because the screenshots reminded me a bit of a toned down Count of Monte Cristo and I am still on my quest to find animes with adult leading characters. I figured, why not? It's about a college student with a major in Economics who gets wrapped up a battle to prevent the economic collapse of his country...sounds pretty interesting. Well this is no Wall Street. \r\nIt's basically about a guy named Yoga Kimimaro who looks like a highschool boy but is supposed to be in college...I suppose I can overlook that as not everyone looks like an adult incollege. He majors in economics yet knows next to nothing about money, investing, and so on. He basically just works at a convenience store and save up. He's in love with his friend who has a boyfriend and the story begins when he gets a random deposit of a large sum of money and a visit by a weird being from some other realm they call the financial district. Now I'm going to stop it here and go over what we have so far.\\n\\n\r\nYoga is by far the most milk toast, boring, passive b*tch character I've seen in quite a while. I wonder if anyone has to come into his bathroom and wipe his a** for him case he's too passive to do it himself. We get a glimpse into how passive he is when he never speaks up to confess his feelings for his friend. you would think that this would be a flaw he would have to resolve in the end, and he sort of does...sort of but we'll get to that later. During most of this anime this guy just walks around as everyone explains the plot and he's so freaking ignorant when it comes to the economy to the point where you wonder why he's even an economics major. By the way he looks and his ignorance, you might as well say he's a highschool kid. but I guess even the creators realized how stupid it would be for a high school kid to participate in a financial game and save Japan from economic collapse. So they instead created this \u201cmight as well be a highschool kid\u201d character with the title of college student and economics major.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s continue. He gets taken to another realm\u2026because it would be boring this was a slice of life about people dealing with Japan\u2019s tough economy and there he has to pay a money battle royale type of game that is never fully explained because the creators know nothing about economics except a bunch of keywords. While there Yoga draws the attention of the main bad guy with a sister complex and daddy issues, Souichirou who is the boss controlling everything there. They do a good job of setting up this character and his personal goals. So much so to the point where I wonder if they should have just made him the main character. He\u2019s an adult, more involved with economics, more knowledgeable about the financial district and its effects on the real world economy (although not smart enough to realize that pumping the economy full of money is not good), not perfect, not passive, has a more defined past, and the list goes on. But I guess that would make too much sense. Instead he\u2019s the exposition guy. He stands around informing the main character of everything for some odd reason because the main character attracted his attention\u2026still trying to figure out how considering the fact that the main character is about as interesting as watching paint dry. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have another exposition character\u2026because the plot is so far gone to the point where they needed multiple characters to explain what is going on. I forgot her name but she just walks around talking about her investigations and eating burgers cause that\u2019s her quirk. These characters basically have to explain the economy and so on to this so called economics major as he battles people with money powers and supernatural creatures. Smh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked the art style. It was sort of monte cristo like which is cool and well, at least the characters were all adults even if one is questionable. The ending was what I expected it to be. Rushed, convoluted, and \u201cexplained\u201d by a third party. Oh and if your wondering if the main character stops being such a  passive b*tch. Well, he acknowledges that it\u2019s one of his issues and he tries to resolve it by standing up for his beliefs\u2026after he\u2019s told what they should be. The plot with the girl he had a crush on was dropped so there is no resolution there. Then he\u2019s told that his choice at the end was for nothing so, so much for making decisions for yourself that other people say you should make. Lol!\\n",

Maybe I'm weird and a little too analytical for my own good, but I would have loved this anime to have been as long as possible and really delve into all of the aspects, the characters, and the plot lines which a series focused around economics could explore. The idea of an economics anime doesn't sound like something that would be as good as it was, but, while I'm very sad that it was never really given a chance, \"C\" is an anime I'll always cherish as one of the biggest surprises I've gotten in my experience with the media, it really shocked me how good it was, how much sense it all made within its own world, and how brilliant and genius the whole thing was. Whoever came up with this needs to do more work because they are brilliant, but, now, I guess all I can do is fantasize about all the places that this anime could have taken me. :)",

Counterfeit money (or Midas Money) can only be seen by the people that are associated with the Financial District, a place that can only be accessed by individuals that have a reason to make money and desires to make more of it. Our main character runs contrast to most of the people in the Financial District in which he doesn\u2019t want to make a lot of money, he wants to have a normal job, have a normal family, and live a normal life. \\n\\n\r\nMasakaki take him to the Financial District and introduces him to the idea of Deals. In short, it\u2019s a wager match in the form of a 1v1 fight (as in an actual fight). He also gives the MC an asset, which is used in Deals. Assets are a manifestation of that person\u2019s future, so the MC\u2019s Asset takes the form of a young girl that can actually speak unlike the majority of the other Assets shown in this show. He explains that losing a Deal in the Financial District causes you to a part of your future, even worst if you go bankrupt in a deal.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story of this show, I think it\u2019s great story that centers around the economy and shows us how the Financial District can impact the real world. The main problem of this show is not the story itself; it\u2019s the lack of sufficient world building for the Financial District. There is some world-building for the Financial District, but there wasn\u2019t enough for a show like this. Masakaki is the character that has the most knowledge about the District. He mentions a hierarchy in the District, but doesn\u2019t say anything about who they are, what they do, and possibly what they\u2019re thinking. He also stated that the Financial District has always existed alongside the world and only really came into play when people developed economies. If that first part of that explanation wasn\u2019t there, then this would be more interesting than it already is. The whole explanation of \u201cexisted since time began\u201d or something like that, I think is a very cheap way to explain either a character of an alternate dimension.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show has a great story going for it, but it suffers from a lack of sufficient world building that could possibly expand on the story and the characters. There\u2019re also minimal plot-holes and no retcons in this show as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the art was incredibly sub-par, the 2D animation felt stilted and expressionless, the CGI animation was stiff as hell, and the 2D/3D animation moments were incredibly clashing; it made the show look bad. After around Episode 5/6, many issues I had with the animation were gone and the show increased in quality with each episode (barring a few scenes that looked like utter shit). The fight scene in the last episode was fantastic with great choreography, pacing and progression with a constant back and forth struggle between the two characters. It honestly was a sight to behold, wasn\u2019t really expecting a scene like this within the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a nice track done by NICO Touches the Walls, but after around episode 5 or 6, it doesn\u2019t fit the show at all and I started to skip it at that point. The ED on the other hand reminded me of several tracks that came afterward like Liar Mask and V.I.P (I can\u2019t be the only one that hears that right?). Not only are the visuals from the ED different from many others, it also thematically fits the show and the song as well; one of my favorite EDs of all time. It\u2019s too bad that the full version of this is so hard to find.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBesides those 2 tracks, most of the tunes played can sound weird at times, but it matches the nature of the Financial District. Some of the other tracks are mostly forgettable, though they are mostly used for atmosphere, so I won\u2019t complain about it too much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nMsyu (Mashu): She\u2019s Kimimaro\u2019s asset who initially started off as a typical asset that has close to 0 character. As the show progresses, she ironically becomes more human, in more ways than one, than her master. It\u2019s quite funny. I do find it weird that she got the most character development out of all the characters in this show. Even Kimimaro got less development than her and he\u2019s the MC. \\n\\n\r\nYoga, Kimimaro: He was a normal college student other than the fact that he\u2019s pretty much broke and works 2 jobs. Since the beginning, he was set on living a normal life, earning money normally, and raising a normal family. After his encounter with Souichirou, his actual character appears off. At times, he\u2019s decisive (especially when it comes to Mashu); other times, he\u2019s passive and can\u2019t decide. By the end of the show, he\u2019s finally figured out what future he wants for himself and everybody else, but I won\u2019t spoil that, just watch and see.\\n\\n\r\nMikuni, Souichirou: This person was a complete mystery in the beginning of the show with his ideas counter that of the protagonist\u2019s, making Kimimaro wonder for about half of the show if the normal life is what he truly wants. Souichirou got the most backstory of all the characters in this show, and it\u2019s actually interesting to see how that one event changed his entire life and idea of a perfect world. (I feel really bad for him)\\n\\n\r\nMasakaki: When he first shows up in front of Kimimaro, he gives off an unsettling vibe (but that CGI/2D animation scene doesn\u2019t help this at all) that make you want to avoid him at all cost. After introducing him to the concept and rules of the Financial District, he takes a backseat in favor of the other characters, which is a shame because he has the potential to be the most interesting character of the show, if not one of the most interesting characters of all time. Sometimes he changes things around, claiming that it was \u201corders from his superiors\u201d. It\u2019s too bad we really don\u2019t get to see those characters.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the other characters aren\u2019t worth mentioning. Granted, there are a few characters outside of these 4 that are important to the story, but I won\u2019t spoil who they are or what they do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t have much to say here. I really enjoyed this show for what it tried to do, and I think it executed those ideas well. Story was really good, Art/Animation was sub-par in the first 5 episodes and jumped in quality as the show progressed, OST and Voice acting was great, and the characters weren\u2019t the greatest but a good amount of them got development and backstory.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the concept of the Financial District and the contrasting ideals of Present vs. Future. I like the unique visuals that are shown in the District and ED; very creative and different from everything I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why most these are 8s is because these concepts weren\u2019t utilized to their fullest potential (reminds me of DBGT in a way). Story would\u2019ve been higher, but the insufficient world building hindered it. Art/Animation, as mention earlier, was sub-par in the first 5 episodes. Not only that, there are multiple scenes early on that use both 2D/CGI in the same scene, which is very distracting. Episode 6 and onward don\u2019t do that as much and the 2D and CGI animation improved significantly, but that improvement happens in the second half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the OST is mostly atmospheric, it genuinely enhances the current situation in some form, with the ED being the best track in the whole show. The characters are the weakest part of the show, mainly because not enough of them are given enough backstory, development, or their motives aren\u2019t revealed. The ones that got development and/or backstory are either important to the story or they\u2019re side characters that will be relevant sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI fully recommend this show to people that want to watch something different.\\n",

The idea of Midas money, demonic printing press, future and the economy is interesting and fairly unique combination. I don't recall seeing an anime like this before. I liked the art and animation, assets and the district were colorful and diverse. The assets were cool as well, representing each persons future differently and having different attacks and abilities. Fights scenes were well done and interesting. The one thing lacking was the relationship development of real word people(the people at college) with Yoga. Although, they may have wanted to focus on him and Mysu, which they did do quite a bit. The end seemed to just cut off when more could have been done to show, say, how Mysu was his future. It is only hinted at what she is in the story.",

This anime is one of the best I've seen.\r\nFirst off, the art and story. It's both pure and original. The story is something unlike anything I've seen. It's true that I only watched it due to it being recommended from Eden of the East, but even this is a completely different turn from that. You have a generated currency which is pretty much endless, if used right. You have to fight in Deals to gain more moneyand to stay in the world. If you go Bankrupt, you're kicked out of the world and all your money is taken from you. From the point of another person, it would seem plain. It's far from that, very far from plain. It's the essence of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was something that I picked up on right after the first episode. It brings the mood to the anime. It strikes it at the right time. It's beautifully made and one of the best I've heard. As for the OP and ED, they're both great. Now, for the background noises and such, they're accurate according to anything else. The voices fit within the duels and act funny if enough is spent. It seems to make sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a stunning 10/10. This is a must watch for an anime enthusiast. You're missing out on a great thing if you don't watch this.",

Then watching those relationships evolve and progress is rather exciting.\r\nThe series manages to pack a lot of story into just  a smallanime season, left me wanting more and hoped for a 2nd season to come along one day.

Having seen Trapeze and remembering how good it looked, I was really expecting a lot. However, blurry visuals and legendary QUARITY made me genuinely disappointed in it. Story wise, it does some things that have never been done, and for that, I commend it. But its finanical discussion never really steps beyond Econ 101 level, the characters aren't particularly engaging, and as gg fansubs so eloquently puts it, the main premise ends up being primarily \"Yu-Gi-Oh with credit cards\". When it does stepup, though, it really STEPS UP, and it's almost worth watching just for the awesome last few episodes. Other than that, though, the series was, to me, consistenly mediocre.\\n\r\nEven so, the series' constant Engrish is pretty fun to randomly quote to your friends, and you'll find yourself constantly wanting to shout \"YOU HAVE GAIN\" in public places. Quite embarrassing. Recommended for fans of Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon because of how the bullshit battle system works. XD",

            "content": "C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control had an interesting premise and pretty good OP. However, almost everything else was executed poorly. Since I completely wasted my time with this show hoping that it would be fulfilling, i'm angry enough to write an review on it. \r\nNote: I do have a potential spoiler rant at the end of the review.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThese guys had absolutely no idea what they were doing when it came to the plot. \r\nThe setting and the idea was great, hell have a gazillion dollars and fight other people with money? COOL! However, the writers didn't seem to know what todo after they came up with that super cool idea. It had a reasonably slow start, an unreasonably slower middle, suddenly OH LOOK \"-----C------\" is HAPPENING EVERYONE PANIC. Don't even get me started on that asspull at the end, that was bullshit and you know it was.\\n\\n\r\n In between the time Yoga came to the district and the time -----\"---------C---------\"--- absolutely jack shit happened other than introducing a shit ton of characters (i will get to THEM in a second) and deal after deal. No, we did not need a character breakdown on a teacher that we didn't even recognize until it was pointed out that he was a  teacher. No, we did not need to stretch out activities for the guild and watch as bland characters go \"hahaha we're so cool\". NO, WE DID NOT NEED AN ENTIRE FLASHBACK ABOUT A CHARACTER WHO ALREADY TOLD HIS STORY TO THE MAIN CHARACTER EPISODES AGO. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of wasting their time with pointless and unconvincing  character introductions and development, they could have wasted their time enriching the world and the system that the writers created. Rather than spending episode after episode explaining the effects on the outside world, lets talk about the district? Questions and facts that should have been answered at the beginning of the series still remain unanswered even after the series ends. I could go on, but i'll just make it simple for you:\\n\\n\r\nYou go in with nothing and leave with an awkward end, more questions ( if you still even care about this shit story), and maybe a conscious to pick up a penny whenever you see it. That's it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe background and scenery was good. As i said before, i liked the world and setting and i loved the nice art that came with it. However, the level of QUALITY in Psycho Pass episode 18 was the same level as every single episode of this series. I had to pause at some points of the show because i could not fucking believe my eyes when i saw the blatant CGI flop this show presented. Seriously, what the fuck? At least TRY to stay consistent. See, if Mysu was 3D-ified only inside her card world thing, that would be okay. But after I saw Yoga go full 3D model walking down the street i was pretty much done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nISSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO KOWASHITE KURE YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\\n\\n\r\nmatryoshka etc etc \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one of the best out there. At this time, i'm listening to it constantly. The OST gets you pumped, and at the same time its fun. No voices were irritating to listen to, except for maybe that Caribbean guy, and yeah, they did a great job with that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nThere are only two characters that will catch your interest in this show. Mikuni and Mysu. Yoga at first seems like a promising protagonist but ends up becoming bland and annoying, like everyone else, a few episodes later. I guess the writers just decided to focus on other things because they were just done with him at a certain point. \\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable about the white hair girl other than the fact that she bought three fast food cheeseburgers at once and only ate one. Oh, and she goes \"OH MY GOD RAAAAUGH you can use my pokemon HAHAH YEAH YOU CAN DO THAT YOU GUYS COOL RIGHT?/!!!!11\" \\n\\n\r\nNone of members in the guild were interesting. Maybe it was because there was no proper character introductions for them or...? Their literal purpose was to Make Mikuni look like a super cool badass businessman.\\n\\n\r\nMikuni was interesting, and yes he ended up as my favorite. The writers knew that Mikuni was going to be popular so they basically spent their entire budget on him, giving him a pointless flashback, making him in almost every single episodes when he really wasn't needed, giving the little character development they were willing to give to him, making one of the two characters with a solid personality. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I thought Mysu was annoying at first, but she is a character that you warm up too as an asset learning about human stuff. If you are going to watch this at any point even after reading this review, watch it for her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nYeah, i gave it a decent score because  i enjoyed the deal battles. There were also times when i was 'excited' and hoping that something cool would happen. Especially with the cliffhanger bullshit they pulled, and then you sat through the opening? Super cool.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe show had its good points. I sat down and watched it and hell I thought it was going to be a strong success. However it just ended up being a blatant laughable disaster. So yeah, don't waste your time with this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Potential spoilers below)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the end, oh my fuck the end. Where did the black card come from? Why the hell didn't we know that Yoga had this fucking card at the beginning of the show? Where the fuck did this card come from? What are the qualifications of getting this card? Plot? There is no way in hell this DARKNESS card does anything but just make money, and the fact that they made the card only have that certain role and present it out of nowhere is appalling. There is a difference between the element of surprise and pulling something out of your ass.\\n\\n\r\n(Potential spoilers above)",

            "content": "Alright, this will be my first review ever, so I'm sorry if it seems tacky etc...\r\nI just finished watching this anime and I want to give out my opinion on it.\r\nFirst of all the goodies:\r\n- Music / Sound world overall\r\n- Epic battles\r\n- Summons (that kinda remind me of Persona and such!)\r\n- Story idea\r\nNegatives\r\n- Characters\r\n- Too little episodes (maybe the pacing too at times.)\r\nSo let's go through these things okay?\r\nFirst of all the music and sound world in this anime is GREAT. I'm not saying the music is exactly memorable to me, but it still fitted the situations at hand in the anime. Especially at theend it gives you a nice, soothing feeling. The sound effects are point on and nothing seems \"out of place.\" The voice actors are fittings as well, though when they were speaking in English, it wasn't as high quality - but that's just my personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles!! I really love them! They really remind me of Persona with the whole card summoning idea. Except this time they are based on your money. They keep you entertained, though sometimes they appear to be a bit too short. I guess it brings in some realism in sense, that no one is able to keep going forever at it, but I was expecting there to be...MORE... into them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is original as well (or well I haven't bumped into similar kind.) The whole idea of how money makes the world go around is a very nice idea. Even in the real world money brings you power and this anime just goes to show you that, with some fantasy elements added in, of course.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the negatives now.\\n\\n\r\nThe story seemed kinda rushed considering it was filled in with only 11 episodes. I really would've hoped there would've been a second season, because this anime would've worked that way A LOT more. They don't really give you time to get to know these people, besides maybe the main character - and even his past is in a haze for the most part. They just kept kicking in more random characters to the show and expecting you to just suck them in and not care about them. Which, btw, happened. I didn't really care for many of the characters, except the ones that were in the main light. I would've loved to hear more about Masakaki, for example. What he is, where he comes from and such, but it remained as a big mystery. Maybe that was the point of it, but it kept bothering me how I never got the time to get to know these characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was a great show and I enjoyed watching it. I will rate it 9/10 because I found more positive than negative about it. It might be a bit of a loose rating, but once again, this is just my opinion :) I hope you will give this show a chance! It starts off kinda EHHHH, but ends up being really epic! And 11 episodes isn't a lot, so it's easy to go through in couple of days (if not even in a day if you're crazy enough.)",

I liked how they attempted to keep a balance of economics and shounen. It would be better if it was 24 episodes, since the ending was sort of abrupt and left a few plotholes. Moreover, it loses points on using a motif used over and over again (I'll spoil it if I say it).\r\nArt: Not bad. But the CG got very noticeable at a handfull of points, which bugs me. Also the animation wasn't very fluid (Thank you PA Works for makingmy standards very high now).\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another outstanding soundtrack, as expected from Taku Iwasaki (gurren lagann, soul eater). Opening and ending were amazing too. VA was pretty decent too. Also A-A-A-A-A-A-ANGEL.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Liked how it was a poor college boy and not some angsty teenager. But I feel the development for the protagonist was a bit rushed. Also forced drama.\\n\\n\r\nActually, you know what, just get the OST and forget about the anime. You won't be missing out on much anyways.",

            "content": "\"C\" gives us an in depth viewing of how the power of money can influence our future. I personally thought the very concept behind \"C\" was fresh and skillfully written. It was a very plot driven anime which managed to fit a very action packed well developed story into an 11 episode series. In fact, I would say \"C\" seemed to \"flow\" as if it were one long movie. \r\nAlthough it could had been more refined in some areas the story was on point for the most part; and any plot holes were easily dismissed. For those who need an explanation for every little detail,I'd say explanations were not necessary for this particular anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors used were vibrant. The character models themselves however were standard although this is not really a detriment.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing theme songs were good, although not great. I was more interested in the BGM which featured a cello and other string based instruments. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, for being an 11 episode anime the main characters were well developed. Their reasons for participating in battle were clear and logical. The characters themselves were likable and although slightly archetype this doesn't take away from the  overall plot freshness.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a well developed anime with the potential for a second season although I don't think there will be one. Overall \"C\" deserves a solid 8 for its originality and intrigue. Other review sites have rated this anime as only \"good\" but I feel it deserves better. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

If they lose, the lose part of their future as a collateral. This go again with the misleading title since it was not about strategies for an economy, but more like battles tomake economic decisions. It did not mean I did not enjoy it since there was some sort of character development, decent story line and a little bit of anxiousness on what is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish they came up with a better title, but then again its probably was hard considering what the story was about.

This is a anime about economy and money disguised as a monster fighting anime.  \r\nIt's best going into it without knowing too much beyond that, but I found it enjoyable, and the strange twists, and how I would say things parallel and work as alagories for real life is facinating.\r\nEach of the main chars I liked though wish some had a bit more screen time, this is definetly one that could have maybe been helped by a fewmore episodes.  The visuals and little changes and things that happen as the story progresses work very well.   Give it a shot if your looking for a action anime, but done differently.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (a little farther down) \r\nMAL always tells me to 'Try your very best to not write any spoilers.' I'm just going to go ahead and IGNORE that suggestion. This review will cover why I like and highly recommend this anime, but to do that I will have to clarify many things. In fact. It would probably be safest to say that this review should be read post-posthumously, so to speak. After you finish the anime. Which you should. Immediately. \r\nTo begin with I want to say, as many other people have, that this story is unique. Not original, that hardly canexist any more, but unique. It is an extremely creative mix of stuff we've seen a dozen times over. Normal human gets given crazy powerful cute helper. Has to fight in duels (usually against their will), ends up saving the world, etc etc. However what it does so well is take what has been done before, and provide it another setting. It's like saying a painting of a flower by Van Gogh isn't unique or original because it's a painting of a flower. Don't be ridiculous! It's taking something familiar, and doing something different and beautiful with it. I honestly think that's the best way to describe the general feeling of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI guess that summarises my liking of the art, sound and story mostly, but let me continue :D \\n\r\nStory : 8 - It did have flaws in some areas, and for those neat-freaks out there like me who struggle with a story that (I would argue intentionally) doesn't answer every question, the ending is a little difficult to stomach. (Though I think it was a beautiful ending. We over-complicate things so much sometimes.) I won't make much comment on the whole 'money' 'future' thing because honestly I don't think it's a huge issue. If you're willing to not be nit-picky, I think it's quite easy to grasp what the producers were going for and they used an interesting medium (the economy) to do so. \\n\r\nArt : 9 - I usually quite dislike this art style, I'm no artist so I can't say what style it is or why particularly, but I loved it in this anime. It had moments of subtle colour and romantic drawing, and it had moments of pure raw bursts of two or three raging colours that clashed and warred and portrayed emotions of confusion, fear, pain, very well. Q, anyone? :P\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'll say in this section, because there's nowhere better to put it, was how extremely CLEVER the producers where in using imagery. There were times in this anime that a character would be having a monologue, but the imagery that accompanied it (like the ants and the wasps and the frog) were another creative means of telling the same message. And that's just one example! The way each scene was structured and the amount of imagery stuffed into each episode was REALLY impressive. Not to mention those crazy cool backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9 - (skipping sound, though I really did enjoy it. a lot. I'm just not much of a musician nor do I pay a lot of attention to it. The fact I noticed the soundtrack at points, even actively turning it up during some of the later episodes, is praise enough.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8 - Solid characters. Enjoyed them all, large cast so some suffer, obviously, let's not dump the expectations of a 100 episode show onto an 11 episoder. Seriously guys, appreciate what you're given. If anyone actually understood the conflict between the two main protagonists, you should get this reference :P One main thing is that with any show this short, each character (even some major ones) Is essentially just a tool to fill a certain plot roll. Aside from the three main ones, Mysa, Yoga and Mikuni, pretty much every other character did in this show, so naturally it may feel as if the characters aren't developed fully. Of course there's missing potential, but they did what they were needed to do, and they did it well. The plot progressed extremely smoothly thanks to the extremely good, in my opinion believable, characters. The white haired lady was a good example of this. \\n\\n\r\nNOW SPOILER TIME\\n\\n\r\nBack to story, though I prefer the term 'plot'. \\n\\n\r\nI read through a discussion feed after finishing this anime, and most of the comments were either voicing a lot of confusion, or annoyance. 'but this didn't happen' and 'but why'd this character do this' and 'who was that crazy character they showed at the end' etc etc. \\n\\n\r\nI always find it extremely frustrating that people are so willing to slam a show simply because they weren't paying attention enough, or smart enough (trigger warning) to get a more-complicated-than-average-plot. It's the same reason shows like Darker than Black (albeit that never finished, which caused much of the confusion) is often only loved or despised. Some people seemed willing to invest the time to understand all THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD, and willing to simply roll with what CAN'T be, and that's extremely important!!! As a completely novice author, I can even say that as the author, you can sure as hell bet I don't have all the answers, but they aren't necessary to what I'm trying to say or do. To much info would just clutter an otherwise interesting story, and I promise you there are animes like that out there. \\n\\n\r\nThe same is true of C: One on of the criticism I read was (SPOILER) about who Q was and how she realised that she was Mikuni's sister. She never died people! In episode seven, during the telling of Mikuni's story, it pretty much ends with these word's \"With that Takakoa lost consciousness, and has not awoken to this day.\" Comas are a thing you know. So of course she's still in his future, there's no reincarnation going on or any shite like that. Hell even that's a misunderstanding, the show repeatedly emphasises that Assets are 'representations' of the future. the title of the show is 'possibilities'. Assets are not realities! That's why, for example, Mysa is a representation of Yoga's future, because she is named after his dead little sister (presumably what his father lost when he went bankrupt, and also the reason why his father committed suicide, just like Yoga's professor was going to do. The information is all there! It's just not shoved down our throats so every moron can understand!! (thank god for that) It even has a seen where Yoga, as a child, names his little sister (the spelling was slightly different Misha, I think, but the pronunciation was exactly the same. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on but I feel these examples make my point. Don't criticise this show because you don't understand it, first, consider that it's complicated, quite philosophical, and short. Then, if you can't piece it together, go back and re-watch it! I'm not saying everyone has to like it, but don't write it off because you don't understand it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've never heard normal classical music before, a lot of it will sound like gibberish because you have no comprehension of how they wrote different movements into their music, all the technical skill that goes into writing it, the effort that goes into playing it. Just because you can't understand or meet somethings standards, doesn't mean they're bad standards. \\n\\n\r\nSorry for crazy rant. Hope you all enjoy. And if you're annoyed at the spoilers, I think I gave fair enough warning.",

The whole concept in this anime is just about using money to save the world either the present or the future. The future can be taken away to save the present people but it results in the disappearance of many people and many structures.... But to be honest , i still don't get the reasoning in this concept in this anime lel. It is very confusing but the story is good so hmmkay.. I would really highly recommend this anime because it isone of the few animes that dont bored me and makes me wanted to binge watch the entire series and i did. Just give the 1st episode a try , if it bores you then stop watching ..... It is all about that feeling whenever you watch a new anime :D Nevertheless , the concept is cool and the story is fine just maybe confusing and doesn't make sense.... There IS romance but not much yet still satisfying... The ending is not complete so basically is like a middle finger to us viewers...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion , i will recommend watching this anime :D BECAUSE It has a good concept and good story <3",

            "content": "This is a review on C: The Money of Soul and Possiblity Control which I think is a very underrated anime for the message that this presents. Without spoiling much, this anime shows us how money can affect our lives and how we come to view money today. In this anime, a chosen group of people are able to gain enormous amounts of money by putting their futures as collateral and fight with \"Assests\" which are a representation of one's future.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\n     This anime has an original story that deals with how money is represented in society and what money reallyis. The pace of this anime reminded me of the well known \"Madoka Magica\" as clues to what was really happening in the Financial Distric and the scheme of the Starling Guild started to slowly unravel episode by episode. The story of the anime really opens one's eyes to how money can affect one's future if they are not careful and what money really is. The story is very enjoyable although budding romance between the main protaganist and his asset feels very rushed and unncessary. Besides the romance, I truly enjoyed this anime and greatly recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n     The animation was quite well done and similar to many of the recent anime series that have aired. The fight scenes are pretty flashy and enjoyable as assests duel and the background reminded me of the background in \"Black Rock Shooter\". The animation also feels very smooth, but nothing spectacular that we havent' seen in recent anime. The art really doesnt take you out of the story, but isnt anything new.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n      The sound was appropriate for the story with eerie and suspenseful sound in the background. It fits quite well with the scene that is presented and the transition between sounds during scenes are very well done as it smoothly transitions from a fight scene to a new discovery. I think that the sound and voice acting was done pretty well overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\n      The characters are pretty well done except for a few exceptions. Most of the characters are relatable especially when they reveal their motives later on in the anime. The character development of the main character and his assest as the story progresses was well done as the growth of the characters are pretty clear. You can see the slow growth of the main character as he begins to realize the value of money and what it really is. The other main characters are also relatable as their motives are slowly shown through the anime. My only complaint with the characters are that the side characters really didn't feel important and were just placed there to further the plot with not much development or motives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n      I really enjoyed this anime and got the same feel as when I watched \"Madoka Magica\". I was really sucked into the themes that it presented and changed my perspective of how money works in our society and how important it is. I truly recommend this anime to anyone as it is worth the 4 hours it takes to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n      Is money worth your future? How much can your future change even if you are careless with your money just a little? What can you do with money? What is the true value of money? Is money really powerful or is it just powerful because we choose to believe it is? How much influence does money have on our future? These are all questions that are raised and answered as you watch the anime. This really opens your eyes to how money is viewed in society and I highly recommend this anime to anyone who will be dealing with money in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the end of my review for C: The Money of Soul and Possiblity Control. I hope you enjoyed reading this review (even though it was super long) and I hope that you will take my advise and choose to dedicate 4 hours to watching this amazing anime.",

            "content": "Story: The plot and setting are not entirely new, combining the battle royale concept (most similar would be the Accel World I'd say) with another anime's premise of having \"infinite money to fix the world\", Eden of the East. That said the characters do face the problems/consequences that would come in such a given world and grapple with them realistically (grittier fashion would be an apt way to describe it). However due to the short nature of the show (11 episodes), the story gets a bit incoherent towards the end and viewers may want more (It does wrap up but feels very abrupt).\r\nArt: The animationis good. Although the use of CG may be a bit weird at first (wasn't expecting it), it blends together well. The fight scenes are pretty good (with the exception of one that's just skipped over, you'll know when you see it), although there's some stereotypical shounen moments where despite the battle raging around the characters feel the need to talk.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Individual tracks were not particularly stand out but musical choices during the scenes always fit. The opening/ending tracks are great and were the reason I got more interested in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters weren't exactly spectacular and ran into some tropes (most notably the MC being indecisive when given sudden power). However they are believable and understandable, with enough in the short episodes to give you an understanding of their perspective and motivations. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: C definitely had more potential and would have benefited from a few more episodes, especially towards the end. However the short time frame was use well and  also removed the excess that a lot other animes usually have (characters repeating cheesy lines and filler). It asked the questions expected of its premise and answers them with few \"twists\" or plot points that stand out. Solid viewing experience.",

So when I heard of this one I just had to watch it! After watching the first few episodes I was a little skeptical but once it explained the whole idea of what's happening I started getting hooked on it. Not only that but the sound for the intro was great! Such visuals and catchy music just made me so into the seriesI was hoping for a second season! I enjoyed the way the animation is and the plot behind it was pretty rare. It's not something you would normally see in a anime storyline. But overall I would recommend this show to fellow sci-fi/romantic watchers out there. But if you don't like it at least it wasn't a complete waste of time. It's only 11 episodes!",

            "content": "Initially, I had quite low expectations for C after reading the premise, but I was assured by a friend that it would surprise me in a pleasant way. He was right. C has several unique aspects, but I wouldn't call the work prolific by any means.\r\nStory: Kimimaro is a college student who works part-time on top of classes to try and save up money for his future. Masakaki, an employee from the mysterious Financial District gives him a chance to make money in that sort of alternate world, where one's future and potential is used as collateral in \"deals\", which are essentially battles between two\"entrepreneurs\". I liked the financial/economic ties, but they were ultimately unnecessary and quite superficial. The impact of the deals and huge influx of money from the Financial District isn't really seen or mentioned until the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Over all, the art wasn't anything special. It never went wonky or anything like that, but it didn't play with any new concepts or exceed my expectations for the average anime, either. The 3D animation occurred at strange times and seemed fairly inconsistent. Masakaki and Msyu switched often between 2D and 3D, which was strange. Some Assets were 2D while others were 3D.\\n\\n\r\nSound: No complaints. Everything was clear. The OP/EP didn't seem out of place, nor did they seem to fit perfectly, but at least the OP was catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Not so good. Kimimaro is a protagonist that most people will appreciate because he is very average in many facets, but he does a lot of cute things too. At the same time, he is a pretty flat character. There's nothing especially interesting about him that sets him apart from other protagonists in other animes. The supporting characters were also flat and boring, most notably the love interest, Hanabi. I didn't even know that Kimimaro was interested in her until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Because this was a short series, it's good for a weekend or a marathon night. It's not especially interesting or engaging, but it's not too boring, either. The unique aspects may pique others' interests in ways that it didn't for me.",

However, C suffered from what I felt was a rushed story. \r\nIt tried to fit a story that should have been spread out over 25 episodes into 11. Certain events ( *Spoiler* such as the thinning of the population *Spoiler*) seemed to happen almost immediately when they should have gradually happened over the course of several episodes. This is most apparent when the show skips ahead in the middle of a certain fight scene involvingthe main character.",
