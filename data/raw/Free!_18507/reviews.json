            "content": "Ok, first, a straight, young guy talking here. I've watched this anime in about two days, about 6 episodes per day. That's how captivating this anime was for me. It's probably the highest number of episodes of an anime I've ever watched in such a short time, but anyways, let's get to the actual review:\r\nI am aware of all the hating coming from one side of the anime community, I mean, I hate fanservice myself. But firstly: I usually am capable of ignoring it if the story/action/characters of the anime are good; and secondly: interestingly enough I didn't have much of a problem with thefanservice in this show, i.e. girl- or gay-oriented fanservice. Being able to simply laugh at the gayish scenes made this anime kind of more enjoyable to me. In fact, that's probably the best proof that I'm heterosexual (not that there is any problem with being gay or of any other sexual orientation, never).\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, until about the first 4 or 5 episodes I thought it was ok, simple, but still good, amusing and catching, while including a lot of clich\u00e9s or tropes, but that's ok. The cool thing is that it is still done very professionally and high quality-like. Using a clich\u00e9 isn't bad in itself, but there are ways of doing it well and ways of doing it wrong, this show does it splendidly, IMO. The scenes are kind of predictable and unpredictable at the same time: you guess what is going to happen, still you are amazed at how good it is performed. But entering the second half of the series... it still goes perfectly in the line of what has happened before, it just gets way more gripping and intense. [SPOILER ALERT] Seeing the protagonists entering in professional competitions and understanding the feelings of the characters (which, again, is done so well) really awakens that sports-spirit inside you. [SPOILER ALERT END] The relationships among the characters also brings back that old topic of \"valuing true friendship\" (again, another clich\u00e9), which, IMO, is one of the most important matters in general, be it in an anime, movie, reallife-story... But let's get to the character development.\\n\\n\r\nWithout including the time of when the characters are kids or small teenies, the actual story lasts for MoL 2-3 seasons/ half a year. If you distribute this among 12 episodes, it's pretty obvious that you can't afford too much character development. Still, I really enjoyed the personalities of each of the main characters (including the girls and EXCLUDING Nitori), as they were all quite different, yet complementing each other. [SPOILER ALERT] It's no secret that I specially liked the development between Haru and Rin, and also the backstory of Rin's father (the tragedy during the tsunami). [SPOILER ALERT END] Repeating this for the one thousandth time, they were no unique or revolutionizing types of character, but they were very enjoyable (and that's the most important thing to me).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art and Sound I can only say that both are outstanding. The animations are at the peak of what the anime industry could deliver during the time of the release and specially \"the diving in the water\" and, of course, the bodies of the characters are just beautiful (I am aware that this might sound gayish, but damn do I wish to have their bodies xD). Both the opening and the ending fit the anime very well and during the 12 episodes I almost always listened to them (if I didn't it was for the simple reason that I couldn't wait to see what would happen next). The OST is probably the only reason why the \"sound\" section didn't make it to a \"10\". It's in no way bad, but it just didn't have any special track for me to remember. Be it an epic, a sad or a serious song, they all are good, but no track in the OST actually made me want to search it up on YT.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: To me, there were only a few minor things that annoyed me at some points, though nothing which the rest of the show couldn't make me forget. For the rest, I can confidently say that I'm happy I got to watch this anime as it made me laugh a lot while still following an interesting, emotional and exciting storyline, and coming to remember the vital importance of things like sports and friendship.",

            "content": "About two weeks ago, I went into Gaia\u2019s AMC forum to post a poll, asking the community what 2013 anime I should watch next. I expected Silver Spoon or Gatchaman Crowds to win, and they received 7 and 10 votes, respectively placing in second and third place. The winner, with 24 votes, was Free! Iwatobi Swimming Club, the notorious #SwimmingAnime that came into existence thanks to a viral animation sample, and an almost revolutionary \u2018give us this show\u2019 petition.\r\nSo, with almost half of that poll\u2019s 60 voters daring me to dive head first into manservice oblivion, what was I supposed to do? Was I supposedto turn my head, and avoid making eye contact with that glistening banana-hammock of a show? Or was I supposed to test my mettle as a critic against one of the most manhood threatening shows to be aired last year? Well, let\u2019s think about that. I love Princess Tutu and Ouran High School Host Club, and I was a motherf(yay)ing brony for two years. So bring it on, you rabid hords of Fujoshi! I watched your #Swimminganime, and now, I\u2019m going to review the crap out of it!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Free! begins with four ten year old boys. They consist of Haruka, a quiet boy who only feels at home in the water; Makoto, a laid back best friend character who\u2019s afraid of the ocean; Nagisa, an excitable little moppet who should, by all conceivable logic, be voiced in English by Greg Ayres; And Rin, an outgoing boy whose connection to his friends can only be trumped by his much much larger ambitions. They were brought together by their love of swimming, although they quickly adopt an inside joke that \u2018fate threw them together for having girly names.\u2019 In any case, after their first big relay tournament triumph, Rin leaves the group to go to a middle school in Australia to train so he can become an olympic swimmer. Nagisa also winds up going to a different school, and the fellowship is disbanded.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the first year of high school, when Haruka, Makoto, and Nagisa are finally reunited, and Nagisa convinces them to start the long-defunct Iwatobi Swim club back up again! Because, as we all know, \u201cHigh school club\u201d has been it\u2019s own ubiquitous genre ever since Haruhi Suzumiya started grabbing up all the money in the world. With Rin\u2019s little sister as their manager, a shy teacher for their faculty adviser, and a brand new team mate in the meticulous beauty-obsessed Rei, and the sudden reappearance of Rin as their new rival from another school, their swim club has only just begun to tread water!\\n\\n\r\nBefore we go any further, I should probably address the pink elephant in the room... People refuse to watch this show because it looks gay. Now, I don\u2019t feel like turning this review into a gay rights rant, nor do I want to make any statements about whether or not I consider homosexuality(or lack thereof) an indicator of quality. Maybe there are some good yaoi shows out there... I don\u2019t know. The ones I\u2019ve seen so far sucked. So instead, I\u2019m only going to address whether or not Free is, in a literal sense, gay. Like Hakkenden was.\\n\\n\r\nAbout a year ago, I was dared by a friend to rent and watch Magic Mike. At the end of it, I said the exact same thing that I said in regards to Free. \u201cWait a second... That wasn\u2019t that gay at all.\u201d Yes, both shows feature plenty of scantily clad men to thrill and chill the straight women and gay men of the audience, but both stories take place in a setting where wearing next to nothing makes perfect sense in context... Stripping in one, swimming in the other. I can understand some guys not wanting to watch a show about male strippers, but if the sight of guys taking their shirts off to swim makes you uncomfortable, then buddy, you\u2019ve got issues.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show isn\u2019t even a yaoi. There\u2019s barely any romantic content in the first place, save for one side character\u2019s crush on Kou, but when you really pay attention, Free! is nothing more than a gender swap of Kyoto Animation\u2019s many female-centric slife-of-life shows. Yes, the guys use cutesy honorifics and nicknames, and they seem to have an uncommonly close relationship, but nobody throws around the word \u201cGay\u201d while watching Lucky Star, K-ON! or Tamako Market... Well, maybe in the pejorative sense... But in any case, while there may be some shounen-ai elements floating around in this pool, they\u2019re subtle, and too subtextual to really effect the story in any way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the story... Okay, a few paragraphs ago, I briefly compared this show to Magic Mike, but unfortunately, the comparison shall go no further. Magic Mike was an awesome movie, and Free! is just kind of... Okay. I hate to be mean to it, because the characters are likeable, and I *was* constantly clicking the next episode button, so it was able to hold my attention pretty well... Free! is Kyoto Animation\u2019s first ever sports based anime, which automatically means it has more plot than half of the work they\u2019ve put out thus far, but even with that to boast about, Free! is still just a little too passive for it\u2019s own good. They go to a few swimming competitions, but the stakes of these events are never more than just \u201cWe wanna swim together and get a higher budget for our club.\u201d The only time this story has any gravity to it is when our heroes are stuck in the ocean during a storm, and they never seen to desire anything other than \u201cLet\u2019s be friends and strengthen our bond.\u201d That makes for a very pleasant tone, but it doesn\u2019t make for a very engaging series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing in this story that really develops is the relationship between the five leading males. Their growth as individuals is negligible, aside from Rin, although I can\u2019t really complain, because they\u2019re all really likeable characters. Their occasional coach is only ever used when he\u2019s convenient, and their faculty adviser makes little to no effort to distinguish herself as anything other than a recycled K-ON! trope. Kou, the group\u2019s manager, is not used nearly enough, considering how much potential she has. If she actually had some character arc, even for a single episode, we could have learned something about her as a person... We could have learned why she cares so much about the swim club, and hey, we could have learned why she never swims a single stroke despite being an official member. Seriously, I get that she\u2019s non-athletic and is too female to compete alongside her team mates, but they visit a beach for crying out loud! She brings a swimsuit, and then just hangs around with the teacher! Why?!\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, it\u2019s a decent, pleasant show, and while I didn\u2019t find the plot particularly engaging, I still enjoyed watching it. The chemistry of the characters more than made up for their lack of depth. I\u2019m monolingual, but the japanese dub sounded really good, and I had no problems at all with the actual dialogue. I didn\u2019t find all of the humor effective, but it had enough good jokes to not be boring at any point. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s a happy little distraction, just like K-ON!. Normally, I\u2019d give this kind of show a 7/10, but there\u2019s one more aspect of this show that I forgot to mention. And that aspect is...\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation. Dear God in heaven, this is one of the top ten best looking animes I\u2019ve ever seen. Kyoto Animation may not be known for having stellar stories... Haruhi, Clannad and Chuunbiyoh being the exceptions... but it always brings great animation to the table, and from that perspective alone, this is the best looking show they\u2019ve ever released. The backgrounds and character designs are outstanding, the attention to detail is mind blowing, the characters are capable of a full range of graceful, fluid motion, and the water... Oh my God.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the animation demo that this show was originally based on was released so Kyoto Animation could boast about how well it could animate water. But in the words of Kid Rock, it ain\u2019t bragging if you back it up. If you\u2019re not taking a simplistic approach, water can be one of the most notoriously difficult things to animate. There are some CGI movies where they have to treat every drop of it like a blue grain of sand just to realistically portray the movement of a wave. While there are a few notable exceptions, like the stellar art design of The Little Mermaid, most examples of animated water range from \u2018adequate animation that you\u2019re not supposed to pay any attention to\u2019 to \u2018horribly awkward CGI texture that you can\u2019t help paying attention to.\u2019 I\u2019m looking at you, Gantz.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have never seen animated water that looks as good as it does in Free. They used a seamless blend of 2D and 3D techniques to make the water look not only natural, but alive. Every reflection, every ripple, every bubble and every distortion is captured with the power of a force of nature, and yet with the subtlety of a facial expression. And that\u2019s saying nothing about the water as a character. Yes, I just called the water a character, and maybe even my favorite one in the show. I find the relationship between Makoto and the water to be fascinating, and I actually want to see the show again somewhere down the road just to see if I understand it a little better!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Free! Iwatobi Swim club may not have very good writing behind it, but what it does have is a charismatic energy that will grab you right from episode one and not let you go until long after it\u2019s finished. The amount of love and enthusiasm that went into this show is like night and day when compared to some of Kyoto Animation\u2019s more phoned in projects, and if that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s a visual feast for the eyes of both yaoi fans and normal people alike. It hasn\u2019t been licensed for an English release just yet, but with free fansubs available in all the usual places, I can definitely recommend this for streaming. It\u2019s a solid 8/10, and the water\u2019s great, so leave all doubts in your locker and dive right in!",

            "content": "\"For the team...\" - from the director of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, K-On, Clannad and Lucky Star comes a show about swimming. And you know, I like it. The story follows 5 swimmers, four from middle school to the present (Nanase, Hazuki, Tachibana, Rin), the other a track and field club member who eventually gets won overbfrom Hazuki (Rei) and Rin's little sister, who is also the coach/support for Nanase, Hazuki, Tachibana and Rei. Without spoilers, Rin... Moves on in life without Nanase, Hazuki or Tachibana and this is of course fully explained, and I like how the story shows the guys experiences from bothsides. Nanase is our main character, so we see the experience from his side and how he misses swimming with Rin and sometimes doesn't see the point if he can't swim with his former teammate, and from Rin's side we see how he gets disc...ouraged, and wishes he... could swim with his former teammate... Oh. To be honest the story is fairly weak, but what makes it bearable is the ending, it's really heartwarming and for anyone who's read my Love Live review, you'll understand why four life long friends coming together after a long stint of not seeing each other is heartwarming to moi.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are pretty much there just for support and to flesh out the story, though of course the ending again makes them redeeming. They are all likable at least, but you can tell the story and character is focused on this rivalry between Nanase and Rin. \\n\\n\r\nMust admit, there are pros of course. As well as the ending I keep going on about, and this will be personal, I love swimming IRL. So the premise for the show drew me in, but it's disheartening to know it's kind of just another string to the main ploy of the show, Nanase and Rin. The other is the art - we're talking Clannad or above. It's quite beautiful, BUT - it's really wierd. Because you can't speak of Free! without the male fan service - well, I mean it's for females to enjoy, but all the guys are male... OK, OK. LOTS OF RIPPED HIGH SCHOOL LADS, AND A GIDDY FEMALE TEEN. It just seems jarring to the almost serious relationship between Nanase and Rin. What really took me out of it, and I kid you not, Rin turned his head slowly as his hair was being windswept and cherry blossoms blew in front of his face...\\n\\n\r\nOK, quick rap up. Pros:-\\n\r\n(IMO) premise (as in swimming)\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nRelationship between characters (mainly ending)\\n\\n\r\nCons:-\\n\r\nWeak story\\n\r\nJarring plot threads\\n\r\nLack of real need for support characters\\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime comes with a recommendation to stream, if it seems interesting to you, but not to feel bad if you can't watch it all the way through. 6/10.",

            "content": "(This is a review for all of the Free! series, including Free! EternalSummer, but spoiling neither of them, it is too generic so feel free\\n\r\n                                                                   to read it)     \\n\\n\r\nMizu wa ikitteiru\\n\r\nHito tabi tobikomeba, soichu wa tachimachi kiba wo muki osoi kakate kuru\\n\r\nDakedo, osoreru koto wa nai...\\n\\n\r\nWatching Free! gives you a feeling different from the usual you get when watching anime...like when you're playing a game with storyline and plot-forget Dota 2, remember Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts-and you enter that world. Not necessarily being consumed by it at the point where you can't sense your surroundings or remain ignorant towards the time and place, but willingly letting yourself be absorbed in it, welcoming the reality you're going to enter. Same way Death Note is an anime but also something more, Free! also has a specific like that, although in case it doesn't hit a soft spot in you, it is pretty much an average piece of work. Half of the reason why that happens can be explained, the other half is the combination of infinite factors that are unlikely to be recorded or described, much like not knowing why a hug feels the way it does, a piece of music, a picture.\\n\r\nSo, Free! is set in a seaside town, a town approachable and familiar like one's neighborhood, like the town in a game, seeming impossible to navigate yourself through it at first, but ending up knowing every street and narrow. You know it's not Tokyo or some existent Japanese city...it is the known world you'll find yourself every time you open the episode. It is the Iwatobi highschool, the ocean, the swimming school, the hills and the swimsuit shop...another Konoha, another Hollow Bastion. A good reason to justify that notion would be because of the town's structure and the way the houses are lined up, not wanting to say welcome to a city, a street, but welcome to Free!\\n\r\nAnd inside there a story starts unfolding and characters to act. A story realistic from the aspect of six boys hooked on their hobby and confronting real-life problems, however lacking in realism when it comes to the actual dialogues or extravagant kindness and pure way of thinking, attitude...You can't say that Free! is more of a slice of life genre than it is about sports. It is purely sports genre, only a different kind of it. For it is not presenting the story of some geniuses that could exist somewhere-unlikely-, it shows the story of some gifted people that do exist somewhere. As an anime, it will not make the impossible possible or fire you up to death with the unbelievable result of a game or the unearthly effort of an athlete, and that is exactly why you can relate to it, and perhaps share some of the happiness they feel at times,but also the reason why you will forget it more easily. Kuroko no Basket does inflict strong emotions at you, deluging you with awe and excitement in every game, but it utterly shatters every prospect of you taking up something such as basketball. Free! focuses more at the concept of athletics, emphasizing on the general atmosphere around the world of sports and ultimately stimulating your desire for attaining that kind of life and the perks that come with it...the friends, the friendly antagonism, the quality consumption of time and the healthy fortifying of body and soul.\\n\r\nAs far I am concerned, I consider the unjustified and unrealistic disputes among the characters to be the opposite of a drawback, but the fact that they are foolish remains. Human relationships in Free! as well as the core of the plot is a bit childish, although contributing in the fact that watching Free! feels like entering a fairy tail. At long last, deviation from reality is the only reason we play games or watch anime, to provide ourselves with the extraordinary real life can not provide us with. Moreover, Free! is fun to watch because in each episode things that divert from the usual range of things an anime plot includes happen. The anime won't be filled with scenes of the school, them training, them competing, and them eating...but with the variety and flow of scenes that caused people to call it a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship of sympathy, friendship and rivalry between the boys is noteworthy...at the largest part the positive or negative feelings between them will seem unreasonable, unjustified and illogical, however when it comes down it, the one think it struggles to emphasize through all these, while using swimming to narrate it, is how people mourn childish, pure feelings when they reach an age where they soon will have to grow up. Those feelings that once you remember them you realize that by now, they are merely a shadow of what they used to be, and still you don't want to let them fade...you know you will never experience them the same way you once did, but still, you want to preserve the shadow of them, because you are scared to let them wear completely off...let a part of yourself completely wear off...a part that is important because you liked it...Same way, they obsess over the relay, because they want to remember that important thing they once had, in an effort to find the measures in order to sew it in their current age.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the real drawback, none of the seiyuus' voices matched the characters' appearance or personality, at a point where at times they sounded utterly unreal, yu-gi-oh like. Of course, their lines supported that style but it still ruined the scene in case you noticed it. The background music however, totally makes up for it. Favorite part is when they toss their clothes or hair aside to challenge each other in swimming and there's promptly dubstep to contribute in the tension. All of the background music in general will catch your attention, every important scene will be enhanced with rock music, violin, piano, rap or whatever the respective mood demands. The openings are rock pieces, aiming to pump you up, while the endings pop with cheerful and funny visuals.\\n\\n\r\nFree! is the first anime I have watched where the background art was amazing but inferior to the character drawings. Each one has like a thousand details on him, from the visible muscles in their bodies to their perfect shaped hair and uniquely bright eyes. Haru's eyes are more blue and clear than any form of water and the arrangement of outfits in each episode might make you feel bad for your sense of fashion. The rest is like all well made art nowadays, the colors only might be a little brighter to be in harmony with the anime's cheery nature.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, if you do not mind the easy-going pace, lack of suspense and excessive drama at times, Free! is a notably pleasant break from the enthralling, heart beat enhancing usual anime... \\n\\n\\n\r\nParenthesis...\\n\\n\r\nI do not understand what people mean about manservice, I just watched a really pleasant story, full of summer, water and optimism with characters that were a bit too emotional at times. When a girl moans and rubs her thighs together while tasting Soma's food, yeah I can say fanservice. But, I won't sweat for hidden meaning just because a guy in swimming suit helped another guy in swimming suit out of the pool. We are fortunate enough to have the authority of commenting on another person's serious work, as well as to have hundreds of people read what is us judging a professional's work from our seat in front of the pc. More or less, that person's means of living can be marked as good or bad because of us, so the least we can do is respect that privilege. Nobody grabbed the other's ass, they just showed naked belly, when down to it they have to because it's a swimming themed anime, how do you want it to show swimmers, with snow equipment or maybe focus on their toes...",

            "content": "So as you might expect I had pretty low expectations going into this show. I mean a swimming anime? A MALE swimming anime? I thought i was gonna get nothing but manservice (male fanservice) , engorged crotches, unnecessary stripping, stupid illogical characters who jump at any opportunity to take off their tops (or maybe even bottoms) and show off some SKIN! Oh boy was I surprised.\r\nBelieve it or not, unlike other of Kyo-ani's works (K-on) which is anime about nothing but being cute, this one is about something. There is indeed a universal message that is substantial. Sure, the fanservice is there but, it's nowhere near the equivalent we would get from another show. For example, in a show like Eiken, women are degraded and have ridiculous bodies which you can never naturally achieve. Free!, on the other hand has bodies that any normal swimmers would have, no exaggerations here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are all given their time to shine, they don't stray from what's important and their past's don't distract us from the show. We watch them grow in front of our eyes and they all give us reasons to cheer for them! The chemistry between these well-written characters s believable and helps the plot move forward. Sure, the show doesn't take itself seriously ALL THE TIME, there is some camp here and there and there but the comic relief doesn't ever sidetrack the audience from what is really going on.OH YEAH, THERE'S A PLOT! Behold! Okay, don't go in expecting a deep, thought provoking but hey, what do you expect?\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the animation is crazy good! They replicate olympic swimming and the soundtrack complements the mood very well be it intense, or emotional. As for enjoyment, you will be on the edge of your seat! The music in the start and end are a real treat too! (for both eyes and ears)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Free! is a decent surprise. The result is a show that is pleasing for the eyes, and the ears. It's got solid animation, a great soundtrack and, well-written characters. Who would have known that a SWIMMING anime anime by Kyoto animation (responsible for K-On) could be this much fun?",

            "content": "First of all, I am a boy, and I love girls.\r\nThis anime came from Kyoto Animation, studio that already made Clannad, Lucky Star, K-On, Kyoukai no Kanata and Hyouka. Like it's predecessor, Free! has great quality of art. Nice opening and ending, dynamic movement, cute character, and perfect triceps. I just can't forgot the last one, because it was repeated so fuckin many times in this series. And here we go, my review!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSport. One thing I can say about this genre is, competitive. If it isn't competitive, than it isn't sport anime. But, this one word doesn't fit our main character, Nanase Haruka. Hedoesn't care about competition or personal record. One thing inside his head just feel the water. But, after his friend, Matsuoka Rin, invite him to a relay, everythings change. He and his friends make swimming club, join a competition, even training to get faster!\\n\\n\r\nIt has a nice beginning, isn't it? I watch six episode in marathon because of this. But, this beginning also the one who mess up the story. The beginning about Haruka and Rin makes other character unnecessary. In first six episode, I love Rei and way he thinks. But the way story develop just make him act for the sake of plot. It happens to other character such as Nagisa and Makoto. The bond between Haruka and Rin makes the other main character look like supporting character.\\n\\n\r\nBeside, this series has great side story. There's a lot of drama worth watched. And, oh yeah, I can't miss fanservice. If you're a girl and looking for some nice-looking man with muscular muscle, then this is your show. If you're a straight man, get a life bro, let's watch some ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI strongly believed that characters in Free have pretty common personality. Just say that, easily got scared, too concerned about someone, or answer every question with one word. They don't have unique personality, or rather time to develop their personality. For me, this kind of personality is too two dimentional.\\n\\n\r\nFor supporting character, KyoAni do what they like. They love to make one-line tagline. Something like Chitanda's Watashi, Kininarimasu or Mirai's Fuyukai Desu. They do the same to our supporthing character, Gou! ...Oops i mean, Kou!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can't stand from this series is... a weird fetish that Kou has. Man, it's my first time knowing someone with muscle fetish!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni, so we have a clear answer. Perfect Art, either backgrounds or characters. I can tell they spend a lot of money to make this art. The water, it really looks like living. The way it moves, the way it bursts, and the way it floats. I just can't get enough of it. Hey KyoAni, you did an awesome job!\\n\\n\r\nEnough water, this series also has one questionable thing. Yeah, we talk about swim, and we can't swim using jacket. So, I'm talking about muscle. There's a ton of muscle here. I can understand this is for the sake of fan service, but they make it way too good. I personally think that it will be better if they don't exaggerate the muscle at some scene. Trust me, they'll still look cute with normal muscle\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic, I think this series does it good. It doesn't amazing, and it doesn't bad. So, it just that, fit the anime but has the potential to be better. For the opening, typical sport anime, it looks cool and catchy. The ending quite normal as well. One thing that unique is the voice actors sing the ending themselves.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, this is the end of my review. Free! is an anime with perfect art and worth your time. It feels nice and refreshing to watch this. Ok, see you in my next review!",

            "content": "I remember when the internet was a-buzz about turning Kyoto Animation's little commercial into a full-fledged animation series. Eventually, fans got their \"Swimming Anime\": Free! And while some aspects of this show I liked, overall it lacks depth. Add on a heaping amount of difficult-to-believe melodrama to the shallowness, and well, it leads to some disappointment. Despite these criticisms though, the show still proved to entertain.\r\nI really appreciated that the show catered to predominantly female-minded fanservice. It's about time that this happened! Anime has had a large abundance of predominantly male-minded fanservice, so this was exciting and refreshing. The animation is also for the mostpart very attractive and fluid.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the plot and the characters that is where things start to become difficult to believe. I've been watching anime for years, so I understand that to enjoy a show sometimes you have to suspend disbelief. However, the characters and relationships presented for the most part feel so unplausible... after not hearing from or seeing a friend for years, most kids drift apart, and it's anything but uncommon. So seeing this unusual obsession that every single member of the swim club has with their rival and old friend Rin is confusing, especially since Rin does not treat them kindly in return. The melodrama present between the characters also felt unnecessarily over-the-top, adding to the unnatural interactions amongst themselves. I often found myself laughing during scenes that were intended to be serious and dramatic. It just does not feel real or make any significant emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this was an entertaining and fun series to watch this past summer every week and it had some great new ideas, the execution was in my opinion was very flawed.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this anime was an abomination. A sadistic tease to any and all romantic anime connoisseurs. And the very reasons this anime made me so utterly livid, was for two simple facts:\r\nFirstly, the aesthetic was simply phenomenal. The artists in charge were undoubtedly meticulously planning these sketches. A swimming anime where the main setting is water. The character's trapeziums flexed with elegant ease, droplets of water acquainting themselves with the crevices of their bodies. Their builds\u2014particularly Makoto Tachibana's, were impeccable. Not overly sculpted, but the perfect amount of chisel. Haruka Nanase's slim, but not overly thin, supple body which dancedwith suave movements throughout the water. Nagisa's lolita appeal which contrasts with his subtle dominance and Rei's awkwardly charming butterfly-like essence. The appeal was perfect! Which served as its biggest downfall in my scoring due its staunch contrast with the lack of ANY remote plot besides the shallow childhood conflict over \"free swimming\".\\n\\n\r\nRomantic anime is not simply having angelic characters with the bodies of Greek Gods. The only female suitor who had any chance of penetrating the tightly woven bond of these friends was Gou, but she understood better than anyone who the real romantic interests were...\\n\\n\r\nEACH OTHER. Which leads me to my second biggest issue with the anime. Intentional or not, how could the creators produce these four flowery boys, and neglect to provide the audience with any relief?? No kiss, no bodily fluid exchange, nothing. The closest they came to intimacy was friendly shoulder touching, or the rare occasion of a hug. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe romance was not the big focus, which I can respect. But the plot was so stupidly uneventful. It would be more fitting to categorize it as slice of life rather than sports, because the majority of each episode was monopolized by pointless banter. At this point all the audience can think is \"F**** KISS HIM ALREADY!\", which as you can imagine, is extremely frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime for anyone looking for resolve or substance. It was as pointless as a male prostitute with erectile dysfunction.",

            "content": "I can't believe I'm writing my first review for a series that I don't like, but I will, and here is why:\r\n1) There is this overwhelming misconception/misunderstanding that all (or most) women/girls/females like this show. And this, is very misleading and (slightly) offending.\r\n2) I cannot understand how some people can compliment the show because of its *developed* characters and *interesting* plot. If you enjoy the animation and fanservice, that's 100% fine. Please just don't slip in misleading points by labeling show to be some kind of deep, well-thought plot or overly complex characters that is mostly non-existent. \r\nSo with that long-winded introduction, here is theactual review\\n\\n\r\nNow, I have mentioned before the word \"fanservice.\" I'm trying VERY hard not to be biased, that is why I'm giving this show a score of 5 and not lower. Why? Because most expectedly, I started watching the show for entertainment, you know, a typical light-hearted sporty anime with eye-catching characters. Yes, I DID watch the show for entertainment. And that is why I do NOT mind all the fanservice whatsoever in this series.\\n\r\nThat being said, I did not find much enjoyment from Free!, perhaps except there are bunch of *hotties* getting (unnecessarily) half-naked most of the time and some (poorly-written) humor.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 5/10\\n\r\nDoes Free! have no or absolutely garbage plot? No, it does have a plot, it's just a really linear, silly, and boring story where nothing really happens. \\n\r\nI will (shamefully) admit that I watched Haikyuu, Ace of Diamond and a few others sport series, so I (slightly) hoped to see some sporty element to it. But of course I was wrong, because guess what? the story IS NOT the focus of this anime. I mean c'mon \"look at the poster and the trailer of this show, nothing really screams sports doesn't it?\" (Shame on myself - should have known that better!)\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, the story IS poor, but that is much anticipated. But even when I try to look past all its obvious flaws, I cannot comprehend how silly, disconnected the story goes. Every now and then, we are introduced to new *interesting* characters with some problematic/traumatic past that do...not really mean anything. Even the *peak* (though in all reality virtually non-existent) tension got solved in... 2 episodes. Just what \"amazing plot\" and \"friendship\" are we even talking about?\\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10 & SOUND - 7/10\\n\r\nHaters, let's be honest, no matter how much you dislike the show, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the animation. So let's give it a deserving (and encouraging) score of 8, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 3/10\\n\r\nThis is what kills the enjoyment of the show, at least - for me.\\n\r\nI understand, this show is supposed to be entertaining. No deep, breath-taking or complex story. And I totally agree that simple, light-hearted, entertaining shows can be very captivating as well. However, you at least need CHARACTERS to keep the show going. And this series' cast has very little CHARACTER. No kidding. \\n\\n\r\nHaru is hardly interesting with his stripping habit (which I get it - is supposed to be funny) nor his (supposedly complex) personality - being stuck/hung up in the past with Rin. He just seems like a very empty person to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nRin - oh boy, where do I even start... Everyone has different opinions, and here is mine. I will describe Rin to you in my most honest language. Rin is your typical character who got butthurt because he lost in some competition and decided to come back \"strong.\" Now, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this cliche. Just because a plot device falls into a pre-established trend doesn't make it bad. What makes it bad is the facilitation/development of the character in the show. We are talking about a guy who holds a strong type of emotion namely jealousy/inferiority complex for his childhood friend. He lost to his friend in grade school (yes, grade school) and he's bottled up that emotion all the way to high school. Then BOOM, after some competition, he's just ...opened his eyes to see something completely different, something absolutely amazing and inspiring. Yup, that's how complex his emotion (and the plot) is. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other boys, I honestly feel like they are added out of convenience, because the show just needs ....some more characters. The dudes hardly do anything meaningful other than ...being there and adding to that whole fanservice thing, WHICH, mind you, I get it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT - 4/10\\n\r\nBottom line, if you look for fanservice, look no further, there is a bunch of half-naked men frequently showing off their abs and jumping in the pool for you. But if you really want to enjoy that aspect, you will still have to watch the show disregard everything else. Because if you actually care to know/hope to understand where the story is going, or how certain characters to actually develop personalities.... you will just be very disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd NO, this is NOT a sport anime. Just because it's about swimming doesn't make it a sport anime.",

            "content": "From the minds of the zany, wacky folks at Kyoto Animation (who, as you may recall, brought us K-ON, Clannad, Chunibyou demo koi ga shitai, and Tamako Market) comes Free, a swimming sports anime that can be described as many things. \r\nFree is the secret love story between a boy and his water. Free is also the story about the manly trials and tribulations of being an adolescent male. Free is about the bonding brofest that is high school team sports; it is a testament to the payoff of hard work. But most of all, Free is the story of love and friendship with thefires of youth blazing in the background. \\n\\n\r\nGlistening muscles, dramatic hair flips, wet bodies, gorgeous backdrops, and immensely attractive character designs practically burst out at the viewer, probably to draw our attention away from the other areas where Free is lacking. You see, Free can pretty much be classified as a fanservice anime. Only this time instead of panty shots, jiggling breasts, and I\u2019m-gonna-walk-in-on-you-in-the-shower-and-you\u2019ll-slap-me scenes, we get half naked teenage boys in swimsuits, perfect muscles, flowy hair, and rock hard abs. Yes that\u2019s right, fanservice for the ladies this time. But guess what? It\u2019s still selling sex.\\n\\n\r\nFree is a pretty enjoyable and lighthearted slice of life show. However, it falls short for several reasons. The first problem with Free that you\u2019ll notice is its characters. They\u2019re very cute, but their personalities can pretty much be summed up in a few words. They\u2019re almost lifeless, never really doing much to break out of their generic character archetypes. This hurts the show severely, seeing as in a slice of life anime, characters make or break the show. \\n\\n\r\nHaruka Nanase is a stoic young man who\u2019s passionate about swimming and not much else. His deadpan delivery and expressionless face sometimes serves as fodder for comedic moments. Ironically, Nanase is boring and uninteresting for the same reasons. Hazuki Nagisa is the energetic and mischievous one of the group. Rei Ryuugazaki is the braniac who comically attempts to treat everything like an equation. Makoto Tachibana is the kindhearted and gentle one of the group. Rin Matsuoka is the Tsundere-chan who acts aggressive and rude towards the other four but secretly wants to be their friend deep down inside. Aw, how cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe connection between the boys is explained to us right away. Nagisa, Makoto, Rin, and Haruka all used to swim together when they were kids. They were the best of friends as well, until Rin moved to Australia. Now Rin is back in Japan to swim for a rival high school, and the other boys team up with Rei to form their own swim club to compete against Rin. Aside from this, we don\u2019t learn much about the other character\u2019s pasts. Rin and Makoto are the only two who really get some kind of backstory. It\u2019s not much, but it at least tells us a bit about how an important experience in their past shaped the characters we see now. The side characters are hardly even worth mentioning, aside from the hilarious Gou who is probably the manifestation of every fangirl watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to being poor characters, it\u2019s just not that much fun to see them interact. In many a great slice of life anime you can tell the characters play well off each other and interact in fun and interesting ways, much like the playful jabs, laughter, and fun we\u2019d experience with our own real life friends. But in Free, it\u2019s pretty hit or miss, with most of the character\u2019s interactions feeling overdramatic or empty. There\u2019s almost no chemistry between the characters. Haruka seems especially cold and unwilling to interact with the other characters. Only in the very last episode do we see the characters show some heartwarming affection towards each other, but of course not before KyoAni forces a healthy dose of melodrama down our throats. Oh boy does KyoAni love their melodrama. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s in full blast, and it\u2019s as cringeworthy as it has ever been. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was another missed opportunity. What could have been a strong story about friendship and teamwork turns out to be a directionless anime that sometimes seems like it doesn\u2019t know what it wants to do with itself. In that regard, Free is much like KyoAni\u2019s previous work Tamako Market. It\u2019s a fun and enjoyable watch but deteriorates as the plot and characters zigzag this way and that a way before finally ending with a whimper.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are excellent, much like all of KyoAni\u2019s work. Backgrounds are bright, detailed and gorgeous. The character designs are sexy and attractive and the animation is very fluid. You almost feel every breast stroke, every butterfly stroke, and every movement when a character is swimming. And that water, dear gosh, have we ever seen such gorgeous water!? This anime is an absolute treat to look at. The sound is pretty standard mellow and calm slice of life tunes. Though there is one terribad dubstep track that appears a few times throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Free is a highly polished anime that is mostly just for fun and giggles and not much else. It is an enjoyable anime but it\u2019s very hard to deny its faults. Free attempts to sell you with its character\u2019s physical attractions and animation, not with its substance, story, or with great character development. KyoAni\u2019s grand scheme this time was to hook in the ladies with hot guys, and it\u2019s commendable that they\u2019d try to appeal to women for once. But no matter how you paint it, Free is, once again, still selling you sex. It\u2019s the same old broken down car with a new paint job. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little sexiness and fanservice, regardless of if it involves men or women. But using sexiness as a crutch while neglecting story and characters doesn\u2019t make for a good anime\u2026well\u2026unless of course it\u2019s a hentai. Unfortunately (and I really do mean that) Free is not a hentai. It\u2019s recommendable to anyone who just wants a feel good and lighthearted anime, but not exactly for anyone who\u2019s looking for something more. \\n",

            "content": "I can't tell you how much I enjoy reading sports manga and watching sports related shows. I was also a competitive swimmer way back in highschool, so when I saw that an anime was coming out about SWIMMING?! Oh yeah, I just had to watch it. Right from the get go I was mortified, the first episode was pretty much showing off the 'eye candy' cast and establishing the background that sets up the premise of Free! It was a major struggle to get through most of it, but I made it through and here I am to tell the world about it.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nMan, ifpeople think watching competitive swimming is boring, then most of the anime fits right in along with the sport. It's a sport anime in the sense that the boys actually swim in a couple of meets and train for said meets, but it's not quite like other sports anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the characters grow outside of training and competitions unlike in other series where much of the game time is focused on inward self reflection or coming up with strategies. Now there's nothing wrong with this, in fact it makes sense. Swimming is a rather quick sport, with the longest single event lasting only 15 minutes max (relatively). There's not much time for reflection, not much time to think, and no way to strategize. So it's perfectly fine that the boys will be spending down time together outside of the sport to build up their characters and progress through the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it doesn't really feel like the characters grew that much. They stay pretty much the same as when they started except for the main conflict in the story, which had been resolved by the end of the series. Most of the episodes gave tidbits on Haru's and Rin's relationship and why they grew apart, but to me it felt like time wasting filler and I believe that the show could have yielded the same results with a shorter amount of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing was, there was a lot of drama. So much so that I actually laughed at the climax, where all the emotions and baggage were on the table. Again, this is understandable since the target audience is supposed to be teen females. Not to stereotype and whatnot, but girls tend to enjoy stories that enrich character backgrounds,  makes a deeper and more emotional connection to the characters, and a storyline that emphasizes friendship or a relationship through events. However, once again I felt most of the drama was so unnecessary and exaggerated that it turned me away.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did appreciate though was the fact that the sport was explained in depth. This isn\u2019t unusual in sports anime, because it\u2019s assumed that the audience doesn\u2019t know the rules or the terms of the sport. Perhaps I enjoyed it more because I knew what they were talking about.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that this anime did right it was the art and animation. Oh boy did they know how to animate water. Considering that this is a swimming anime, to would be expected that the water would look pretty. However, you can tell from the quality that the animation budget mostly went to the water. I also appreciate the time they spent on the actual swimming itself, the movements were fluid and the boys had good form. This is where the show truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the sound wasn\u2019t as great as the animation, which is pretty disappointing because the sound can make the animation truly outstanding. Most of the soundtrack was pretty average which nothing much in particular standing out. The one bit I liked was the dub step/techno used during the meet, which I thought was a nice touch considering dubstep was and is still pretty popular. The opening theme song is pretty typical as well, which makes the sport look edgy and cool while at the same time dramatizing the relationship between Haruka and Rin. The ending theme is catchy and refreshing, with the voice actors for the characters singing it themselves. I\u2019ll admit, I was really into it for awhile, listening to it on the 4 hour loop on youtube back this last summer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the lack of character growth, I believe the characters didn\u2019t have much personality to grow on in the first place. In Free! we see some pretty common character tropes with a little quirk added to them to make them more comical. Haru is your \u2018tsundere\u2019 who seems to have a romantic love for water; Makoto is the \u2018big brother\u2019 who\u2019s actually easily frightened; Nagisa is the \u2018shouta\u2019 who\u2019s pretty dense; Rin is the \u2018cool guy\u2019 until he talks; and Rin is the \u2018Sporty\u2019 guy who gets discouraged easily. I\u2019ll admit the troupes worked well with each other and they served as perfect fuel for a good chuckle here and there. But in my opinion all of them were pretty two dimensional that relied on their quirk to keep the ball moving.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow even though my rating and my comments might sound harsh, I actually had a good time with the show -- after I got past the hump and made myself watch it. It gave me a good laugh nearly every episode, and it was a bit heartwarming to see the level of friendship that existed between everyone. It\u2019s just I could have done without the filler esque episodes as well as all the drama. If it were up to me it would have been more about the swimming, but I suppose it does well as an introduction to sports anime for those who find that watching an anime on a sport would be boring.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll rewatch the series, as it has been licensed in North America and the dub is currently in production. Nor do I foresee myself watching the second season or the OVA. For me, I stop here and that\u2019s fine by me.",

            "content": "Given the fact that I'm not really into school/slice of life anime, Free! turned out be one of the best anime of this kind I've ever watched. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is just awesome. The plot has many twists, but what I really really like is that the past is strongly connected to the present. The 4 main characters: Haruka, Rin, Nagisa and Makoto (excluding Rei) are childhood friends who share the same passion: swimming. Life had a funny way of gathering them, tearing them apart and then gathering them back together. I will say more about the characters when I get to that point. Althoughthe action might get a little boring sometimes there is a lot of comedy and me, who doesn't laugh so easily, I find this anime way too funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The characters are designed very elaborately, with lots of details especially when it comes to their bodies, hair and facial expression. I really need to mention that the underwater scenes are amazing, again, made with such meticulousity that it almost makes you feel like you're there, swimming alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of people complaining about the background music but you know what? I truly like it. Even the dubstep music in the background of tense situations... it's fine. It fits. There's nothing to complain about. And now, the sound of water, combined with the art...well this creates such a pleasant atmosphere..it's beautiful, not to mention that I didn't encounter any flaws in the musical part of the series so this is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis is finally what I wanted to talk about. The main characters may seem a little stereotypical. Haruka - the silent one, who everyone admires and excels at everything he does. Rei - the obessed-with-laws-of-physics one, who is always calculated and tries to be the best. Makoto - the good friend, who is always there for everyone. Nagisa - the funny and sweet, childish one, who is always joking and doesn't take anything seriously. And then, here's Rin, the most intriguing character I've seen. Unlike Haruka, Rin doesn't have natural talent at swimming so he has to work his ass off to be the best. He always felt inferior to Haruka so he dedicated most of his training hoping he would beat him. At the beginning, Rin was angry with Haruka but then he realised Haruka never meant to hurt him and always supported him, just like a true friend. Many others despise Rin for his stubborness and selfishness but me, on the other hand.. I kind of understand him. I know what is like to try so hard to be number one and there is always one person who is always better than you no matter what you do. I guess I like Rin so much because I found some parts of myself in him.\\n\r\nAnother thing.. despite the fact that the anime has only 12 episodes, there's a huge character development and I apperciate that. That is how you can tell the difference between a good anime and a bad one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed Free! as much as I could. Like I said, there are boring parts and since I don't want to be subjective, and give this anime a proper score, I have to admit that there are also flaws. However, if it hadn't been for Rin and the strong conflict he created, I would've rated this lower. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf I had to use a single word to describe Free!, that would be \"beautiful\". Everything is beautiful: the idea of true friendship and how friends stay forever, the complex characterisation and not to mention the art and the sound, which are almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Free! to everyone. No matter if you're a girl or a guy, trust me, this anime is not about a bunch of handsome guys and fan-service. You should really give it a try if you haven't yet.",

            "content": "WARNING: may contain some spoilers and some grammatical mistakes.\r\nFree!... The first show from Kyoto Animation that apparently is fanservice and fanservice only for the ladies. But is that truly right?\r\nNo, it isn't.\r\nBefore you go and say there are naked cute boys going around hugging for the whole show, I want to explain my point of view and why I scored this with a 9.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nIt's not a complicated spot or anything completely special, but it's refreshing, it's about friendship, loyalty, being able to move forward with the help of others and follow YOUR own dream instead of living a lie. Haru, the main character, onlycared about feeling the water since he first started swimming as a kid. He thought that was all that mattered, until Rin shows up and gets him to swim on a relay with him and their other 2 teammates, Makoto and Nagisa. After the amazing experience of swimming with the best teammates you could ask for, Haru, Rin and the others felt something they've never felt before - swimming together in a relay was the best feeling for them. However, they were not completely aware of this, so when Rin goes to Australia to follow his dad's dream and become an Olympic Swimmer , his confidence is shaken when he realizes that something isn't right. Swimming isn't as important for him if he doesn't do it with his best friends, so he assumes he's just weak and gives up on swimming, and so does Haru. \\n\\n\r\nWhen later he races against Haru and wins, he thought he'd be free from the feeling of weekness that surrounded him, but it didn't work. Beating Haru wasn't what he needed to become \"free\". He needed to swim with him again. So, seeing his old teammates forming a swimming club all over again, he feels lonely and doesn't know how to move on. However, in the last episode (the best one of the whole show), friendship saves Rin from the dark hole he was stuck in, and in the process, Haru finally feels complete again.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nI don't give a damn if this design is way too cute or anything, or if the characters have too many muscles--the animation is FLAWLESS. Half assed anime to please the fans, you say? I'd like to see you stuck in a studio and make the animation as realistic as possible. The swimming styles, when they swim and turn in the water, when they dive in... Everything is realistic, and they took the work to animate it the best they could. The movements of the swimming styles follow the real sport rules, and everything is carefully taken care of.\\n\\n\r\nSount (10/10)\\n\r\nThe opening song is by OLDCODEX and it's a really good catchy song, and so is the opening. The ending is sang by the main character's voice actors - it's also catchy and i loved it, so I've got nothing to say about this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nA cool type guy, a silent one, a prince, a shota boy and a glasses dude. It's predictable, yet the development makes up for it. Every character evolves with the help of one another, and if you compare the first episode to the last one, you'll easily realize that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI really did enjoy these series, it always made my Wednesdays. It was refreshing from all the stress i was going through, and not a SINGLE episode was boring/rushed, in my opinion. This anime made me cry in some episodes and laugh my ass off in some others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAs I said above, I enjoyed these series a lot. It's a really big change of work from KyoAni and I think they did an excellent work. They saved the bomb for the final episode, and it worked. I will never forget this anime, and I look forward to next summer so I can see season 2 and hopefully have a really great time with it as I did with this season.\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge this series by what you hear around. Give it a try yourself.",

            "content": "There are various types of sports anime such as basketball, baseball, tennis, football, etc. Now this anime focuses on a different sport called swimming and how it's presented in 'shounen-style'.\r\nStory: 5 - Its about a guy named Haruka Nanase who loves swimming though he quit for a while since his childhood but recently is motivated to swim again so that he'll be able to defeat his childhood friend Rin Matsuoka with the Free Iwatobi Swimming club members. The story is more or less really unoriginal and has nothing new to show us except that it's about swimming. One thing I really hated about free washow unclear it was if it was a shounen or shoujo anime because I think it should've just stuck to one side as it was really irritating the way they presented the swimming like a typical sport-shounen yet had some fangirling moments suited for a shoujo anime. Either way the only good thing about the story was the use of an unused sport as swimming hasn't been explored in an anime before (though in some mangas it has been explored as the main topic).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 - The the art was decent as it had a refreshing feeling to it which is needed for a anime like this so its satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 - I more or less don't remember any of the soundtack, opening or endings which probably means that there was nothing memorable but the voice actors carried out the characters nicely so efforts are applauded.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 - Too many stereotypical and shallow characters but it's satisfactory as the characters did complete their roles well. Though I think a lot of things could have been improved about the characters such as their depth or backgrounds etc but it can't be helped now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5 - If you're dead bored then you will be able to watch this series but overall it doesn't have much of a impact and isn't that enjoyable but that's my opinion and I think i'm being a bit biased as I was kind of ticked of by this series but its suitable for those people who are patient.\\n\\n\r\nPeople Who Liked: Tsuritama, Kuroko No Basuke. Hetalia Axis Powers, Kimi To Boku., Meganebu and Prince of Tennis will enjoy this series as they have a bit of a similar feel to these animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 - Overall, it has its shounen moments howerever, I'd rather recommend this series to people who like shoujo-based anime.",

            "content": "So, I wanted a light-hearted anime to get me back into the medium after finishing my Game of Thrones-marathon. I had previously watched some of Ergo Proxy, but it felt a bit dark to hop into after GoT's overbearing nature. I'm not sure what I expected out of it when I started watching, but\r\nFree! is a good anime.\r\nAnd there's really not too much more to say about it. KyoAni basically made K-ON (just going by what I've seen and impressions, as I haven't actually seen K-ON!)but with dudes in tight clothing and swimming.\r\nThe story of Free! is about as simple as it gets, seeing asthis is a sports anime in a school setting. There's a group of people who like a sport. The sport happens to be competitive swimming. They start a club at their school (Do Japanese people not have local or regional clubs on youth levels? It seems like there's always in-school clubs that are the go-to places to train. Then again, maybe I'm one of the minority of people here.) They go through some stuff to be able to start the club and get members, and then it's off to the races (literally) after a training arc. The writing us usually pretty good, and there was some intrigue about the characters' common past, but it wasn't executed particularly well when actually revealed and the writing in general took a nosedive from there. Not to the extent of tearing the show down, but it feels like the show is kind of treading water until the second season, and just wanted to get all the story out of the way so it could focus on the team in the future. I understand that philosophy, but I don't agree with it. There needed to be a better mix between the story and sport, seeing as some of the scenes towards the end felt extremely redundant.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most sports series that aren't hyper-specific in the mechanisms of the sport, Free! is a character-focused show. It's got a pretty decent sized cast (7 central characters) and most are given ample screen-time. Do note that they are extremely generic for the type of series this is. If you've seen a sports series, you will have stumbled into more than a few of these.\\n\\n\r\nHaru is the resident sports fanatic. The twist on this in Free! is that he's kind of indifferent when it comes to actually competing (though I assume it will change in the future, since I just found out there's a sequel airing right now), and just wants to be in the water - so much that he tends to soak in his bathtub when he's not in school. From what I can tell, he lives alone, or at least very independently. Only time he shows some actual motivation is when his rival is involved. Always swims freestyle (front crawl), which is where the title stems from.\\n\r\n    And that rival is Rin. A member for what seemed like a short time of the same swimming club as Haru when they were kids (they're currently 17), he later left for Australia to chase his dream of becoming an Olympic swimmer, which he chases to fulfil it for his father, who never got to reach it. While acting hostile and/or indifferent to Haru and the rest, he's clearly no antagonist and still wants something from them, but whether that's just competitive rivalry or friendship is yet to be seen. Said to be very good at butterfly stroke, but is shown to be proficient at others as well.\\n\r\n    Makoto is the reliable guy, and obviously also team captain (with Haru taking the supposedly superfluous position of vice-captain), keeping the group together. He's got a deep-rooted problem that makes his life in the swimming club a bit odd when it's time for a training camp of just vacation - he's afraid of the ocean. I'll get more into that later. Swims backstroke for the club.\\n\r\n    Nagisa is the energy bunny and relentless optimist of the group. He also fulfils what I suppose is the moe-role, but for guys (I'm sure there's even a fucking term for it). Breaststroke-specialist (heh) for the club.\\n\r\n    Rei is the guy they picked up to fill final spot on the team. He's the brains of the squad, and only joins after thinking that Haru's swimming looks beautiful (he only likes beautiful things, apparently, so the clich\u00e9s won't stop on the Rei-train any time soon). However, as he joins the club, a problem of his might throw a spanner in the works - he can't swim. This is used for comic relief until it's not funny, but to the series' credit, they do get away from it rather quickly after.\\n\r\n    To the sort of expendable charters then. First is Gou (but she likes to be called Kou), the younger sister of Rin. She steps into the position of club manager to help the club initially get started and is the one to plan training sessions and the like. She's pretty obsessed with muscles, which is used to some comedic effect at times.\\n\r\n    And finally there's Miss Ame, the class' home-room teacher, and then club advisor (you basically need one to be legitimate, is my understanding after my years of watching anime). It's hinted she's had a job that's related to swimsuits, and it's strongly hinted that is was as a swimsuit model.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is pretty alright, but it's, as said earlier, very generic. The gimmick that brings the boys together is that they all have girly names, and Gou has a manly one. All the characters have a role to play, and it's made more important than them actually having characters (even though they clearly do, but they're moulded to fit the part).\\n\\n\r\nFree!'s strength is probably how damned easy it is to watch. It's incredibly easy-going, even in it's few serious scenes and you can follow the story (the little there is to be followed anyhow) with ease. You could probably watch without subs and still have a good idea about what's going on. I suppose that's actually a pretty big achievement in itself, now that I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAdding to the delight of watching is the absolutely superb animation. The character designs are excellent and very well animated. I think they mix normal animation and CG during some of the in-water scenes, but I could be mistaken. In any case, it's gorgeous. It's easily the best animated show in Kyoani's portfolio.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is good in general, although some of the actors kind of flub the emotional dialogue at times, just reverting to the normal style of voice-cracking screaming/shouting, or just not sounding like they care.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some fan-service in the series, but to discuss it I would have to bring up gender roles and sexuality in media in general, which would be tedious and stuff. It's very bearable, and you might in fact like it.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, if you like watching good-looking anime boys do things, you'll enjoy the series. If you enjoy sports stories, you'll enjoy this. Free! is an amalgamation of the two and does its thing very by-the-book, so you get what's on the cover. It's good, but not more, and that's okay.",

            "content": "The loud hubbub regarding the announcement of Free! is quite understandable. Here is the animation studio, KyoAni best known for creating and specializing moe for anime fanboys,  producing an anime that is aimed at girls and fujoshi! The particular outcry by the male otaku population is funny, in my part. The male fanboys attacking KyoAni for betraying them and jumping the shark by producing an anime that is \"outside\" of their territory.The attacks including labels as the \"gay swimming anime\", 'Kuroko's swimming\" and threats of boycott. Thousands of manly tears were cried, loud shouts of angry fanboys could be heard at forums and acrossthe internet. But at the end of that fanboy tunnel, a loud sound could be heard, the frantic screaming of fangirls and fujoshi around the globe. So Free!, become the battleground between KyoAni/Fangirls and their core audience, the male otaku population.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the end, it seems that there is a winner.. KyoAni won the hard fought war.. And their reward: swimming at the pools of money that Free! merchandises and DVD's sold. Fun Fact: Free! DVD's average sold is about 27k, which is their best sale in previous years and sold infinitely better than its 2013 counterpart, Kyoukai no Kanata (in KyoAni sales, it is considered a flop and a disappointment).\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of this intro, here is my review for Free!, the surprising hit anime of 2013.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAs a sport anime, Free! did not particularly stand out. There are many masterpieces on this genre, but Free! won't be among them. The story is your typical generic one that is: boys swimming+ team rivalry + friendship. Not so original, in fact Kuroko's Basketball is the same, just change the sport. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, there are many fleeting similarities between Free! and KuroBas. Both of them being called as fujoshi fan bait, cast of full of pretty boys and homoerotic subtext between characters. What KuroBas lack and Free! advantage is of course, muscles.. lots of muscles. And those muscles and pretty boys made fangirls nosebleed to death in Tumblr.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story is generic one.. (Where am I?).. The first few episodes introduced us to the characters back-story and the creation of their swimming club. Then the middle episodes were the training and the final ones, for the competition. Free! progresses nicely on the story, but its progress is its main weakness.. The characters were revealed, but the swimming part suffered. If you want to see the show because you were a swimming fan, then you will be disappointed because there is a lack of it. Instead, you were treated by ridiculous amount of fanservice including boys trying their swimsuits, attending a festival and showing their muscles. \\n\\n\r\nThis criticism should be lethal one.. But one thing that Free!had done right is the fanservice part weaved on the story. How much fan.. ugghh.. manservice it is? Not telling, but the fact that my nose is bleeding at the end of Episode 6 is very telling. And that is only in Episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nSomeone said that you can replace Free! characters with the main characters of K!On, but it is not clear cut as that.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka - the stoic, serious one\\n\r\nMakoto - the nice best friend\\n\r\nNagisa - the cute one\\n\r\nRei - the meganneko\\n\r\nRin - the rival\\n\\n\r\nAll of them were generic, cut pasted cardboard characters in anime. But they showed development on the series, with the main exception of Nagisa who has never character development on the anime. (I wish he could have one in the Season 2). The core conflict of the characters is their childhood friendship and the resolved tensions with each other. In the end, I think they have grown up..a little.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly like the fan favorite, Makoto who is  very nice (and cute) . He is the best friend of Haruka, and their interactions is a sweet part of the story. They were like an old married couple. Less successful is Rin, because his motivations is not clear cut.. But in the end, it resolves nicely. Rei, is a very adorkable character that is growing in my heart. He is very funny, too. The supporting charcetrs were more or less in the background with the exception of Gou, Rin's sister. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni could animate a trash dump and it will still be amazing as usual. KyoAni' reputation for top notch technical quality is present here. From the animation of water rippling to the backgrounds that screams \"scenery porn\", all of them is fantastic. KyoAni is ace on this department.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the character design should be mentioned. Oh man.. Looking at them, you would surely fall in love with the faces and the muscles, ripped muscles at that. Every main character is the extremely good looking, with bishounen sparkles all over them. the only complaint is the design of Nagisa which is fairly generic ( think Honey of Ouran High School Host Club when he grows up).\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nSound is fairly good with the particular standout, the ED song, Splash Free! It is an energetic, full of danceable tunes sung by the seiyuu. The OP song, Rage On, is good too, with its rocking rhythm. The background music consists pf calming electronic beats which you can found in KyoAni anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice acting, everything is good.. Shout out to Mamoru Miyano for his another great performance as Rin. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of Free! depend on few things:\\n\\n\r\n1. You like KyoAni for their outstanding animation and technical quality.\\n\\n\r\n2. You like a slice of life and sports comedy drama.\\n\\n\r\n3. You like muscles and lots of manservice/homoerotic subtext.\\n\\n\r\nIf you check 1, you will just opine that it is another KyoAni anime that has outstanding technical quality. If you checked 1 and 2, you will like it and will likely find it good. If you check all of the three, you will probably say that Free! is the best thing since sliced bread. If none of them, I think Free! is not for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI really really like Free! and I am looking forward for the season 2 this summer. But Free! is an anime that divides opinion. It is up to you whether you will like it or not, as I do. For me, it does not scale to heights as some of the best animes produced by KyoAni or sports anime like Slam Dunk. Instead, what Free! did to the animation industry is opening/tapping the mainstream fangirl/fujoshi market by having an anime that is well designed, well crafted and very memorable. I am hoping that it will give trends to anime that caters to vastly different demographic market.\\n\\n\r\nActual Objective Score: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nMy Biased Score: 8\\n\\n\r\nDifference: 1.5 points",

            "content": "First of all, I must say that this is my first venture into Sports anime. I'm a sucker for a good slice-of-life anime because I like the realism and the usual pace. I decided to watch this even though I do not like sports. Why? Because swimming isn't like the sports I immensely dislike that require humans to chuck or run around with spherical or oblate objects. \r\nI notice many people talking about fan service, and I was there watching the entire anime in one day wondering where the so called fan service was? I mean, they are swimmers, there are supposed to be halfnaked throughout the whole thing. There we few instances that may have been seen as fan service but really, I've watched anime with fan service and what I saw didn't really feel like fan service. It felt natural. I am a guy and it didn't make me feel awkward one bit because it didn't feel like frikin' fan service. But that's just how I saw it.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't expect to rate this anime as Very Good. But I ended up enjoying it a bit more than I should have. Why? I'm a sucker for friendships like these. These aren't just guys who just exist and are friends. These are friends who share a bond, and mutual goals and ambitions and I can relate a bit because I have such a friend. I like friends like these that don't waste time pretending to be bad ass and give in to peer pressure and stupid sheet like that.\\n\\n\r\nSure the plot could have been a bit better and have more of a purpose than it did, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless, and it did feel like a slice-of-life anime. I enjoyed watching the life of the Iwatobi Swim Club. I look forward to binge-watching the second season.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, WHAT FAN SERVICE?!",

            "content": "Competition is a part of sports and friendship that will never disappear. We want to impress the crowds of people that attend official sporting events and then we want show off to our own special circles. But has our society taken the need of competition and a display of superiority to levels not needed? Or is it something that is a part of our own natural behavior? Whether or not it is natural to us, Free! is the story of when this competition has torn friends apart.\r\nI shall forewarn you, this is a review with spoilers. The story centers around Haruka Nanase who is atalented swimmer and has a genuine love for water. So much that in public he finds it necessary to strip down to the swimming trunks he always wears and bathe in fish tanks. As we see him throughout most of the series, he looks apathetic and indifferent, but he is always said to be smiling on the inside. Since middle school he has never swam competitively, only ever swimming freestyle.\\n\\n\r\nHe quit swimming because of his friend and rival Rin Matsuoka. After returning from foreign lands he challenges Haruka to a race and loses. He sees that after a year so he has had little progress and says that he will quit swimming because of disappointment in himself. However, Haruka blames himself for making Rin quit swimming and vows never to swim competitively again.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes off from there as the once former team reunites and challenges Rin and the school he has joined. By the end we see that all Haruka wants to do is to swim with his friends, nothing else matters. Rin finds that to push himself further he needs the companionship of his friends. Without them, he hits a wall with nobody to push him forward. I think it is wonderful that this sports oriented story has capitalized on the dangers of competition. Making a truly heart grabbing story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever this point is lost to most people because they focus too much on the fantastic muscles each character has. I think it is embarrassing that the male anime viewers are complaining about this. Honestly, have we all not seen how ridiculous the male oriented fanservice gets? Granted, I doubt a high school swimmer would have a body like this, but it is somewhat obtainable through hard work. Not the size of a breast which is determined through genetics. I think it is understandable that there can be female oriented fanservice and I am not going to complain about it. It is just a taste of our own medicine.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation outdid themselves with the animation here. I loved the intro and all the special effects they added in with water. The ending, however, left me with some mixed feelings. I liked it, then it would throw me for a loop. The animation was well down and nothing more can be said about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound had me intrigued as well. The opening song was great, I found myself watching it every time instead of skipping it like I do for most anime. The ending was just as unique, again, it threw me for a loop. I must also congratulate Kyoto for using dubstep. I did not see that coming and while I feel it is out of place, it works. I found the voices to work as well. They fit, so I can\u2019t complain.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a slice of life anime and it is understandable that a moving plot is not always present. However they presented a conflict well and wrapped up that conflict with little distracting from it. Everything had a purpose and it served well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters I found to be forgettable. I anticipated that I would have loved Rei\u2019s character, but found him annoying. I could sympathize with him later on, but he is still not that great. Nagisa, as well, I found a bit annoying. In my opinion, the best designed character in this series is Rin. He has greatest show of emotion by anyone and is completely understandable. I can understand why people like Haruka and that I do treasure the emotion I see change in him during the last few episodes. In fact, in the last two episodes I am sure he showed more emotion than the rest of the entire series. But do we have to make a person dead straight jaded to show this kind of significant change? Makoto brought this kind of realistic emotion change to the table, but often I felt it was just a copy of what was going on before. Smiling, closing his eyes, and tilting his head slightly to the left. I enjoyed Makoto\u2019s gentle nature at the beginning, but it got to a point where I wanted something more and his trouble with the ocean brought that until we fell into the pattern once again. I can\u2019t say these are something other than cookies from the cookie cutter.\\n\\n\r\nI also think it is necessary to mention the actions and familiarity these characters act in. I am not going to criticize it for being seen as just  more fanservice, but actually going to uphold what they have done. I don\u2019t know how it works in Japan, but I am a senior in an American high school and some of the interaction I have seen in Free! is similar to how people in my school act. Hugging and jumping on people happen all the time in my gym class, people are just being friends and it doesn\u2019t have to be anything more than that.\\n\\n\r\nFree! has been a ride that I decided to stick to for twelve episodes. Animation was great and one of the reasons I felt myself returning to it. The plot and characters, what really counts, has made it less than acceptable for me. This show is worth your time if you can stick to it and see past the flaws I have mentioned. I will admit that I was almost moved to tears during the last episode, a true and noteworthy statement about any show I will watch. If you enjoy a nice and relaxing slice of life show, I am sure Free! is for you.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nRounded Total: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "Ok, first, a straight, young guy talking here. I've watched this anime in about two days, about 6 episodes per day. That's how captivating this anime was for me. It's probably the highest number of episodes of an anime I've ever watched in such a short time, but anyways, let's get to the actual review:\r\nI am aware of all the hating coming from one side of the anime community, I mean, I hate fanservice myself. But firstly: I usually am capable of ignoring it if the story/action/characters of the anime are good; and secondly: interestingly enough I didn't have much of a problem with thefanservice in this show, i.e. girl- or gay-oriented fanservice. Being able to simply laugh at the gayish scenes made this anime kind of more enjoyable to me. In fact, that's probably the best proof that I'm heterosexual (not that there is any problem with being gay or of any other sexual orientation, never).\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, until about the first 4 or 5 episodes I thought it was ok, simple, but still good, amusing and catching, while including a lot of clich\u00e9s or tropes, but that's ok. The cool thing is that it is still done very professionally and high quality-like. Using a clich\u00e9 isn't bad in itself, but there are ways of doing it well and ways of doing it wrong, this show does it splendidly, IMO. The scenes are kind of predictable and unpredictable at the same time: you guess what is going to happen, still you are amazed at how good it is performed. But entering the second half of the series... it still goes perfectly in the line of what has happened before, it just gets way more gripping and intense. [SPOILER ALERT] Seeing the protagonists entering in professional competitions and understanding the feelings of the characters (which, again, is done so well) really awakens that sports-spirit inside you. [SPOILER ALERT END] The relationships among the characters also brings back that old topic of \"valuing true friendship\" (again, another clich\u00e9), which, IMO, is one of the most important matters in general, be it in an anime, movie, reallife-story... But let's get to the character development.\\n\\n\r\nWithout including the time of when the characters are kids or small teenies, the actual story lasts for MoL 2-3 seasons/ half a year. If you distribute this among 12 episodes, it's pretty obvious that you can't afford too much character development. Still, I really enjoyed the personalities of each of the main characters (including the girls and EXCLUDING Nitori), as they were all quite different, yet complementing each other. [SPOILER ALERT] It's no secret that I specially liked the development between Haru and Rin, and also the backstory of Rin's father (the tragedy during the tsunami). [SPOILER ALERT END] Repeating this for the one thousandth time, they were no unique or revolutionizing types of character, but they were very enjoyable (and that's the most important thing to me).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art and Sound I can only say that both are outstanding. The animations are at the peak of what the anime industry could deliver during the time of the release and specially \"the diving in the water\" and, of course, the bodies of the characters are just beautiful (I am aware that this might sound gayish, but damn do I wish to have their bodies xD). Both the opening and the ending fit the anime very well and during the 12 episodes I almost always listened to them (if I didn't it was for the simple reason that I couldn't wait to see what would happen next). The OST is probably the only reason why the \"sound\" section didn't make it to a \"10\". It's in no way bad, but it just didn't have any special track for me to remember. Be it an epic, a sad or a serious song, they all are good, but no track in the OST actually made me want to search it up on YT.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: To me, there were only a few minor things that annoyed me at some points, though nothing which the rest of the show couldn't make me forget. For the rest, I can confidently say that I'm happy I got to watch this anime as it made me laugh a lot while still following an interesting, emotional and exciting storyline, and coming to remember the vital importance of things like sports and friendship.",

            "content": "About two weeks ago, I went into Gaia\u2019s AMC forum to post a poll, asking the community what 2013 anime I should watch next. I expected Silver Spoon or Gatchaman Crowds to win, and they received 7 and 10 votes, respectively placing in second and third place. The winner, with 24 votes, was Free! Iwatobi Swimming Club, the notorious #SwimmingAnime that came into existence thanks to a viral animation sample, and an almost revolutionary \u2018give us this show\u2019 petition.\r\nSo, with almost half of that poll\u2019s 60 voters daring me to dive head first into manservice oblivion, what was I supposed to do? Was I supposedto turn my head, and avoid making eye contact with that glistening banana-hammock of a show? Or was I supposed to test my mettle as a critic against one of the most manhood threatening shows to be aired last year? Well, let\u2019s think about that. I love Princess Tutu and Ouran High School Host Club, and I was a motherf(yay)ing brony for two years. So bring it on, you rabid hords of Fujoshi! I watched your #Swimminganime, and now, I\u2019m going to review the crap out of it!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Free! begins with four ten year old boys. They consist of Haruka, a quiet boy who only feels at home in the water; Makoto, a laid back best friend character who\u2019s afraid of the ocean; Nagisa, an excitable little moppet who should, by all conceivable logic, be voiced in English by Greg Ayres; And Rin, an outgoing boy whose connection to his friends can only be trumped by his much much larger ambitions. They were brought together by their love of swimming, although they quickly adopt an inside joke that \u2018fate threw them together for having girly names.\u2019 In any case, after their first big relay tournament triumph, Rin leaves the group to go to a middle school in Australia to train so he can become an olympic swimmer. Nagisa also winds up going to a different school, and the fellowship is disbanded.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the first year of high school, when Haruka, Makoto, and Nagisa are finally reunited, and Nagisa convinces them to start the long-defunct Iwatobi Swim club back up again! Because, as we all know, \u201cHigh school club\u201d has been it\u2019s own ubiquitous genre ever since Haruhi Suzumiya started grabbing up all the money in the world. With Rin\u2019s little sister as their manager, a shy teacher for their faculty adviser, and a brand new team mate in the meticulous beauty-obsessed Rei, and the sudden reappearance of Rin as their new rival from another school, their swim club has only just begun to tread water!\\n\\n\r\nBefore we go any further, I should probably address the pink elephant in the room... People refuse to watch this show because it looks gay. Now, I don\u2019t feel like turning this review into a gay rights rant, nor do I want to make any statements about whether or not I consider homosexuality(or lack thereof) an indicator of quality. Maybe there are some good yaoi shows out there... I don\u2019t know. The ones I\u2019ve seen so far sucked. So instead, I\u2019m only going to address whether or not Free is, in a literal sense, gay. Like Hakkenden was.\\n\\n\r\nAbout a year ago, I was dared by a friend to rent and watch Magic Mike. At the end of it, I said the exact same thing that I said in regards to Free. \u201cWait a second... That wasn\u2019t that gay at all.\u201d Yes, both shows feature plenty of scantily clad men to thrill and chill the straight women and gay men of the audience, but both stories take place in a setting where wearing next to nothing makes perfect sense in context... Stripping in one, swimming in the other. I can understand some guys not wanting to watch a show about male strippers, but if the sight of guys taking their shirts off to swim makes you uncomfortable, then buddy, you\u2019ve got issues.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show isn\u2019t even a yaoi. There\u2019s barely any romantic content in the first place, save for one side character\u2019s crush on Kou, but when you really pay attention, Free! is nothing more than a gender swap of Kyoto Animation\u2019s many female-centric slife-of-life shows. Yes, the guys use cutesy honorifics and nicknames, and they seem to have an uncommonly close relationship, but nobody throws around the word \u201cGay\u201d while watching Lucky Star, K-ON! or Tamako Market... Well, maybe in the pejorative sense... But in any case, while there may be some shounen-ai elements floating around in this pool, they\u2019re subtle, and too subtextual to really effect the story in any way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the story... Okay, a few paragraphs ago, I briefly compared this show to Magic Mike, but unfortunately, the comparison shall go no further. Magic Mike was an awesome movie, and Free! is just kind of... Okay. I hate to be mean to it, because the characters are likeable, and I *was* constantly clicking the next episode button, so it was able to hold my attention pretty well... Free! is Kyoto Animation\u2019s first ever sports based anime, which automatically means it has more plot than half of the work they\u2019ve put out thus far, but even with that to boast about, Free! is still just a little too passive for it\u2019s own good. They go to a few swimming competitions, but the stakes of these events are never more than just \u201cWe wanna swim together and get a higher budget for our club.\u201d The only time this story has any gravity to it is when our heroes are stuck in the ocean during a storm, and they never seen to desire anything other than \u201cLet\u2019s be friends and strengthen our bond.\u201d That makes for a very pleasant tone, but it doesn\u2019t make for a very engaging series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing in this story that really develops is the relationship between the five leading males. Their growth as individuals is negligible, aside from Rin, although I can\u2019t really complain, because they\u2019re all really likeable characters. Their occasional coach is only ever used when he\u2019s convenient, and their faculty adviser makes little to no effort to distinguish herself as anything other than a recycled K-ON! trope. Kou, the group\u2019s manager, is not used nearly enough, considering how much potential she has. If she actually had some character arc, even for a single episode, we could have learned something about her as a person... We could have learned why she cares so much about the swim club, and hey, we could have learned why she never swims a single stroke despite being an official member. Seriously, I get that she\u2019s non-athletic and is too female to compete alongside her team mates, but they visit a beach for crying out loud! She brings a swimsuit, and then just hangs around with the teacher! Why?!\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, it\u2019s a decent, pleasant show, and while I didn\u2019t find the plot particularly engaging, I still enjoyed watching it. The chemistry of the characters more than made up for their lack of depth. I\u2019m monolingual, but the japanese dub sounded really good, and I had no problems at all with the actual dialogue. I didn\u2019t find all of the humor effective, but it had enough good jokes to not be boring at any point. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s a happy little distraction, just like K-ON!. Normally, I\u2019d give this kind of show a 7/10, but there\u2019s one more aspect of this show that I forgot to mention. And that aspect is...\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation. Dear God in heaven, this is one of the top ten best looking animes I\u2019ve ever seen. Kyoto Animation may not be known for having stellar stories... Haruhi, Clannad and Chuunbiyoh being the exceptions... but it always brings great animation to the table, and from that perspective alone, this is the best looking show they\u2019ve ever released. The backgrounds and character designs are outstanding, the attention to detail is mind blowing, the characters are capable of a full range of graceful, fluid motion, and the water... Oh my God.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the animation demo that this show was originally based on was released so Kyoto Animation could boast about how well it could animate water. But in the words of Kid Rock, it ain\u2019t bragging if you back it up. If you\u2019re not taking a simplistic approach, water can be one of the most notoriously difficult things to animate. There are some CGI movies where they have to treat every drop of it like a blue grain of sand just to realistically portray the movement of a wave. While there are a few notable exceptions, like the stellar art design of The Little Mermaid, most examples of animated water range from \u2018adequate animation that you\u2019re not supposed to pay any attention to\u2019 to \u2018horribly awkward CGI texture that you can\u2019t help paying attention to.\u2019 I\u2019m looking at you, Gantz.\\n\\n\r\nBut I have never seen animated water that looks as good as it does in Free. They used a seamless blend of 2D and 3D techniques to make the water look not only natural, but alive. Every reflection, every ripple, every bubble and every distortion is captured with the power of a force of nature, and yet with the subtlety of a facial expression. And that\u2019s saying nothing about the water as a character. Yes, I just called the water a character, and maybe even my favorite one in the show. I find the relationship between Makoto and the water to be fascinating, and I actually want to see the show again somewhere down the road just to see if I understand it a little better!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Free! Iwatobi Swim club may not have very good writing behind it, but what it does have is a charismatic energy that will grab you right from episode one and not let you go until long after it\u2019s finished. The amount of love and enthusiasm that went into this show is like night and day when compared to some of Kyoto Animation\u2019s more phoned in projects, and if that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s a visual feast for the eyes of both yaoi fans and normal people alike. It hasn\u2019t been licensed for an English release just yet, but with free fansubs available in all the usual places, I can definitely recommend this for streaming. It\u2019s a solid 8/10, and the water\u2019s great, so leave all doubts in your locker and dive right in!",

            "content": "\"For the team...\" - from the director of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, K-On, Clannad and Lucky Star comes a show about swimming. And you know, I like it. The story follows 5 swimmers, four from middle school to the present (Nanase, Hazuki, Tachibana, Rin), the other a track and field club member who eventually gets won overbfrom Hazuki (Rei) and Rin's little sister, who is also the coach/support for Nanase, Hazuki, Tachibana and Rei. Without spoilers, Rin... Moves on in life without Nanase, Hazuki or Tachibana and this is of course fully explained, and I like how the story shows the guys experiences from bothsides. Nanase is our main character, so we see the experience from his side and how he misses swimming with Rin and sometimes doesn't see the point if he can't swim with his former teammate, and from Rin's side we see how he gets disc...ouraged, and wishes he... could swim with his former teammate... Oh. To be honest the story is fairly weak, but what makes it bearable is the ending, it's really heartwarming and for anyone who's read my Love Live review, you'll understand why four life long friends coming together after a long stint of not seeing each other is heartwarming to moi.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are pretty much there just for support and to flesh out the story, though of course the ending again makes them redeeming. They are all likable at least, but you can tell the story and character is focused on this rivalry between Nanase and Rin. \\n\\n\r\nMust admit, there are pros of course. As well as the ending I keep going on about, and this will be personal, I love swimming IRL. So the premise for the show drew me in, but it's disheartening to know it's kind of just another string to the main ploy of the show, Nanase and Rin. The other is the art - we're talking Clannad or above. It's quite beautiful, BUT - it's really wierd. Because you can't speak of Free! without the male fan service - well, I mean it's for females to enjoy, but all the guys are male... OK, OK. LOTS OF RIPPED HIGH SCHOOL LADS, AND A GIDDY FEMALE TEEN. It just seems jarring to the almost serious relationship between Nanase and Rin. What really took me out of it, and I kid you not, Rin turned his head slowly as his hair was being windswept and cherry blossoms blew in front of his face...\\n\\n\r\nOK, quick rap up. Pros:-\\n\r\n(IMO) premise (as in swimming)\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nRelationship between characters (mainly ending)\\n\\n\r\nCons:-\\n\r\nWeak story\\n\r\nJarring plot threads\\n\r\nLack of real need for support characters\\n\\n\r\nAnd this anime comes with a recommendation to stream, if it seems interesting to you, but not to feel bad if you can't watch it all the way through. 6/10.",

            "content": "(This is a review for all of the Free! series, including Free! EternalSummer, but spoiling neither of them, it is too generic so feel free\\n\r\n                                                                   to read it)     \\n\\n\r\nMizu wa ikitteiru\\n\r\nHito tabi tobikomeba, soichu wa tachimachi kiba wo muki osoi kakate kuru\\n\r\nDakedo, osoreru koto wa nai...\\n\\n\r\nWatching Free! gives you a feeling different from the usual you get when watching anime...like when you're playing a game with storyline and plot-forget Dota 2, remember Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts-and you enter that world. Not necessarily being consumed by it at the point where you can't sense your surroundings or remain ignorant towards the time and place, but willingly letting yourself be absorbed in it, welcoming the reality you're going to enter. Same way Death Note is an anime but also something more, Free! also has a specific like that, although in case it doesn't hit a soft spot in you, it is pretty much an average piece of work. Half of the reason why that happens can be explained, the other half is the combination of infinite factors that are unlikely to be recorded or described, much like not knowing why a hug feels the way it does, a piece of music, a picture.\\n\r\nSo, Free! is set in a seaside town, a town approachable and familiar like one's neighborhood, like the town in a game, seeming impossible to navigate yourself through it at first, but ending up knowing every street and narrow. You know it's not Tokyo or some existent Japanese city...it is the known world you'll find yourself every time you open the episode. It is the Iwatobi highschool, the ocean, the swimming school, the hills and the swimsuit shop...another Konoha, another Hollow Bastion. A good reason to justify that notion would be because of the town's structure and the way the houses are lined up, not wanting to say welcome to a city, a street, but welcome to Free!\\n\r\nAnd inside there a story starts unfolding and characters to act. A story realistic from the aspect of six boys hooked on their hobby and confronting real-life problems, however lacking in realism when it comes to the actual dialogues or extravagant kindness and pure way of thinking, attitude...You can't say that Free! is more of a slice of life genre than it is about sports. It is purely sports genre, only a different kind of it. For it is not presenting the story of some geniuses that could exist somewhere-unlikely-, it shows the story of some gifted people that do exist somewhere. As an anime, it will not make the impossible possible or fire you up to death with the unbelievable result of a game or the unearthly effort of an athlete, and that is exactly why you can relate to it, and perhaps share some of the happiness they feel at times,but also the reason why you will forget it more easily. Kuroko no Basket does inflict strong emotions at you, deluging you with awe and excitement in every game, but it utterly shatters every prospect of you taking up something such as basketball. Free! focuses more at the concept of athletics, emphasizing on the general atmosphere around the world of sports and ultimately stimulating your desire for attaining that kind of life and the perks that come with it...the friends, the friendly antagonism, the quality consumption of time and the healthy fortifying of body and soul.\\n\r\nAs far I am concerned, I consider the unjustified and unrealistic disputes among the characters to be the opposite of a drawback, but the fact that they are foolish remains. Human relationships in Free! as well as the core of the plot is a bit childish, although contributing in the fact that watching Free! feels like entering a fairy tail. At long last, deviation from reality is the only reason we play games or watch anime, to provide ourselves with the extraordinary real life can not provide us with. Moreover, Free! is fun to watch because in each episode things that divert from the usual range of things an anime plot includes happen. The anime won't be filled with scenes of the school, them training, them competing, and them eating...but with the variety and flow of scenes that caused people to call it a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship of sympathy, friendship and rivalry between the boys is noteworthy...at the largest part the positive or negative feelings between them will seem unreasonable, unjustified and illogical, however when it comes down it, the one think it struggles to emphasize through all these, while using swimming to narrate it, is how people mourn childish, pure feelings when they reach an age where they soon will have to grow up. Those feelings that once you remember them you realize that by now, they are merely a shadow of what they used to be, and still you don't want to let them fade...you know you will never experience them the same way you once did, but still, you want to preserve the shadow of them, because you are scared to let them wear completely off...let a part of yourself completely wear off...a part that is important because you liked it...Same way, they obsess over the relay, because they want to remember that important thing they once had, in an effort to find the measures in order to sew it in their current age.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the real drawback, none of the seiyuus' voices matched the characters' appearance or personality, at a point where at times they sounded utterly unreal, yu-gi-oh like. Of course, their lines supported that style but it still ruined the scene in case you noticed it. The background music however, totally makes up for it. Favorite part is when they toss their clothes or hair aside to challenge each other in swimming and there's promptly dubstep to contribute in the tension. All of the background music in general will catch your attention, every important scene will be enhanced with rock music, violin, piano, rap or whatever the respective mood demands. The openings are rock pieces, aiming to pump you up, while the endings pop with cheerful and funny visuals.\\n\\n\r\nFree! is the first anime I have watched where the background art was amazing but inferior to the character drawings. Each one has like a thousand details on him, from the visible muscles in their bodies to their perfect shaped hair and uniquely bright eyes. Haru's eyes are more blue and clear than any form of water and the arrangement of outfits in each episode might make you feel bad for your sense of fashion. The rest is like all well made art nowadays, the colors only might be a little brighter to be in harmony with the anime's cheery nature.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, if you do not mind the easy-going pace, lack of suspense and excessive drama at times, Free! is a notably pleasant break from the enthralling, heart beat enhancing usual anime... \\n\\n\\n\r\nParenthesis...\\n\\n\r\nI do not understand what people mean about manservice, I just watched a really pleasant story, full of summer, water and optimism with characters that were a bit too emotional at times. When a girl moans and rubs her thighs together while tasting Soma's food, yeah I can say fanservice. But, I won't sweat for hidden meaning just because a guy in swimming suit helped another guy in swimming suit out of the pool. We are fortunate enough to have the authority of commenting on another person's serious work, as well as to have hundreds of people read what is us judging a professional's work from our seat in front of the pc. More or less, that person's means of living can be marked as good or bad because of us, so the least we can do is respect that privilege. Nobody grabbed the other's ass, they just showed naked belly, when down to it they have to because it's a swimming themed anime, how do you want it to show swimmers, with snow equipment or maybe focus on their toes...",

            "content": "So as you might expect I had pretty low expectations going into this show. I mean a swimming anime? A MALE swimming anime? I thought i was gonna get nothing but manservice (male fanservice) , engorged crotches, unnecessary stripping, stupid illogical characters who jump at any opportunity to take off their tops (or maybe even bottoms) and show off some SKIN! Oh boy was I surprised.\r\nBelieve it or not, unlike other of Kyo-ani's works (K-on) which is anime about nothing but being cute, this one is about something. There is indeed a universal message that is substantial. Sure, the fanservice is there but, it's nowhere near the equivalent we would get from another show. For example, in a show like Eiken, women are degraded and have ridiculous bodies which you can never naturally achieve. Free!, on the other hand has bodies that any normal swimmers would have, no exaggerations here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are all given their time to shine, they don't stray from what's important and their past's don't distract us from the show. We watch them grow in front of our eyes and they all give us reasons to cheer for them! The chemistry between these well-written characters s believable and helps the plot move forward. Sure, the show doesn't take itself seriously ALL THE TIME, there is some camp here and there and there but the comic relief doesn't ever sidetrack the audience from what is really going on.OH YEAH, THERE'S A PLOT! Behold! Okay, don't go in expecting a deep, thought provoking but hey, what do you expect?\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the animation is crazy good! They replicate olympic swimming and the soundtrack complements the mood very well be it intense, or emotional. As for enjoyment, you will be on the edge of your seat! The music in the start and end are a real treat too! (for both eyes and ears)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Free! is a decent surprise. The result is a show that is pleasing for the eyes, and the ears. It's got solid animation, a great soundtrack and, well-written characters. Who would have known that a SWIMMING anime anime by Kyoto animation (responsible for K-On) could be this much fun?",

            "content": "First of all, I am a boy, and I love girls.\r\nThis anime came from Kyoto Animation, studio that already made Clannad, Lucky Star, K-On, Kyoukai no Kanata and Hyouka. Like it's predecessor, Free! has great quality of art. Nice opening and ending, dynamic movement, cute character, and perfect triceps. I just can't forgot the last one, because it was repeated so fuckin many times in this series. And here we go, my review!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSport. One thing I can say about this genre is, competitive. If it isn't competitive, than it isn't sport anime. But, this one word doesn't fit our main character, Nanase Haruka. Hedoesn't care about competition or personal record. One thing inside his head just feel the water. But, after his friend, Matsuoka Rin, invite him to a relay, everythings change. He and his friends make swimming club, join a competition, even training to get faster!\\n\\n\r\nIt has a nice beginning, isn't it? I watch six episode in marathon because of this. But, this beginning also the one who mess up the story. The beginning about Haruka and Rin makes other character unnecessary. In first six episode, I love Rei and way he thinks. But the way story develop just make him act for the sake of plot. It happens to other character such as Nagisa and Makoto. The bond between Haruka and Rin makes the other main character look like supporting character.\\n\\n\r\nBeside, this series has great side story. There's a lot of drama worth watched. And, oh yeah, I can't miss fanservice. If you're a girl and looking for some nice-looking man with muscular muscle, then this is your show. If you're a straight man, get a life bro, let's watch some ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI strongly believed that characters in Free have pretty common personality. Just say that, easily got scared, too concerned about someone, or answer every question with one word. They don't have unique personality, or rather time to develop their personality. For me, this kind of personality is too two dimentional.\\n\\n\r\nFor supporting character, KyoAni do what they like. They love to make one-line tagline. Something like Chitanda's Watashi, Kininarimasu or Mirai's Fuyukai Desu. They do the same to our supporthing character, Gou! ...Oops i mean, Kou!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can't stand from this series is... a weird fetish that Kou has. Man, it's my first time knowing someone with muscle fetish!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni, so we have a clear answer. Perfect Art, either backgrounds or characters. I can tell they spend a lot of money to make this art. The water, it really looks like living. The way it moves, the way it bursts, and the way it floats. I just can't get enough of it. Hey KyoAni, you did an awesome job!\\n\\n\r\nEnough water, this series also has one questionable thing. Yeah, we talk about swim, and we can't swim using jacket. So, I'm talking about muscle. There's a ton of muscle here. I can understand this is for the sake of fan service, but they make it way too good. I personally think that it will be better if they don't exaggerate the muscle at some scene. Trust me, they'll still look cute with normal muscle\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic, I think this series does it good. It doesn't amazing, and it doesn't bad. So, it just that, fit the anime but has the potential to be better. For the opening, typical sport anime, it looks cool and catchy. The ending quite normal as well. One thing that unique is the voice actors sing the ending themselves.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, this is the end of my review. Free! is an anime with perfect art and worth your time. It feels nice and refreshing to watch this. Ok, see you in my next review!",

            "content": "I remember when the internet was a-buzz about turning Kyoto Animation's little commercial into a full-fledged animation series. Eventually, fans got their \"Swimming Anime\": Free! And while some aspects of this show I liked, overall it lacks depth. Add on a heaping amount of difficult-to-believe melodrama to the shallowness, and well, it leads to some disappointment. Despite these criticisms though, the show still proved to entertain.\r\nI really appreciated that the show catered to predominantly female-minded fanservice. It's about time that this happened! Anime has had a large abundance of predominantly male-minded fanservice, so this was exciting and refreshing. The animation is also for the mostpart very attractive and fluid.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the plot and the characters that is where things start to become difficult to believe. I've been watching anime for years, so I understand that to enjoy a show sometimes you have to suspend disbelief. However, the characters and relationships presented for the most part feel so unplausible... after not hearing from or seeing a friend for years, most kids drift apart, and it's anything but uncommon. So seeing this unusual obsession that every single member of the swim club has with their rival and old friend Rin is confusing, especially since Rin does not treat them kindly in return. The melodrama present between the characters also felt unnecessarily over-the-top, adding to the unnatural interactions amongst themselves. I often found myself laughing during scenes that were intended to be serious and dramatic. It just does not feel real or make any significant emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this was an entertaining and fun series to watch this past summer every week and it had some great new ideas, the execution was in my opinion was very flawed.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this anime was an abomination. A sadistic tease to any and all romantic anime connoisseurs. And the very reasons this anime made me so utterly livid, was for two simple facts:\r\nFirstly, the aesthetic was simply phenomenal. The artists in charge were undoubtedly meticulously planning these sketches. A swimming anime where the main setting is water. The character's trapeziums flexed with elegant ease, droplets of water acquainting themselves with the crevices of their bodies. Their builds\u2014particularly Makoto Tachibana's, were impeccable. Not overly sculpted, but the perfect amount of chisel. Haruka Nanase's slim, but not overly thin, supple body which dancedwith suave movements throughout the water. Nagisa's lolita appeal which contrasts with his subtle dominance and Rei's awkwardly charming butterfly-like essence. The appeal was perfect! Which served as its biggest downfall in my scoring due its staunch contrast with the lack of ANY remote plot besides the shallow childhood conflict over \"free swimming\".\\n\\n\r\nRomantic anime is not simply having angelic characters with the bodies of Greek Gods. The only female suitor who had any chance of penetrating the tightly woven bond of these friends was Gou, but she understood better than anyone who the real romantic interests were...\\n\\n\r\nEACH OTHER. Which leads me to my second biggest issue with the anime. Intentional or not, how could the creators produce these four flowery boys, and neglect to provide the audience with any relief?? No kiss, no bodily fluid exchange, nothing. The closest they came to intimacy was friendly shoulder touching, or the rare occasion of a hug. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe romance was not the big focus, which I can respect. But the plot was so stupidly uneventful. It would be more fitting to categorize it as slice of life rather than sports, because the majority of each episode was monopolized by pointless banter. At this point all the audience can think is \"F**** KISS HIM ALREADY!\", which as you can imagine, is extremely frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime for anyone looking for resolve or substance. It was as pointless as a male prostitute with erectile dysfunction.",

            "content": "I can't believe I'm writing my first review for a series that I don't like, but I will, and here is why:\r\n1) There is this overwhelming misconception/misunderstanding that all (or most) women/girls/females like this show. And this, is very misleading and (slightly) offending.\r\n2) I cannot understand how some people can compliment the show because of its *developed* characters and *interesting* plot. If you enjoy the animation and fanservice, that's 100% fine. Please just don't slip in misleading points by labeling show to be some kind of deep, well-thought plot or overly complex characters that is mostly non-existent. \r\nSo with that long-winded introduction, here is theactual review\\n\\n\r\nNow, I have mentioned before the word \"fanservice.\" I'm trying VERY hard not to be biased, that is why I'm giving this show a score of 5 and not lower. Why? Because most expectedly, I started watching the show for entertainment, you know, a typical light-hearted sporty anime with eye-catching characters. Yes, I DID watch the show for entertainment. And that is why I do NOT mind all the fanservice whatsoever in this series.\\n\r\nThat being said, I did not find much enjoyment from Free!, perhaps except there are bunch of *hotties* getting (unnecessarily) half-naked most of the time and some (poorly-written) humor.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 5/10\\n\r\nDoes Free! have no or absolutely garbage plot? No, it does have a plot, it's just a really linear, silly, and boring story where nothing really happens. \\n\r\nI will (shamefully) admit that I watched Haikyuu, Ace of Diamond and a few others sport series, so I (slightly) hoped to see some sporty element to it. But of course I was wrong, because guess what? the story IS NOT the focus of this anime. I mean c'mon \"look at the poster and the trailer of this show, nothing really screams sports doesn't it?\" (Shame on myself - should have known that better!)\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, the story IS poor, but that is much anticipated. But even when I try to look past all its obvious flaws, I cannot comprehend how silly, disconnected the story goes. Every now and then, we are introduced to new *interesting* characters with some problematic/traumatic past that do...not really mean anything. Even the *peak* (though in all reality virtually non-existent) tension got solved in... 2 episodes. Just what \"amazing plot\" and \"friendship\" are we even talking about?\\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10 & SOUND - 7/10\\n\r\nHaters, let's be honest, no matter how much you dislike the show, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the animation. So let's give it a deserving (and encouraging) score of 8, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 3/10\\n\r\nThis is what kills the enjoyment of the show, at least - for me.\\n\r\nI understand, this show is supposed to be entertaining. No deep, breath-taking or complex story. And I totally agree that simple, light-hearted, entertaining shows can be very captivating as well. However, you at least need CHARACTERS to keep the show going. And this series' cast has very little CHARACTER. No kidding. \\n\\n\r\nHaru is hardly interesting with his stripping habit (which I get it - is supposed to be funny) nor his (supposedly complex) personality - being stuck/hung up in the past with Rin. He just seems like a very empty person to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nRin - oh boy, where do I even start... Everyone has different opinions, and here is mine. I will describe Rin to you in my most honest language. Rin is your typical character who got butthurt because he lost in some competition and decided to come back \"strong.\" Now, there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this cliche. Just because a plot device falls into a pre-established trend doesn't make it bad. What makes it bad is the facilitation/development of the character in the show. We are talking about a guy who holds a strong type of emotion namely jealousy/inferiority complex for his childhood friend. He lost to his friend in grade school (yes, grade school) and he's bottled up that emotion all the way to high school. Then BOOM, after some competition, he's just ...opened his eyes to see something completely different, something absolutely amazing and inspiring. Yup, that's how complex his emotion (and the plot) is. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other boys, I honestly feel like they are added out of convenience, because the show just needs ....some more characters. The dudes hardly do anything meaningful other than ...being there and adding to that whole fanservice thing, WHICH, mind you, I get it. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT - 4/10\\n\r\nBottom line, if you look for fanservice, look no further, there is a bunch of half-naked men frequently showing off their abs and jumping in the pool for you. But if you really want to enjoy that aspect, you will still have to watch the show disregard everything else. Because if you actually care to know/hope to understand where the story is going, or how certain characters to actually develop personalities.... you will just be very disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd NO, this is NOT a sport anime. Just because it's about swimming doesn't make it a sport anime.",

Free is also the story about the manly trials and tribulations of being an adolescent male. Free is about the bonding brofest that is high school team sports; it is a testament to the payoff of hard work. But most of all, Free is the story of love and friendship with thefires of youth blazing in the background. \\n\\n\r\nGlistening muscles, dramatic hair flips, wet bodies, gorgeous backdrops, and immensely attractive character designs practically burst out at the viewer, probably to draw our attention away from the other areas where Free is lacking. You see, Free can pretty much be classified as a fanservice anime. Only this time instead of panty shots, jiggling breasts, and I\u2019m-gonna-walk-in-on-you-in-the-shower-and-you\u2019ll-slap-me scenes, we get half naked teenage boys in swimsuits, perfect muscles, flowy hair, and rock hard abs. Yes that\u2019s right, fanservice for the ladies this time. But guess what? It\u2019s still selling sex.\\n\\n\r\nFree is a pretty enjoyable and lighthearted slice of life show. However, it falls short for several reasons. The first problem with Free that you\u2019ll notice is its characters. They\u2019re very cute, but their personalities can pretty much be summed up in a few words. They\u2019re almost lifeless, never really doing much to break out of their generic character archetypes. This hurts the show severely, seeing as in a slice of life anime, characters make or break the show. \\n\\n\r\nHaruka Nanase is a stoic young man who\u2019s passionate about swimming and not much else. His deadpan delivery and expressionless face sometimes serves as fodder for comedic moments. Ironically, Nanase is boring and uninteresting for the same reasons. Hazuki Nagisa is the energetic and mischievous one of the group. Rei Ryuugazaki is the braniac who comically attempts to treat everything like an equation. Makoto Tachibana is the kindhearted and gentle one of the group. Rin Matsuoka is the Tsundere-chan who acts aggressive and rude towards the other four but secretly wants to be their friend deep down inside. Aw, how cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe connection between the boys is explained to us right away. Nagisa, Makoto, Rin, and Haruka all used to swim together when they were kids. They were the best of friends as well, until Rin moved to Australia. Now Rin is back in Japan to swim for a rival high school, and the other boys team up with Rei to form their own swim club to compete against Rin. Aside from this, we don\u2019t learn much about the other character\u2019s pasts. Rin and Makoto are the only two who really get some kind of backstory. It\u2019s not much, but it at least tells us a bit about how an important experience in their past shaped the characters we see now. The side characters are hardly even worth mentioning, aside from the hilarious Gou who is probably the manifestation of every fangirl watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to being poor characters, it\u2019s just not that much fun to see them interact. In many a great slice of life anime you can tell the characters play well off each other and interact in fun and interesting ways, much like the playful jabs, laughter, and fun we\u2019d experience with our own real life friends. But in Free, it\u2019s pretty hit or miss, with most of the character\u2019s interactions feeling overdramatic or empty. There\u2019s almost no chemistry between the characters. Haruka seems especially cold and unwilling to interact with the other characters. Only in the very last episode do we see the characters show some heartwarming affection towards each other, but of course not before KyoAni forces a healthy dose of melodrama down our throats. Oh boy does KyoAni love their melodrama. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s in full blast, and it\u2019s as cringeworthy as it has ever been. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was another missed opportunity. What could have been a strong story about friendship and teamwork turns out to be a directionless anime that sometimes seems like it doesn\u2019t know what it wants to do with itself. In that regard, Free is much like KyoAni\u2019s previous work Tamako Market. It\u2019s a fun and enjoyable watch but deteriorates as the plot and characters zigzag this way and that a way before finally ending with a whimper.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are excellent, much like all of KyoAni\u2019s work. Backgrounds are bright, detailed and gorgeous. The character designs are sexy and attractive and the animation is very fluid. You almost feel every breast stroke, every butterfly stroke, and every movement when a character is swimming. And that water, dear gosh, have we ever seen such gorgeous water!? This anime is an absolute treat to look at. The sound is pretty standard mellow and calm slice of life tunes. Though there is one terribad dubstep track that appears a few times throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Free is a highly polished anime that is mostly just for fun and giggles and not much else. It is an enjoyable anime but it\u2019s very hard to deny its faults. Free attempts to sell you with its character\u2019s physical attractions and animation, not with its substance, story, or with great character development. KyoAni\u2019s grand scheme this time was to hook in the ladies with hot guys, and it\u2019s commendable that they\u2019d try to appeal to women for once. But no matter how you paint it, Free is, once again, still selling you sex. It\u2019s the same old broken down car with a new paint job. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little sexiness and fanservice, regardless of if it involves men or women. But using sexiness as a crutch while neglecting story and characters doesn\u2019t make for a good anime\u2026well\u2026unless of course it\u2019s a hentai. Unfortunately (and I really do mean that) Free is not a hentai. It\u2019s recommendable to anyone who just wants a feel good and lighthearted anime, but not exactly for anyone who\u2019s looking for something more. \\n",

            "content": "I can't tell you how much I enjoy reading sports manga and watching sports related shows. I was also a competitive swimmer way back in highschool, so when I saw that an anime was coming out about SWIMMING?! Oh yeah, I just had to watch it. Right from the get go I was mortified, the first episode was pretty much showing off the 'eye candy' cast and establishing the background that sets up the premise of Free! It was a major struggle to get through most of it, but I made it through and here I am to tell the world about it.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nMan, ifpeople think watching competitive swimming is boring, then most of the anime fits right in along with the sport. It's a sport anime in the sense that the boys actually swim in a couple of meets and train for said meets, but it's not quite like other sports anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the characters grow outside of training and competitions unlike in other series where much of the game time is focused on inward self reflection or coming up with strategies. Now there's nothing wrong with this, in fact it makes sense. Swimming is a rather quick sport, with the longest single event lasting only 15 minutes max (relatively). There's not much time for reflection, not much time to think, and no way to strategize. So it's perfectly fine that the boys will be spending down time together outside of the sport to build up their characters and progress through the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it doesn't really feel like the characters grew that much. They stay pretty much the same as when they started except for the main conflict in the story, which had been resolved by the end of the series. Most of the episodes gave tidbits on Haru's and Rin's relationship and why they grew apart, but to me it felt like time wasting filler and I believe that the show could have yielded the same results with a shorter amount of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing was, there was a lot of drama. So much so that I actually laughed at the climax, where all the emotions and baggage were on the table. Again, this is understandable since the target audience is supposed to be teen females. Not to stereotype and whatnot, but girls tend to enjoy stories that enrich character backgrounds,  makes a deeper and more emotional connection to the characters, and a storyline that emphasizes friendship or a relationship through events. However, once again I felt most of the drama was so unnecessary and exaggerated that it turned me away.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did appreciate though was the fact that the sport was explained in depth. This isn\u2019t unusual in sports anime, because it\u2019s assumed that the audience doesn\u2019t know the rules or the terms of the sport. Perhaps I enjoyed it more because I knew what they were talking about.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that this anime did right it was the art and animation. Oh boy did they know how to animate water. Considering that this is a swimming anime, to would be expected that the water would look pretty. However, you can tell from the quality that the animation budget mostly went to the water. I also appreciate the time they spent on the actual swimming itself, the movements were fluid and the boys had good form. This is where the show truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the sound wasn\u2019t as great as the animation, which is pretty disappointing because the sound can make the animation truly outstanding. Most of the soundtrack was pretty average which nothing much in particular standing out. The one bit I liked was the dub step/techno used during the meet, which I thought was a nice touch considering dubstep was and is still pretty popular. The opening theme song is pretty typical as well, which makes the sport look edgy and cool while at the same time dramatizing the relationship between Haruka and Rin. The ending theme is catchy and refreshing, with the voice actors for the characters singing it themselves. I\u2019ll admit, I was really into it for awhile, listening to it on the 4 hour loop on youtube back this last summer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the lack of character growth, I believe the characters didn\u2019t have much personality to grow on in the first place. In Free! we see some pretty common character tropes with a little quirk added to them to make them more comical. Haru is your \u2018tsundere\u2019 who seems to have a romantic love for water; Makoto is the \u2018big brother\u2019 who\u2019s actually easily frightened; Nagisa is the \u2018shouta\u2019 who\u2019s pretty dense; Rin is the \u2018cool guy\u2019 until he talks; and Rin is the \u2018Sporty\u2019 guy who gets discouraged easily. I\u2019ll admit the troupes worked well with each other and they served as perfect fuel for a good chuckle here and there. But in my opinion all of them were pretty two dimensional that relied on their quirk to keep the ball moving.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow even though my rating and my comments might sound harsh, I actually had a good time with the show -- after I got past the hump and made myself watch it. It gave me a good laugh nearly every episode, and it was a bit heartwarming to see the level of friendship that existed between everyone. It\u2019s just I could have done without the filler esque episodes as well as all the drama. If it were up to me it would have been more about the swimming, but I suppose it does well as an introduction to sports anime for those who find that watching an anime on a sport would be boring.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll rewatch the series, as it has been licensed in North America and the dub is currently in production. Nor do I foresee myself watching the second season or the OVA. For me, I stop here and that\u2019s fine by me.",

            "content": "Given the fact that I'm not really into school/slice of life anime, Free! turned out be one of the best anime of this kind I've ever watched. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is just awesome. The plot has many twists, but what I really really like is that the past is strongly connected to the present. The 4 main characters: Haruka, Rin, Nagisa and Makoto (excluding Rei) are childhood friends who share the same passion: swimming. Life had a funny way of gathering them, tearing them apart and then gathering them back together. I will say more about the characters when I get to that point. Althoughthe action might get a little boring sometimes there is a lot of comedy and me, who doesn't laugh so easily, I find this anime way too funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The characters are designed very elaborately, with lots of details especially when it comes to their bodies, hair and facial expression. I really need to mention that the underwater scenes are amazing, again, made with such meticulousity that it almost makes you feel like you're there, swimming alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI've heard a lot of people complaining about the background music but you know what? I truly like it. Even the dubstep music in the background of tense situations... it's fine. It fits. There's nothing to complain about. And now, the sound of water, combined with the art...well this creates such a pleasant atmosphere..it's beautiful, not to mention that I didn't encounter any flaws in the musical part of the series so this is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis is finally what I wanted to talk about. The main characters may seem a little stereotypical. Haruka - the silent one, who everyone admires and excels at everything he does. Rei - the obessed-with-laws-of-physics one, who is always calculated and tries to be the best. Makoto - the good friend, who is always there for everyone. Nagisa - the funny and sweet, childish one, who is always joking and doesn't take anything seriously. And then, here's Rin, the most intriguing character I've seen. Unlike Haruka, Rin doesn't have natural talent at swimming so he has to work his ass off to be the best. He always felt inferior to Haruka so he dedicated most of his training hoping he would beat him. At the beginning, Rin was angry with Haruka but then he realised Haruka never meant to hurt him and always supported him, just like a true friend. Many others despise Rin for his stubborness and selfishness but me, on the other hand.. I kind of understand him. I know what is like to try so hard to be number one and there is always one person who is always better than you no matter what you do. I guess I like Rin so much because I found some parts of myself in him.\\n\r\nAnother thing.. despite the fact that the anime has only 12 episodes, there's a huge character development and I apperciate that. That is how you can tell the difference between a good anime and a bad one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed Free! as much as I could. Like I said, there are boring parts and since I don't want to be subjective, and give this anime a proper score, I have to admit that there are also flaws. However, if it hadn't been for Rin and the strong conflict he created, I would've rated this lower. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf I had to use a single word to describe Free!, that would be \"beautiful\". Everything is beautiful: the idea of true friendship and how friends stay forever, the complex characterisation and not to mention the art and the sound, which are almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Free! to everyone. No matter if you're a girl or a guy, trust me, this anime is not about a bunch of handsome guys and fan-service. You should really give it a try if you haven't yet.",

            "content": "WARNING: may contain some spoilers and some grammatical mistakes.\r\nFree!... The first show from Kyoto Animation that apparently is fanservice and fanservice only for the ladies. But is that truly right?\r\nNo, it isn't.\r\nBefore you go and say there are naked cute boys going around hugging for the whole show, I want to explain my point of view and why I scored this with a 9.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nIt's not a complicated spot or anything completely special, but it's refreshing, it's about friendship, loyalty, being able to move forward with the help of others and follow YOUR own dream instead of living a lie. Haru, the main character, onlycared about feeling the water since he first started swimming as a kid. He thought that was all that mattered, until Rin shows up and gets him to swim on a relay with him and their other 2 teammates, Makoto and Nagisa. After the amazing experience of swimming with the best teammates you could ask for, Haru, Rin and the others felt something they've never felt before - swimming together in a relay was the best feeling for them. However, they were not completely aware of this, so when Rin goes to Australia to follow his dad's dream and become an Olympic Swimmer , his confidence is shaken when he realizes that something isn't right. Swimming isn't as important for him if he doesn't do it with his best friends, so he assumes he's just weak and gives up on swimming, and so does Haru. \\n\\n\r\nWhen later he races against Haru and wins, he thought he'd be free from the feeling of weekness that surrounded him, but it didn't work. Beating Haru wasn't what he needed to become \"free\". He needed to swim with him again. So, seeing his old teammates forming a swimming club all over again, he feels lonely and doesn't know how to move on. However, in the last episode (the best one of the whole show), friendship saves Rin from the dark hole he was stuck in, and in the process, Haru finally feels complete again.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (10/10)\\n\r\nI don't give a damn if this design is way too cute or anything, or if the characters have too many muscles--the animation is FLAWLESS. Half assed anime to please the fans, you say? I'd like to see you stuck in a studio and make the animation as realistic as possible. The swimming styles, when they swim and turn in the water, when they dive in... Everything is realistic, and they took the work to animate it the best they could. The movements of the swimming styles follow the real sport rules, and everything is carefully taken care of.\\n\\n\r\nSount (10/10)\\n\r\nThe opening song is by OLDCODEX and it's a really good catchy song, and so is the opening. The ending is sang by the main character's voice actors - it's also catchy and i loved it, so I've got nothing to say about this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nA cool type guy, a silent one, a prince, a shota boy and a glasses dude. It's predictable, yet the development makes up for it. Every character evolves with the help of one another, and if you compare the first episode to the last one, you'll easily realize that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI really did enjoy these series, it always made my Wednesdays. It was refreshing from all the stress i was going through, and not a SINGLE episode was boring/rushed, in my opinion. This anime made me cry in some episodes and laugh my ass off in some others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAs I said above, I enjoyed these series a lot. It's a really big change of work from KyoAni and I think they did an excellent work. They saved the bomb for the final episode, and it worked. I will never forget this anime, and I look forward to next summer so I can see season 2 and hopefully have a really great time with it as I did with this season.\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge this series by what you hear around.

            "content": "There are various types of sports anime such as basketball, baseball, tennis, football, etc. Now this anime focuses on a different sport called swimming and how it's presented in 'shounen-style'.\r\nStory: 5 - Its about a guy named Haruka Nanase who loves swimming though he quit for a while since his childhood but recently is motivated to swim again so that he'll be able to defeat his childhood friend Rin Matsuoka with the Free Iwatobi Swimming club members. The story is more or less really unoriginal and has nothing new to show us except that it's about swimming. One thing I really hated about free washow unclear it was if it was a shounen or shoujo anime because I think it should've just stuck to one side as it was really irritating the way they presented the swimming like a typical sport-shounen yet had some fangirling moments suited for a shoujo anime. Either way the only good thing about the story was the use of an unused sport as swimming hasn't been explored in an anime before (though in some mangas it has been explored as the main topic).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 - The the art was decent as it had a refreshing feeling to it which is needed for a anime like this so its satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 - I more or less don't remember any of the soundtack, opening or endings which probably means that there was nothing memorable but the voice actors carried out the characters nicely so efforts are applauded.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 - Too many stereotypical and shallow characters but it's satisfactory as the characters did complete their roles well. Though I think a lot of things could have been improved about the characters such as their depth or backgrounds etc but it can't be helped now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5 - If you're dead bored then you will be able to watch this series but overall it doesn't have much of a impact and isn't that enjoyable but that's my opinion and I think i'm being a bit biased as I was kind of ticked of by this series but its suitable for those people who are patient.\\n\\n\r\nPeople Who Liked: Tsuritama, Kuroko No Basuke. Hetalia Axis Powers, Kimi To Boku., Meganebu and Prince of Tennis will enjoy this series as they have a bit of a similar feel to these animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 - Overall, it has its shounen moments howerever, I'd rather recommend this series to people who like shoujo-based anime.",

            "content": "So, I wanted a light-hearted anime to get me back into the medium after finishing my Game of Thrones-marathon. I had previously watched some of Ergo Proxy, but it felt a bit dark to hop into after GoT's overbearing nature. I'm not sure what I expected out of it when I started watching, but\r\nFree! is a good anime.\r\nAnd there's really not too much more to say about it. KyoAni basically made K-ON (just going by what I've seen and impressions, as I haven't actually seen K-ON!)but with dudes in tight clothing and swimming.\r\nThe story of Free! is about as simple as it gets, seeing asthis is a sports anime in a school setting. There's a group of people who like a sport. The sport happens to be competitive swimming. They start a club at their school (Do Japanese people not have local or regional clubs on youth levels? It seems like there's always in-school clubs that are the go-to places to train. Then again, maybe I'm one of the minority of people here.) They go through some stuff to be able to start the club and get members, and then it's off to the races (literally) after a training arc. The writing us usually pretty good, and there was some intrigue about the characters' common past, but it wasn't executed particularly well when actually revealed and the writing in general took a nosedive from there. Not to the extent of tearing the show down, but it feels like the show is kind of treading water until the second season, and just wanted to get all the story out of the way so it could focus on the team in the future. I understand that philosophy, but I don't agree with it. There needed to be a better mix between the story and sport, seeing as some of the scenes towards the end felt extremely redundant.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most sports series that aren't hyper-specific in the mechanisms of the sport, Free! is a character-focused show. It's got a pretty decent sized cast (7 central characters) and most are given ample screen-time. Do note that they are extremely generic for the type of series this is. If you've seen a sports series, you will have stumbled into more than a few of these.\\n\\n\r\nHaru is the resident sports fanatic. The twist on this in Free! is that he's kind of indifferent when it comes to actually competing (though I assume it will change in the future, since I just found out there's a sequel airing right now), and just wants to be in the water - so much that he tends to soak in his bathtub when he's not in school. From what I can tell, he lives alone, or at least very independently. Only time he shows some actual motivation is when his rival is involved. Always swims freestyle (front crawl), which is where the title stems from.\\n\r\n    And that rival is Rin. A member for what seemed like a short time of the same swimming club as Haru when they were kids (they're currently 17), he later left for Australia to chase his dream of becoming an Olympic swimmer, which he chases to fulfil it for his father, who never got to reach it. While acting hostile and/or indifferent to Haru and the rest, he's clearly no antagonist and still wants something from them, but whether that's just competitive rivalry or friendship is yet to be seen. Said to be very good at butterfly stroke, but is shown to be proficient at others as well.\\n\r\n    Makoto is the reliable guy, and obviously also team captain (with Haru taking the supposedly superfluous position of vice-captain), keeping the group together. He's got a deep-rooted problem that makes his life in the swimming club a bit odd when it's time for a training camp of just vacation - he's afraid of the ocean. I'll get more into that later. Swims backstroke for the club.\\n\r\n    Nagisa is the energy bunny and relentless optimist of the group. He also fulfils what I suppose is the moe-role, but for guys (I'm sure there's even a fucking term for it). Breaststroke-specialist (heh) for the club.\\n\r\n    Rei is the guy they picked up to fill final spot on the team. He's the brains of the squad, and only joins after thinking that Haru's swimming looks beautiful (he only likes beautiful things, apparently, so the clich\u00e9s won't stop on the Rei-train any time soon). However, as he joins the club, a problem of his might throw a spanner in the works - he can't swim. This is used for comic relief until it's not funny, but to the series' credit, they do get away from it rather quickly after.\\n\r\n    To the sort of expendable charters then. First is Gou (but she likes to be called Kou), the younger sister of Rin. She steps into the position of club manager to help the club initially get started and is the one to plan training sessions and the like. She's pretty obsessed with muscles, which is used to some comedic effect at times.\\n\r\n    And finally there's Miss Ame, the class' home-room teacher, and then club advisor (you basically need one to be legitimate, is my understanding after my years of watching anime). It's hinted she's had a job that's related to swimsuits, and it's strongly hinted that is was as a swimsuit model.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is pretty alright, but it's, as said earlier, very generic. The gimmick that brings the boys together is that they all have girly names, and Gou has a manly one. All the characters have a role to play, and it's made more important than them actually having characters (even though they clearly do, but they're moulded to fit the part).\\n\\n\r\nFree!'s strength is probably how damned easy it is to watch. It's incredibly easy-going, even in it's few serious scenes and you can follow the story (the little there is to be followed anyhow) with ease. You could probably watch without subs and still have a good idea about what's going on. I suppose that's actually a pretty big achievement in itself, now that I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAdding to the delight of watching is the absolutely superb animation. The character designs are excellent and very well animated. I think they mix normal animation and CG during some of the in-water scenes, but I could be mistaken. In any case, it's gorgeous. It's easily the best animated show in Kyoani's portfolio.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is good in general, although some of the actors kind of flub the emotional dialogue at times, just reverting to the normal style of voice-cracking screaming/shouting, or just not sounding like they care.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some fan-service in the series, but to discuss it I would have to bring up gender roles and sexuality in media in general, which would be tedious and stuff. It's very bearable, and you might in fact like it.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, if you like watching good-looking anime boys do things, you'll enjoy the series. If you enjoy sports stories, you'll enjoy this. Free! is an amalgamation of the two and does its thing very by-the-book, so you get what's on the cover. It's good, but not more, and that's okay.",

            "content": "The loud hubbub regarding the announcement of Free! is quite understandable. Here is the animation studio, KyoAni best known for creating and specializing moe for anime fanboys,  producing an anime that is aimed at girls and fujoshi! The particular outcry by the male otaku population is funny, in my part. The male fanboys attacking KyoAni for betraying them and jumping the shark by producing an anime that is \"outside\" of their territory.The attacks including labels as the \"gay swimming anime\", 'Kuroko's swimming\" and threats of boycott. Thousands of manly tears were cried, loud shouts of angry fanboys could be heard at forums and acrossthe internet. But at the end of that fanboy tunnel, a loud sound could be heard, the frantic screaming of fangirls and fujoshi around the globe. So Free!, become the battleground between KyoAni/Fangirls and their core audience, the male otaku population.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the end, it seems that there is a winner.. KyoAni won the hard fought war.. And their reward: swimming at the pools of money that Free! merchandises and DVD's sold. Fun Fact: Free! DVD's average sold is about 27k, which is their best sale in previous years and sold infinitely better than its 2013 counterpart, Kyoukai no Kanata (in KyoAni sales, it is considered a flop and a disappointment).\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of this intro, here is my review for Free!, the surprising hit anime of 2013.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nAs a sport anime, Free! did not particularly stand out. There are many masterpieces on this genre, but Free! won't be among them. The story is your typical generic one that is: boys swimming+ team rivalry + friendship. Not so original, in fact Kuroko's Basketball is the same, just change the sport. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, there are many fleeting similarities between Free! and KuroBas. Both of them being called as fujoshi fan bait, cast of full of pretty boys and homoerotic subtext between characters. What KuroBas lack and Free! advantage is of course, muscles.. lots of muscles. And those muscles and pretty boys made fangirls nosebleed to death in Tumblr.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story is generic one.. (Where am I?).. The first few episodes introduced us to the characters back-story and the creation of their swimming club. Then the middle episodes were the training and the final ones, for the competition. Free! progresses nicely on the story, but its progress is its main weakness.. The characters were revealed, but the swimming part suffered. If you want to see the show because you were a swimming fan, then you will be disappointed because there is a lack of it. Instead, you were treated by ridiculous amount of fanservice including boys trying their swimsuits, attending a festival and showing their muscles. \\n\\n\r\nThis criticism should be lethal one.. But one thing that Free!had done right is the fanservice part weaved on the story. How much fan.. ugghh.. manservice it is? Not telling, but the fact that my nose is bleeding at the end of Episode 6 is very telling. And that is only in Episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nSomeone said that you can replace Free! characters with the main characters of K!On, but it is not clear cut as that.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka - the stoic, serious one\\n\r\nMakoto - the nice best friend\\n\r\nNagisa - the cute one\\n\r\nRei - the meganneko\\n\r\nRin - the rival\\n\\n\r\nAll of them were generic, cut pasted cardboard characters in anime. But they showed development on the series, with the main exception of Nagisa who has never character development on the anime. (I wish he could have one in the Season 2). The core conflict of the characters is their childhood friendship and the resolved tensions with each other. In the end, I think they have grown up..a little.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly like the fan favorite, Makoto who is  very nice (and cute) . He is the best friend of Haruka, and their interactions is a sweet part of the story. They were like an old married couple. Less successful is Rin, because his motivations is not clear cut.. But in the end, it resolves nicely. Rei, is a very adorkable character that is growing in my heart. He is very funny, too. The supporting charcetrs were more or less in the background with the exception of Gou, Rin's sister. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni could animate a trash dump and it will still be amazing as usual. KyoAni' reputation for top notch technical quality is present here. From the animation of water rippling to the backgrounds that screams \"scenery porn\", all of them is fantastic. KyoAni is ace on this department.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the character design should be mentioned. Oh man.. Looking at them, you would surely fall in love with the faces and the muscles, ripped muscles at that. Every main character is the extremely good looking, with bishounen sparkles all over them. the only complaint is the design of Nagisa which is fairly generic ( think Honey of Ouran High School Host Club when he grows up).\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nSound is fairly good with the particular standout, the ED song, Splash Free! It is an energetic, full of danceable tunes sung by the seiyuu. The OP song, Rage On, is good too, with its rocking rhythm. The background music consists pf calming electronic beats which you can found in KyoAni anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice acting, everything is good.. Shout out to Mamoru Miyano for his another great performance as Rin. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of Free! depend on few things:\\n\\n\r\n1. You like KyoAni for their outstanding animation and technical quality.\\n\\n\r\n2. You like a slice of life and sports comedy drama.\\n\\n\r\n3. You like muscles and lots of manservice/homoerotic subtext.\\n\\n\r\nIf you check 1, you will just opine that it is another KyoAni anime that has outstanding technical quality. If you checked 1 and 2, you will like it and will likely find it good. If you check all of the three, you will probably say that Free! is the best thing since sliced bread. If none of them, I think Free! is not for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI really really like Free! and I am looking forward for the season 2 this summer. But Free! is an anime that divides opinion. It is up to you whether you will like it or not, as I do. For me, it does not scale to heights as some of the best animes produced by KyoAni or sports anime like Slam Dunk. Instead, what Free! did to the animation industry is opening/tapping the mainstream fangirl/fujoshi market by having an anime that is well designed, well crafted and very memorable. I am hoping that it will give trends to anime that caters to vastly different demographic market.\\n\\n\r\nActual Objective Score: 6.5\\n\\n\r\nMy Biased Score: 8\\n\\n\r\nDifference: 1.5 points",

            "content": "First of all, I must say that this is my first venture into Sports anime. I'm a sucker for a good slice-of-life anime because I like the realism and the usual pace. I decided to watch this even though I do not like sports. Why? Because swimming isn't like the sports I immensely dislike that require humans to chuck or run around with spherical or oblate objects. \r\nI notice many people talking about fan service, and I was there watching the entire anime in one day wondering where the so called fan service was? I mean, they are swimmers, there are supposed to be halfnaked throughout the whole thing. There we few instances that may have been seen as fan service but really, I've watched anime with fan service and what I saw didn't really feel like fan service. It felt natural. I am a guy and it didn't make me feel awkward one bit because it didn't feel like frikin' fan service. But that's just how I saw it.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't expect to rate this anime as Very Good. But I ended up enjoying it a bit more than I should have. Why? I'm a sucker for friendships like these. These aren't just guys who just exist and are friends. These are friends who share a bond, and mutual goals and ambitions and I can relate a bit because I have such a friend. I like friends like these that don't waste time pretending to be bad ass and give in to peer pressure and stupid sheet like that.\\n\\n\r\nSure the plot could have been a bit better and have more of a purpose than it did, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless, and it did feel like a slice-of-life anime. I enjoyed watching the life of the Iwatobi Swim Club. I look forward to binge-watching the second season.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously though, WHAT FAN SERVICE?!",

            "content": "Competition is a part of sports and friendship that will never disappear. We want to impress the crowds of people that attend official sporting events and then we want show off to our own special circles. But has our society taken the need of competition and a display of superiority to levels not needed? Or is it something that is a part of our own natural behavior? Whether or not it is natural to us, Free! is the story of when this competition has torn friends apart.\r\nI shall forewarn you, this is a review with spoilers. The story centers around Haruka Nanase who is atalented swimmer and has a genuine love for water. So much that in public he finds it necessary to strip down to the swimming trunks he always wears and bathe in fish tanks. As we see him throughout most of the series, he looks apathetic and indifferent, but he is always said to be smiling on the inside. Since middle school he has never swam competitively, only ever swimming freestyle.\\n\\n\r\nHe quit swimming because of his friend and rival Rin Matsuoka. After returning from foreign lands he challenges Haruka to a race and loses. He sees that after a year so he has had little progress and says that he will quit swimming because of disappointment in himself. However, Haruka blames himself for making Rin quit swimming and vows never to swim competitively again.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes off from there as the once former team reunites and challenges Rin and the school he has joined. By the end we see that all Haruka wants to do is to swim with his friends, nothing else matters. Rin finds that to push himself further he needs the companionship of his friends. Without them, he hits a wall with nobody to push him forward. I think it is wonderful that this sports oriented story has capitalized on the dangers of competition. Making a truly heart grabbing story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever this point is lost to most people because they focus too much on the fantastic muscles each character has. I think it is embarrassing that the male anime viewers are complaining about this. Honestly, have we all not seen how ridiculous the male oriented fanservice gets? Granted, I doubt a high school swimmer would have a body like this, but it is somewhat obtainable through hard work. Not the size of a breast which is determined through genetics. I think it is understandable that there can be female oriented fanservice and I am not going to complain about it. It is just a taste of our own medicine.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation outdid themselves with the animation here. I loved the intro and all the special effects they added in with water. The ending, however, left me with some mixed feelings. I liked it, then it would throw me for a loop. The animation was well down and nothing more can be said about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound had me intrigued as well. The opening song was great, I found myself watching it every time instead of skipping it like I do for most anime. The ending was just as unique, again, it threw me for a loop. I must also congratulate Kyoto for using dubstep. I did not see that coming and while I feel it is out of place, it works. I found the voices to work as well. They fit, so I can\u2019t complain.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a slice of life anime and it is understandable that a moving plot is not always present. However they presented a conflict well and wrapped up that conflict with little distracting from it. Everything had a purpose and it served well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters I found to be forgettable. I anticipated that I would have loved Rei\u2019s character, but found him annoying. I could sympathize with him later on, but he is still not that great. Nagisa, as well, I found a bit annoying. In my opinion, the best designed character in this series is Rin. He has greatest show of emotion by anyone and is completely understandable. I can understand why people like Haruka and that I do treasure the emotion I see change in him during the last few episodes. In fact, in the last two episodes I am sure he showed more emotion than the rest of the entire series. But do we have to make a person dead straight jaded to show this kind of significant change? Makoto brought this kind of realistic emotion change to the table, but often I felt it was just a copy of what was going on before. Smiling, closing his eyes, and tilting his head slightly to the left. I enjoyed Makoto\u2019s gentle nature at the beginning, but it got to a point where I wanted something more and his trouble with the ocean brought that until we fell into the pattern once again. I can\u2019t say these are something other than cookies from the cookie cutter.\\n\\n\r\nI also think it is necessary to mention the actions and familiarity these characters act in. I am not going to criticize it for being seen as just  more fanservice, but actually going to uphold what they have done. I don\u2019t know how it works in Japan, but I am a senior in an American high school and some of the interaction I have seen in Free! is similar to how people in my school act. Hugging and jumping on people happen all the time in my gym class, people are just being friends and it doesn\u2019t have to be anything more than that.\\n\\n\r\nFree! has been a ride that I decided to stick to for twelve episodes. Animation was great and one of the reasons I felt myself returning to it. The plot and characters, what really counts, has made it less than acceptable for me. This show is worth your time if you can stick to it and see past the flaws I have mentioned. I will admit that I was almost moved to tears during the last episode, a true and noteworthy statement about any show I will watch. If you enjoy a nice and relaxing slice of life show, I am sure Free! is for you.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nRounded Total: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "I remember when everyone had just started talking about Free, and they were all hyping about watching it \"for fun\", for the \"rare\" female fan-service, and of course the shipping that would most definitely ensue. When I started to watch it, I totally thought that was all it was going to be, too.\r\nWell, if you ever are going to watch Free! because of those very reasons, guess again. The story started to get deeper and deeper. It was about 3 episodes in when they had started introducing sad backstories, which actually were very interesting. They added quite a lot of character to these swimmers whoeveryone was just going to use as their shipping boy toys. Things got deeper and deeper, and instead of cliche sport animes where the \"good team\" gains validation by beating the other team, when one team beat the other, they did not feel that validation at all.\\n\\n\r\nAt that moment, it became excessively apparent that this was no cliche sports anime. The swimming started to become a sort of back drop to help the plot move along, but the plot really advanced as the boys started to grow in terms with their feelings, and confront them. It became a whole outstanding coming of age story, that was really heartfelt.\\n\\n\r\nI never thought I'd cry over swimming, much less sports. But the wonderful story, beautiful art (I will tell you, I've seen professional swimmers say the art is spot-on), and outstanding character development left me in tears on the final episode. Where instead of at the bottom where it usually read, \"See you next Water Day!\" it, instead, said \"See you next Summer!\"",

            "content": "--- This review may contain minor spoilers ---\r\nStory : 7/10\r\nWell, anybody who has seen a single episode of Free! can notice that its story it's kinda common, with our main characters ''reviving'' their favourite club, needing a last member to create the club, and even an old friend who has changed. I give it a 7/10 in the story topic, obviusly, because it isn't original at all, and because there are some things, kinda... weird. Like, Haruka takes a bath with his trunks. Why ?? And i also wanna point the stupid fact that Rei wen't swimming, in the ocean, during a storm. Like, WTF.It was forced, just to get an excuse to show some past things about the characters...\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCome on, don't you dare to disagree. Free!'s arte and animation is outstanding, mainly in the swimming parts. Gosh, the water looks so real !!\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFree! has a good Ost. Not bad, not excelent, but it's good, but i wouldn't give an 8 to a normal ost, right ?? Here, i wanna talk more about the Opening and Ending. Honestly, the opening blew me away, the music can change our mood and our feelings, and that's something that we don't see everyday. Now, about the ending, i have to say that it's not that good, if we compare it to the opening, but that doesn't change the fact that the ending has a unique and spectacular rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOver the episodes, we slowly watch a character construction, not intensive, but that lets us know the struggles that some characters went trough in the past, with the deaths of their kinds. Altho some characters are completely flat, and we have to agree that we don't know anything about some main characters, i still think that the anime will show us that missing parts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn this section, i will talk about my opnion, an opinion from a person who loves sports, practices sports everyday, including swimming. Altho this group of friends are trying to reach the maximum of their capacities, we can't consider ther as a profesional team, but, we can see a bit of their routine, for ex. workouts or different trainings, like we saw in their ''Trial in open water''. However, we are restricted to some things important to their lifes, where those times are filled in with slice of life moments, or some relationships adjustments, like Rin and his old friends...\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a good anime, obviusly has its flaws, but these are erased by the good moments that we pass during this anime. With 4 episodes left to watch, at least in this season, i hope that the anime doesn't disapoint me, and continues to delight me.",

            "content": "Widely known as \"Shingeki no Shitstorm\" before it even aired, Free! was a show that made a huge splash on the anime community during the summer of 2013. It sparked a lot of controversy over whether or not the show was a juicy bait waiting for rabid fujoshi to pounce on. Thus, this show has isolated itself from a significant portion of the male anime viewers who just happens to be people who are not confident enough in their masculinity.\r\nDo not be deceived.\r\nFree! is by no means an anime for homos. If one could simply look past the amazingly proportioned as well as scantily cladexterior and dig into the actual content of the anime, they would realize that Free! is a heartwarming story about the pure friendship between members of the same sex. Another recurring element in the story is the sense of fulfillment one gets from doing things they life, no matter the results; which I personally feel like is lacking amongst young people these days. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, though the overall message of the series is sent, the execution is lacking. So much emphasis is focused on Haruka and Rin, the rest of the characters are overshadowed and feel flat. Various episodes could also be cut down and lose some irrelevant content such as the moments of obvious sexual tension between characters that leads to misconceptions about this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Free! Iwatobi Swim Club was a delightful treat to the eyes and soul and I would definitely recommend it to people who need a break from the Linkin Park pseudo darkness shows plaguing the industry nowadays. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Why oh why is this anime so highly rated? Hmm. I'll try not to completely drag this anime. I don't even know why it's considered a sports and comedy anime. It lacked in both areas. They bitched and moaned more than they actually swam. \"I miss Rin so much. Come back to us\" \"I'm free or maybe not so free.....I don't know anymore\" \"I'm going to beat you Haru. I have a crazy obsession with you\". \"Rin. You did your best. I secretly low key love you\"\r\nStory/Plot:\r\n 4/10\r\nTHERE WAS NO PLOT. The story was just so....boring. It was all so....boring. It didn't really grab myattention. It wasn't awful, but it was boring. (You're going to hear me say boring a couple of times, so be prepared) It was a mediocre plot at best. They need to take some tips from Haikyuu and other sports anime. I think it's so highly rated because of how hot the lead male characters are. It's perfect for you crazy ass yaoi lovers who feel the need to ship every damn male character with each other. I love yaoi by the way. I'm not bashing it.  There was no room for any shipping. The chemistry between the characters fucking sucked. Speaking of characters, let's talk about them.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nBoring ass personalities. The characters are what made the anime so damn boring. Zero character development. I think the only character that had a somewhat decent character development was Rin. The main character,Haru, was a BORING expressionless character. He annoyed me throughout most of the anime. The only characters I thoroughly enjoyed was Rei and Nagisa. All the other characters were BORINGGGG. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nI loved the opening song a lot and the art was so beautiful. The dub voices were pretty great too. I was surprised. Only why I'm giving it a 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nIt's a no from me dawg. It's a cute little anime if you want to kill time.

            "content": "SPLASH FREE!!\r\nSoo, \"Free!\", huh? My first thought when I saw the poster were \"What the....I NEED TO WATCH THIS!\". So I did. Did I enjoy it? Hell yeah. Do I think this is a good anime? Well...in comparison to....well....there's not much to compare it to since there are barely any other pure \"manservice\" anime out there, but I'd say yes. Should you watch this? Well as long as you're no homophobic douchebag then yes, it's hilarious. \r\nAnyways, since many people aren't giving this anime a lot of credit (mainly homophobic douchebags), I thought I'd write a review of \"Free! Iwatobi swim club\".\r\nStory:\r\nWithout spoiling too much(I think I never said this before since I mainly do rants), Free is about a group of \"nippleless Calvin Kline models\" (Thanks gigguk) who start a swim club at their school and compete in tournaments and stuff. They grow closer as a team and as friends over the course of the anime, showing that friendship is the most important thing in the world. Kinda like K-ON, except that music is replaced by water and cute girls doing cute things are replaced by \"cute\" guys doing \"cute\" things (I put that into quotations because I, as a straight dude, don't think that they're cute but hilarious, but I was told that they're \"soo adorable\").\\n\r\nMany people say they're disappointed by the fact that the storyline isn't that ellaborate and deep, but what do you expect from a Moe anime? You don't watch Moe anime for the same reason you watch Drama for example. It's supposed to be fun and mindless entertainment and Free delivers such in a perfect manner. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFree looks gorgeous. Seriously. The Water looks amazing (Though not as amazing as in \"Garden of Words\"), the guys look...well....they look pretty good, I'm jealous actually \\n\r\nThe whole anime has the typical Kyoto animation stamp all over it and honestly, I did not think that they could pull guys looking...well...moe off. They look like typical moe characters, but more about that later. \\n\r\nThe backrounds are reallly detailed, especially the pools and there are a few eastereggs here and there. As always I guess. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the Free music shop! We've got everything what your heart desires: Dubstep? Check! Orchestral pieces? Check! Rock/Punk songs? Check! Catchy J-pop openings? Check! Really catchy endings with superdisturbing lyrics? CHECK! All for an efficient price of 9.99! Order now and you'll get the....\\n\r\nAhem, sorry 'bout that, but it's basically what listening to free for me felt like. The music feels old but not dated, fresh but not hipster. I really must say, free has some of the best soundtracks I have heard in a while. And seriously, I can't stop listening to the ending even though the lyrics are indeed really disturbing!\\n\r\nThe voiceacting is on point and you can really hear that the voiceactors were having fun doing their jobs. Great performance!\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nYou know, \"Character\" is always the point where I'm too lazy to write a lot, so I'll keep this tradition up! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are your typical moe/harem characters...only in a male version. There's the Silent but passionate one that's sometimes tsundere (I'll just name them after other moe characters since I don't remember their names: Shiori Shiomiya), the supernice scaredycat giant (Akyama Mio), the  supergenki friendshiplover (Ayumi Takahara), the one who doesn't fit in because he's a total weirdo but in the end does (Ichinose Kotomi) and the supertsundere who's also (for some fangirls) the love interest of the maincharacter (insert anyone you like, I'll go for Taiga).\\n\r\nThey are nothing special since they behave like any other moe character of their type, except for the fact that they are guys. Nothing exceptional but not boring either.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Some credit towards the two female leads (Though they are only sidecharacters), they really stand out. That's all.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this far more than I expected. Every episode is fun, you can laugh a lot about the ridiculous fanservice and the storyline is not halfbad. And if anyone says that they don't watch this because it's gay, just slap them and tell them that they're pussies because they judge a book by it's cover and don't even give different things a chance. Free is superfun to watch and you can make a good drinkinggame out of it. Seriously. Just drink a shot every time there is a crotch on screen. I call it \"Crotch Shots\". I know I'm a genius.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves Free with an overall score of....\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, it's worth watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPeace out I'm Toastyy!",

            "content": "First thing, Free! is a sports anime, about swimming. It creates a lot of hype, moreover there's quite a number of cosplayers I saw doing the characters from this anime. I got introduced to Free! by my friend who is a fujoshi. Well at first I didn't really want to watch since I don't like yaoi. \r\nAfter I give it a try, I got hypnotized by the animation of the water and fell in love instantly. Dear God, it is so freaking smooth and fluid. Being a swimmer myself, I just can't help myself to swoon. And don't worry, it is not yaoi at all.Guaranteed. Well, the bromance is quite strong but it's really not yaoi ^^\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about 4 guys Haruka, Makoto, Nagisa, and Rin who loves swimming and were good friends. Rin went off to a different school, while the rest decided to revive their school's swimming club. It is quite simple. The characters are mostly male and the main characters have girlish names (giggles). Even though most of the characters have likable personalities (and nice body *.*), I feel they are not explored enough. Their personalities can very much be summed up in a word and lacking depth. Aside from Makoto and Rin, their background stories, their family, etc. we don't know much of them yet. \\n\r\nHowever, the relationship between them grew to my liking, since there was 1 more guy aside from the 3 friends, Rei joining the swimming club. His struggle trying to fit in to the circle is quite interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its minuses, you won't feel bored watching it thanks to the jokes and light humor. The pace is not slow, complimented with nice animation and bright colors to keep your eyes glued to the show. The opening and endings must be praised. It is very catchy and memorable, I never skip the opening and ending when watching the show. I also want to applaud the voice actors for singing so well for the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like light and funny series like K-On!, you might try this one. They have similar character personalities (just K-On! the characters are girls and for Free! boys) and art style. You can watch this to pass the time, it's only 12 episodes anyway.",

            "content": "Story: 1\r\nArt: 10\r\nSound: 5\r\nCharacter: 1\r\nEnjoyment: 3\r\nOverall: 4\r\nNow, if you're trying to decide whether you should watch this show or not, I'll tell you something: \"I only swim free\".\r\nThat's the whole series.\r\nTo class this as a 'sports' or 'comedy' anime would be blasphemy. I can tell you now, there are probably FUNERALS that are funnier than this piece of shit anime. All they do is whine and bitch and then there's the running gag of Haru stripping his clothes off whenever someone mentions the word \"pool\". IT'S NOT FUNNY. It wasn't funny the first time, nor was it funny the 103th time. And if this showDOES manage to come up with a funny moment, they'll milk it to the point that it's no longer funny. The only funny moment I can think of is one scene where Haru's trying on swimming shorts that look identical and Nagisa's like \"I don't see the difference\". I remember having a genuine chuckle when I saw that scene. I'm going to stress one point though, THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT COMEDY. honestly, what even is this anime? It's just muscular guys taking off their shirts and bitching about things and-- sorry, excuse me. Time to say some positive things.\\n\\n\r\nERROR 404: PAGE NOT FOUND\\n\\n\r\nSorry, I've got nothing nice to say. (Well, there's the art which I gave a ten. It's a shitty series, but the art is 12/10. Kyoto Animation never disappoints.)\\n\r\nBut, honestly. Free! is a series which gets overhyped by countless fujoshi and fangirls when it's really nothing that special. As far as I'm concerned, it's the only swimming anime out there, but it feels more like swimming's an 'accessory'. For sport anime fans out there, I'll use a comparison. Kuroko no Basket suffers from not enough character development outside of the court. Haikyuu is an all-rounder -- we get character development on AND off the court. And then, we have Free. You get convoluted attempts at developing the characters outside of the pool, and there IS some character development skills-wise. But, it's not quite enough to make me love the series. I kept watching, hoping that they'd expand on this foundation they'd built. I was incredibly intrigued by the opening, my breath was taken away by the art, but I was let down more and more as I went through the whole series. I've said this like twice already, but ALL THE CHARACTERS DO IS BITCH. This anime gets way too tied up with all these friendships and problems that aren't really problems (to give you an example, there's a whole arc dedicated to a character deciding to run away from home when his parents tell him that he's not allowed to swim anymore. Yup. He RUNS AWAY. Packs his bags and leaves, just because his parents wanted him to quit the swim club and improve his grades). This is meant to be a swimming anime, but we barely get to witness the magic of swimming. Not to mention, the actual swimming scenes... they're kind of boring? Don't get me wrong. The art is amazing. But, the actual swimming... I don't know. I was expecting more, I guess?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I have nothing to say about it. It wasn't memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, okay. On a serious note, this anime DOES do some things well. I said earlier on that there were some attempts at character development. There's a certain arc where two characters travel to a different country (keeping it vague so as not to give spoilers) and in this country, we actually get to see some character development. Those episodes weren't too bad, actually. I quite enjoyed those. (That's in Season 2.) Oh, yeah. They also have English-speaking characters in there, and much to my surprise, I didn't hear the 'engrish' I'm so accustomed to hearing in anime. The VAs they used for the characters were actually English speakers! (Or at least, they sounded like English speakers.) It's a little detail, but I liked that. Actually, now that I think of it, some of the rare moments I liked about this anime were all in Season 2. So, I guess all I can say is that this is a rare occurrence where the second season is actually BETTER than the first. This season was ass, but the second season redeems itself SLIGHTLY. And heavy emphasis on SLIGHTLY. Free! is not a masterpiece by any means. It's far from being a masterpiece. And while the characters are sweet, they're not what you'd call memorable. Too many people gas up this anime and call it the best thing ever, the \"gayest show ever\" (Honestly, I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't ship anyone on the show?? I just saw them all as really close friends. And no, I'm not a 'yaoi hater'. I have so many favourite pairings in anime like Haikyuu! and KnB, but for some reason, I just didn't really find any couples worth shipping in this show?? idk) and of course, there's the people who dub it as \"fanservice\".\\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't think this show is fanservice. Granted, Kou has a very prominent muscle fetish, but I don't think this show can be classed as 'fanservice'. It's about swimming (or at least, it is when they're not bitching and whining) so of course they're going to take their shirts off to swim. If you're so prudish that you can't stand the idea of muscular men taking their shirts off to get in the pool, then it's not that you can't stand fanservice. You've got something wrong with you. I mean, in my experience, the muscles were kind of just... there? I didn't care about the muscles, lol.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I'll make like Haru and tell you one thing:\\n\r\n\"I only swim free (because I get no character development whatsoever and basically act as an emotionless bobblehead who serves to do nothing but make Rin an angsty little teen who spends years working towards trying to beat me only for me to not give two shits because, you guessed it, I ONLY SWIM FREE)\".",

            "content": "FREE! ANIME SEASON 1 REVIEW 11-27-2018\r\nOVERALL: 9\r\nPLOT: 9\r\nThere's only two things that made me watch this anime. You know what? The muscles! Is the first thing. The cuteness! Is the second one. Before watching this series, I've come across so many doujins of it. And I've really think that it's just a gay thingy so I've never considered watching it at first. But yeah, the animation attracted me to. This anime shows how happiness in doing what you love to do comes first. It shows how hard it can be to achieve your goal, there are roadblocks on your way, there are so many spacefor improvement, there are too many people who are far more greater than you on the field you wanted to do. But the one thing that you should not forget is to enjoy each and every step of the way. That it is okay to fail, it is okay to get exhausted, it is okay to slow down, as long as you know what you want and you are happy doing it. But yeah, there are just really sidetrack scenarios which displays unnecessary affections to make fujioshi people heart throbs! Did I say I'm one of those?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the characters interesting? What makes them human? For me, it's the purpose of them existing. It's the reason why they are still breathing. It is how they can make the viewer think of what they say. The characters are not required to be likeable, it is more of they should be realistic. Though most of the gestures on this series is not too humanly, the one thing I really love about it is the two type of person a human can be. First is the type of person who know what he wants and can sacrifice everything to get it. And the other one is the person who love what he is doing and just go with the flow. The goal is really the same, to do what they wanted to do, but the view is very different which makes the character feel differently. It even come to the point that the characters detest the bond of their friendship. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND AND ANIMATION: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere's no doubt about this one, the animation is really good. The structure of it, how the proportions of the body was made, how the expression on their faces has been conveyed, it is really great. Additionally, the voices of the characters actually expressed the emotions that needed to be brought upon the characters. In line with the opening and ending songs, they are very catchy and fun to listen to. The mermaid thingy at the ending song are really annoying, but at the same time, it's cute and funny. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\\n\r\nWho is not going to enjoy muscles? Hahaha. Animation is really one of the aspects to enjoy an anime series, honestly. But yeah, of course the message of the story is the main keypoint on enjoying a series. I guess, this anime tackles all of this. The animation is great, the message of the story is also there, the funny scenarios and the way the creator wanted the viewers to laugh is also present. I did enjoyed watching it and I'm planning to watch the season 2. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is gay! To be honest. I've never imagine a group of guy doing that kind of thing. Oh, don't misunderstand. What I mean is a guy expressing emotional feelings toward other guys are just not a real thing, or am I wrong? But the ending is good. While it is somewhat gay, the character realized that there's no point ignoring the ones he cherish for his dream and just enjoy while he's at it. And I think that's really for the best.",

The depth of the characters is lingering in the shallow end of pool (get it? get it?? cuz swimming.) If you don't get it, I'm saying the characters are flat. One....maybe Two dimensional. They aren't people. They are swimming pieces of paper. I gave character a 2, because paper is better than nothing. \r\nThe only reason any one would wanna watch this is to watch beautiful men swim. People go to aquariums to watch beautiful fish swim. Peoplewatch Free to watch beautiful men swim. \\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much this whole anime. Enjoy.\\n\\n",

With that in mind I feel like I have to give it an ego boost because it does hit on a lot of key points I think a lot of people missed.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nFor a sports, SoL anime what more could you expect to emerge from it. While it may be pretty straight forward where team trains to reach amazing results in competition I really like the pace they took it in. They did try too hard to bore you with ludicrous training montages or anything to major but they alsoa ddedin nice character background to add in more feeling to it which was good in the sense they didn't try to hard about that either. If therew as one word I used to describe it all it would be smooth.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style was very modern but also very beautifully detailed. Character design was very nice as well as they didn't try to take things over the top like some animes do to get you to remember them. Vibrant color scheme almost the whole way through so solid job on that note.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIf theres one thing about this anime I wish I could have it would be the sound. The OST for this anime surprised me in the fact most of the background songs were all dubstep orinated which is a plus plus on my end. I also really enjoyed the OP and ED. Never skipped them once just because how awesome they sounded.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters stood out to me as being a very diverse cast. It felt really different than what I was used to such as Haru. I expected an  MC such as him to be rather cocky or energetic but no very quiet but intelligent feel.  Though the only thing  wrong with the characters was how most dwelled on the past too much. I really thought with the way the anime was going to could be done with there past a little earlier on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed myself with this one. I usually don't pick up on Sports anime but dang this was pretty amazing. The show did have some scenes where I was just like WTF, and the  abridged series definietly picked up on but itw as still a great experience.  Even if your not into Sports or SoF this is something you should definitely check out and I'd reccomend it anyday of the week.",

            "content": "I honestly had zero expectations on this anime. As always, I just sit back and let the series entertain me and surprise me. And it's quite nice that the series itself managed to change my opinions while it lasted, in a very subtle way.\r\nThe first episode didn't give me too much of a good impression, actually. To be honest, I should say it left me with the worst first impression ever. But in the second episode, where the fanservice went down a lot (thank you) and the story started developing, it felt pretty interesting. And then you reach the ending, without realizing it. And everythinghas been a very pleasant, smooth ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't something to be quite deep about-- But it's very well written and nicely told. We follow the everyday of the teenagers that decide to swim together once again, like they did when they were kids. And, as the teenagers they are, they tend to overreact a lot. Bothered by it? Not a single bit! It's the part of the story where I feel comfortable at. Even if I'm way too old as to feel like a teenager (I'm like... ten years older than the main characters, lmao), there are values and lessons that are worth to be learned at any age.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just wonderful. They grow up a lot, in a very realistic way, during the story. I want to focus on two of them: Rin and Rei. While Makoto is a sweetheart who doesn't have too much to think about, Nagisa is that annoying yet lovable kid that sometimes you can't stand and others you just have to let him be. Gou/Kou is a respectable young lady, in all matters; Ama-chan is just perfect and Haruka begins to be human in the exact moment when you're about to give up on him. And he was the character I disliked from the very beginning, but it was pretty nice to see him grow like this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Rei and Rin. Rei is a very, very kind boy. A hardworking boy. A person that gives his best in everything he does. He deserves to have his precious friends and the happy times with them and the bright future that awaits him. He's just-- A darling. A complete darling.\\n\r\nRin, on the other hand, is a boy that has to grow in a very painful way. He has to face his own anger and disappointment and, at first, he blames such things on others. But when he starts seeing the truth, when he finally realizes why he's so confused and angry, he just brings tears to your eyes. The whole process this character goes through is simply amazing, realistic-- Very, very human.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the characters, they're all cool in their own way, especially Captain Mikoshiba. (I don't have to say that Samezuka is my school, yo'.) Nitori can be annoying at times, but he's just a kid, he's got his reasons. And Goro-sensei is simply hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was one point I didn't find enjoyable. From opening to ending, and then the BGM, nothing seemed to fit for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by itself is just AMAZING. Nothing more to say about this. It's out of the question.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is not my favourite animation studio-- I'd rather say it's one of those that I strongly dislike, mostly because of the kind of products they offer. But this time I have to give the guys a standing ovation. Free! it's not an anime for girls only. It's filled with lots of nice feelings: friendship and self-improvement are the best lessons we can take from this series and, personally, these are the values I appreciate the most in a story. The fact of it having handsome boys doesn't make it less worthy to be watched-- On the contrary, it reinforces the fact that you must not judge a book by its cover, because whenever anybody wants to rant about Free!, there's nothing to rant about. You can like it or not, yet the series has something to give.\\n\\n\r\nI am a guy watching hotties swim. And I would watch it again.",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Free!, Free!: Eternal Summer, and Free!: Dive To The Future \u3011\r\nFree! is a pernicious deviation from what many people think about the series from first glance\u2015a cover full of shirtless men in swim-gear! While this series was the beta test for, what would become, KyoAni\u2019s bishounen archetype\u2015this show dives into the character\u2019s motivations and explores the main casts\u2019 childhood feelings for one another through layers of flashbacks and tension. The franchise, in and of itself, is interesting, experimental territory for an anime studio to tread in; seeing as pretty girls in swimsuits is easy cash versus half-nakedguys, which girls usually don\u2019t readily shill for as easily\u2026 but, maybe I\u2019m underestimating the power of the fujoshi fanbase.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022    The characters are basic typical reverse-harem archetypes, but through further exploration into the series, they become very likable. Haruka (Haru) is the kuudere character whose only motivation for anything is his passion for swimming, but because his love of swimming is so pure, he refuses to swim competitively; therefore, having empty prospects for a future after high school\u2015because his love of the water is practically the only thing he carries any value in. I relate really heavily to Haru\u2019s plight, being a freelance musician and writer, because sometimes when you love something so much and hold it dear to your heart\u2015you just want to do it, just for the sake of making yourself happy, rather than sullying the thing you love with marketing and monetization. Sometimes, despite having to pay the bills, you just want to be \u201cfree.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u2022    Rin\u30fcthe voluble, shark-mouthed rival character\u2015is Haruka\u2019s foil, in essence. Because of something tragic that happened in his past, Rin is unable to find value in himself as a swimmer (seemingly, more than that; his ENTIRE self-worth rides on his career); so, unsurprisingly, Rin clashes with Haru fairly frequently on the basis of ideals. The idea that Haruka doesn\u2019t compete, despite having more natural talent than he does, drives Rin mad and makes him feel insecure. The dynamic between these two is a very interesting focal point to the series; KyoAni even goes as far to making their characters colors red and blue (contrasting colors that signify duality between the two). As well as their \u201cspirit\u201d animals, Rin is represented by the shark\u30fcits characteristics being vicious and carnivorous\u30fcrepresenting Rin\u2019s ruthless passion for proving to the world that he\u2019s the best; whereas, Haru is symbologized frequently as a dolphin\u30fcwhich aptly represents his gentle and carefree spirit. Like warring philosophies, the contrast between these two characters is essential, metaphorical meat to the plot.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022    The other characters don\u2019t carry as much weight and intrigue as Haru and Rin, but they are equally as likable\u2026 except for Rei, the underappreciated-glasses-kun character. His backstory isn\u2019t fleshed out in nearly as much detail as the other four cast members, his socially inept personality-type creates needless drama, and he\u2019s persuaded to join the swim club\u2026 when  doesn\u2019t even know how to swim AND he\u2019s already an excellent pole-vaulter! It makes no sense; I guess because he possibly has the hots for the blonde shouta character (though KyoAni will never made anything more than implied gay; the closest we\u2019re going to get is probably Miss Kobayashi)? Makoto is practically perfect\u30fche\u2019s good at everything, kind, sweet, great with children, good at cooking, caring; the perfect husbando. Unfortunately, his implied crush on Haruka is more one-sided than not. As far as the shouta character (Nagisa) goes, his personality was delicately stitched together by his backstory in Free: Eternal Summer, but I think that KyoAni\u2019s later BL series\u30fcTsurune\u30fcperfected the parts of his archetype that were lacking in their newly formulated shouta character.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022    While, Free and Free: Eternal Summer were very similar in the feeling of a character-based drama\u30fcFree: Dive to the Future wanders into a different direction than its predecessors. While, Free is more character-centric and less focused on the actual sport of swimming; it\u2019s comparable to Hibike! Euphonium\u30fcto the fans out there: you can\u2019t even lie and say that you watch it for the orchestral-band angle! Free: Dive to the Future is more based on the competitive side of swimming and introduces a ton of new characters, so there is less personalized character drama\u30fcit's kind of like how Shokugeki no Soma is focused more on culinary craft and competition, rather than focusing on each individual character in each episode. While this turned many of the original fans away, I thought that Dive to the Future was a fresh take on the story\u30fcthe original series and Free: Eternal Summer fleshed out the main cast enough that I think that a series centered more about their lives going forward, plus a cast of new, beautifully designed characters wasn\u2019t the worst direction to take the story.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022    A complaint that I did have with the new characters, however, was how similar many of them were to the original cast. Some of them were practically the same character, with a different hair-color and a pair of glasses added, with the same personality and facial expressions! Does Free! actually exist in an alternate universe where Japan clones pretty boys who are good at swimming? The world will never know! I actually liked the Haru clone, Ikuya\u30fchis internal conflicts seemed pretty concrete and he is a beautiful, little bishounen who has a fixation with Anderson\u2019s telling of The Little Mermaid\u30fche is adorable! I feel like there could have more meat to the bones in Dive to the Future, but alternately, I felt the same way about the original series and Eternal Summer made all of lingering wants from the previous season dissipate! There\u2019s a sequel for Dive to the Future coming up, so we can see for ourselves if they will meaningfully develop the outliers that didn\u2019t get much attention! Another positive step that the third season made was that it still had the original cast working through and getting over their issues, as the title indicates, it\u2019s a reflection of the characters striving towards their dreams and being the best people that they can be. While the newest season didn\u2019t leave me feeling touched and inspired, like Eternal Summer did\u30fcI think that it brought unexpected things to the table and went out on a limb to do something new.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022    All in all, Free! is a heart-warming, coming-of-age story between a bunch of pretty boys. It\u2019s admirable that this series not only treated its main cast with respect, but also its female characters (despite being a low-key BL show) and the older coach characters that used to competitively compete; many male fanservice series have treated female characters an anthropomorphized version of human trash and old people like geezers. I appreciate how KyoAni has grown from a studio that only focuses on pretty people\u30fcto a studio that learns how to show due diligence to every character, from every walk of life. I think it\u2019s an important narrative choice to not only focus on the characters you\u2019re supposed to focus on, but give respect to the surroundings in ones\u2019 real life as well. Free succeeds as a respectable sports show and more than meets the eye, despite there being nothing but GIFs of bare abs online! I give Free! a 6/10, Free!: Eternal Summer a 7/10, and Free!: Dive to the Future a 6/10.",

            "content": "Under the motif of swimming, Free! uses the overarching theme of friendship to touch the viewer. Sweeter than I thought, the anime captivates through small things and the big changes that they make in our lives.\r\nThe story starts with four ten year old boys. Haruka, the quiet child who becomes one with the water; Nagisa, the puppy-like, always excited friend; Makoto, the laid-back, seemingly more mature one; and Rin, a more explosive, outgoing boy with larger ambitions.  Besides being connected by their practice of swimming, they also have girly-sounding names, which created an inside joke about them being brought together by this fact.Fast-forwards to after their first big tournament, Rin leaves the group to go to Australia in order to train so he can become a professional, Olympic swimmer. Nagisa also goes to another school, which disbands the group.\\n\\n\r\nFree! is also a complete anime under its own right. It\u2019s about swimming, but more than that, it\u2019s about the friendship of the swimmers. Their stories, backstories and backgrounds are all matters to character development, a strong point of the show. The characters evolve not only regarding their current situations, but also regarding their past selves, from which fear and other strong perceptions are brought up to them, one by one, so they can be faced. Talking about characters, each one has a different personality, which means that they will react differently to the situations that they all are brought to. This adds thickness to the story and to their development because the viewer can think \u201che isn\u2019t acting like himself\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what he would do.\u201d I felt compelled to tell that because this is one of the reasons that make Free! so captivating.\\n\\n\r\nCaptivating. The word means \u2018to attract and hold interest\u2019, which is exactly what Free! does. The anime creates its own world and makes the viewer feel part of it. Not \u201cworld\u201d as in something complex as high fantasy, \u201cworld\u201d as in a different scenario with its own atmosphere that makes one submerge in it. It\u2019s a great thing, honestly, because it shows cohesion and coherence in the writing and the execution \u2013 after all, good writing can have bad adaptations \u2013, which already is a \u2018win\u2019 by itself. The ability to make someone feel immersed in a work of fiction is an indicator of something done right \u2013 in this case, the developed and peculiar personality of the characters with their intertwined backgrounds makes it.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, things are a bit simpler. They have a big goal in mind: revive the Iwatobi Swimming Club and win a competition to bring in money. But, for that they need at least four members \u2013 they start out with three: Haruka, Nagisa and Makoto, as Rin is in another school, one that is strongly focused on swimming \u2013 ; the fourth member, Rei, is a great addition to the group because he has a unique background, being a former member of the track team, which, regarding the strong point of the anime, character development, shows a great connection with his personality and forms of swimming \u2013 as every other character, sure, but he has to develop. After getting the fourth member in, they have to compete so they can maintain the club alive. Of course, as nothing is life is so simple, and as everything depends on money, the oxygen of the market, they have to train more so they can seize a good prize. Again, things aren\u2019t simple and \u201ctrain\u201d is a loaded word, specially in anime. That can mean \u201ca different regimen to suit different situations\u201d or \u201cabsolute hell to bring out the stronger, berserker-like self of the athlete\u201d. Since Free! isn\u2019t a battle shounen, you\u2019ll get the first kind of training. Sort of.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all I can spoiler about the story. Actually, it isn\u2019t all that of a spoiler at all: the story is very simple, it\u2019s basically what I said. The complexity lies on the interactions between the characters, as every other slice-of-life. It\u2019s a big story made of much smaller ones. So, what happens?\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens is that in every different actions that the Iwatobi Swimming Club takes, something that adds to the story will happen. An encounter with someone from the past, the return of memories , the correlation between the two, a promise, a bet and growth. I won\u2019t extend that, otherwise I\u2019d be telling the parts of the story that makes this anime what it is, however, it is safe to say that these smaller things matter a lot because they are relatable to the real world (with some exceptions, of course). \\n\\n\r\nMoving to the art and sound, words can\u2019t do justice about them. It\u2019s Kyoto Animation, so top notch quality animation is expected. A little difference, however, is that they focus more on the characters\u2019 designs than on the scenarios and, of course, a special attention to water. The cast has amazing detail on their hairs, well-defined muscles that make sense for a swimmer\u2019s body (also when they\u2019re swimming), sparkling, \u2018watery\u2019 eyes and preferred colours that somehow match their selves. Water, which is hard to animate, and sometimes it requires so much detail and concentration that it can be the breaking/turning point of animations, games or movies, in Free! has a special attention, as it does not look stiff or simply \u201cblue parts of the screen\u201d. \u201cThe water is alive\u201d, as Haruka would say. Everything in Free! is colourful and represents how cheerful it is.  It\u2019s so colourful and cheerful it brings a summery vibe to everyone watching it. (In fact, the second season is called Free! Eternal Summer \u2013 makes every sense in this world.) Watching it in the winter makes it warmer; watching it in the summer makes the heat bearable. Win-win. To complete these summery waves, the soundtrack makes everything look like a party. From the opening to the ending, a matching music is playing, creating an atmosphere. A dubstep that fires up the scenario when the characters are competing or training hard, a chilling music, and maybe a piano, to make difficult conversations softer, a cheerful music representing their volition and even an ominous piece for the rare moments of almost terror. The opening \u201cRage On\u201d helps to open the show, putting the viewer into an exciting mood, closed by the ending \u201cSplash Free!\u201d, which maintains the mood up, ready for the next episode (with the exception of the last episode? The ending \u201cEver Blue\u201d serves as a closing, as if it were saying \u201cend of act 1\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll reserve this paragraph to go a little bit out off topic and address a certain subject: fanservice. It is said that Free! is a manservice anime because it\u2019s about swimming. Ok. It\u2019s understandable that someone may think this, after all, you only use a piece of clothing to swim. Right. What can we do about that? It\u2019s reality. The thing is, a sports anime will be, fundamentally, an anime with athletes. So, claiming \u2018fanservice\u2019 because the anime does exactly what it does in real life points to bigger issues that aren\u2019t the anime itself, but the subject that it touches \u2013 in this case, swimming with _men_. Manservice would be gratuitously showing muscles for amusement. In Free!, however, everything has a context; first, the overarching context of swimming, and second, the context of the friendship.  Addressing the swimming first. To say that it\u2019s fanservice simply because of swimming is to ignore all the details of this story, it\u2019s also almost like saying that swimming itself is akin to fanservice. Again, it shows a problem with the subject (swimming), not with the aim/execution (fanservice). The show sometimes makes fanservice jokes about the swimmers\u2019 bodies, talking about their muscles and their beauty appeal, but nothing that lasts more than five seconds and it doesn\u2019t hurt the story at all, doesn\u2019t sound forced and it cracks some laughs. Now, addressing the friendship. To make things simple, the anime doesn\u2019t have macho guys that will beat you dead to death in a fight; it has a temperamental character, but nothing exaggerated. Free! has characters that talk instead of fight, that appreciate each other\u2019s companies and congratulate each other. That is enough to label that as \u2018manservice\u2019 and even \u2018boys-love\u2019. There\u2019s nothing wrong with boys-love anime, it\u2019s just a genre. However, forcing this label on the anime is generally used as a way to make it appear less worthy, as if it were an insult. All that confusion stems simply from the fact that the anime has boys who are close friends and value their friendship. Guess what? The same happens in almost every anime between girls, specially in the Mahou Shoujo genre. The difference here: the protagonists are boys.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish, Free! is an anime that knows it\u2019s limitations, which is refreshing: there is no forced drama, tears or screaming \u2013 maybe something a bit cheesy, but it\u2019s bearable and expected from anime. However, all its existing limitations are surpassed by the overwhelming quality of art, sound and execution.  It\u2019s an anime about the small things with their big impacts that fill up human lives.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, I'll be honest. I didn't expect much from this Anime and only started it because of all the \"plot\" and the whole \"everyone is gay for each other\" thing and naturally as a girl I got instantly interested and wanted to see if all of the arguments were true or not\r\nNow, I've completed Free! and I have to say that all of this is just half true. Sure, since it's an Anime about swimming you can't really hinder the whole \"plot\" thing but it's in no way exaggerated as it's generally with fanservice for boys and everything felt quite natural to me. \r\nAs forthe \"gay friends\", there were some scenes where it did felt like they have more for each other than just being friends but even that was just a feeling and as the story progresses you can definitely say that it's more likely to be a brotherly relationship than a romantic one. So in conclusion, the fangirls are just exaggerating everything. Just to clear that for the doubtful ones.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the real reason why I absolutely enjoyed this Anime is because of how the relationship between the members of the swim club are handled. Free! is not only feeding the hungry fangirls (which isn't really fanservice actually), it has a pretty touching story of friendship. When a tournament starts you feel pumped up and just want to see those four win together as a team. You want to see them swim, have fun and just be together as close friends. Seriously, it's fantastic. It can be cheesy sometimes but it does have very emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nAlso a huge plus point for the soundtrack and the animaton. I mean, it's Kyoto Animation, what did you expect ?! Also, Openings and endings are upbeat and give you an adrenaline push.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A pretty solid, heartwarming, colorful and enjoyable Sports Anime. I think boys should also give Free! a try. It's better than it's labeled to be.",

            "content": "Here's a quick breakdown of my rating: Story = 4; Art = 7; Sound = 8; Character = 4; Enjoyment = 4. \r\nThere are so many things wrong with this anime but in this review I'll only touch on the most obvious criticisms:\r\n1) The ridiculous amount of fan service in this anime is nauseating. I admit that the characters and their very hot bodies were initially a treat to the eyes, but even sweet things taste bitter if you overindulge. Seriously was it really necessary to give flashes of abs, deltoids, triceps, and the V line every 5-10 minutes? At this point the guys should'vejust gone full on naked and even then I bet the viewers wouldn't be the slightest bit shocked or impressed. The writers and the producers of Free! deserve a huge slap in the face. These high school boys are swimmers NOT strippers!!!\\n\\n\r\n2) There is ZERO knowledge about the sport of competitive swimming in this anime. Lets get this straight, freestyle is a type of swimming stroke NOT a type of swimming style. In other words, a swimmer can incorporate certain techniques with strokes to achieve a type or \"style\" of swimming, but the strokes in themselves don't describe a swimming style. It really frustrated me that the writers didn't understand this basic concept. Like in episode 3 when Rey Ryugazaki confessed \"I want that kind of freedom\" and Haruka Nanase responded \"It's not freedom. It's freestyle.\" I wanted to smack my head on the table until it bled of 'cuz of the sheer stupidity and cheesiness of that line. Also in every team relay one swimmer MUST swim freestyle so the fact that the MC, Nanase, refuses to swim in relays because he \"only swims freestyle\" MAKES NO FREAKIN' SENSE WHATSOEVER!!!\\n\\n\r\n3) Now let's talk about content. Oh wait, what content? There was NO content worthy of discussion in this anime. It's a shame because speaking from prior experience competitive swimming is a brutal yet fascinating sport. There are so many intricacies involved in competitive swimming (like learning how to hold your breath for an extended period, mastering flip turns, cutting down time, toning your muscles, swimming long distance vs. short distance) that could've have been incorporated in this anime. If the writers focused on the actual sport of competitive swimming Free! could've been a great shonen anime, but for some reason the writers chose to focus on the aesthetics and lame high school drama. Yeah, the writers and producers really deserve a slap in the face for wasting the anime's potential.",

(DUH) but I have noticed guys pointing out the fact that they believe its a show for fan service. well if you are a guy then it would probably stand out like that because the guys are shirtless like 90% of the time. im not saying they don't have the right to think that, but as a girl I am happy to have found this anime. \r\n1) there are no awkward boob scenes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nGOD FORBIN THERE BE AN ANIME WITHOUT BOOBS\r\n 2) Yes the guys are shirtless and overly detailed in the muscle department, but what matters to methe most is character development. I don't watch this show for the shirtless guys. I watch it because its a good show about friends and the struggles you deal with in your day to day life.\\n\\n\r\n3) no one has magical powers. just training and determination.\\n\\n\r\n4)  makoto\\n\\n\r\n5) to elaborate on #4, Makoto is the best friend of Haru. he's hard working, cares for his friends and family, and he looks great in glasses.\\n\\n\r\n6) this is the most realistic anime I have ever watched and its cool that you can relate to characters on a personal level. \\n\\n\r\n7) GOD FORRBID THERE BE A SHOW WITH SHIRTLESS GUYS. its not like they are naked like girls in all the other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot line is very simple. like most sport anime you can pretty much tell that the outcome is going to be that they win. and hey if they don't, they cry as a team and move on. nobody dies, they are just sometimes defeated. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you are tired of watching all your favorite characters die or suffer, this is a great show to watch! if you don't want to watch it, there is a great parody of this on YouTube called 50% off. the parody is nothing like the show but its really funny!\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch, its really good!",

            "content": "When I first was told about this anime, I had heard the rumors of it being the \"gay swimming anime\" followed by an iconic trill of giggles. I'm not too into yaoi, so I kept my distance and watched from afar. It wasn't until my friend made it a \"must watch\" when I decided to test the water, if you will.\r\nFirst off, this show is not a yaoi (shocker!). It is rather a very well drawn shoujo of a group of friends who just so happen to be shirtless most of the time (for swimming, of course).\r\nThe music itself was quite outstanding. What shocked mewas that I had never heard dubstep in an anime before. It matched the show's upbeat tempo and intense races and brought me into what I was watching.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, there isn't much to show. When I really think about it,  I really don't know anything about these characters other than that they're friends. You learn nothing really personal about these characters, but this is a shoujo. It's sort of to be expected. But if they were to put in more effort then this show would have probably broken through the roof more than it already has.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a great show to watch when you are under a lot of emotional stress. The friendship and few adventures they have leave me with such a goofy grin. Though people may watch it for the \"fanservice,\" I watched it for the proportions. At times I thought I was going to cry, and this show isn't even that sad. I was just so friggin happy! Another plus is that this show is most definitely a jab at shows which over-sexualize their female characters. There are a couple female characters in this show and although they are not very prominent, it was a pleasant surprise to not see over-exaggerated breasts. Rather, the show is more focused on the muscular physique of its male characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would recommend this show to anyone who likes to smile and doesn't mind thinking too hard about the plot. It's pretty much thrown out there and isn't meant to get too serious. You, as the audience, are supposed to be drawn into what the sole purpose of the show is about: mending broken ties through swimming competition. As my first review on anime, I hope this input helped!",

            "content": "I am a girl and I am not a pervert and I do not watch this anime because of the beautiful characters swimming their bodies and showing the beauty of working out etcetera, etcetera... \r\nGuilty much?\r\nBut Seriously, I hate bulky muscular men as much as I hate large and unrealistic breasts. I'm not really the fanservice loving type.\r\nWhich brings us to my review:\r\nTo be frank, I've seen the story before. It is much alike to the KNB series and they are both in the sports genre. But I wouldn't want to compare because when I do, things would get a little bit rusty.( Don't worry,no magic and superstitions are applied in this show.) I think the plot is mediocre because it isn't original and the scenes were pretty much predictable and so on and so forth. Some jokes feel flat and some aren't entertaining. A lot of people would say that this show is gay, well, it is. I am quite feeling uneasy while watching this anime. Muscles, water and some expected scenes are showing up. The only unique part of this show is that it used \"Swimming\" as the main theme. On the other hand, the points and conflicts were too simple, I usually ended up comparing it to other Sport related anime like, Slam Dunk and Kuroko no Basket. I am getting tired of childhood friends seeing one another in the future. Anyway, I watched the whole thing and it was just okay. The great news for fans is that this series will have a new season this coming July. In my opinion, I think the ending is just fine and it went smoothly. There isn't any empty feeling around here. Nevertheless, they don't make hilarious comedic acts that feels awkward all the time in the second season, I don't see any reason why they would not make another season. I just wish they would make the plot more complicated and execute funny moments properly without making it corny. Some jokes are a bit off and becoming repetitive. But then again, all in all it was just okay for me.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation have been animating great shoujo animes like Clannad and Air and now, Free!, a shiny anime with vibrant particles in many shapes and sizes. The animation is as always modern and fantastic. Who knew water can be so beautiful when animated? The greatness of the characters' eyes were just like Hyouka's. I feel a bit suspicious. The uniforms look tangy and colorful. The swimsuit kinda ruined it for me. But I like the art. It's not the ordinary cartoonic style.\\n\\n\r\nA bit complex and jumpy tones were delivered in all episodes of Free! The opening and the ending were just fine and exquisite to hear. A mix of rock and pop with a bit of athletic speed tempo were present in both songs. There is also a sad piano background music which is for dramatic moments. Others, well not really that outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nHere we go, Characters (5). I personally hate yellow-haired jolly guys so Nagisa isn't one of my favorites. Makoto has a very calm and friendly personality, gentleman of some sort. Rei is practically Narcissistic. Rin has a transition of personalities from grade school to high school and then there's a tsundere guy, Haruka. I do not like tsundere boys and girls but Haruka made the exception. I think he is adorable despite the fact being like Kuroko Tetsuya(but I like Haruka more), and possess some kind of innocent voice and attitude. However I dislike the fact that he and Makoto always hang out and talk about personal and deep stuff and then after ten seconds their faces almost touched and not to mention their lips, I just feel like their hacing yaoi and I really hate yaoi themed animes. Oh, and I feel weird because Makoto's seiyuu is the same seiyuu of Yoshida HARU which is kind of unusual when he calls Haruka, \"Haru\" when he became Haru. (confused.)\\n\\n\r\nI liked it but not all of it. It is a slice of life kind of anime so it has a friendly approach and a sweet aura. Fillers were seen in a lot of episodes that shouldn't be there. 12 episodes and a lot of fillers? No can do. The jokes were really off and undoubtedly stupid. Gay scenes, Gay scenes everywhere. This is a fanservice for females I think who love gorgeous bodies of men floating and swimming in water with their vibrant hair colors and big bulky muscles. Oh my God, it chills through the spine. I hate fanservice so much!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't want to drop the whole thing and if I have time, I might sneak a peek at the second season this coming July. I liked the ending, it is happy  not a tragic and not a fugging open ending. Honestly speaking, if you are a straight guy and you feel awkward about watching other guys' beautiful body then don't see this because it has a lot of it. For girls, I think you'll love and hate this series. I think I'll forget this anime someday to the point that it just take up my time but I will recommend it to sports writers and people who can't swim because you will learn something from this anime. At least, you learned something... right?\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I actually wanted to give this a 9, but that would mean giving this show the same rating I gave to the first two Rebuild of Evangelion movies and the second season of Ghost in the Shell: SAC. Maybe even an 8 seems absurd, but this anime is exactly what I think a fanservice series targeted towards girls should be: lighthearted, sweet, funny, and loaded with characters that are attractive and easy to fall in love with. \r\nIf this was really just a sports anime, I wouldn't give it such a high score, but honestly...Free! is as much about the muscles and the boys whohave them than it is about the swimming. This anime only happened because people saw KyoAni's mock trailer, which was supposed to be a joke, and literally petitioned for it to be an actual series. In other words, this is made for people who want to watch cute shirtless boys do cute shirtless things with homoerotic subtext, and it fulfills that purpose very well.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nI wasn't actually expecting this to have much of a story, but it's there, and it's fun. It's not amazing, but Free! is not something you should be watching for the story. Just ditch it now if you're looking for something sophisticated. Free! isn't complex and it's not supposed to be. It's just fun. Corny, silly, simple, half-naked swimming fun. Unexpectedly, Free! is actually such a funny anime (on purpose). This show really never fails to make me laugh.\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNothing less than what would be expected from KyoAni. The entire thing is gorgeous, and I'm not just talking about the boys. The animation is super fluid (there we go again with the unintentional water puns), bright, colorful, and overall just great. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are really enjoyable, especially the first ending song, \"Splash Free\". The quality of the music is consistent throughout. What bugged me was that during more intense parts of the show (...as intense as the swimming anime can get), there'd be this aggressive dubstep-reminiscent electronic nonsense playing and it was so ridiculous it was funny. It's as if KyoAni was like, \"oh, let's pretend this is a serious sports anime for a minute while Rin is gazing into Haru's eyes\" and threw in serious music. Still, it didn't sound bad, and when the music is thematically appropriate, it's always good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part. They all have their strengths, their weaknesses, and their quirks; they're actually very well-rounded, and most experience very satisfying development, especially Rin. They're all very charming characters, and the character that seems to be the simplest out of all of them proves to be more than he seemed in the second season. The boys and Kou are all easy to get attached to and feel for. Also, there's more than a little homoerotic subtext. If you don't think they're gay, you're wrong. KyoAni made a genius business decision in deciding not to have any official couples, but having certain pairs show more-than-friends affection to each other at times. That keeps all the fujoshi ensnared, regardless of who they ship. I see what you're doing, KyoAni. And I don't mind. Keep going.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWhen this anime first aired, it was truly the highlight of my week. I'm not exactly a happy person -- I have health issues that keep me down rather consistently -- but my mood was always significantly better on Wednesdays (at least, I think water time was Wednesday). I was just as thrilled with the second season. I watch mostly very dark anime, so Free! was a breath of fresh air. I thought I would forget about this anime after it was done, since it's not exactly intellectual, but I was wrong. This is my go-to when I need something that I can genuinely enjoy at any time. It just doesn't get old for me; it's so full of sweetness, love, and friendship that I can't help but feel happy when I think about it. In fact, I enjoyed Free! more than I enjoyed anime that I rated 10/10.",

            "content": "An anime about swimming... how interesting can it really get? Well yes, the story can be a little simple and sometimes I felt like the series dragged on for longer than it really should have. But for me, the art of this series coupled with the genuine sensitivity behind the story trumps almost everything else (and not just because I'm fangirling over the hot bodies lol!), which is why I believe that Free! is still a unique anime and worth my time watching.\r\nLet's start with the storyline. I thought Free! had a decent story with a relatively rich emotional setting. Three (Makoto, Nagisa and Haru)out of four boys from a childhood swim team are reunited in high school and decide to start a local swim club once more upon discovering that one of their teammates has returned from Australia. The story progresses when we realise there is some conflict between Haru (a somewhat swimming prodigy who is completely obsessed with water) and Rin (portrayed as a super competitive guy) which creates unease amongst the team members of the new swim club, especially with the new member Rei (who is almost like a replacement for Rin). The plot then continues to unravel the mystery behind this tumultuous relationship between Rin and the other boys, and what it means to be part of a team in the past and in the present. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the key themes here are friendship and sportsmanship, which I didn't think would appeal to me as a committed shoujou fan. However, the story did somehow draw me in, especially when I learnt about the motivations of the characters (particularly Haru and Rin) and how they've come to be the type of person that they are. Yes there is a huge sports element to it, but sports is not really the point of the story, it's merely a means of communicating the themes of camaraderie and friendship. In that way, even if you're reading this review with the mindset that you're not into sports and this kind of anime wouldn't appeal to you, I would reconsider because swimming is just the setting, and the story of Free! operates within that setting.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I feel like there was a lot lacking in terms of the development of the other characters apart from Rin and Haru. You somewhat get to see a deeper side of Makoto and Rei throughout the series, but barely. It feels like the story almost over-focuses on Rin, upto a point where I didn't really see the point of focusing so much on one character when there's a whole cast of other interesting characters as well. And given that the series had a relatively simple storyline, I didn't see how it dragged on to 12 episodes. There were a few fillers in the middle that didn't really add any value to the plot or to the viewer's understanding of the characters, which made me feel like those one or two episodes were almost a waste considering the direction of the whole series. I mean, fillers are fine, but in a 12 episode anime, you would wonder why there is a need to put in fillers when you could put in one or two episodes about the other characters. But eh, it's not that much of a problem in the grand scheme of things, I guess I just get a little frustrated when an anime isn't efficient in terms of using episodes wisely for viewer benefit.\\n\\n\r\nSo now on to my favourite part: the art and sound. I simply can't believe how beautiful this anime is! When I watch real life swimming, it has to be one of the most boring and ugliest sports out there (sorry to all those dedicated swimmers, I used to swim a lot too, maybe I just got over it way too quickly). But wow, Free! has really blown my mind in terms of water effects and displaying the fluidity of swimming. I literally feel like I'm relaxing next to a serene pool when I watch this, the art is such a treat to my eyes. And not just because the guys have hot bodies (but no complaints about that, it only adds to the viewing value for girls like me haha!). If there was ever a situation where I could give more than 10/10 for art, this is it. Also, in terms of sound, I found both the opening and ending themes really nice, they fit well with the simultaneously competitive but fun element of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, because I was so impressed by the art, and because the story and characters were worth getting attached to, I would definitely rewatch this anime sometime in the future. The experience of watching something so beautiful and exquisite really gave me something to look forward to every week. Maybe it's because I'm the type of person who is very picky about art, but Free! really surpassed my expectations in terms of viewing pleasure whilst also providing a sound storyline.",

            "content": "I must admit that I didn't really want to watch Free, because I was pretty sure that it was all about fanservice and I fucking hate random fanservice, but I promised to my friend to watch it since she said that it was good and I should try out and because I'm the type of person who before judging has to see with her own eyes things I just accepted and I didn't not regret watching it, I swear.\r\nThe story isn't anything original but I loved it anyway, I simply loved how this story was even though had just only 12 episodes. \r\nI truely likedthe characters growth and I loved how this show showed us what means losing and obtain a friend (Rin/Rei). I also liked how they showed the feelings of the characters with expressions. You could just feel emotions in some scenes and I really could not wait for other episodes.\\n\\n\r\n This anime was a lot of fun and also a bit sad I have to admit, I seriously liked Rin's story and I liked a lot the fact that the productors showed us also what he really felt, it isn't something that you see in animes nowadays, since all you can see around is fanservice. About that topic (except for Gou's obsession over boy's body) it was really easy to stand, I didn't find it annoying or anything because I was more in the history, a thing that I appreciated though was that the fanservice wasn't there just for show, I mean you saw the characters(GOU GOU GOU) interract with that, it's better than seeing boobs without even a comment lol (and I like seeing boobs when it's not an useless fanservice). \\n\\n\r\nAnother cute aspect of this is that everything was connected, I didn't see anything left in the hands of the case, everything was perfectly united by logic (Rei could swim with butterfly style as Rin,both Rin's father and Makoto's old friend died in the same accident, the overload of scenes were Makoto gave Haru an hand or all the time he noticed the changes on his humor or just when he spoke his thoughts) that is just amazing to me cause it's like not leaving something for guarantee , as Rei's jealousy. It would be really really stupid do not touch this topic, I mean it's so obvious that if you enter in a new gruop and this group has already a close bond you feel out of this group right? Well, I thought they were not going to show it and they proved me wrong, I was like \"they cannot show this side too! That's so amazing\" I loved it, really. As I loved the fact that Rin felt replaced (though it's not said you can see it, c'mon) So to me this anime touched so many themes that i hurts.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was pretty good, I just didn't like the fact that Rei didn't join to them to the relay race .__. but I loved the fact that Rin stayed in his school and understood that he has to live for his own dream.\\n\r\nIt wasn't a masterpiece but totally a good anime and I would lose a lot if I would not watch if just for my initial thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like (without counting Gou's obsession/ though I liked her as character) was the ending. It was simply disgusting.",

            "content": "Take Free! for what it is, a fan service sports anime, and you will not be disappointed. \r\n This isn't to say that men can't enjoy this show, but just don't expect it to be something it's not. It's a sports show aimed at a female audience. Instead of the sports matches being dynamic and action packed, they are visually stunning to watch. The sports scenes have amazing artistic detail and flow, coupled with the realistic water sound effects and dramatic music (to enhance the emotions of a scene).  I re-watched this purely for how breathtakingly beautiful the art is. \r\nThe main story isnothing to write home about, it's simple male competitive tension with an underlying hint of sexual frustration. What drives this anime is the emotional aspect; a lot of the story is told through loaded gestures and the hidden meaning in actions. It's friendship full of longing, anger, jealously, nostalgia, support, love, etc. The emotional aspect is what keeps an otherwise simple story, pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one anime where the music is really successful.  Because of how they set up scenes and how they pair certain soundtracks with emotionally charged incidents from the very beginning, just hearing the same music that will set up a scene is very successful in evoking emotions in the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nIn sports anime I feel I always have to touch on the realism of the athleticism in the show. The level in this anime is one of the most believable that I have seen. Some characters are ridiculously good yes, but it is because they competitively swam (and thus appropriately trained at a high level at proper institutions) since childhood. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a sports anime that has a different take on sports anime, which is why I think it's so successful.",

            "content": "For a woman like me, watching an anime like this felt like eating candy. A bunch of really really good looking guys who happen to form a swimming club\u2026that are perfect ingredients for many nosebleeds! Kyoto Animation is well known for series like Clannad, Air and Kanon. I\u2019ve yet to see the last title, but the fanservice in these shows are mainly aimed at men. Nothing wrong with that and I loved Clannad and Air simply because they have great stories and art, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with fanservice aimed at girls either. Up until now, I haven\u2019t seen such series yet, except for otomegame anime, but there should be something better than that! And finally, I found something better. Much better!\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I\u2019m not into sports anime either, but after seeing the ads for Free!, I just couldn\u2019t let this one pass by unnoticed. The art is fantastic and colorful, and the animated water was gorgeous! The character designs were great as well, making every boy look handsome as hell and seeing them in their swimmingsuits was enough to make me excited. I\u2019m a girl after all. The soundtrack of this show was good too. I don\u2019t like dubstep very much, but it fits the show very well, giving it this \u2018cool\u2019 feel. The opening from OLDCODEX is one of my favorites this season.\\n\\n\r\nAside from good appearances, I found the story pretty good as well. Free! is about Haru who loves water so much that he wants to jump in it as soon as he sees it. Together with three childhood friends they formed a swimming club when they were in elementary school. Everything changed when one of them, Rin moved to Australia to follow his deceased father\u2019s dream to become an Olympic swimmer. The swimming club falls apart, since Haru stopped swimming and all of them went to different schools. When Haru enters high school Nagisa and Makoto happen to be in the same school and they persuade him to reestablish the old swimming club of Iwatobi Highschool. One day, they meet Rin but find out he\u2019s changed greatly. The story about friendship isn\u2019t new, but the show told it really well with lighthearted, funny moments but also intense scenes during the swimming tournaments and confrontations with Rin.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the handsome boys seemed quite natural to me. Their emotions and feelings towards eachother were portrayed really well and especially the character development of Haru and Rin is worth pointing out. Haru started of as a bit cold and quiet boy, but as the show progressed he seemed to become more open and talked more. Only in the end Rin\u2019s breakdown seemed a bit too expected and too sudden. There were some moments that felt a bit BL-ish and could be easily misunderstood for that, but isn\u2019t it just true friendship? You want to be with your closest friends too, right? And hug your great teammates when you reach the first place?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this a really entertaining show. It\u2019s easy to say as a girl to whom this series is aimed at, but in the end I actually loved it. On that point dear KyoAni succeeded. But I\u2019m not so shallow minded as it seems. Good looks are important, but if I found this series boring or the story was really bad, I wouldn\u2019t enjoy this as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nFree! is a great show for girls (and maybe boys too?) who want to look at some handsome men, and in the mean time enjoy a good story too. The story is not great and pretty simple, but enjoyable. If you expected KyoAni to make anime just for men and are ticked off because this is aimed ad girls, you might be really disappointed. But then again; appearances are not the most important thing. If you enjoyed the story, then it\u2019s not important to who it\u2019s aimed at!",

            "content": "I found Free to be a surprisingly fascinating watch - whether it be because of the lush animation, or the characters themselves, the ultimate result was an enjoyable anime that really managed to capture my attention.\r\nStarting with the art direction, most the scenes in Free! are a pleasure to look at - this is down to the beautiful animation which builds on a clean palette of colours to create a sleek effect that runs throughout the show. As many people have noticed, the way water is animated in the program really stands out as something special. There's a sense of depth to it that I'dimagine is very difficult to produce. In addition to this, the characters themselves are well designed, their movements fluid and their images well defined. Personally, I feel that some shows fall into the trap of making their characters look a little too similar. Here, there's no such problem. The five boys that make up the principle cast do borderline on being colour-coded, which does almost add up to being a little too obvious, but they manage to pull back from the brink. Praise should also go to the design of the women in the show - Gou especially, who is almost our, the viewer's, avatar in the world of Free! Nothing in particularly stands out in her design as something great, but I find that there's something pleasing about her look.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was okay, but I ultimately feel that it was nothing to write home about. It's never something that really stands out to me, which I guess to some might be a good thing in that it never feels intrusive. It complements what's going on plot-wise and scenery-wise well, so it's hard to knock it as being bad. \\n\\n\r\nPlot-wise, the show has one clear goal in mind from the outset, and it generally stick with this theme throughout the series. What I personally love so much about the story is how character driven it is. Considering this could be seen as a sports anime, where often the main goal is simply to win a trophy, the goals here seem to be much more driven by the characters' relationships with each other. Often in anime, men's bonds aren't really discussed in the way they are here. Some see this as borderline yaoi bait (there are a lot of pretty healthy shipping communities in the Free! fandom) but I find it refreshing to see a group of adolescent boys talking so openly about their feelings. So many anime go for the angst ridden young male that they almost seem to forget there are others as well (of course there is a character in the show who does follow that stereotype, but I felt that Rin, along with Nagisa, who plays the naive role, to be the weakest character.). As you can probably guess by my username there is one character who really stood out in my book - Makoto Tachibana. I found that his personality so wonderfully permeated all the scenes he took part in, which was wonderful to see. There was a strong sense of character development there which I loved. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Free! is in my book, an underrated anime. Too many people are willing to write it off as 'that swimming anime with the scantily clad men', but ultimately, the tale it tells is a heartwarming one of friendship and honesty. I highly recommend you check it out.",

            "content": "Free! Iwatobi Swim Club is the first anime that I watched the full series of. Therefore, going into this I was a bit skeptical. Would I really like anime? Why was there so much hype over this? Would my love of swimming be able to save me from the vortex of the Free!dom? Was the ED song even possible to play on the piano? \r\nTo my surprise, I ended up enjoying this quite a bit. It's probably not the anime that most people would agree should be a first anime to watch, but that's what I ended up doing. \r\n[ This is the first reviewI've ever written, so I don't know if this is good or not... ]\\n\\n\r\nStory :: 8\\n\r\nTo an outsider ( i.e. me, the anime noob ), Free! looked like something about an excess of muscles and very beautifully animated water. I wasn't expecting much of a plot because everyone who had seen it already could only talk about the muscles. However, fear not, there is a plot in behind all the fanservice, and it's not a unique one, but it's nevertheless interesting. I found myself earnestly anticipating what would happen in each episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt :: 9\\n\r\nAh, the main focus of most people would most certainly be the art in this anime. Fanservice aside, everything was wonderfully drawn and it most certainly raised my standards for art in anime that I watched in the future! I can't give this a 10, though, because while the character designs are attractive, now that I've watched more anime, I find that they aren't extraordinarily unique. But I suppose that's to be expected. This isn't a science fiction or fantasy anime, after all. The one thing that bothered me on occasion is that the side profiles of the people can look a bit strange sometimes, but it didn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSound :: 9\\n\r\nI had an unhealthy obsession with the ED, Splash Free, probably because I was trying to play it on the piano and the sheet music I had required some work because of the octave-jumping, and I spent a long time trying to learn them. The OP and ED are both very catchy, the background music sets a nice ambiance [ though it can be lost and unnoticed much of the time ], and the character songs are wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter :: 8\\n\r\nThis anime did a good job of introducing me to the basic character tropes of anime- megane, tsundere, shota, whatever you use to refer to them- and I liked the personalities of all the characters. I do think that their personalities could have been given more facets, however, which would have made for a much more interesting story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :: 9 \\n\r\nFree! Iwatobi Swim Club is kind of my guilty anime pleasure now. It's not my favourite anime, but it's possibly the one that I follow and talk about the most because it's so popular and well-known. \\n\\n\r\nOverall :: 9\\n\r\nFree! is not the best anime out there. However, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit [ and somewhat jealous of the swimming. Why isn't my butterfly beautiful? ] and it appealed to me in many ways. Oh, and I did accomplish playing the ED ;) all's well that ends well.",

And as for the red head it doesn't really explain why he became so bastardy really...\r\nHowever, with the story I couldn't help but think \"this has got to be more than bromances.\" And found myself saying \"They are so gay for each other\" more than once per episode. On a side note I have nothing against homosexuals orlesbians.",

            "content": "First of all, straight guy here. Second of all, this anime is actually pretty good.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story follows 3 high schoolers who were child hood friends establishing a swim club. There's so much fanservice here that it is painfully obvious that men aren't the real target audience. But still it has a cohesive plot. The characters are interesting but most look like side characters just to fill the story. It also hasn't made much layout for the background story of each character. Although it failed my expectation of it at least sizing up to [i]Haikyuu![/i] it's still watchable and I might just start thesecond season soon.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nNow here is where 90% of the staff probably focused. The art is amazing. Very clean and very sharp. No bad quality fast scenes that will leave a bit of bad taste, but then again the actual swimming in this anime might not even total an hour for the whole series so I can't really say much in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe scores are actually nice and not boring. Not very exciting either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8 [I'm gonna give them nicknames coz Nagisa likes nicknames and I like them too]\\n\r\nHaru (the Water Jet) is the main protagonist-- a guy who likes to wear is swim suit under his normal clothes. He's very fixated on his old friend Rin who went away hen they were still in elementary. He obviously has a man-crush on his friend but the anime doesn't really depict him as such.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa (the Dolphin) and Makoto (the Kingfisher) are Haru's childhood friends and are mostly side characters made to make Haru and Rin more the focus of the story (like supporting characters to enhance the main characters and be the glue to the story). Although Makoto got an episode about his background story, it was not very memorable and would be forgotten on the next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nRin (the Great White) is Haru's \"rival\" or friend or whatever you wanna call him. He was Haru's really really good friend in elementary but went away to train his swimming skills. He returns and disregards his old friends and acts cocky. He has the deepest character amongst them and the one with the most notable character development.\\n\\n\r\nRei (the Water Butterfly) is the newest member of the swimming club and looks up to Haru. He can only swim Butterfly and sinks when he tries other techniques. He is actually one of my favorite characters with the most admirable trait amongst the swimmers. He is smart and very athletic. He is also the bridge(a character that plays a critical role to let the story move forward but isn't a main character) of the story from around episode 3 to the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nI recommend watching it if you are tired of the action animes or other generic genres. It's a nice easy going anime that has a nice pacing and has a potential to grow into a much much more exciting and enjoyable anime.",

It holds a very good lesson that connecting with other people will always be more important than being the best. \r\nWithout getting too gushy, I really do admire the strength, diversity, and depth of the five boys we get to know in this anime.

The anime shows how it feels to be a part of a team and how friendship and inspiration can have a huge impact on your life. This group of friends are very close and they not only love swimming but they loveswimming together as a team, as friends. Yes yes I\u2019m a girl and they are all very nice to look at,  but I think that it\u2019s anime can hit home for even guys. I also really enjoyed the music this anime as well.

Yeah, the fanservice can and will get a little annoying here and there but Free!(unlike most fanservice filled shows) has good character and a actual plot. Now, back the review. Pros to Kyoto Animation for making the animation and sound so beautiful and fluid( well they did create on of themost saddest anime of all time...you know what i'm talking about) I didn't really like the anime because of the random fanservice( since its a swimming anime) but i digress the anime is still cool in its own ways.",

This story tellsyou that there is a chance of that return, and it's almost ironic that reality doesn't bet on it whereas fiction does. This one definitely shows you what that happy ending will look like and what you can do to get there, whether you are a Haru or a Rin.

Yowamushi Pedal being the first sports anime that I've actually liked, and it's following Yowamushi Pedal: Grande Road (which I'm still viewing). My enjoyment of Yowamushi Pedal was due to the attention to character development, and the obvious love for road racing by all the information giving about the spot. \r\nFree does not spend that type of time explaining the sport. It's all kept to a minimum only explaining about the different swimming styles and strokes. Nope, the true attention to details is spent on the muscles of the swimmers. This isfanservice for the ladies. And I enjoyed that sparkling flowers and over the top body scanning scenes weren't used. Most of the time. Instead we get to see them on display through swimming, stretching, and working out. So it felt a little more natural. Which I appreciate. It's true I watched for the fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all stereotypical, but I do appreciate that the writing attempts to flesh them out. I won't claim it's great, but enough that I could tell them apart from their other stereotype partners. \\n\\n\r\nThe story basically evolves around why the swimmers swim and the mystery to what happened to Rin and Haruka. Not to mention the meaning of swimming free. For swimming for the team and not for selfish reasons. So there was that attempt. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want super Yaoi it's actually really tame. There's some veiled meaning behind water metaphors and such. As someone who is not Yoai fan I did enjoy it. AND I secretly want the next season to go there. Especially with things between Rin and Haruka. These to guys have serious chemistry. Many others do together, but Rin and Haruka are amazing to watch together. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest though the writing and plot is all at a bare minimum. So while I enjoyed myself I know I'll never come back for a reviewing. There wasn't much there to require that. This is fanservice. From guys wearing swim trunks under their close to strip at a moment. The overly dramatic swim scenes where their breathing underwater and spanning the sexy bodies. Yeah. Fanservice. Not only that but I felt like the one really interesting character gets benched and underappreciated by his new friends. Here's to next season delivering more character development. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end this one is for those who like to look at the male form. You don't have to feel to guilty because there is some attempt to make it's man candy have personalities. The story is engaging enough that I genuinely wanted to know what happened in the past, and see these characters pull through to the future. Though I am happy it's streaming on Crunchyroll. This isn't one that I'd actually add to my collection, or rewatch in the future.",

            "content": "Free! is the continuing story of four friends who are joined by just two things: their love of swimming, and their status as \"boys who have girly names,\" following the events of the light novel High\u2606Speed! That said, reading the High\u2606Speed! is absolutely not essential to understanding and appreciating Free!, though it may add to the experience; I, personally, enjoyed the series just fine without it, though I don't doubt I'll read the novel in the future.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAs previous reviews have already stated, the plot is not the strongest point of the show- four boys reunited by chance get back into their old hobby ofswimming- however, this is a story driven more by characters than plot, anyway. While Free! might not fit in nicely with other sports anime, where the sport is always on the forefront of each character's mind, in Free! swimming is merely a vehicle to serve the story's main purpose: main character Haruka's emotional growth throughout the series. The series demonstrates Haruka's social and emotional withdrawal in the beginning of the series, then uses his involvement in the swim team to help him reconnect to the world. Often, however, the show will divert from even that plot to give fanservice moments and cute antics, which gives it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the highest points of Free!, the show is absolutely beautifully drawn and animated. The visuals are clear and appealing, the colors pop pleasantly; all in all, the art is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this series was also great. Though the opening theme might not seem to fit, it does work nicely with the rest of the sounds, which featured a wide range of styles from \"muffled rap music in the distance\" to \"was that dubstep I just heard?\" to the stereotypically cute town melody. It's not often I even recognize sound in anime, but watching the series, it does add to the overall enjoyment of the series. The end theme, sung by the main five voice actors, was cute and tied the show up nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's true: the characters are somewhat typical. I would, however, counter that with their overall likability. They play off each other nicely, and it's easy to tell the series really revolves around them and their emotional connections to each other. It's because of their interactions that I give them 9/10; if they didn't work together nearly as well, I'd rate them 8 or even 7/10 for being, frankly, a bit flat. As they play off each other, though, they drive each other-and the plot- forward, and are, again, fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've said this many times already, but Free! is just an enjoyable show. It's not a dark psychological analysis of the human condition, or an epic journey across time and space; it's just a few guys who like swimming and hanging out with their buds. Plain and simple. They swim, they make jokes, they get up to some wacky hijinks; there's the show. And it's absolute fun, especially when the series was running concurrent to such a dark show as Attack on Titan. It's a breath of fresh air from all the \"darker and edgier\" nonsense that's been going on. Just absolute fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the series a 9/10 in review; however, I feel it deserves a high 9, for whatever that's worth. If you're expecting something deep and meaningful, you'll have to work to find it in Free!- but if you're looking to watch a short series and relax, Free! is second to none.",

            "content": "I don't know about you guys, but what brought me to this anime was that youtube promo (you know, back when it was called \"swimming anime\" and had an epic sound track?). I must confess, I was incredibly anticipating this anime. I mean come on, I'm a girl, I've got my bishie-needs. Safe to say. The anime was no let down. \r\nThe story is a bit stereotypical of sport animes. I'm giving it a 7. Very simplistic. A guy who loves his sport, has a rival, your typical used-to-be-friends-but-after-some-major-event-we-hate-each-other. However, whats wrong with stereotypes right? This anime has a rather engaging plot. It kept meseated for a good few hours. Classics are sometimes the best. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather stunning, if I may say so myself. It has originality, its own style. It's not grandma-safe, but then again, if you are drawn to this anime, you wouldn't be the grandma kind anyway. Not to mention, the guys in swimsuits don't leave much to the imagination (And here I was beginning to think that only guys got the butt in bikinis fanservice). But yes, as we all had guessed, this anime has a lot of wet pecs and triceps on display, not that too many of us are complaining. The art deserves a 9.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is not the kind that causes your inner musician to awaken and inspire you to pick up your dusty violin to play crappy internet downloaded sheet music in the desperate attempt to recreate the awe-inspiring sound. But no, there is no cringe and you don't feel the soul-deep itch to skip the intro. But, then again, I kinda expected more from the music, considering how the promo I mentioned earlier has sound that is still in my head 5 months after I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are stereotypical; the rival with anger management issues, the guy nest door best friend, the cutie who looks like a grade schooler, the glasses-interlect, the tsundere main yeah yeah. It's what we know and love. But one thing that has compelled me to give this an 8 is the fact that all the characters are somehow relate-able. The antagonist is not the kind that uses underhanded tricks to pull down the protagonist. They are honorable and compete fairly. That is rare in an anime that includes competition, producers seem to think that we love to see the antagonist use dirty tricks, only to lose.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also have a strong sense of team spirit and group loyalty. its what we expect in a sports anime, but nice all the same. They each do a bit of individual soul searching, and thankfully, they do come to a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is certainly very enjoyable. Great characters, pretty art, compelling slice of life, perfect for a lazy afternoon. So long as your intention is not to NIT PICK the anime apart and look into the \"DEEP MEANINGS\" and \"social implications\" of the depiction of young peoples or what ever, you will find this anime enjoyable. Just don't go all English-analysis-mode. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, I think its worth mentioning, this anime teeters on the edge of being shounen-ai. I seriously doubt these boys are heterosexual. There's just some kind of sexual tension that underlies this anime. I don't know. If the anime is a BL, like Junjou, then you don't get this strange nervousness when watching it. But free! is supposed to be slice of life. Hard to explain, but this anime is certainly going to inspire some squeals from yaoi fain girls. \\n\\n\r\nFree! is an interesting anime that is worth watching, the key is not to walk into it with all your hate for fanservice and sexual undertones. After all, we are here for enjoyment, not for tearing our beloved anime apart and criticizing every piece.",

I have nothing but my time to lose, so why the hell not? I am pretty good at that already.\r\nAfter the first episode I was not impressed at all and dropped this anime because characters were very poor and plot was nothing but a big nuisance. Nothing made any sense, all I saw was some gay looking guys with poor, unoriginal personalities. But when I finally decided to get back to Free!, I finished it in acouple of days. Don't get me wrong, I still was not enjoying it that much, actually, I was just looking for some plot and common sense in this gay anime (I like yaoi, so maybe that gayish atmosphere kept me there).\\n\\n\r\nI could not go with this anime just because of one particular character - Rin Matsuoka. I could not believe how anyone could be so stupid and arrogant to fuck up a nice friendship and it just had to take another innocent character to put everyone in their minds and give some common sense. That is the most unoriginal thing someone could come up with. I still don't understand why Rin had to do they way he did, though everthing was finally explained in some twisted logic (is logic a good word here?). \\n\\n\r\nThough Free! has poor protagonists, the art is really nice and eye-catching. I really enjoyed animation and sound quality. I cannot say anything bad about it (muscles are really pretty nice, girls c;).\\n\\n\r\nIn overall, people who love sports anime will definitely love this one too but the ones who like philosophy, logic and fine reasoning won't be satisfied with plost and whole storyline at all.",

There's a perverted girl that has an obsession to muscles.\r\nThis anime was pretty funny, if I ignore the stuff thatmakes me uncomfortable, then this is a pretty good anime. Obviously, this anime is catered more to females, it's more like a shoujo Boy's Love anime more than a sports anime (which I thought was about swimming), but nevertheless it was good. \\n\\n\r\nThere's quite a fair amount of comedy, lots of crying (the characters), and I suppose, touching moments (can't say I felt anything during the tear jerking feels portion of the anime). The art is nice, I liked the sound, but the story was a bit mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you don't mind watching a slightly homosexual anime, and you're comfortable watching masculine males getting close together, all huggy buddy and bubbly together, then this might be a good anime to watch.",

            "content": "I was fairly interested in watching Free! when I first knew of its existence. The series was yet to start and I noticed that it was garnering a lot of attention. When I saw a group visual for the anime, I immediately knew why, but I wasn't in it for the topless guys splashing around a pool full of other topless guys (okay, maybe a bit hihi). I enjoy sports anime very much so I was really in it for the tournaments and other stuff that comes along with it. \r\nStory - 7/10 \r\nWhen I found out that the series was only 12 episodes long,I got a bit skeptical. I noticed how sports anime usually lasts at least 25 episodes per series so I had a hunch that the quality of the story (or how they convey it) would be quite compromised. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was, okay. It went at a fair pace, although there were times when I thought \"Well, that escalated quickly.\" but they were rare times and could easily be overlooked. There were moments where the story becomes a little bit predictable, but maybe that's just because I'm someone who unconsciously likes to predict possible outcomes of this and that. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough everything was about swimming, unlike other sports anime, Free! didn't revolve much around the dynamics and technicalities of the sport. Rather, the series was leaning more to how swimming affected the main character (Haru) and the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - 10/10\\n\r\nHECK YES. The art is probably one of the major reasons why I wanted to watch the series. Free! was visually stunning, and no, not just because of the well carved torsos or the impeccably perfect triceps, but because of the well carved torsos and the impeccably perfect triceps. Haha! But seriously, it wasn't because they were hot as summer whenever they appear sans their shirts, it's because of how well they were portrayed sans their shirts. The detail is no joke, people. And the way they animated them moving through difficult-to-animate water was just STUNNING. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, they do wear clothes other than their swimsuits and uniforms. Another factor that I really like about the art is how each character is does not have one full closet of the same casual clothing. Provided that the times that they do wear casual clothing is less than when they're shirtless or in their school uniform, all the more that I appreciate the effort exerted in making their clothes vary and fashionable. \\n\\n\r\nI can't even properly put to words how amazing the art (and animation) is for Free! but if you want to check it out without really spoiling yourself, you can go and search videos of the Opening and Ending clips of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the OP and ED of the series, both were enjoyable and can really get you hooked. The opening song is sang by Oldcodex, and having watched Kuroko no Basuke, I didn't have to worry about whether I was going to like the opening song or not. It was upbeat and listening to it coupled with the animation would really get you hyped up. Whenever I watch and/or listen to it I would unknowingly feel my breath hitch for a second or two. You know how songs could reach out to you in a certain way whenever you hear it? Being a music lover, songs that make me hold my breath while building excitement are the best! \\n\\n\r\nBut while I liked the opening song, the ending song is what got me sold! The concept was very unique. It was different and entertaining to watch. The music was perfect in every way that it can be. I adore the song so much that I have it on repeat right this moment (LSS right here guys, save me) and I probably won't be able to get it out of my head for the rest of the week. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime were okay. It doesn't stand out greatly, but that doesn't matter much since mostly don't even notice that a soundtrack is playing. However I do take notice of the background music of scenes, whether they're appropriate or not, and for Free!, well, it was again, okay. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned above, Free! doesn't dwell on the technicalities and dynamics of swimming but more on how the sport influences the main character and the people around him. This means that unlike in other sports anime, character development in Free! isn't only limited to one's growth his/her skills and attitude towards the sport and the competition. Truth be told, there is little to no development with their swimming skills other than their increasing stamina and other basic aspects. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the focal point of the series. Their attitude towards each other was highlighted throughout the twelve episodes and it was pretty interesting to watch for a change. Although it is implied in the first few episodes how there's some deep history between Haru and Rin, later on you'll discover how it wasn't that deep really, but also not too shallow. The characters still had substance and albeit somewhat lacking in a way (probably because of how short the series was), were still fairly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nWhat girl wouldn't enjoy seeing half-naked boys splashing about with more half-naked boys, right? Lol, that sounded so wrong, but hey, the series was still pretty entertaining to watch. I was a little bit let down when I discovered how the series wasn't geared much to the sport itself, but I still ended up wanting to watch it till the end. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of cringe-worthy moments and yes I'm pertaining to the fanservice moments of the series. It was disturbing but not to the extent that I had to pause the episode to take a breather and compose myself. I'm an expert in ignoring fanservice as the series progresses so it wasn't much of a problem for me.\\n\\n\r\nI was skeptical at first, but in the end it was enjoying; not one of the greats, but still entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a sports anime that's toned down in terms of tournaments and competitive rivalry, then I'd suggest you check out Free! Although the story was a little lacking, it doesn't really matter much once you actually watch it. Not bad, so I say.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS!\r\nCharacters 8\\10\r\nI would first love to talk about fanservice:\r\nFree! is highly criticized because of the fanservice, but I don't understand why.\r\nThe characters are hot. Yes this is true. They have muscles, but in no way did I feel that they had no personality. Let's start with Haru:\r\nHaru is antisocial and a quirky guy whose only concern is swimming. He doesn't enjoy doing things that take too much effort.\r\nHe likes to do as he pleases. At first glance it doesn't seem like it, but he does in fact cares about his friends. I would like to discuss his character more but it will be filledwith spoilers. You might feel like he got it all figured out, but actually, he is not so sure anymore, which makes him very confused.\\n\\n\r\nRin: more about him in second season, too. Anyway, he moved to Australia to learn swimming professionally, only to come back four years later. He changed, he is not this cheerful and bold as he was as a kid and he is aggressive and brutal. We later discover why he changed and turned out to be like this and we do feel it is only natural for him to feel that way.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa: He seems harmless at first glance, but he actually would go very far into getting what he wants. He can be annoying at times and manipulative, but he does have good intentions and he deeply cares for his friends.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto: oooh where should i start? He is a goodhearted kid who cares deeply for his friends and always takes care of Haru.\\n\r\nHe is able to be manipulative but he doesn't really have bad intentions. He doesn't mind showing his fears. He cares deeply for Haru and he gets worried about him easily. He sacrifices for his friend.\\n\\n\r\nRei: You think he is a brutal and clever guy. He is very clever when it comes to logic and he is a genius when it comes to calculating things, but it seems that he can be easily manipulated. He is not stupid, he is simply naive. He doesn't like anything that isn't beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nNitori: He is a sweetheart. He seems to care for Rin, but he isn't able to figure him out. He lacks self confidence, but he can be determined. More about him in the second season.\\n\r\nThis is it for the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. I am not simply talking about the characters; the water. Do you know how hard it is to draw water and make it believable? Also, the character design was really good; their bodies fit perfectly with the type of strokes they do. Also, their expressions were very believable and made you understand what they were thinking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\10:\\n\r\nThe voice actors were really good! They were able to convey the emotions of the characters. I thought that the music was good as well to set the mood, but sometimes I felt like it didn't always need to have a background music.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\10\\n\r\nThe story was enjoyable and cute and the plot was well written. It is simple and not too complicated, but the reason why i thought it was very good was because of how well it went with the characters and I believe that, with their personalities, their ways of acting were very believable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\10:\\n\r\nThere was never a moment where I was bored, I laughed my ass off a lot and at the same time I felt so sad and was left with SO many feels. The last episode, I was laughing and punching a pillow and I had so many feels!!! It got even better in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\10\\n\r\nIts simple plot and believable characters were mixed with appealing arts and beautiful sounds, and mixing drama and comedy, the anime was in the end very good and I can say that it motivated me to do few things I have been delaying, after watching them working hard and triumphing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime. Heck, this anime is the reason why I watched 10 other anime just to shake off this empty feeling after it all ended!",

            "content": "High school boys in swimsuits, what more can you ask for?\r\nFree is no doubt different from others from the sports genre, why you ask\r\nWell it has to do with swimming and it caters to the female audience in terms of animation but other than that its follows the same story structure.\r\nFree isn\u2019t as intense as most sports anime like Hajime no Ippo or Kuroko no basket, reason for this is most likely due to it only being 12 episodes. As I said before Free follows the basic sport genre structure, that being; you meet the main character Haruka Nanase, he trains for competition then hecompetes in said competition.  Additionally the story involves flashbacks , member recruiting, character development and understanding parts as well as the good ol comic relief segments that end up progressing the story.\\n\r\nIn terms of pacing, Free has done quite well as nothing feels rush and flows nicely like a stream\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhy does he have shark teeth? \\n\r\nThe character design in free is really good as the characters look quite good in terms of colour and structure. All the male characters have a tone lean build, which is accompanied by epic abdominals that only appear in competition. The water is a high point to the art, as it simply looks beautiful.\\n\r\nThe Scenery is also done pretty good and it will catch your eye.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and different from each other which makes free a lot more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Haruka the stone cold, emotionless one with a fetish for water\\n\r\nMakoto, a father like character with a kind and caring nature\\n\r\nNagisa, the more girly type of guy, whose sociable and easy going\\n\r\nRei; the guy who thinks everything can be explained and accomplished with theory\\n\r\nShark boy: a competitive, arrogant P***k with a obsession in beating haruka which he secretly loves(Opinionated)\\n\r\nthere also few others such as Shark boy sister Gou. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP was really good it looked good(except for the rape scene) and sounded awesome, the ED not so much as it failed in every way\\n\r\nSoundtrack/background noise was done well and was timed really well, making it that much more enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe voice actors have done a good job and they match their characters. My only qualm with the sound is for the silver hair chap who has the most irritating voice and personality in short he\u2019s worse than the ED.\\n\\n\r\nFree is a good watch that will leave you satisfied. It can get a bit homo at times but other than that it\u2019s a decent sport anime. \\n",

            "content": "Everyone wants to be free. The definition of free is different for everybody though. Well for Haruka Being free means being in the water and you\u2019re about to discover what Free! means for me. ^^\r\nWell to be honest I am quite disappointed in Free!. Why? Because I started watching it as recommendation from Kuroko no Basket. Well lets make one thing clear Free! isn\u2019t about sports at all. It is more about friendship and slice of life. \u201cHow can you make swimming exciting?\u201d was my first question when I started this serie. Waiting for to be blown off my chair I started this serie. UnfortunatelyI didn\u2019t even felt a breeze and my chair just stayed upright. But after watching the first 8 episodes I realized that the serie doesn\u2019t rely on that at all. From then the serie became much better for me. I found this serie fairly enjoyable, what means I don\u2019t regret watching it. But on the other side I won\u2019t recommend this serie to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nNow all this is known, I guess I can start the review properly now. Well the story is about a group of guys (With girl names) that like to swim. At first they seem to have a weird bond. It is later on that you see how big and natural it actually is. I don\u2019t think you need to know much more since the strength of it isn\u2019t the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about the series are the characters. Especially Haruka and Rin, who are old teammates/friends but eventually became rivals because of some circumstances. Well the rival story isn\u2019t completely true. Rin takes Haruka as his rival, but Haruka doesn\u2019t feel like taking swimming competitively serious. He just loves to be be in the water. It lets him feel free. So I\u2019m convinced that \u201cswimming is his passion\u201d would be an understatement for Haruka. Swimming is more like breathing for him. The way he stays so mysterious while you experience his thoughts is very good! The same counts for Rin, the characters does have something special in the beginning. But they become very good at the end. It is a bit like a sunflower that is growing. You know that it has the potential to become something so beautiful what already makes it kinda beautiful. But once they started to blossom they become extremely beautiful!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous and surely played an important role for all those female fans. The swimming scenes are so beautiful and the character looks very good to. The style of drawing fits the story perfectly! The OST isn\u2019t special at all, they have a good opening though. And the voice acting is also good. Enjoyment was something that lacks in my opinion. This has probably only worsen because of my wrong expectations. I really liked the end though and I am curious what season 2 will bring. ^^\\n",

            "content": "I have to say, this is one of the best anime I have ever watched. I know, a lot of comments say \u2018fan service\u2019, but I have to disagree. Now, I know there are different opinions than mine, I\u2019m not saying mine is the best or theirs should be invalidated, but I will say all these people who fail to realize that others have opinions and won\u2019t always agree on things with them should not be allowed to call this show \u2018shit\u2019. \r\nFirst, I can understand how some may see this as fan service, though I have to say that isn\u2019t all the show is.Yes, there is some in there, I cannot deny that, but it is not purely a \u2018show for girls to fan over\u2019. The show is not meant to be too in depth but the plot is one that will leave you thinking. The theme of this show is friendship and growing up, as you watch it you follow Haruka Nanase and the rest of the Iwatobi gang as they bond over their love for swimming and try to reconnect with an old friend, Rin Matsuoka. \\n\\n\r\nSo, first, let me get this out of the way: Swimming guys are going to be half naked. That in no way can be called fan service. Yes, maybe they didn\u2019t need those prolonged scenes of Haruka getting out of his tub (He has jammers on so calm down anyone who thinks otherwise), but they\u2019re going to be shirtless, they\u2019re going to have muscles. Another thing to point out is the fact that the characters are close, everything they do can be interpreted as you like, so that means you can see it as friendship or as pure yaoi. Again, it\u2019s up to you. In no way does that mean that this is fan service, it\u2019s all up to interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nNext, I would like to say that the characters did develop during the show, it wasn\u2019t some great life changing development, it was rather more realistic which may be why so many people have a problem with it. Haruka Nanase begins to appreciate his friends more, learning they are all he needs to swim freely, and he also realizes he needs to leave behind his bad memories in order to move forward. Rin Matsuoka learns to let go of his past, instead embracing a warmer future where he can swim happily and reconnect with his old friends. The gang learns teamwork and all become closer during the show, with there being both ups and downs in their friendships. Fears are explored, acceptance is given, and the characters all grow as they learn new values and morals to live by. It is subtle but still there, still present as it would be in our lives. We don\u2019t rapidly change over the course of a couple months, it is a gradual process, so in this way you can see the show is even more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t agree with me, that is fine, but please do not be the asshole who writes that it shouldn\u2019t have the score it has. Do not put women under the bus stating that this isn\u2019t fair because men can\u2019t have high scoring fan service anime. Especially, do not say that \u2018any respectable women needs to give this a 2 or 3\u2019. IT IS NOT FAIR TO PUSH YOUR OPINIONS ON OTHERS. Realize that while I have this opinion, the next person reading this may differ, and the person after that, that makes them no less of a person, but when you shame them and imply that they would be disrespectable if they liked this show then you should get no kindness here. I\u2019m sorry you may not like this show, I really am. I wish you could see this the way I do, but again realize that everyone has opinions and your opinion is no better than anyone else\u2019s. By shaming other people who like this show you are becoming a bully and if you are one of these people, please realize this. You would not like it if someone made you feel dumb, upset, hurt, or angry for your opinion and I for one, as a respectable woman who liked the show Free!, do not like feeling this way by you. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the choice is up to you. This show is interpretation only. Feel any way you want about it, please be respectful, and I hope you enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n-Cassie ( A friend who feels the same kind of passion I do towards Free!, although she lacks a MAL account. ) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Eighth Review - Free!\r\nWhat do I even say about this anime? well at first I wasn't so keen to pick it up and watch. Boys in swimsuits swimming and all, not really my style. However I saw that it was getting pretty good comments and reviews, heck even my friends were saying it was good, so here I was watching it - and hell I am so glad I did. \r\nAt first I was just thinking it was going to be about a group of boys showing there abs off to girls, and how wrong was I. It starts with the 4 boys and thensome plot like twist that makes you want to know what happened with this group, it gives you a reason to want to watch on. it doesn't however stop there, it goes on to the now grown up a bit boys creating this club. \\n\\n\r\nI must admit I found the first part dull and boring, like it was dragging on, but the second part of the anime drags you in and keeps you wanting more, keeps you wanting to find out what happens with the group and what had happened previously. The plot was good though in the end and it was a mystery that wanted to keep you knowing and wanting to find out more. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters where actually well designed and thought off, Haru in particular with his 'cold-like' attitude but he still loves some things (Like Mackerel!) The team of boys really was thought well and the designers made  the team bond together with there different personalities but great characteristics that each one blended together with. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style - WOW! I was actually amazed at the art of this anime, being water it's pretty hard to animate properly however the developers did a great job of it. when they jump in the pool and the water splashes, when they are swimming and the camera is below, the way they made the water look and react. I was really shocked to see that the art style was really good, definitely one of the best I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nSo to conclude, this anime turned out to be good, I actually enjoyed it and was into it, I actually finished it off in one day (and I was watching another anime!) It wasn't my type of anime yet I watched it and enjoyed it, it def goes to show that sometimes even anime you might not think you like actually pulls you in and gets you interested. Great to see an anime that is not spoiled with fan service. \\n\\n\r\n~ Canaan\\n\\n",

Free is alighthearted sports anime with just enough angst and drama to keep it interesting. Stunning animation and relatable characters, paired with overwhelming fanservice, make this anime very popular with the teenage female demographic. The music is catchy, the plot is satisfying, and there's a lot of teamwork to cheer about. Overall, it's a very enjoyable show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Free is not the show to watch intently, looking at plot and character development. Most of the characters fit a certain 'type'. There's the strong and silent Haru, the caring Makoto, the goofy and child-like Nagisa, the nerd Rei, and the angsty and violent Rin. Using these character tropes, it is easy to determine where the plot will go. The backstories of the characters, besides the Rin/Haru conflict, are also not fleshed out. Don't watch this anime expecting anything more than a comedic swimming drama.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, hope this helped!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I went into this anime not knowing anything except that it's a show about a swim club and that it was pretty popular. Having never watched sports anime, I didn't know what to expect. After watching it, I love it.\r\nStory (7):\r\nThe story follows a group of swimmers who were childhood friends who end up forming a swim club at their high school. They then plan to compete against other teams, and ultimately race against their old friend now rival at an opposing school.\r\nThe drama is nicely done. I quickly found myself invested in these characters and their dilemmas, both in the swim world, and intheir life outside the sport. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of drama, but also a good amount of comedy. There is one episode in particular where the team goes to a festival, and one character follows around two of their rivals-it is hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nOne issue I do have (and I realize it's a personal pet peeve) is the excess of fan service. There is quite a bit of it in this anime, which I feel takes away from the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Haruka's fascination with water does get old pretty quick.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9):\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the few anime I've seen in which I don't dislike a single character. Every single character has their own personality and are each naturally likable and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto is incredibly sweet-the kind of person you'd want to be your best friend. Nagisa is adorable and hilarious. Rei is a great character-and it's fun to watch him transform from someone who can't swim to being an important member of the team. Rin is a good antagonist while still remaining likable.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, the only character I don't have too strong a connection to is the protagonist Haruka. I don't dislike him, but compared to the other wonderful characters he comes across as a bit bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what made me like this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. I've never seen water so clear, so pretty, and so beautifully animated as it is in this anime. The swimming animation is also pretty to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all well done, each one stands out. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, this anime is beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good. I watched a few episodes in the original audio, and a few with the English dub. I found both to be enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is cool. Still it is the ending theme that I love. It's one of my all time favorite anime ending songs, and even now I enjoy listening to that song by itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\\n\r\nI was intrigued with this anime. I had a fun time watching it and would definitely watch both this one and the second season again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8):\\n\\n\r\nFree! is a fun anime to watch. It's pretty to look at and has good characters. The story is interesting. And of course, that ending song is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n8/10.",

It was humorous without being overly silly or illogical. Not a masterpiece, but I would still recommend it. There are a lot of flashbacks, so if you don't like that then maybe this isn't the anime for you.\r\nThe animation was standard to slightly above average. I appreciated that the musculature on the characters, while very well defined, was not too bulgy or unrealistic. It felt like the approprivate amount of musculature for a group of swimmers. The music, while not phenomenal, waspretty good.\\n\\n",

            "content": "From the cover photo itself, everyone can tell that Free! is most definitely not an anime for everyone. It is, in fact, an anime catered towards the female population; a rarity in the world where most shows are made for men. Put away the unexplainably perky boobs and long, long legs, boys, this fanservice is all about broad shoulders, abs and biceps.\r\nFree! is anything but complex. It's about as basic as a slice of life anime can get. You have four boys who went to the same swimming club as children before one of them moves away and later coming back in a different swimmingteam. It's a high school comedy-drama, nothing that should make your head spin. The plot takes its time with progression, at a pace that is rather slow but not dragging. At 12 episodes there really wasn't much to be going on about and Free! makes use of it and keeps up its leisurely pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are heavily reliant on tropes. They aren't anyone no one has ever seen before. You have the broody main character, his cheerful gentle giant of a best friend/sidekick, the mischievous ~shota~ and the very angsty frienemy who is motivated by pressure to beat the MC. Perhaps the only really memorable ones are Gou who serves as the female representation in the anime and Rei who subverts the serious megane type to show an extremely goofy side. Gou is important because she acts just like the target viewers of the show-- she's a typical fangirl, fawning over the swimmers and their bodies, shipping the boys with one another. Still, the characters didn't really feel flat, they had enough of their own motivations, quirks and fears to feel three-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was amazing and the character design was incredible. The way it's different from other fanservice-reliant animes is that they kept the body proportions right. Comparing the main characters' bodies to actual swimmers wouldn't be ridiculous as they're more or less the same. There's also variations in their body types: long and lean are Haru, Rin and Rei; large and well-built is Makoto; and small but compact is Nagisa. On the backgrounds and other details, the artist did well. From the droplets of water on their eyelashes to the leaves of the trees, nothing seemed underdone. The animation of the boys swimming were great, their strokes flowed well and it was done smoothly, just overall excellent.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't focus on the sound during watching, mainly because they seemed so natural. The opening and ending songs were great, though! The music and the video themselves were highly entertaining. The boys' characters can really be seen in it, no matter how ridiculous it all was (the way Haru was dancing so unenthusiastically and just kind of swaying around in the club while everyone was showing off their maddest dancing skills was hilarious).\\n\\n\r\nIt's fairly obvious that it is targeted towards female fangirls, especially those who can be considered fujoshis. The humor is silly, some of the plot progressions ridiculous but it all works well for the show. I'm not ashamed to say I find this quality entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, it's a very good show that managed to deliver despite its at times over-the-top premise. It overcomes possible problems with good art, relatable characters and very high rewatchability. Like I said, it's not for everyone but as part of its target audience, it did very well.",

I find the anime to be extremely funny and well done in terms of animation, in the end it's not about fan service or the fact that he anime looks slightly \"shounen-ai\", it's about childhood friends who want to swimtogether again, and that's a nice thing, remembering the childhood days. The only things that bothered me was the whole \"too much Rin centered story\", it should have not been about competing against Rin but competing as a team for the win(without Rin) but it was nice to see that in the end they just ended up being friends again.\\n\r\nCan't wait for second season ^^",

            "content": "Story: 9- Free! revolves around the Iwatobi Swim Club (hence the title). The story begins with 4 boys who swam together in elementary school but had parted ways for one reason or another. Years later they are now in high school and reunite to start another swim club.\r\nArt: 9- The animation and style of the show was very well done! The animation of the water and point of view from the swimmers was beautifully depicted, giving a very life like feel. The art of the actual characters was well done, of course each of the male characters was given well sculpted swimmers body.\r\nSound: 9- Ithought the music was well matched in each scene. Besides being well matched there was a large variety of music played throughout the sound track of the show, which helped it from feeling repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9- All though there was only 12 episodes the writers did a wonderful job developing the personalty and back story of each character. I found the group as a whole to be comical and engaging and work well together. As the series progresses we see much emphasis placed on the bonds of friendship, a more than subtle underlying theme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9- I highly enjoyed Free! and would recommend it. All though the genre is a bit different from what I normally watch I am very glad I gave it a chance. I am excited to see how the second season will play out as well!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9- Overall Free! was a great series. I know it has been addressed that many people will overlook this because it 'looks gay'. However yaoi is never implied, it is merely the story of a close developing friendship between the members of the Iwatobi Swim Club. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you think swimming is boring? WELL I THINK YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THIS ANIME IS BORING! :D\r\nBeing able to turn a relatively boring subject (at least for most of the people on this earth) into a heart-warming and enjoyable anime, just that is incredible! The story is simple and straightforward, so you get the point of the anime which of course has its good and bad sides. I like the way how the story continually does flashbacks and tells you about the past in a non-viscous way (*ERHM... Naruto *COUGH... Bleach) but instead nice and nostalgic way is really appreciated.\r\nSince the anime is from the21st century you just got to expect great art, and this anime is a good example of that. Especially the way water is animated is really well made and detailed. A beautiful sight for your eyes with 1080p quality (^w^)\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I'm being picky with is the music choice for the anime. Sometimes I like it. But sometimes I hate it. I don't know whether I like it or hate it. But overall it's GOOD. The casual steel-stringed acoustic guitar fits really nice to the calm, character building scenes. But during the more dramatical scenes I miss the \"exciting\" music, which makes you jump out of the bed by the attraction and enchantment. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I need to say anything about the characters. They are pretty typical for a slice of life anime. A gang of 4 people:\\n\r\n1. The cool guy (calm and handsome, yet the best and most skilled of them)\\n\r\n2. The uncle (he's the one who keeps the gang alive, the link to keeping them together)\\n\r\n3. The over-exalted guy (always happy, and positive, the one who makes the other shine during tough times)\\n\r\n4. The intellectual one (the brain! Enough said XD)\\n\\n\r\nSo did I experience the anime as an enjoyable type of anime? Well, I can't deny it. Some slice of life animes are really slow and protracted, but I can't say that about \"Free!\". I started watching it on a friday and the next day it was finished! It was just so captivating I couldn't stop. It was like one episode, and then the next one, and the next one, and the next one... OH! Wait... I finished the 12th one... :'(((((((\\n\\n\r\nLastly\\n\r\nif you have been wondering whether to watch this anime or not. I would say: \"You won't regret it!\". Why not? I think it's good enough for you to consider it as good. Maybe you give a grade as high as a 10, but it's not bad, not in anyone's eyes.",

            "content": "Being honest with you, I was reluctant to watch Free! I was just told it's about swimming and the art is really nice and that wasn't enough to persuade me to watch it. But when I heard a bit more about the story I said I'd watch it. And I'm glad I did. It was a really good anime\r\nI wasn't too sure about the story at first. It reminded me of Clannad except they got things done quicker with less of an emotional journey. And less character development. The story was enjoyable but predictable. I felt like it was a bit rushed, and it neededmore episodes to carry out the story without it seeming rushed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was outstanding, the water looked incredible and the characters were drawn nicely. I loved how Rin and Haru were drawn. All the characters did look well, but Rei's glasses kind of take away from how his eyes look. Makoto's face showed how kind he is and how he's the guy who has everyone's back. Nagisa had the typical Boy Lolita look but it suits him and shows his personality. Haru's eyes showed how much he just wanted to swim and be free. Rin looked awesome, his pointy teeth are really cool and his eyes were drawn really well. He also had the facial expressions that showed he was trying to look like he didn't care, but on the inside he did. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all really good and the main characters did develop during the series, but they needed a bit more time to develop. When I watched it I didn't see any character development at all, but thinking about it now I can see how the characters grew. Especially Rin and Haru. \\n\r\nRei was recruited for the club to fill in Rin's empty spot, but I felt like they made it too obvious that he was a substitute for Rin. He was a bit stuck up and even though he did learn how to swim it made no sense how he actually learned. He just tried one move and that's it. There's another reason why this anime needed more episodes. And it's official that Nitori is king of the Notice Me Senpai Club..\\n\\n\r\nI loved the music. It fit every situation. I love the ending song, it's sung by their Japanese voice actors and it sounds awesome. (I'm actually listening to the soundtrack while writing this review) The opening song was good but it wasn't amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe is anime really needed more episodes for the characters to develop, especially Rei. I'm currently watching the second season and there has been some character development with Nagisa and Nitori.\\n\r\nOverall this anime is really good and I do recommend it for sports anime lovers and if you want to try something new, it's really enjoyable.",

            "content": "I have to say that I was very, very pleasantly surprised by Free! I have been consciously avoiding sports animes for quite some time now, and when a new friend on Tumblr finally convinced me to take a peak, I was hooked from the first episode. \r\nThe story is pretty simple: former swimming teammates get together again in high school and start a new club. The character typologies are pretty stereotypical at first glance: we have the quiet guy, the nurturing one, the glasses character, and the sweet Honey-senpai-like figure who sometimes ends up being the most reasonable one. On the other side, we haveRin Matsuoka, a childhood friend and now-rival of the newly-formed Iwatobi Club. It all seems pretty basic until you get into the show and realize how well the character development has been elaborated, considering this is a sports anime.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the usual comedy and drama, these characters have issues that are very relatable to anyone who has ever felt pressure from their friends, parents, teachers etc. This anime made me feel nostalgic about high school and the friends I gained there. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely breathtaking, I never would have thought that it would be done with such beautiful care and precision. The same goes for the music, including the opening and ending sequences which have become sort of a meme in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Free! much, much more than I originally thought I would, and if anyone thinks that sports animes are not their cup of tea, maybe they should start with this one.",

            "content": "Before I say anything else I feel it important to firstly state the Free! Iwatobi Swim Club was not a sports anime. How can I make this claim? Simple. There was less actual swimming taking place in this anime than there was melodrama. \r\nI'll use Kuroko No Basuke for a comparative example. In KNB, all of the arcs, sub-plots and drama could be drawn back to basketball. If you got rid of basketball, none of the sub-plots or character development would make sense.In Free!, you could literally replace swimming with any other sport without the plot changing in any way. Hell, you could replace theswim club with chess club and the story would still be the same. \\n\\n\r\nThere were scenes in which Rin would pin Haruka to a wall/fence and yell at him. Those interactions reeked of unresolved sexual tension more than anything else, and really took you out of the scene. Which brings me to point that the amount of UST in this anime was astounding, and it will always be just UST because the writers of the show have decided not make any pairings cannon, despite the constant bedroom eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there were a few things I liked about Free!. The absolutely gorgeous animation, Rei and Nagisa's interactions and Rei as a character.",

So for those of you who watched it and ended up seeing my review: most of us got to Free 'cause we are Gou.\r\nBut I don't know about you, I found there is much more to it then that.\r\nSo, shall we begin with pros? Yes, we shall.\r\nThe story is very good and actually educational. Through the anime we learn about friendship and teamwork and what a team truly is. Wow. that sounds so cliche' I think I'm gonnadie. But it's not. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing and each have it's own personality, weaknesses included. The anime admits that even boys like THAT have their weak sides. it's fun to follow these characters and I found myself wishing for them that everything will go well. Some characters are deep and some are funny and hyper. there is a bit of everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good and I find it fun. well, but it isn't something that sticks out.\\n\r\nThe music is fun and I found myself even staying for the ending theme, witch is rare.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the cons.\\n\r\nSo this might seem stupid, but I feel the need to warn. The anime is pretty misleading. I was sitting in my room, waiting for some romance, but every time there was a spark it turned out to be friendship.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the end. It was satisfying but I expected more. a few things got in the way so it wasn't perfect. I think it could've ended better. \\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion? \\n\r\nRecommended for people looking for a fun and short anime. Also, highly recommended for girls looking for biceps and hot guys ;)\\n\\n\r\nI tried to make it short and helpful. \\n\r\nHope it was\\n\\n",

The characters are both lovable and unlovable, developing as the story progresses. I have never been much into the sport of swimming, but Free! had me interested in it from the beginning.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are looking for a coming of age, slice of life, sports anime. Free! has all the necessary elements of these genres and has put them together well.\r\nYou might not like it if: You are looking for romantic interersts as an important partof the anime. Free! truly revoloves around the friendship of these highschool boys.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Watch for subtle jokes throughout the season, such as the mysterious background of their teacher and how all the boys have traditionally girl names.",

            "content": "The voice of the oil man sounds made of oil, gristle and syrup. It is deep and reassuring, absolutely sure of itself, and curiously fraudulent. No man who sounds this forthright can be other than a liar. His name is Daniel Plainview, and he must have given the name to himself as a private joke, for little that he does is as it seems. In Paul Thomas Anderson's brutal, driving epic \"There Will Be Blood,\" he begins by trying to wrest silver from the earth with a pick and shovel, and ends by extracting countless barrels of oil whose wealth he keeps all for himself.Daniel Day-Lewis makes him a great oversize monster who hates all men, including therefore himself.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the movie is like viewing a natural disaster that you cannot turn away from. By that I do not mean that the movie is bad, any more than it is good. It is a force beyond categories. It has scenes of terror and poignancy, scenes of ruthless chicanery, scenes awesome for their scope, moments echoing with whispers and an ending that in some peculiar way this material demands, because it could not conclude on an appropriate note -- there has been nothing appropriate about it. Those who hate the ending, and there may be many, might be asked to dictate a different one. Something bittersweet, perhaps? Grandly tragic? Only madness can supply a termination for this story.\\n\\n\r\nThe movie is very loosely based on Oil!, Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel about a corrupt oil family based so loosely, you can see the film, read the book and experience two different stories. Anderson's character is a man who has no friends, no lovers, no real partners and an adopted son that he exploits mostly as a prop. Plainview comes from nowhere, stays in contact with no one, and when a man appears claiming to be his half-brother, it is not surprising that they have never met before. Plainview's only goal in life is to become enormously wealthy, and he does so, reminding me of \"Citizen Kane\" and Mr. Bernstein's observation, \"It's easy to make a lot of money, if that's all you want to do is make a lot of money.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"There Will Be Blood\" is no \"Kane\" however. Plainview lacks a \"Rosebud.\" He regrets nothing, misses nothing, pities nothing, and when he falls down a mine shaft and cruelly breaks his leg, he hauls himself back up to the top and starts again. He gets his break in life when a pudding-faced young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) visits him and says he knows where oil is to be found, and will share this information for a price. The oil is to be found on the Sunday family ranch, where Standard Oil has already been sniffing around, and Plainview obtains the drilling rights cheaply from old man Sunday. There is another son, named Eli, who is also played by Paul Dano, and either Eli and Paul are identical twins or the story is up to something shifty, since we never see them both at once.\\n\\n\r\nEli is an evangelical preacher whose only goal is to extract money from Plainview to build his church, the Church of the Third Revelation. Plainview goes along with him until the time comes to dedicate his first well. He has promised to allow Eli to bless it, but when the moment comes he pointedly ignores the youth, and a lifelong hatred is founded. In images starkly and magnificently created by cinematographer Robert Elswit and set designer Jack Fisk, we see the first shaky wells replaced by vast fields, all overseen by Plainview from the porch of a rude shack, where he sips whiskey more or less ceaselessly. There are accidents. Men are killed. His son is deafened when a well blows violently, and Plainview grows cold toward the boy; he needs him as a prop, but not as a magnet for sympathy.\\n\\n\r\nThe movie settles down, if that is the word, into a portrait of the two personalities, Plainview's and Eli Sunday's, striving for domination over their realms. The addition of Plainview's alleged half-brother (Kevin J. O'Connor) into this equation gives Plainview, at last, someone to confide in, although he confides mostly his universal hatred. That Plainview, by now a famous multimillionaire, would so quickly take this stranger at his word is incredible; certainly we do not. But by now Plainview is drifting from obsession through possession into madness, and at the end, like Kane, he drifts through a vast mansion like a ghost.\\n\\n\r\nThe performance by Day-Lewis may well win an Oscar nomination, and if he wins he should do the right thing in his acceptance speech and thank the late John Huston. His voice in the role seems like a frank imitation of Huston, right down to the cadences, the pauses, the seeming to confide. I interviewed Huston three times, and each time he spoke with elaborate courtesy, agreeing with everything, drawing out his sentences, and each time I could not rid myself of the conviction that his manner was masking impatience; it was his way of suffering a fool, which is to say, an interviewer. I have heard Peter O'Toole's famous imitation of Huston, but channeled through O'Toole he sounds heartier and friendlier and, usually, drunk. I imagine you had to know Huston pretty well before he let down his conversational guard.\\n\\n\r\n\"There Will Be Blood\" is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by \"No Country for Old Men,\" and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But \"There Will Be Blood\" is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp. Which is not a dishonorable thing.",

            "content": "Story: My friend, Luis, showed me this anime after I had to suffer through No Game No Life. I have heard of it from anime club, and it came to me that I saw the first episode in the club as well. I thought sports animes were the last thing I was going to be watching, but I found Free! to be super entertaining. It may seem very corny to outside viewers, but the series becomes more heartfelt when you come to understand why the characters are the way they are. I will admit that the ending to the first season made me go insane.I cried like a baby for hours. The whole series is basically about three high school friends who are trying to build a swim team at their high school because one of them, Haruka, has been in love with the sport since childhood and wants to relive the competition they took part of in elementary school along with Rin, a mutual friend who transferred to Australia and came back to the private school with a very cocky and bad attitude. For what it's worth, the story is a 9 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it's good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's a sports anime for god's sake. The art is supposed to be focused on the bodies of the characters, of course. When I originally heard of this anime, I thought it was just going to be about fan service with boys in swim trunks or speedos. It turned out I was wrong. The only stripping of clothes you would see is Haruka changing into his swim pants whenever he spotted a pool or an ocean to swim in because that was basically the running joke of the whole series, seasons 1 and 2. The other running joke is when Rin's little sister and the team's new swim coach, Go, is always pointing out how attractive men are in their swim trunks, but she doesn't mention anything inappropriate whatsoever. Plus, I find Rin's sharklike teeth to be cool, and the guys muscles seemed realistic. The only compliant I have is that I know some swimmers are beefier than others, and this didn't portray much diversity in size, but that could also be because in Japan, most of the people are skinny, so I won't complain so much. As far as art goes, it's a full vote.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme is fun to listen to every once in a while, but I wouldn't listen to it constantly. However, the opening clips give you a sense of what the show is truly about, and it's bittersweet a bit, but it doesn't give away too much. The ending theme is what I love the most because it's so sweet. I would rate this 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Pretty much like Ouran, Free! has its group of tropes, but they do not center around one person. Haruka is the emotionless boy who is mostly focused on swimming \"free,\" meaning freestyle. Makoto is the kind one who just wants everyone to get along, and he is Haruka's best friend, who is the master of the backstroke. Nagisa is the lolita boy type and best at the breaststroke. Rin is the tough guy with a broken guy. When he used to hang out with the others, he was the butterfly stroke to complete the team. Then, there's Rei, who is the Free! equivalent to Kyoya without the douchebagness on the side, who took place of Rin for competing at the butterfly. There are other characters who are enjoyable as well, especially Haruka, Makoto, Nagisa, and Rin's old swim coach. This fandom is full of gay shipping, and I don't get involved in it often because I only ship two people if they look as if they would actually work in the actual show. The only ship I will partake in is Rei and Nagisa. Well, yes, they are both first years and they ride home on the bus together on the way and back from school, but they have been super close ever since Nagisa convinced Rei to join their building swim team. They are more best friends like than Makoto and Haruka. The characters never disappoint when it comes to this show, so I rated this a full vote.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I wasn't crazy about this anime than I was with Ouran and Black Bullet even though I did cry at the last episode of the first season. I mean, it's good, but there's not one thing that makes me go crazy over it. Would I watch it again? Sure. Do I highly recommend giving this show a try? Yes, I do. I promise that Free! won't kill you. For that, this gets a rating of 9 out 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The overall score of the anime is the rounded 9 out of 10. I'm not putting my judgement on you, but please at least watch the first episode of Free! before you judge it.",

As all sports anime it is suggestive and homoerotic, and in this regard it somewhat accomplished its goal effectively. The story and characters were extremely cheesy and over the top. Many of the situations were not believable, and as a swimmer, many of the issues they had while swimming were unrealistic and unrelatable. The story seemed effortless but was not the main function of this anime. Overall this was not terrible to watch, but many ofthe main plot points led to moments that were cringey to watch and difficult to get through.",

            "content": "The only outstanding thing from this anime can be summarized in the following sentence: The animation is beautiful.\r\nStory: 5\r\nLet me just say (mainly to those of you who have already watched this anime): Rin is probably the only reason why the plot even exists and moves forward. Which I find really annoying.\r\nAnyways, the plot has two main parts.\r\n1. Three characters of the main cast, Haruka, Nagisa, and Makoto form the Iwatobi High School Swim Club and attempt to recruit one more person in order for them to be considered an official club by their school.\r\n2. The three characters, plus the one other guy they recruitednamed Rei, join a competition in order to get Rin back into their 'squad' so they can be friends again.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of Free! follows the very basic sports anime format with nothing special about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThere is a bit of character development in this anime, but it isn't very significant from what I see in the first season.\\n\r\nHaruka is my favorite character in this anime, probably because he reminds me of Kageyama (Haikyuu!!). \\n\r\nBut there really isn't anything unique about the characters of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning, the animation of Free! is extremely beautiful and fitting for the genre. \\n\r\nIt is also the only thing which makes me think that this anime deserves a 7 overall.\\n\r\nI especially like the animation of the eyes and the water.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OP/EDs were pretty good, and BGM was put in the right places at the right moments, but there weren't any tracks that stood out to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nSince it had a really basic story and not much character development, Free! was kind of boring at some parts, but I did enjoy the comedy they put in throughout the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA really mediocre anime overall, Free! has great animation and nothing else.\\n\r\nIf you want to get better at drawing anime art or receive inspiration to draw from an anime, then I would recommend this show. But if you're here for a good sports anime, I would suggest you do yourself a favor by watching Haikyuu!! If there was just one sports anime to watch, it would be Haikyuu!!",

Aka female fanservice, the anime. \r\nI'll be honest, I mainly just watched this for hot boys in swim suits, and oh man did I get that in spades.\r\nNow to the actual review\r\nFree!! Is an anime about boys swimming. Simple enough, right? WRONG.\r\nThere's surprisingly a lot of drama in this anime. The main drama is with Haru and Rin, because they have this fued about who's best at swimming or something. It went from a friendly rivalry to at least Rin being legitimately upset and borderline hostile toward Haru. Cat fight, amrite ladies?... I'm sorry.\r\nThe animation is really pretty, and the soundtrack ain't too badeither, so that definitely helps.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this anime shines is its characters. Personally Rin is my favorite because he's a shark boy but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't have much to say about this first season, it's pretty good but the main plot is boys swimming. I'm not quite sure what else to say.\\n\\n\r\nI'd reccomend this to anyone who likes sports anime, or anyone who wants some hot anime boys in tight swim gear",

            "content": "**WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AT THE SECTION \"ITS ENDING\"! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE IT RUINED FOR YOU, THEN SKIP THAT SECTION!**\r\n(I'm reviewing season 1 and season 2 in this review, so sit back and enjoy it.)\r\nThis anime at first glimpse REALLY didn't excite me, but I was wrong. It was a wonderful surprise to see for a first impression into the sports anime world.\r\nSo, let's get started...\r\n- FIRST IMPRESSIONS -\r\n           6/10\r\nWhen Haruka says the first few lines for the introduction, it was like a little pleasant surprise for me. Sure, it's notexactly the best but it caught my attention enough to continue the first episode. And by the end of it, I was more than surprised as to just how much I enjoyed it than to what I was expecting!\\n\\n\r\n- STORY -\\n\r\n    5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and very easy to follow. Not as original, but it's not bad at all. It was executed very well though, I'll give props to that. But really, there isn't much to talk about about the story. (What really drives this anime is more of the characters to be honest.)\\n\\n\r\n- CHARACTERS -\\n\r\n        7/10\\n\\n\r\nThey really are the stars of the show, and probably the thing I mostly enjoyed about in the show. They're relatable and very entertaining! (I'm only going to showcase the main five which were Haru, Makoto, Rei, Rin, and Nagisa due to the fact that there were lots of characters. But trust me, every character blended in very well in the series!)\\n\\n\r\nHaru - He was by far the most interesting out of all of them. What with his addiction (or you might as well call his love) for water and the fact that he strips whenever he even sees water that's large enough for him to dive into no matter what situation he's in, I incredibly loved him for being so calm in most of the things he's been put through! But he really did have some development throughout season 1 and 2, which I appreciate very much as well.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto - The friendly giant, I'd say. He's Haruka's best friend and is more like the Mom of the group. I really loved how he worries over Haru and the rest of the crew. Even his flustered moments were very enjoyable! Although not as much development for him as Haru, he did get quite a bit and was even a major requirement for Haru's as well!\\n\\n\r\nNagisa - He's the shota of the group, kind of generic but real sweet. He even adds some shipping references for the fanbase to enjoy (myself included.) I enjoyed how he was basically the light that lit the firework onto the whole swim club idea and even encouraging for another person (*cough*Rei*cough*) into joining them. And even though he's almost happy nonstop, he did have quite the depth to him later on.\\n\\n\r\nRei - I guess he's the opposite to Nagisa, more strategic than carefree. But for an original character, I really thought he was a character from the source (the light novel series). He really fit in! His character development I'd say was the second most noticeable (with him being rather reluctant but soon warms up to swimming in general overtime.) And his \"BEAUTIFUL\" thing really made it for me.\\n\\n\r\nRin - I'd say that Rin really had changed throughout the series! At first I was like \"Ohhhhhh no not one of these people again-\" but slowly, I began to be rather attached to him. He wanted to be the best and had strong ambitions, but was a tad cocky at times (which I can definitely understand, but that does change.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters were just a good thing to have around, and I couldn't really imagine if any of them were missing.\\n\\n\r\n- ART -\\n\r\n  9/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation had done wonderfully with this series! The water, lighting, movement, and just how everything was done was STUNNING! All of the competition scenes were amazing and keeps your eyes glued to the screen, and some of the symbolism through it was beautiful!\\n\\n\r\n- SOUND -\\n\r\n    7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was very good quality, but nothing too special to think about. I LOVED the voice acting though since it was very well done and the cast had suited each character perfectly. The OST isn't very memorable (I'm not counting the character songs, guys.) but it definitely isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\n- ITS ENDING -\\n\r\n       8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, both endings for each season were very satisfying and I was pretty happy with how it turned out. In the second season, it was more about Haru and Makoto (along with others) moving on since they were almost finished with high school. Haru didn't have anything in mind which was very problematic, and during a festival he even has a fight with Makoto about what he was going to do since graduation was coming so soon.  It ended with Haru finally being able to move on and become a professional swimmer and things had lit up from there. (From the run down swim club at Iwatobi turning into one of the popular clubs to join, and Makoto and Haru moving to Tokyo all happy to get on with their lives)\\n\r\nI'd say it was a great ending for the series as it had ended with a scene that was drawn in the beginning of the series in the first place and boy was it nice to see them grow up bit by bit!\\n\\n\r\n- ENJOYMENT + CONCLUSION -\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to say that although the story wasn't the most original I didn't regret watching it! I really loved the show for just the simplicity and its characters, and it did have a type of story that was easy to follow, it had pretty good pacing, amazing art, etc. \\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Definitely if you have free time or if you just want something to watch just for the sake of watching. Would I recommend it for the plot? It'll depend on you but it's not OVERFLOWING with it.",

So I will just explain my ratings a bit for your to understand:\r\nStory : 7\r\nThe plot isn't the best plot in the whole anime universe. 'Beating Rin in swimming contest' doesn't really get me warmed up.  But the side stories about the MC and his friends does made me get interested.\r\nArt: 10 \r\nThe art is just simply outstanding. After getting so freaking tired of art from the 60's (exaggeration), this anime is like a pleasure to my eyes so I have no complains\r\nSound: 10\r\nWell, it is pretty nice actually. I like the voiceactors and the effects. It is better than a certain mecha movie I just watched earlier where the volume is sometimes loud and sometimes low that just wanted me to drop it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nThe character is likable and funny at some moments and serious at the other. Sometimes, I think some of the characters gives too much fan services that annoys me. Plus, why does Haru strips whenever he is near water? It is getting me crazy.....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10 \\n\r\nIt is actually quite enjoyable after a few episodes into the anime. Even though the plot isn't quite entertaining, the slice-of-life anime really get me interested. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\\n\r\nYup, I grade pretty easily too, btw. But I don't think I will ever ever ever give a 5 to this anime. Never ever! Because this anime is simply one of them that I enjoyed with excellent artwork and characters that aren't all talk. \\n\\n\r\nSo I hope that you will at least give this anime a try.",

Lets get this out of the way I have not seen any sports anime prior to this, so I did not know what to expect but I was amazed by how much I enjoyed this show. I finished watching Free Iwatobi swim club in the duration of fourteen hours.\r\nFree follows Haruka ,Makoto and Nagisa who are childhood friends wanting to revive the swimming club in high school.Along with new member Rei they enter contests train and encounter their old friend Rin. With regards to story it's pretty basic but it was entertaining to watch. The main strength of the showis its characters and all five main characters are unique and relatable in their own way. My personal favorites were Haruka because I felt the same way about swimming that he did when I was younger and I still do and Nagisa who was the funniest part of the show. I also really enjoyed the transformation of Rei throught the show. Also, they way the characters interacted with each other was great especially Haruka and Rin. A prime example of this is the sixth episode where it's just the main characters interacting with each other and learning the backstory of Makoto. Also, one of the best aspects of the show was showing how Rei fit in to the group  which was one of the best parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTe art is fantastic particularly the swimming scenes, specifically the relay race in the final episode which was absolutely phenomenal and the character design and movements was also very nice. Kyoto Animation did a fantastic job with this show. The opening and the ending of the show were fantastic, with an intense opening and lighthearted ending totally fitting the theme of the show. The voice acting was also great.\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime free is more than fan service, while the story may be melodramatic but the drama is handled very well which made the show quite emotional to watch.Aside from the lack of some of the backstories of the characters and some side characters who I didn't really care for this first season was phenomenal.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I am so freaking tired of harem anime with boobs bouncing everywhere. Don't get me wrong - some are actually good, some though.\r\nThe story of Rin and Haru is amazingly well developed. You could also keep track of the plot and what's going on. I really enjoyed this swimming Anime, even though I am not good at swimming in real life.\r\nI fell inlove with all the characters, especially Nagisa. I loved the \"We're all boys with girly names!\" thing! They were all so adorable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing I have to complain about except the fan-service side of the story - I'm okay with gay people, but it sort of is taking over - but not enough to ruin everything.",

            "content": "Cute story about childhood friends reconciling together. Kyoto Animation does a great job on the animation of the water and biceps, and all the characters have a lot of energy throughout the show, making things fun and interesting to watch.\r\nAs far as the story goes, it's an understandable story, but one where the dialogue doesn't play out to its fullest potential. Several times, we see the characters talk about mundane things or repeat things in serious contexts that left me wanting more depth. People go to great lengths at times to do or say relatively simple things.\r\nLike how Kyoto Animation's highschool K-On girls don't talkabout boys, Free boys don't talk about girls. Maybe they're just too busy thinking about swimming with other guys all the time, but in both cases it makes it that much less believable for high school aged boys.\\n\\n\r\nI really did not like the ending. Not to spoil anything, but it essentially felt like it was  all about Rin, with Rei more or less just filling the space he left empty in their group. Everyone's considerate, but in the end I'd hate to be Rei.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all characters were all fun (except Haru is almost like Mikasa from Attack on Titan, with a one-track mind on swimming Free to her one-track mind on Eren), the animation was great, and I enjoyed seeing a protagonist group of guys doing fun things (like Daily Lives of High School Boys). Can't wait for the next season!",

            "content": "Spoiler free! \r\nI think that no matter what, Free! is a really fun anime to watch. It's only 12 episodes, so of course, there is nothing to compare with other anime that is actually based of a manga, since Free! is based off of a light novel. Considering the fact that Free! wasn't even supposed to be an anime, it's held up pretty well. \r\nI started watching Free! very impressed with how well written it was even with the excessive fanservice. I think that the way they animate the water is really beautiful. You can really feel the motivation behind the characters' thoughts. The storylinestarts out filled with tension and I think that most people will want to continue watching to see what happens. Overall though, I don't think the overall plot is anything very revolutionary, and does very much fall into the slice of life genre with maybe more angst. \\n\\n\r\nI think that later on, the plot does get a little lazy however, which is why I stopped taking it as seriously and just started watching casually to see what happens. The reason that the plot falls flat I think, is because the characters that have been so carefully developed are then used in the later episodes in these really melodramatic ways that made me cringe. For example, the way that some expressions were animated took away from what the anime was trying to communicate. \\n\\n\r\nAlso adding to the silliness of the later episodes was the ridiculous soundtrack...there were moments where the music was just ???? completely inappropriate and laughable. Normally, I am fine with whatever music but even to my ears, there was just too much of a disconnect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, I think that in the end I probably just expected too much of this anime from watching the first 3 or so episodes, since I hadn't read the light novel. If you watch the series just expecting something a little fun, I think you would like this. The characters are even pretty amusing sometimes! \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The fact that so many people call it \"Gay\" just makes me question their sexuality. If you are not comfortable enough with your sexual orientation toget over the fact that an anime can have shirtless men (BECAUSE THEY ARE SWIMMING GOD DAMNIT) and not be gay then I think you should take a long and thorough session to find yourself.\\n\r\n    I am not going to go into detail about the actual anime because I only wanted to leave my opinion on the commonly discussed topic of it being a \"gay\" or \"yaoi\" anime.\\n\r\n    I DO recommend this anime, even if you're a straight male believe it or not.\\n",

An easy-breezy show you can watch during the weekends with your favorite snack. \r\nIt's not exciting, it's not heart wrenching it's not lmao funny either. But for some reason it makes me feel good (not in a raunchy way). While I was watching, I was constantly reminded of my own summer vacation. The white sand, blue sky,clear sea and the hot sun. It took me back to my fun holiday. And for some reason it kinda made me want to book another beach getaway. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for those people who are complaining that it's just fan service and are for fujoshis. So what? I don't see people complaining about fan service with bouncing boobs and panty shots in every scene. What's so bad about an anime with hot guys in swimming gear? \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, fan service for girls or not I don't regret watching this. It's fun and enjoyable. :)",

            "content": "Free! was a series i wasn't particularly excited about. the synopsis did not draw my attention, and the images and video clips i saw in previews made me think it was just going to be a fan service anime targeting a female audience. Of course i decided to give it a watch anyways, as an animator i appreciated what i saw in the water effects and figured if nothing else that would be worth my while.\r\nHaving watched Free! all the way, i have to say this: if you have any remote interest in it, ragardless of how off putting the manservice is to you, giveit a chance. the first episode lays on the manservice a bit thick with suggestive camera pans and plenty of pool side topless dudes with amazing bodies, but that gets significantly toned down later on in the series around episode 3 or 4. One of the things that made it work even for me as a guy was having Gou, or Kou as she prefers being called, present at the scene. Her reactions somehow level out the manservice by providing you with a squealing fangirl if you don't have one on hand, making you feel like it's ok to watch this because there's a girl here. Sort of like how it's ok to walk into a girly store at the mall with a girl, but feels wrong when a guy goes in alone.\\n\\n\r\nVisually KyotoAni does it yet again. everything in this show looks absolutely gorgeous from the background art to the characters. Of the most notable things are the water effects and the character animation and posing. During the backstroke event when the swimmers dive off the block you can feel the arch in their backs. the physicality just shows so well. When they hit the surface you can feel the water wrapping around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ok as they never get too in depth about them. The character development was also fairly weak but given that this anime is what it is it didn't need to be any more than that. Nagisa possibly being the most stereotypical of the characters, being the overly girly cute boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was actually pretty good. it's not amazing but it worked for the sake of a sports anime revolving around swimming. None of the problems really feel like big problems, in fact they are actually pretty trivial, but they do well enough telling the story that you can sort of understand why it's such a big deal to the characters. It's not dark, it's not particularly serious, and it's got just a light touch of drama.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Free! was something fun for the summer, so if you've got the time i suggest you dive right in!",

For an anime like this, I don't think you should rate it by the storyline, plot, etc since Free is basically intended to be fanservice so it really shouldn't be graded on the storyline. It's like saying Death Parade is bad because it didn't have any comedy (That's an exaggeration), if it's intended for being Psychological & Dramatic, it shouldn't be rated down because of the elements outside that. That's basically why Free! shouldn't be graded on a complex storyline scale since it was reallymade for people to enjoy fanservice & gays, not complex characters\\n\r\n+adding to that: Free! is good at what it was intending to do lmao, lot's of fanservice & gay ships, exactly what people would want if they're watching this",

Before I start I want to say that I think that this anime is definitely more interesting in Free! Eternal Summer, but I really still did like this one.\r\nStory-6 I thought that this anime had a fairly good plot. I really can't say much else hahah.\r\nArt-7 The art in this anime was good. Not the best but still. And sorry to be a fangirl but I LOVE MAKOTO and i think he's adorable lmao.\r\nSound-9I really liked the sound in this anime. Each character had a voice that really suited them (I watched this in sub). I also love the opening and closing on this one. XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-6 As much as I love the characters in this, in my opinion they weren't very developed. In Free! Eternal Summer it's better (I'm still kinda early in it but still). And again, I love Makoto. XD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8 I really enjoyed watching this, and as soon as I finished I went right to the second season. That's pretty much it for this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7 I really wanted to give this a better rating, but I'm sure when I watch the entirety of Free! Eternal Summer I will be able to give it a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review and I hoped this helped you :) Byeee \\n\r\n~A Makoto Tachibana lover",

I\u2019ll tell you again; this is more than just a fanservice show for girls.  \r\nThe art is beautiful, so beautiful even the water looks sexy as hell. The art is flashy which of course works well with theshow. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were way better than I thought they would be. I really thought this would end up as one of those shows with only fanservice and no good characters at all, but it surprised me, which I am glad for. There is a good amount of fanservice in here of course, but it doesn\u2019t take over the show. I even found it laughable at some times. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show, but I can understand it is not meant for everyone.

This anime provides it in spades and really captures that feeling of Summer.  Look, nothing in this industry is perfect (with possibly the exception of G Gundam).  You take what you can from what your watching.  For me, Itook the summer time vibe and got hammered drunk.  Watch it, enjoy it, and send me a message when you done.",

            "content": "Well, i don\u00b4t watch too many animes, so probably i can\u00b4t really compare to other shows very well, but i can compare it to stories in common. For me a good story is told, when it wether makes me laugh or cry or leaves me wether happy or thoughtful in the end. This anime made me cry and happy, too. Sure it\u00b4s no Drama, but the little stories told within are making the characters great. \r\nAbout the drawing and the sports, which seems to be a point for people to wether watch it or not (I was wondering about it, too, at the beginning becauseof many comments) - i can only tell you : \\n\r\nSure they were drawn \"attractive\" but seriously, i don\u00b4t think that this is enough to care for a character. By the way, there are so many animes in which there is way more attention being payed on drawing \"girl bodies\", so  i don\u00b4t see, why \"drawing the characters attractive\" would matter or make that story worse. \\n\r\nFor me it was a story about friendship, about characters who take care of each other along the way and having the time of their life, yet it is just going to start. (You should definitely watch \"eternal summer\", too!)\\n\r\nAbout the \"sports\" in the Anime : The Team is always training to become better and they even show that they try to \"eat the right things\" (which is very important doing sports). I liked the cheering up and also the fact that later it shows Rins Problems abroad and that it\u00b4s not easy at all to follow your dream. \\n\r\nFor me that was enough sports included. Of course in reality it\u00b4s much different from the training to the looks etc, but i didn\u00b4t except to watch the olympics but an anime after all and I was happy it would leave me with my imagination. So for me, it was (very unexpected) an amazing anime! \\n\r\nI really did enjoy it ! :) I would recommend it to everyone, especially to people who like character driven stories more than plot driven stories.",

I was mistaken.\r\n   As my first sports anime, I really enjoyed Free!. Not only was the art beautiful, but I did enjoy the story too. It's story wasn't as well developed as it could've been, but it was still very good. I did enjoythe character development throughout the first season although part of me felt as if it was a little bit rushed.

The amount of fanservice and ab-shots in the anime really took away from my suspension of disbelief. I think every episode has at least one scene of the main character, Haruka Hanase who is actually one of my favorites in terms of characters, shirtless. Don't get me wrong, I did understand WHY it was used, but I felt it was slightly overdone.\r\nOn a another note, I think the anime overall was good. It hada questionable story, but I liked the characters and artwork. The sound was also great with the effects sounding like splashing water and all, and the show was somewhat enjoyable for me. I will have to say though, I did like the second season much better, in fact that's the season where my favorite character in Free! was introduced, Sosuke Yamazaki.

            "content": "Although it admitedly isn't a particularly deep series, it's charm points being quite obviously fit teenage boys and their relationships, Free! is very well executed, engaging and overall every enjoyable.\r\nThe Story\r\nFree is about Nanase Haruka, a teenage boy who likes water more then land, and his experience in re-etering the previously abandoned world of competitive swimming due to the return of his chilhood friend, and now enemy, Matsuoka Rin. Haruka reluctantly forms the Iwatobi Swim club at his school with he and Rin's old teammates Nagisa and Makoto, Rin's sister Gou and new member that can't really swim Rei. Rin joins the rival schools swimteam.\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of this series is trying to figure out what's going on in Rin's head, as the viewer is never quite sure what his true intentions are until almost the last episode.\\n\r\nThere's plenty of comedy, drama, shonen ai (not really, but seriously, they are all so gay) and semi-tragedy to enjoy.\\n\r\nA couple of stories appear to repeat themselves, and a suprising number of the swimmers have childhood trauma with people drowning, which they sort of seem to forget about.\\n\r\nIt's nothing spectacular, but the characters make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\r\nIt's easy to assign roles to the main characters of Free. Haruka is the silent serious one, Rin is the devilish one, Makoto is the gentle loyal friend, Nagisa is the silly one and Rei is the geek. That doesn't stop them from being extermely enjoyable to watch and likeable, thought.\\n\r\nThe side characters are unfortunately a little more lacking. Gou is a female pervert, obsessed with guys muscles (even her brother's), Ama-sensei, the advisor, is a little yandere, Nitori, Rin's kohai, is all senpai notice me, etc...\\n\r\nI'm eternally grateful for KyoAni's decision not to put Gou in a bikini at any point, it's extremely refreshing to have a non ecchi anime for girls to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation\\n\r\nAnimation is KyoAni. I don't really need to say much more then that, flawless. The amount of detail put into the water graphics is ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nThe opeing theme for the first season of Free is possibly one of the catchiest songs of anime 2013. The voice acting is good, althought quite a few of the minor characters sound quite similar. The voice for Rin is particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something light hearted, cheerful, emotional and well animated that can be watched fairly quickly and plesurably, Free is the show for you. Just don't go expecting any amazing plot twists, trust me, there aren't any.",

I watch Anime for entertainment and Story, I do not care If It is catered to a certain Audience. Free, for some reason was very anticipated many Female viewers prior to Its airing. Many Male viewers began hating on Free saying that Its \"GAY\" even prior to Its premiere date. I'm a Male myself and I will be honest with you, I did enjoy Free from Episode 1 up to Episode 12. Yes, there were some Fan Services in the Anime, but nothing forme to drop the Anime as a whole because I love the Story, Music, and Art. K-ON! was catered to Male viewers as well, yet the Females don't complain about It. I don't know what makes Free hated by Males. Don't many of us guys enjoy having a good looking Body? If so, why hate Free just for that? \\n\\n\r\n[STORY] 8.0 /// [CHARACTER] 7.0\\n\r\nI was expecting Free to be another Plotless Anime because of Its SPORTS genre. Keep in mind, I'm not an avid watcher of the Sports Genre in anime so this is technically my first time watching an Anime from that Genre. It proved to be wrong when I saw 1-2 Episodes where It did have the potential to have a great Storyline. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the Plot. Everything was well fleshed and easy for many viewers will understand. The Ending was absolutely well done no doubt. \\n\\n\r\n[ART/SOUND] 10.0\\n\r\nAnimated by the same Company who did Kanon, Clannad, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, and K-ON! another excellent job for Kyoto Animation for producing such amazing Art for Free. This Anime does share some similar Art Style from Hyouka and a little bit from Chuunibyou, especially the character designs. The Water and the Environments are top notch. Watching it in 720p looked absolutely beautiful. I was also impressed with the Music that was used in the Background. Mixed with Acoustic tunes to some Electronics like Dubstep that fits well with the Scenes. \\n\\n\r\nTo Sum it all up, Free is not a bad Anime to watch. If you are a Male viewer who wants to watch It, just watch It. Don't be ashamed to watch It just because Its for Females. I can't say for Fan Services, but again don't let that stop you. With that said, that's all I have to say for my Review of Free. And I do look forward to Next Season in 2014.",

When he returns in high school, the boys work to put together a new school swimming team with the help of Rin\u2019s sister, Gou (or is it Kou?), and Rei, a new calculations-obsessed member, but find Rin to be a very different person.\r\nIt\u2019s really the humor and the relationships that steal the show here, that and the level of fanservice: the use of subversive female-gaze camera shots to display gorgeous half-nakedmale bodies with water sparkling or dripping off of them. And the fact that the guys all bond by being boys with girly names.\\n\\n\r\nThe delicious rivalry between Haruka and Rin, the mystery of what happened between them to change their personalities, the way they all take care of each other, the reason Haruka only swims freestyle, and generally the strong (and supremely slashy!) friendships make this a delightful anime even if you have no interest in swimming.",

            "content": "I admit that I found Free! too late, but I enjoyed the anime well. The artwork is pretty detailed, especially the guys here. It was so detailed that the artwork alone made me think that this is a gay anime. Turns out, that the artwork is simply amazing and has nothing to do with the genre, although this kind of artwork do reinforce the aura of each character. \r\nThe story is a little bit too focused on swimming. This is good, but not that good, since it made the story fells a little bit repetitive, although it's not that repetitive since the each episoded managedto be as different as possible. However, the story itself is pretty good, although I do admit that the anime aren't subtle enough to hold the story and explanations. It's pretty obvious that the anime held the explanation about Nanase and Rin for too long and it's obvious. But the ending is pretty mainstream, since Iwatobi SC gave Rin a chance to swim, and got disqualified for doing so, even if they won.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Sometimes I wonder if it's my headphone that is too good, or the sound is actually pretty good. The soundtrack is marvelous, and the soundtrack has alot of details in it. The soundtrack illustrate the anime pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character, Haruka Nanase and Rin was in the spotlight for too much. Nagisa and Rei also cathed a lot of attention, but sadly, Makoto was nearly left out from the story. Apart from his closeness to Nanase and his past, we didn't have much time to enjoy Makoto. Matsuoka Go benefits from the minimal amount of female character here, but the character could be developed well if given more amount of details. Nanase was over the top, and denred common sense, but it is good since it is pretty comical. Rin on the other hand was more detailed than Nanase, but boring since it was pretty common in other anime, but the char is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nI do enjoy this anime, and it totally blew my expectation. I never see an anime that draws the main character body in details consistently, and the story didn't left too many plot holes and consistent right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nI give this 9 out of 10",

            "content": "I have written a blog entry about this show but I figured I would give a review a try and see how this turns out. For the most part, this show is probably one of my favorites as is the second season, Eternal Summer; the storyline, the artwork, and the character development in both seasons are really what sealed the deal. For me, this is the first show that I have watched where I felt real emotion and sympathy for each one of the characters, even the characters that you \"were not supposed to like\" and that just proves how spot on the development ofeach of the characters really are; it is extremely telling when you can feel any kind of emotion for every character in a show and it is incredibly rare to find. \\n\\n\r\nThe show makes it so easy to become invested into everything that encompasses the story and it does not take long before you are fully submerged into the crystal blue water, similar to the characters you get to know, and suddenly you want to be in that world with them. Suddenly, you start to care and you begin to think about swimming in a way you never did before and it is wonderfully beautiful. After finishing both seasons, I found myself in my bed at two in the morning crying my eyes out because I was so overcome with this overwhelming sadness and nostalgia. For a while I could not figure out where these emotions where coming from but then it hit me: it was because, after those twenty five episodes, I had gotten so deeply involved in everything that was happening that those emotions completely took over my entire being. The wins, the losses, every friendship; I felt everything. The next thing I know I am looking that the ending screen of the entire show and I had only one thought going through my head, \"I do not want it to end. It cannot end.\" For me that is the most wonderful thought to have after watching an Anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I understand and completely respect the fact that this kind of Anime is not for everyone and not everyone is into sports Anime; everyone is entitled to their own opinion and their thoughts are completely valid; however, I think that this show is definitely a show that people should check out because I do not think it will disappoint anyone. It is still a very good show regardless of whether or not it is traditionally popular.",

No complicated story lines or fillers. There was good development within the characters throughout the story. The beginning wasn't very catchy, but the ending was fulfilling. I felt that it wrapped up the story nicely and it felt complete.\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nEach person had their unique personalities, like Haru's water fetish, which contributed to the comedic aspect of the anime. \r\nThe male characters being really close friends + having their shirts off most of the time (obviously b/c they are swimmers) apparently threw some viewers off, making themthink its \"gay/homo\" or \"female fan service.\" Ignore these people. They are going over the top and making a big deal out of nothing.\\n\\n\r\nART/ ANIMATION\\n\r\nFantastic. The detail put into every character's slim, but muscular bodies were amazing. I thought they really reflect how real life swimmers bodies are built. Also, animation of water was insane. How they made the water look so good is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nThe ending song was really catchy! I caught myself dancing to it a few times. The opening song was meh...\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed this anime. It was definitely worth my time and I recommend everyone to watch it!",

So Free! is basically about swimming and friendship with Happiness and Joy inside that makes you feel the importance about friendship and see that the Iwatobi Swimming Club is aiming high for a goal. Most of the people that have not watched this yet will think this is a Yaoi, Shounen Ai, or BL. But trust me, this is nothing related to those. There might be some parts where it looks like there is gonna be shounen ai related scene coming out but mostly it is the part when they hold each other sleeves and fight...probably even the fan arts that is looking likely a BL. Once you watch it, You can never escape from the story- the story is really nice and funny, comedy part makes you laugh, the sad parts makes you cry. The characters drawing is perfect and the characters personality is well described, I personally enjoyed it as the swim matches between the school is intense and makes you scream with joy as you are watching it. The boys are handsome and that is all I can say about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe OVA Free! Free! (Fr!Fr!) is nice as the OP Rage on by OLDCODEX is really good song with the ED Splash Free! by Style Five (Haruka, Makoto, Rin, Nagisa and Rei's voice actors) is a must to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all I can talk about Free!~",

            "content": "Not going to lie--when I first started this series, I wasn't really expecting much, because of the pre-airing hype. I'm a fujoshi, but I pretty much expected this to be just fanservice without much profoundness to it. Boooyy I was wrong.\r\nThis series /does/ have a lot of fanservice, but it actually has a point to it, which was a pleasant surprise for me. This /is/ a sports anime, technically, but it focuses more on the relationships and friendships between the characters, and Haru and Rin's character growth than it does the actual sport.\r\nI insist on addressing some of my annoyances with the other reviews here.It is not \"a yaoi\", the term is used just as \"yaoi\" (side note, yaoi is also not an adjective). Another, yaoi (in western definition) refers to the explicit male-male works. In Japan, yaoi is mostly only used for smut-without-plot doujinshi. The term itself literally just means that it's gratuitous PWP. Free! is either shounen or shoujo. It has no relevance to yaoi. Please stop misusing the term.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't have minded more in-depth incorporation of the sport. Overall, great series (though the most terrible fandom I've ever seen--from ship wars to staff/translator bashing). The character designs/personalities are great (except for nitori--the teardrop mole is overrated go home and if he says senpai one more time I will shove a bottle of chlorine down his throat), though not outstanding, which is probably part of the reason this show isn't in my top favourites. Makoto is by far the most popular character in this series, but it seems most people are in denial about his co-dependency issues and that trait of his where when he always gives into Haru first is not a good trait to have. I'm not saying they shouldn't enjoy his character, but I do wish they'd do so without denying parts of his character that the staff have even acknowledged. Though I personally find him to be a weak character. Rin, and the other characters, are also not perfect, which I acknowledge. Except Rei. Rei is perfect in every way. From his horrifying fashion sense to his beautiful super-saiyan-level-amazing screaming in the drama CDs. Also, A+++++ voice acting for Hirakawa and Mamoru.\\n\r\nThe instrumentals are generally lovely, and the first OP song is legendary. The Engrish in some of the songs is horrible, however. (For god's sake, Japanese musicians have too little respect for other languages.) The character songs are poorly composed (save for Mamoru's, which had decent melodies, and whose singing is the only one really worthwhile to listen to imo).\\n\r\nThe animation, is, needless to say, simply outstanding. The animation for swimming is very accurate, which I appreciate. It's pretty much perfect there. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say I'm not a huge fan of kuudere (e.g. Ayanami Rei, Kuroko) like Haru, but Haru isn't a flat character by any means, nor is he just there to look pretty. By the end of S2 especially, he grows tremendously as a character. His journey on his (avoidance of his) path to find a dream is extremely relateable. He's generally very apathetic, but Rin and his friends manage to spark change in that. The story takes us on Haru's path to find what it means to be truly \"free\", which if that's not profound, I don't know what is. However, Haru as a character himself is difficult for me to care about long-term, like one of those movies that you forget about after leaving the theatre. I wouldn't say he's a weak character, but he's not terribly interesting.\\n\r\nMakoto.... has nice legs. I don't have much else to say here about him other than I'm glad for his character growth in S2. (Honestly, I have less problems with him than I do for his fans.) I'm a huge fan of Yamato Nadeshiko types (e.g. Hinata, Sinon, Orihime, etc.) but I do not believe Makoto deserves to be called that. Yamato Nadeshiko are, at the core, with strong mental strength (or achieve strong mental strength), and Makoto is actually rather weak and vulnerable inside.\\n\r\nNagisa is a devil in sheep's clothing. Not as much as the fandom jokingly makes him out to be (lol Thugisa), but beware. We learn about him more in S2, which I'd love to expand on, but this is on S1. Anyway, he's adorable, but that's not all he is.\\n\r\nRei is the most hilarious character in this series by far. He's completely adorkable, and a total goofball, but he can say some pretty wise things, and he's a huge cataylst for change in both Haru and Rin. I relate to him a lot, too, including reasons such as that I also can't bloody swim no matter what I do lol. We share a similar appreciation for beauty (aesthetic, and in my case, also otherwise). Even if you don't care for stories of male bonds, I highly suggest watching the series even if just for him.\\n\r\nS1 focuses a lot more on Rin's character growth than Haru's. Rin's character has the most depth by far, and he sticks. A lot of people make him out to be a lot more of an arrogant smug prick than he actually is, though--please keep in mind that much of what we see of him in S1 isn't actually his true self (is that a spoiler? ...I don't think so. .....ah well. I just don't want anyone to ingrain any wrong first impressions). That said, he's not perfect either, of course. But you can ignore the people who keep harping on him as \"abusive\" for literally no good reason.\\n\\n\r\nI find it rather jarring that anyone would say Hyouka is a romance, but there's a parallel scene in Free with the flowing sakura with all the same camera angles and the shoujo wind, and yet people say this show is \"not gay at all\". (keeping the identities in the following passage vague to avoid spoilers)  Nevermind all the rest of the very, very obvious fujoshi-baiting (almost kiss-CPR trope, hello?), and the two people very obviously in love with Haru, made especially obvious in the novel (\"my shining/waterbird\"), and one comment by Sousuke in s2 that Rin didn't even deny, and Rin's whole hotel bed speech. Or the \"or should we sleep together in the same bed like when we were children?\" in the drama CD. And then they actually do sleep together in the same bed (happy accident) later in S2. Yes, they can think whatever they want, but misinforming people with \"not gay at all\" is just rather sigh-worthy. Only one male->male affection is made 100% canon (verbalized) in this series, and there are no canonically gay relationships, but this show is far from \"not gay at all\". It makes me really sad that I can describe so many romantic scenes between males to people, while not stating their genders, and when the other party is told, especially if they're males, they automatically assume I'm talking about a male and a female in love. But when they watch the show first, it's always \"it's just bromance\". You people talk about \"I don\u2019t feel like turning this review into a gay rights rant\", but it's just your brand of heteronormativity and being in denial about things you don't want to see. Power to you if you don't like it; but don't spread it just because you're uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I find most amusing was the hype expectations of their characters, vs the actual personalities of the characters. Especially Rei. We were all expecting the typical studious tsundere meganekko, and instead we got a HUGE DORK (still my favourite character). The shota we all expected to be a 2-dimensional fluffy puppy turned out to be a little shnit. Etc.",

Third, this series is about bonds of friendship.\r\nArt: Though I don't give particular attention to the \"art\" of any animation, I gotta say for the sake of this review that the art in this anime is surely beautiful. The characters, scenery's and even the water are well drawn with colors that pop and thus is visually appealing. \r\nSound: One of the elements that give life to any animation imo isthe sound, so the sound is more important to me than the art. In this series, the music is great and whether it be comical to emotional, the tracks fit the scenes perfectly. The opening track brings up the hype while the ED track is just okay to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Alright, all the characters are very likable though the series mainly focus on the development of two characters. The others also get their shining moments but the female characters doesn't really get much development.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Enjoyment : Again, though the story mainly focuses on the relationship of two characters,  I for one actually enjoyed this show. There were funny moments, annoying moments and emotional moments. And more than that, the friendship that the characters share allowed them to grow, change and be selfless. For people who takes interest in stories of friendship (male friendship in particular), sports and some eye-candy (with the art), this is a very good anime to see.",

There are huge fuck-off guys, yes, but that wouldn't be at all. A group of guys based swimming club and the whole story is about trying to succeed in swimming, at the same time, appear glimpses of the past and the whole story is nicely interwoven. I caught I couple of timesshe smiled in the classic passages, like buying a swimsuit. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are beautifully elaborate characterize and I have to say that I after a few episodes she was able to identify what that character will answer. :-)\\n\\n\r\n As I wrote, there's no specific anime, but as a swimmer I spent the entire anime beautifully relived and I have to say, that there is a lot of things that correspond to reality.

After marathoning this and the second season you start to question. You've stared at bare chests for hours now. Do nipples.. exist? Are there supposed to be some? Wait, do they even have belly buttons? Oh- thERE - maybe? \r\nI did like this! I mean, the plot's about as shallow as Donald Trumps campaign. But hey, at least this anime isn't a train wreck that might end up as president!\r\nGet this: president withoutnipples. Have you ever seen Trump's nipples, huh? Food for thought.\\n\\n\r\nLoved the characters. They have just enough personality for you to start liking them. And since much of this anime circles around friends, swimming with friends and progressing with friends.. well. I might as well just have spoiled the whole anime for you. But you should still watch it. It was such a nice and light-hearted story! The competitions have you on the edge of your seat. You might also get delusions about suddenly quitting school/work to become an olympic swimmer, though. Goodbye, family. It was a good run, but my talent calls me. I surely have the best doggy paddle in the whole of Europe.\\n\\n\r\nI also really, really liked their clothes (when they wore some, which wasn't that often). Their clothes were surprisingly western and suited their personalities to a t. They looked cool. They also looked cool without them, but that's not the point.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, yeah, this anime gets a ton of crap for being ''fanservice''. But who cares. It made me laugh a couple of times, definitely wasn't hard on the eyes and taught me what a relay is. And how it's apparently better than crack if done with the right people. \\n\\n\r\nMight actually watch this again someday. You know. For science.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review will most likely only be helpful to you if you can relate to my perspective while watching it, so I\u2019ll go ahead and tell you what it is.\r\nI hate sports.\r\nI hate playing sports.\r\nI hate watching sports.\r\nI hate listening to people talk about sports.\r\nSo, I naturally must\u2019ve misclicked when I was rating this anime, which Crunchyroll placed in the \r\nsports genre, right? Well\u2026\r\nI will say that it is to this anime\u2019s advantage that it is about swimming. Not because I dislike swimming any less than any other sport. Far from it. Actually, taking swimming lessons was probably one of the worst experiences of mylife. Quite simply, I can not stand the knowledge that I am unable to breathe, even if it only for a few seconds underwater. However, in the very least, swimming seems to be one of the easiest sports to understand. I can understand that the first person to travel from one end of the pool to the other wins, and that seems to be all that I needed to know to understand the action in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n(In all seriousness, one genuine advantage of the anime\u2019s focus upon swimming is its animation. Even those who strongly disliked this anime readily admitted that the animators know how to animate water realistically and beautifully.)\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, even if I didn\u2019t understand the fundamental basics of swimming, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that I wouldn\u2019t understand the majority of this anime, because the majority of this anime does not consist of swimming. In fact, I would say that Free! is only 25% sports anime, which left 75% with the potential for me to enjoy. What is the other 75%? I\u2019m glad that you asked.\\n\\n\r\n25% relates to the \u201cslice of life\u201d genre. This includes the characters partaking in activities that are related to swimming, but not actually swimming, such as repairing the school\u2019s pool; activities that are related to the maintenance of the swimming club in general, such as the quest to gain new members; and activities that involve the characters just hanging out. As the name implies, a \u201cslice of life\u201d story is relatively grounded in realistic, relatable situations. Because these situations tend to be mundane and uninteresting in their own right, the best way to make the story engaging to the audience is through a cast of likeable characters. \\n\\n\r\nFree! certainly succeeds in having a likeable cast of main characters. However, one aspect of the characters that may not have been intentional is that is quite difficult to take most of them seriously. This is especially true in regards to the protagonist, Haru, and the antagonist, Rin. On one hand, Haru and Rin never failed to make me laugh. On the other hand, I get the impression that this was not the intended reaction to their characters. \\n\\n\r\nHaru\u2019s love of water and stoicism is exaggerated to a ridiculous degree. It was quite easy to make jokes about him being sexually attracted to water. I also found it funny that Haru was just as emo as a young child in his flashbacks as he was as a young adult. At least Rin was a little more realistic, beginning as an energetic and happy child and entering an emo phase as a teen. His character motivations are also more satisfactorily explained than Haru\u2019s. However, Rin\u2019s actions are still just as ridiculously over the top as Haru\u2019s, with him constantly flying into a rage or sobbing at little provocation. The interactions of these two characters esentially sums up another 25% of the anime, which can most accurately be described as a soap opera. The primary conflict in Free! is the emotional tension between Haru and Rin. Due to their exaggeratedly dramatic interactions, it is quite difficult to take their conflict seriously, rendering it rather humorous.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are, ironically, probably more likeable and easier to take seriously than the protagonist and antagonist. Rei was an especially interesting character. Although he received little backstory, he grows throughout the series more than any other character, both in physical skills and his relationships with others. Nagisa also does not receive a backstory, and nor does he really change throughout the series. Despite this, I still felt as though I could take his character more seriously than Haru or Rin. His enthusiasm and playfulness are exceptional, but not unrealistic. My favorite character is definitely Makoto. Makoto has the most common sense of any of the characters, and, I suppose in spite of this common sense, he remains devoted to his friends and cares deeply for them. Unlike Nagisa and Rei, Makoto actually does receive a bit of backstory, and, unlike Haru or Rin, he is not overly dramatic or unrealistic in the way that it shapes his character.\\n\\n\r\nI will readily admit the the supporting cast of Free! is quite poor. The only supporting character that I was glad was a part of the show was Nitori, solely because I received pleasure from watching him get hurt. (I\u2019m a sadist. What of it?) Nitori is an annoying fanboy of Rin, who refuses to quit following him despite Rin frequently demanding him to go away. His counterpart is Gou, a fangirl of the members of the Iwatobi swimming club and younger sister of Rin. While she is less annoying than Nitori, I thought that she was a massive waste of potential. Even though she never swims, she is still technically a member of the swimming team, but she never really develops a compelling bond to any of her teammates. Coach Sasabe has almost no personality. Miss Amakata has almost no personality and is annoying. (Her entire character consists of two running gags, one of which was dragged out throughout the series despite having an obvious punchline, and the other of which was simply not funny.) \\n\\n\r\nThe final quarter of Free!, as well as the aspect that it seems to be the most known for, is its fanservice. It was featured prominently throughout the show, and it was just as high quality as the animation of the water. The character designs left little to be desired, with all of the main characters somehow managing to be simultaneously baddass with their muscular bodies and adorable with their pretty faces. Immature and easily amused, I thought that the fanservice was one of the best comedic aspects of the show, especially in regards to how obvious some of it was. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the show that many seem to classify as fanservice is the relationships between the characters. Whether the relationships were romantically inclined or not, they were definitely strong and one of the more compelling aspects of the show. Between the lifetime friendship between Makoto and Haru, in which they resembled an elderly married couple who could read each other\u2019s thoughts, and the budding relationship between Rei and Nagisa, in which the latter can\u2019t get enough of teasing the former, there are plenty of sweet moments in the show between characters that can appeal to those who are fans of yaoi as well as those who are not.\\n\\n\r\nThe exception to this rule, in my opinion, was the relationship between Rin and Haru. I can argue that Makoto and Haru are just friends with the personal example of the dynamic between myself and my best friend. I can argue that Nagisa has a flirty personality in general, not just towards Rei. I have trouble arguing that Rin and Haru could be considered \u2018just friends.\u2019 The magnitude of the decisions that they base upon each other seems to imply that there is a very particular kind of tension behind their interactions. Unfortunately, the exaggerated subtext made their relationship especially ambiguous, and since none of the main characters ever confess romantic feelings onscreen, it just leaves the audience feeling especially confused and/or disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Free!, even though I could not take it very seriously. This anime is recommended to those who are interested in beautiful animation, likeable characters, compelling relationships, and ridiculous fanservice. There should be at least 25% that can appeal to you, right?\\n",

            "content": "This is more of a random rant rather than a review, to be honest. I wanted to note something down since this was such a pleasant surprise for me. Probably not unlike many people I was really doubtful of how deserving Free! was of the hype surrounding it that continues even now. Even now I still think that at first glance the synopsis, the characters, the posters, most things I'd seen related to Free! would still discourage me from starting the series even if time had turned back. But, oh my, am I glad that I actually decided to give this a chance! I'd initiallyfinished around one and a half episodes but didn't really liked the subtle 'gayness' that was seeping out of the screen. If you haven't already realized by now, I'm not exactly a fan of yaoi in general, though I also have nothing against it. \\n\\n\r\nHowever.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea what prompted me to pick it up from where I left it but I did, and sooner than later I was at the last episode WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN MY FACE (literally) and thinking 'why the hell am I crying??'. Needless to say I enjoyed it very much, so much more than I'd expected to.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself doesn't come with an outstanding story or character development, but the non-complexity of things made it an anime easy to enjoy and immerse oneself in. It was a simple anime but not mindless or without story progression, the cast interacts well and the main characters get subtle character developments, with the exception of Rin (and maybe also Haru) who had the most progression. Also I have to say that the boys were really cute to watch, though I couldn't stop myself from sensing the subtle gayness that flows through the air during certain moments, which I'm quite pleased to say actually doesn't happen often. I'm not too emotionally invested in any of the characters yet but the cast is overall quite likeable with distinct personalities. The art and animation also make up for the flaws Free! might have had. It was quite brilliant and very aesthetically pleasing, making it even easier to enjoy the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this was highly enjoyable with a simple major storyline to follow, but sufficient story progression and some character development that allows emotions involvement on the audience's part. Sound-wise and art-wise I do think that it is pretty well-produced, which boasts the overall enjoyment one could gain from watching the anime. Off to the second season now!",

            "content": "First of all, the review was written in Spanish and then translated with my bad English. The original version is below this.\r\nEnglish: \r\nDefinitly Free! was to me the surprise of this season. I must admit that I not expected more than fanservice to girls, but ended up convincing and like it much more than I could imagine.\r\nHistory : 6. It's nothing out of the ordinary . The friends who form a swimming club and have his  rival ex friend who for some reason now competes against them to overcome the protagonists. If we rely only on the synopsis is not anything special , butthe issue of swimming for approval.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : 10. Kyoto Animation 's work was wonderful , not only in the physical details of the boys ( we all know they did a good job with that ) , but the animation of water, landscape and whether the design of the characters was fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nMusic : 8. I enjoyed both the opening and the ending and the OST I also liked . I have no complaints about this but not that stand out much .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.I definitely love the characters. Complex or not, every one of them won my affection for his charisma and humanity. It does not happen often with anime series, but Free! I felt that the guys really exist, that if we ignore the physicist who have x3. The niggle I have is that they are not developed at all or we don\u00b4t know all of them, we learned important things on drama CD that could well have put them in the anime to give more weight to some characters. My favorites: Rin, Nagisa and Gou. \\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 10. At 100%. With Free! I laughed, I cried, I was excited and a lot of other things. I have to tell you that I cried in the end,  I am sensitive to the issues of friendship, so watch that ends the way I wanted, even though it was exactly as I predicted, I was filled with feelings. Literally I swam in Feeling. Every Wednesday I waited anxiously for each chapter and when this finished I wanted the next. If that's not entertainment Then what is?\\n\\n\\n\r\nEspa\u00f1ol (Original):\\n\\n\r\nDefinitivamente Free! fue para mi la sorpresa de esta temporada. He de admitir que no esperaba mas que fanservice e insinuaciones yaoi de esta serie, pero termin\u00f3 por convencerme y gustarme mucho mas de lo que pude imaginar. \\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 6. No es nada fuera de lo normal. Los amigos que forman un club de nataci\u00f3n y que tienen su ex amigo rival que por alguna raz\u00f3n ahora compite contra ellos para poder superar al protagonistas. Si nos basamos solo en la sinopsis no es nada del otro mundo, pero el tema  de la nataci\u00f3n hace que lo apruebe. \\n\\n\r\nAnimaci\u00f3n: 10. El trabajo de Kyoto Animation fue fant\u00e1stico, no solo los detalles en el f\u00edsico de los chicos (que todas sabemos que hicieron un buen trabajo con eso), sino la animaci\u00f3n del agua, los paisajes y en si el dise\u00f1o de los personajes me gust\u00f3 mucho. \\n\\n\r\nM\u00fasica: 8. Disfrut\u00e9 mucho tanto el opening como el ending y el OST tambi\u00e9n me gust\u00f3. No tengo quejas sobre esto pero tampoco es que destaque mucho. \\n\\n\r\nPersonajes: 8.Yo definitivamente amo a los personajes. Sean complejos o no, todos y  cada uno de ellos se gan\u00f3 mi cari\u00f1o por su carisma y humanidad. No me pasa a menudo con series de anime, pero con Free! me pas\u00f3 que sent\u00ed que los chicos existen, eso si ignoramos el f\u00edsico que tienen x3. El problemita que tienen es que no se los desarrolla del todo o no se sabe todo de ellos, nos enteramos cosas importantes por CD drama que podr\u00edan bien haberlas puesto en el anime para darles mas peso a algunos personajes. Mis favoritos: Rin, Nagisa y Gou. \\n\\n\r\nEntretenimiento: 10. Al 100%. Con Free! me he re\u00eddo, llor\u00e9, me emocion\u00e9 y un mont\u00f3n de cosas mas. De por si ya les digo que llor\u00e9 con el final, es que soy sensible con los temas de la amistad,  as\u00ed que ver que termina como yo quer\u00eda, a pesar de que fue ex\u00e1ctamente como lo predije, me llen\u00f3 de sentimientos. Literalmente nad\u00e9 en Feeling. Esper\u00e9 cada mi\u00e9rcoles ansiosa por cada capitulo y cuando terminaba ya quer\u00eda el pr\u00f3ximo. Si eso no es entretenimiento \u00bfEntonces que lo es?",
