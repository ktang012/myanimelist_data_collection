            "content": "When you lose everything and end up with nothing, how do you pick yourself up and move on? Do you lash out in anger and bitterness, hiding your wounds? Do you allow the emptiness inside you to shut out any emotional reaction, numbly accepting your fate? Do you desperately search everywhere for what remains of you, hoping to piece yourself back together? Or do you fear losing again so much that you spend all your time protecting what you already have, nearly crushing it in your tight grasp?\r\nWith each of these suggestions, I refer to a particular character in the story whose struggle with lossreflects one of these patterns. This theme of loss and the struggle to regain or find acceptance is by no means a new one to either drama or anime/manga, but in Pandora Hearts it is approached in a sensitive, original, and surprisingly light-hearted, pleasing manner. Though emotionally gripping, Pandora Hearts is rarely dark and angsty, favouring quirky, likeable characters and a humourous, tongue-in-cheek storytelling style.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\nThe XEBEC-produced art/animation quality may be somewhat lacking, but the irresistibly charming Pandora Hearts is sure to make you fall in love with its beautifully crafted story, characters, fantasy world, and music.\\n\\n\r\nPros:  \\n\r\n-\tmost loveable, original and well-developed cast I\u2019ve seen in a long time\\n\r\n-\tdetailed, interesting \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-themed world\\n\r\n-\tstory contains few \u201cfiller\u201d episodes and is perfectly paced, sure to leave you gasping for more\\n\r\n-\temotional, memorable OST by .hack//SIGN & Noir (and many more) composer Yuki Kajiura\\n\r\n-\tone of those anime that has a bit of everything: drama, action, humour, even hints of romance\\n\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n-\tsub-par art quality, rather unacceptable by today\u2019s standards\\n\r\n-\tweak, disappointing ending; many story threads left hanging without resolution\\n\r\n-\tsome unavoidably clich\u00e9 moments and a protagonist who is often ineffectual and, worse, annoying in his willingness to lay down his life\\n\r\n-\tno clear antagonist in the story, though this isn\u2019t really a problem until the very last episodes\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\n15-year old Oz Vessalius is the typical spoiled selfish noble kid, playing pranks all day, teasing his servant and best friend Gilbert, gaining favours from his indulgent uncle Oscar. Then, on the night of his coming-of-age-ceremony, time freezes and Oz is forced into the Abyss by mysterious strangers. Trapped in this nightmarish alternate dimension, he meets a strange, devilish young girl named Alice, who is really a Chain (a sort of \u201cmonster\u201d of the Abyss). They form a Contract: Alice decides to help Oz return to his world, while he promises to search for her missing memories. As they find out more about her, it turns out there\u2019s a lot he doesn\u2019t know about the past either\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a somewhat well-worn path \u2013 disaster befalls na\u00efve youngster, he meets mysterious girl, they discover new things, make friends and beat bad guys \u2013 but the difference is that the characters who fill all the traditional roles are so original and interesting. Alice, as the heroine of the story, is refreshingly powerful and strong-willed, with a bad mouth, a meat fetish, and a wicked laugh  \u2013 and a surprising sensitivity. Oz, on the other hand, is earnest and soft-hearted, though he oddly doesn\u2019t seem to care too strongly about anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also plenty of mysteries to be solved and plot twists to be revealed. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that the plot is the anime\u2019s strongest point. Not quite. Most of the \u201cplot\u201d really has little to do with the present situation at hand and is more about exploring the characters\u2019 pasts. In fact, almost all of the really interesting moments in the anime are actually revelations about the past. As you might expect, all this jumping back and forth between past and present, real and alternate dimensions, while fascinating, can leave one confused and overwhelmed. Lastly, I can\u2019t neglect the fact that the ending is truly dismal. Like many anime (it seems), a promising beginning, middle and even climax is no guarantee of a satisfying ending. When you reach the final episode I\u2019m sure you, too, will be thinking, \u201cWhat? They can't leave it at that - there must be some mistake!!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10) \\n\r\nThere\u2019s no way Pandora Hearts gets anything less than full score on this one. The characters are simply enrapturing. It\u2019s hard to pick a favourite because there are so many good choices! For starters, the designs are original, enticing, and complement the characters\u2019 personalities well. Oz, despite being 15, has the vacant, vulnerable look of a younger boy, suggesting his innocence and fragility. Alice looks fiery and ferocious with her red jacket, demonically pointy hair, and long high-heeled boots; but her short stature and smooth, childlike features render her cute and approachable. Gilbert is astonishingly handsome, dark, and mysterious when he first appears as Raven in full black attire; as soon as his hat comes off, however, (so to speak) he becomes comical with his messy \u201cseaweed\u201d hair, his emotional tantrums, and his self-conscious cigarettes. Two other characters I feel deserve special mention: Xerxes Break, a silly yet understatedly dangerous character whose loose sleeves flop over his hands, whose smile is always shaped unnervingly into a V, and who wears a freaky rattling puppet-doll on his shoulder called Emily; and Vincent Nightray, who has two different-colored eyes, one yellow and one red, as if to represent his unpredictable, split personality (at times saccharinely sweet; at others cold-bloodedly cruel and deceptive).\\n\\n\r\nEach character is quirky, with multiple sides to their personality. Oz occasionally shows a hyper-romantic, flirtatious side. Alice, as mentioned earlier, will do anything for meat. Gilbert has an incurable phobia of cats. Sharon, a girl who is older than she looks, likes young boys and seems to have a thing for Alice. Break is addicted to candy and other sweet things. Vincent is disturbingly obsessed with his brother. And so on. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters also have incredible chemistry together. Oz and Alice have this cute little \"You're my man-servant, do what I say!\" \"Hahaha, of course Alice! (but not really!)\" thing going on, with semi-romantic undertones. Oz and Gilbert, meanwhile, have an endearing \"master and servant\" relationship that's complicated by the fact that Gilbert looks (and is) much older than his \"master\" (and made hilarious by the fact that Oz can still get away with teasing him.) Naturally, Gil and Alice find themselves caught in a struggle for the affections of their master/man-servant Oz, hurling funny names at each other that soon become familiar (\"Stupid rabbit!\" \"Seaweed hair!\") - though when it comes to Break, they are united in their icy distrust of the slippery, duplicitous character.\\n\\n\r\nThe true strength of the characters lies in their multi-facetedness. No character in the main cast feels \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad.\u201d For much of the story, there is even no clear antagonist, as each suspicious individual is shown one by one to be pure-hearted in some way. Somehow, the anime hardly suffers for this lack of \u201ctrue evil,\u201d which I view as a testament to the strength of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, the entire anime basically revolves around the characters\u2019 individual backstories. There is nary a character in the main cast who we do not see some kind of flashback of. In a way, the characters\u2019 pasts define who they are even more distinctly than the present action. Strangely, I found this worked very well, leading one to speculate fascinatingly about what must have happened before the main story. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (6/10)\\n\r\nBy today\u2019s standards, as well as the standards set by the rest of the anime, the art really sticks out like a sore thumb. And let me get this clear that I don\u2019t in any way mean Jun Mochizuki\u2019s original designs; I\u2019m talking about the frame-by-frame art quality of the anime, which was produced by studio XEBEC. Compared to contemporaries in the same genre that I\u2019ve been watching such as Kuroshitsuji and Nabari no Ou, the art and animation really has a lot of catching up to do. Unpolished, often with very unappealing colour palettes, and few extremely eye-catching or original backdrops, I wondered frequently why they could not have done this beautiful story justice with a higher budget. Without the charms of Mochizuki\u2019s character designs, the art would nearly render this anime unwatchable. The opening of an anime should be its one greatest chance to dazzle and woo the audience with flashy, high-budget sequences; yet Pandora Hearts is one of the only good anime I\u2019ve watched where the quality of the opening animation failed to impress me at all. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a beautifully conceived opening with wonderful music and fascinating visuals, but the animation itself is little beyond lacklustre.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Voice Acting (9/10)\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura\u2019s work truly is beautiful. It\u2019s hard to say anything bad about it. When it comes to emotional drama, suspenseful themes, heart-wrenching themes, and tragic themes, she is the master. Her English-language insert piece, \"Everytime you kissed me,\" is a thorough success, and the ubiquitous \"music box\" theme she created for Pandora Hearts, \"Lacie,\" is hauntingly memorable. But I can be nit-picky. The themes can get slightly repetitive and, if you\u2019ve heard her previous work, it'll probably feel a little deja vu. The endings and opening, while excellent, are not extraordinarily exceptional. In the end, the one point I knocked off comes down to the music not being extremely original, just very good.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing really left to be desired from the Japanese voice acting. Everything is just as it should be. The boyish, suave Junko Minagawa (Ryoma Echizen , Ritsuka Aoyagi) is the perfect choice as Oz, while listening to Kosuke Toriumi (Yuri Lowell, Kiba Inuzuka)\u2019s sexy voice as Gilbert is like eating chocolate ice cream, and Akira Ishida (Gaara, Kaworu Nagisa, Athrun Zala, many others) does a spectacular job as the eccentric, foppish Break (and Emily!), as usual. In all respects, a very strong cast.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Pandora Hearts has its share of flaws, and probably won't please absolutely everyone (action fans, why are you still here?!), but once immersed in its lovely, charming little world, its intoxication is a very, very pleasant experience. (9/10)",

            "content": "I would just like to say that this is the very first anime I've given a 10 to without watching it in its entirety. I've always enjoyed twists on Alice in Wonderland and I love the darker genre of anime so needless to say Pandora Hearts drew me in right away. \r\nThe synopsis doesn't do the story justice. Imagine being 15 and having everything and then being sucked into a world that is similar to a broken toy box where the dolls try to eat you. Thats just what Oz Bezarius goes through on his coming of age ceremony on his birthday. I won't saymuch more or else I could spoil something, but trust me that the story is up to par.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was brilliant. It's hard for me to watch an anime with bad artwork so I try to choose those with characters that are pleasing to look at. The fight scenes and magic are also very well played in this anime. I think my only complaint is not with the art-work itself, but with the quality. Having to wait each week you take what you get and sometimes the colors/etc. look dull in the fan-subs.\\n\\n\r\nI love the music! This is one of the few anime that I just can't get enough of the opening theme. Parallel Hearts by Function Junction is awesome. If you have time look it up on YouTube...there are a lot of people who have done piano and accoustic versions of it that are just wonderful. I also really like the music box melody and just in general the music is great throughout. It presents the anime with a whimsical and yet forboding feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. Theres something for everyone from the crazy and weird humored (Break) to the broody and mysterious (Raven) to the over-powered and short tempered girl (Alice) to the flirty kid who has a lot more pain hidden than you'd think (Oz) and even the girl that hardly talks but knows how to take down anyone (Echo). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall both get a perfect 10. This is probably the first anime in a long time that I just can't get enough of. Though the entire series isn't out yet after you watch a few episodes you'll be sitting on your computer each Saturday waiting for the next one to come out too!",

            "content": "Imagine your reality falling into pieces on your fifteenth birthday, pushed into a broken toy box and relentlessly pursued by people you barely know.\r\nPushed aside and left broken, do you accept death in the name of saving another's life, desperately looking for pieces of yourself to confirm your existence? Knowing nothing about yourself, wanting to find out, yet scared of finding out, how do you move on? How do you protect something you once lost, in fear of losing it again, suffocating it with your loyalty and inability to let it leave your sight?\r\nPandora Hearts explores the story of Oz Vessalius ( or Bezarius, asI'm used to ), a boy whose life is thrown into chaos on his fifteenth birthday, at his coming-of-ceremony. The anime, I'd say, has an overarching theme of loss and self-discovery.\\n\\n\r\nThe Abyss is a deep, dark place where sinners are dragged into-a place that Oz stopped believing in until he was thrown in. With the discovery of a pocket watch that sings a haunting tune, strange things begin happening and Oz meets a young girl called Alice, a Chain from the Abyss with the form of a black rabbit once her suppressed power is unleashed, who is searching for her lost memories.\\n\\n\r\nI won't reveal anymore. The whole charm of the anime is found in the characters and the past shrouded in mystery. Oz, Alice, and his faithful servant, Gilbert, begin their quest to search for pieces of memory that Alice is searching for.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, it looks like a normal anime. Questing for memories while defeating enemies but that's exactly where we're misled. The pieces of Alice's memory are intertwined with others', and for the most part, the plot involves flashbacks of the characters' pasts. One fragment only leads to more questions. Pandora Hearts' strongest point is its characters. The characters are never one-sided and they are so skilfully woven that we see begin to slowly see the flaws in them. Why does Oz accept everything so light-heartedly? Nothing seems to bother him at all but as we move on, we see a darkness emerge, once layered and locked away.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, the anime retains its timely comedy, providing a light-hearted adventure for the person watching. Alice and Gilbert are constantly fighting for Oz's attention, coming up with nicknames like \"Seaweed Head\" and \"Stupid rabbit\". Oz leaves them to their own antics, only to be unwillingly dragged in and pulled from both sides. Oz, disturbingly calm about everything, with a policy to accept everything as it is because anything can happen. He has also been shown with a tendency to flirt, much like his uncle.\\n\\n\r\nAlice, while meat-loving, sarcastic, tsundere-like and shows some signs of sadism, has a sweet and vulnerable side. Gilbert, while short-tempered and sensitive, is gentle and hold a fierce loyalty to Oz. The only time Alice and Gilbert cooperate with each other is when yet another interesting character, Xerxes Break slips in ( quite literally ). Break is one of those manipulative characters who believes in using others and being used. He also likes to pop out of the strangest places, but he, too, has a larger part than simply being a \"minor\" character. His mistress, Sharon, is a deceptively sweet-looking character who, in punishing Break, shows no hesitance.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Nightray, a man who, at times is, sweet while other times, scarily crazed and shows an alarming obsession for his older brother. Then, although he didn't have much screen time, Eliot Nightray and his attendant, Leo. Eliot was truly a crucial character who played a large part in Oz's development. There also some undertones of hinted romance but that doesn't play a large part.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes passed by too fast for me to realise that I was almost at the end. Oz, as a character, peels away the protective layers he had unconsciously wrapped around himself and slowly starts to face himself. He, Alice and Gilbert have grown undeniably closer and it's time to face past demons. The mystery behind what truly happened in the past is left as a question mark and in that aspect, I believe the anime could have ended off better.\\n\\n\r\nEven then, the plot did a great job. I'd say, honestly, it didn't feel like there was \"evil\" like in some anime, there's pointedly evil people who do the most horrible things. But in this, you slowly start to realise that things are not as they seem and that's exactly what makes this a classic watch. The plot wasn't perfect, I admit, there were certain clich\u00e9s but the idea of building something with pieces of memories and at the same time, building the characters' pasts solidly, they did a wonderful job. I did cry once, at that important part of Eliot and Oz's meeting.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the OSTs, they were perfect. I love Kajiura Yuki's music and using the English piece \"Everytime You Kissed Me\" by Emily Bindiger really raised the quality of the anime. The OST is one of the things that gave me goosebumps. One thing I had a problem with, though, is that it tended to become repetitive. At some point, I realised that the same OSTs were repeating and it didn't have as much impact as it should have. Even so, the OST really did help to make this a top-notch and haunting anime. The voice acting was great. There were times when it kind of slipped and you start to wonder if Oz's voice actor is a female but I think she did a really great job of voicing Oz. It was deceiving because I always thought it was a male ( except for those few times she had to scream ). The voice actors manage to bring out the feelings and the characters they are. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation appealed to me, but in today's standards, it hardly stands out. The animation, however, holds this certain fluidity and childishness in young characters, showing that, perhaps, the story isn't as deep as it seems and we shouldn't look too much into it. The animation remained smooth throughout so I don't think it was much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts is worth your time and effort. But I wouldn't say that it would appeal to all fans who might be more inclined to other genres. I really enjoyed it, hence the full score. It's still a great watch so give it a try!",

            "content": "First off, I have to confess that the only reason why I'm writing this review is because there is a review here that says it's a horrible anime and I can't allow that to be said, 'cause this is my favourite anime of all time! (sorry MAL this just had to be said don't worry I focus only on the anime from now on)\r\nPandora Hearts is a anime/manga that is completely unique, seriously I've read over 200 manga's (i haven't added them all to my list on this site btw) and searched through hundreds more to find one similar to this and I can't findone that matches the suspence, mystery, action, and down right awesomeness this anime offers. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that the first episode is kind of confusing. So many things are introduced that some people i guess, can't handle the new world that this anime introduces. But as the anime goes on you start wanting more, so many questions so little clues, and the answers you slowly get not only make your jaw drop to the floor, but add so many more questions that need to be answered. (seriously it makes you want to learn Japanese so you can watch the next episode that much sooner) This anime really sparks your curousity. The very characters in this anime seem to be a mystery all themselves, I mean the first line of the anime is \"Oz Bezarius, your sin is, your very existence\" and then you at home watching this think \"What the heck? That's just a kid, what could be so horrible about his existence that he is thrown into a prison for the worst criminals out there?\" And the questions don't end there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is, just like in the manga, so beautifully done it's like looking into a window of our own past. This world resembles one from the Victorian era in europe or later, with dukes, and kings, and parties more like balls, with castles and mansions so wonderous it makes you feel like you've gone make in time. The charaters of this story are also drawn fabulously with their very characteristics drawn into their beings. It doesn't take you long to remeber who's who in this anime. (which is a problem i've had in the past with other animes, and also having more characters with western names also helps!)\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is just great! Not only are the opening and closing themes catchy and memorable, the battle music and just any time music gives this anime a more present time sound and feel. The characters voices match the characters themselves perfectly and are not annoying in anyway,(i hate when characters have annoying voices they are a total turn off) even the chains (creatures of the Abyss/monsters) voices sound match them perfectly.   \\n\\n\r\nI'm trying my best not to spoil anything about the characters so I'm only saying their charateeristics, but if you feel like I spoiled something for you I deeply apologize. \\n\r\nOz Bezarius- fifteen years old and future duke of the Bezarius household. He's kind of childish, for a boy who is now having his coming-of-age ceremony. He trust others easily and cares about others a bit to much and maybe doesn't care enough for himself. He loves his little sister Ada and loves to tease his servant/friend gil who is one year younger than him. He is very kind but his mysterious past gives him a bit of a dark side. He is a character who you easily love and is the \"hero\" of this story. \\n\r\nGil- Oz's most loyal servant and friend. He tries his best in all things he does and is deeply ashamed of his failures. His biggest fear is cats and helps Oz get away from his duties and play around and explore.\\n\r\nAlice- the mysterious chain whose true form looks so human that you tend to forget that she isn't. Her other names include: Bea Rabbit, black rabbit, and most famously The Blood stained Black Rabbit. Her power is unlike any other chain. She is a girl who speaks her mind and doesn't let Oz forget that he is her servant and should feel honoured that he is contracted with her. Her favourite foods include meat, meat and more meat and to her the world is her playground. Her past in one of the main points and mystery of this  story and what her memories hold are the answers to many questions.\\n\r\nSharon- a seemingly young girl who Oz meets at his coming of age ceremony. Her cute mannerism and charming smile make you believe she is no one of importance, but her warning she leaves Oz with makes you wonder who in the world is she?\\n\r\nBreak- a strange man with a doll on hisleft shoulder named Emily. He is Sharon's servant, who's odd manner makes him more than meets the eye.\\n\r\nThis is just a few of the character's in this story but they are the ones I feel are most necessary to know about before watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review is pretty long (not inteaded) but I hope I have given you a better idea about how amazing and unique this anime is. (i mean i like unique things right?) And if you are not satisfied or this review doesn't help you i deeply apologize. But if you want more and are not satified with the 8 (soon 9) episodes available. I highly recommend the manga and if you want more then just the 17 chapters available in english, message me about the next twenty chapters where I can tell you where the raws and their english translations are. Again I highly recommend this anime I know the more popular it is the sooner an english dub will be made.",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts is a prime example of wasted potential. It starts out with an interesting premise that grabs you at the start, but after a few episodes, it\u2019s nothing but downhill from there until it finally crashes and burns at the end of its 25-episode run.\r\nWhy do I say this?\r\nThere are many interesting plot threads and ideas that are introduced at various points in the story, but they are almost never followed through with or they\u2019re executed in a way that, frankly, makes them boring. For example, when we learn about the four dukedoms of Pandora, I get the sense that there\u2019s a lot ofhistory and political machinations going on in the background but it hardly ever gets explored, instead focusing on the development of our main heroes, Oz and Alice (which doesn\u2019t sound that bad, but more on that later). Then, we are introduced to the main antagonists, the Baskervilles, who seem really cool and threatening at first, but when we meet them, are like Team Rocket without the silly speeches. In other words, they\u2019re there just to have antagonists in the show and don't do a whole lot to further the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe cherry on top was the notably craptastic anime-only ending. I have never even read the manga and I could tell the ending was shoddily put together at the last minute, just to have some sort of conclusion, but honestly, I\u2019d rather have an open ending over what they did here. For fear of being too spoilery, I will just say that the writers thought to throw in a bunch of generic Chains to provide some sort of \u201cultimate challenge\u201d for the protagonists, but as a result, it comes off as completely random and badly-written.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s move on to the protagonists beginning with Oz. Oz is a lovely young fellow \u2013 cheerful, caring, loyal, and brave. However, he\u2019s apathetic, taking everything in stride even when he\u2019s faced with some terrible Chains in the Abyss. It\u2019s completely unrealistic and makes it hard for anyone to connect with him. How can you care about a character who, well, doesn\u2019t care? To his credit, he does get some character development but it either never follows through (e.g. his father issues) or it takes the form of someone lecturing him (this is probably more the fault of the writers than an actual character flaw, though).\\n\\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s Alice, Pandora Heart\u2019s main tsundere. She doesn\u2019t end up being nearly as interesting as she first presents herself to be, although her little quirks make her more endearing than Oz, such as her insistence that Oz is her manservant and her fondness for meat (LOL since when does a rabbit like meat so much?). Still, I\u2019m afraid to say she doesn\u2019t have much depth to her, the most being her desire to regain all the fragments of her memory. The rest of the time, she\u2019s relegated to being a source of humour and/or romantic tension with Oz or, in her B-Rabbit form, being the series own deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some notable characters \u2013 namely Gil, Break, and Vincent \u2013 who receive some notable time and developing on top of interesting histories and colourful personalities, but they\u2019re supporting characters who must eventually step back to let the main plot take center stage.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, overall, it\u2019s poor. There are some nice designs floating around, but when it comes down to making everything move, it\u2019s lacking, especially for such a recent and (relatively) short series. I\u2019ve seen longer and older series with equal or better animation, to be honest. I swear, I have never seen so much floating hair and clothes in anime in my life \u2013 it was like a gust of wind went by and the animators simply took a single frame from that and kept it for the entire sequence while keeping the mouths moving. Even in the opening sequence (which are nearly always of high quality), there\u2019s a shot of Oz running that looks odd and clunky.\\n\\n\r\nMost reviews will also point out the lovely music, but then it\u2019s by Kajiura Yuki, so that\u2019s a given. If you\u2019ve heard Kajiura\u2019s music before, you\u2019ll recognize her style almost immediately, so whether that\u2019s a positive or a negative is up to you. For me, it\u2019s generally a positive since she pulls through with another solid soundtrack, but personally, I\u2019d like to see her try something different from what she usually composes. For Pandora Heart\u2019s purposes, though, it\u2019s good listening material here, although certain tracks tend to get overplayed. Voice acting was pretty solid, so no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Pandora Hearts began as a very promising series with a lot of great ideas that could have continued being great until the end if executed properly. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t happen and the series falls flat on its face by the halfway point. I would say either read the manga (which I\u2019m told is better?) or find another fantasy series.",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts is an anime that draws inspiration and many thematic elements from the story Alice in Wonderland.   It is about a young aristocrat named Oz Bezarius, the heir of a noble house, who becomes the victim of a dark ceremony in the first episode and is cast down into the \"Abyss\" - a prison like area inhabited by monsters called Chains.  While there, he meets the Chain known as Alice, the Black Rabbit.\r\nThe show starts out incredibly strong, but its strength doesn't last long at all.  The overlying problem with the show is that it doesn't seem to know whatdirection it wants to go in.  You are initially presented with a dark and gothic horror that almost immediately makes way for super deformed art and bright, flashing colours.  The show remains this way, tying together ridiculous anime tropes and scenes right next to its dark and gritty storyline.  Alice quickly moves from a creepy and dangerous entity to a glutton and comic relief character.  I think a bit more focus in either area would have been fantastic, but as it is Pandora Hearts can be disorientating and very dissonant.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great.  Oz is a typical shounen lead, complete with a tendency to risk himself for others that borders on suicidal.  It's quite stereotypical, but not to the point that I hated whenever he appeared on screen, and he at least presented himself in this honest way for the majority of the show.  However the other characters are fantastic.  Gilbert is written extremely well and undergoes a lot of development throughout the show, and Xerxes Break eventually ends up as a complete scene stealer as soon as he is given even a hint of his backstory.  Alice, however, never quite moves past her brutal introduction and despite being the center of the entire story she quickly fades in and out of obscurity for episodes at a time.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack from Yuki Kajiura is extremely strong, and has several pieces that match up to her great scores from Kara no Kyoukai.  Some tracks are often described as repetitive, but I had no issue with this myself.  I do think that a couple of times a song choice for a scene may have been less then amazing, but the music itself was very good.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the ending - there are massive plot points that never get resolved and I wish I had known that going in.  For such a great premise and beginning so many things slip away through the story that it is really kind of infuriating.  The ending of the series is anime only, and like many other poor anime adaption endings you will be able to pick up the exact moment where the story veers off.  Anime only ends can be done right - but this one wasn't.  Nothing was answered, and the mysteries that Oz and Alice often mentioned resolving were simply ignored until the end.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the biggest shame is how much more could have been fit into 25 episodes, where instead the writers wasted absurd amounts of time with super deformed art and typical anime filler scenarios.  There are many plot points that are deemed as important to the main characters that never go anywhere and end up being a complete waste of screen time. The most infuriating part comes towards the end of the show, where you should be spending your time getting your answers to the questions you've built up, an entire episode is instead spent on showing everybody drunk.  Put simply I kind of wish the series had cut some of the bullshit, a lot of the comedy moments were poor and completely out of place.  \\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts is a fun ride and there are some FANTASTIC moments, but ultimately your destination ends up being a hole in the ground that goes straight to the Abyss of Anime-Ending-Only Hell.  There are no side trips to Resolution or Answers, you just go straight into the pit.  And since I've already visited, I'll try to warn you not to.",

            "content": "Oh Pandora Hearts, how you have let me down.\r\nI'm kicking off this review by saying that I didn't watch this at anyone's request. A friend of mine mentioned watching it in passing and with nothing else to go on I threw myself headfirst into it.\r\nPandora Hearts had potential which is a downright shame because it wasted it by veering off into \"nothing-is-explained land.\"\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe initial premise was awesome. Dark, horrific, desperate. A lot of the story elements in Pandora Hearts are drawn from Alice in Wonderland and twisted into darker themes. The basic premise is that Oz Vessalius, a spoiled rich kid, is thrown intothe Abyss which is basically hell. Oz is forced to make a contract with a Chain called Alice to escape from the Abyss, and is captured by the mysterious organization Pandora upon his return.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the serious themes mostly stop there. Much of the plot is wasted on comedy which is unsuccessfully placed next to a story attempting to also be serious, leading to the comedy ruining the mood countless times. I cringed so much, because they'd have a great scene going and then wreck it with jokes that usually weren't funny anyway.\\n\r\nThere was also great potential in Oz's contract. He has a brand of a clock on his chest and when the hand makes a full rotation, he will die. But this never comes into effect during the show. Pandora Hearts ends with the hand on Oz's clock only having made two moves during the entire show. Since this anime ended up different from the manga in its final episodes, the writers could easily have made the clock move more and more and end with Oz's death or the hand making its final turn. In the beginning of the show, Oz and Gilbert were obsessed with trying to find a way to negate Oz's contract so that he wouldn't die, but this issue is abandoned soon enough and never comes into play again.\\n\r\nPandora Hearts also wasted too much time developing its characters. Now, this normally isn't a bad thing, but it's detrimental when you have a 25-episode anime with no chance of a second season and you instead spend all the time on characters' backstories, letting the plot take a backseat; because the result is well-developed characters that get an abrupt end. The show almost seems to me as if the makers were following the manga all the way through, then abruptly realized they were at 24 out of 25 episodes and were like \"Oh shit guess we better wrap this up.\" That's pretty lazy writing, especially considering manga doesn't have a set amount of chapters when it starts being made, while anime is only licensed for a certain amount of episodes at a time. The point I'm trying to make here is that the manga could afford to spend a lot of time developing the characters and bring the story back later, while the anime can't really do that. Even if Pandora Hearts had gotten a second season, I know from experience that not as many people watch the second season of a show. So spending all your time on characters and pretty much abandoning the plot is a poor choice.\\n\r\nAnother issue I had with the story is that it's chugging along, and then shortly before the ending (episode 20 to be exact), there is an absolutely pointless filler episode where Alice gets drunk and a lot of \"comedic\" nonsense takes place. I was watching this and fuming that they wasted a whole episode on essentially nothing happening. Filler episodes are marginally more acceptable in the beginning of the show, but certainly not at the end.\\n\r\nBecause of this poor choice of pacing, the last episode is a terrible ending. It doesn't even have a \"last episode\" feel to it. It starts out like a typical episode and there's even more of that mood-ruining comedy. Then the story reaches its (pretty boring) climax and it's over halfway through the episode. The rest of the episode is just the characters doing stuff. They even played the regular opening and ending themes during the last episode, which I have come to be greatly annoyed by because it makes it seem like any other episode. Using the opening theme in the last episode is generally more acceptable to me than using the ending theme.\\n\r\nSo many questions that were built up in the early episodes are completely abandoned. At the very least they could have attempted to answer some of them.\\n\r\nThe issues with the story basically all boil down to better planning. The story couldn't figure out which way it wanted to go, leading to multiple confusing moments. The character development could have been placed so as to cause minimal slowdown issues. Questions could have been answered effectively if the writers had looked up and realized a wall was right ahead and they were driving into it.\\n\r\nAll in all, Pandora Hearts had great potential for a dark show that was wasted time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nPandora Hearts was made by a fairly new studio, so the art and animation aren't too great, but they're not particularly bad either. They were pretty average.\\n\r\nThe only issue I had with it was the use of fanservice which I thought was pretty poorly placed and unnecessary (then again, fanservice is rarely necessary. But in this story it didn't seem appropriate at all).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nHot damn do I love the OST of this show. Yuki Kaijura, who also did the soundtrack for Madoka Magica, does not disappoint. The OST is gorgeous and orchestral and really fits the dark theme they were originally trying for. You might say I'm biased because I'm a sucker for minor-key orchestral songs, but the soundtrack of this show is really very good. I especially love the watch's music box-esque theme and how they would play it at the very end of each episode.\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Parallel Hearts, is badass as hell (though I do wish they had changed it when they changed the ending song because using the same opening while not changing the ending gets pretty old), and the first ending song, Catcher in the Maze, is really pretty and awesome and I especially love the full version. I didn't really like the second ending though, and in my opinion they should have switched the two ending songs, or just not changed the ending song at all.\\n\r\nI also really love the insert song, \"Every Time You Kissed Me,\" performed by Emily Bindiger, that was played during the final episode. I think it's a really subtle and nice touch that the key of the song and the music for it is built around the watch's theme. I also like how they got an American singer to perform the song, rather than a Japanese person singing in English (I'm looking at you, second Future Diary OP).\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting, long story short this anime will never get a dub (aside from fandubs), so I watched it subbed. Even though I don't consider myself to be a good judge of Japanese voice acting, I thought the voices in this show were amazing. Oz's voice actress in particular blew me away because I couldn't make up my mind whether it was a man or a woman until I looked it up and discovered that a woman was voicing him.\\n\r\nOz's voice was the particular standout, but I thought all around the voice acting was really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, most of the screentime of this show was given to developing the characters and explaining their backstories. I think Gilbert especially got a lot of really good character development going on for him. In addition, once Xerxes Break's backstory is explained, he goes from being the ambiguous, quirky trickster to a really interesting character.\\n\r\nI thought a lot of characters weren't explained, however. The white-haired version of Alice that keeps popping up throughout the show doesn't really get much of an explanation and while I do remember her purpose in the show, it wasn't fulfilled in my opinion. Also, Oz's sister, the Baskervilles, and the students at the academy (one of whom was playing the watch's song on the piano; names escape me) didn't get appropriate screentime to explain themselves.\\n\r\nAlso, even though Alice is my favorite character in Pandora Hearts, I do agree with someone else's review: the show didn't explore the potential Alice had to be a dark and crazy creature of the Abyss. Once she leaves the Abyss, her sly nature goes away and she's pretty much reduced to a gluttonous tsundere. And I think that's a downright shame considering she could have turned on Oz and Gilbert, or left them to pursue her own ambitions (Like getting her memories back. Could we have an explanation for why they weren't recovered by the end rather than just \"well we haven't had any luck with that oh well\").\\n\r\nI do like the hinted romance between Oz and Alice, and how it was left open for the viewer to decide if they wanted anything to happen or not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI took a break after watching the first seven or eight episodes, but quickly marathoned the rest of the show after reading an announcement that the site I was watching it on was shutting down. I probably would have taken my time with this show if I hadn't been worried about losing access, so even though I watched it fairly quickly, I was pretty reluctant.\\n\r\nAnd I've already mentioned my gripes with the mistimed comedy that resulted in glaring tone issues compared to the story attempting to be dark. That factors into the enjoyment score.\\n\r\nI also noticed a lot of parallels between this story and Fullmetal Alchemist (the manga and the 03 anime), which didn't help my enjoyment levels, since I enjoy FMA so much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nIt's kind of unfortunate that at one point in the show I was considering scoring it a 9, then it ended up as a 5 ultimately.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty shabby and the show leaves a lot of holes and hanging questions, but the characters were overall pretty solid and the music fantastic. So I'd recommend watching Pandora Hearts if you have spare time on your hands. It's not really a priority.",

            "content": "What gives people the strength to go on after they have fallen? What makes them strive for the perspective of a bright future? Seeking to answer those questions, \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d gives the impression of a charming, unique series that differs from its counterparts through adapting a popular scheme, but not entirely living off it. Why, then, is it nothing amazing in particular?\r\nSTORY (7)\r\nGood beginning. This series starts with really nicely developed foundations. It seems very promising; we get to know Oz Vessalius, your typical young hero-wannabe, but as soon as Alice shows up, things start getting interesting. Oz ends up in the twisted realm of\u201cAbyss\u201d, only to be saved by the mad rabbit, however nothing comes free of charge. And nothing is the same when he goes back to his world.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I ask: when and why did it go downhill? What happened to the fascinating, dark mood this show kept in the beginning? When did it become a clich\u00e9-filled sh\u00f4nen adventure with hardly any development overall? I had high hopes for the series and kept watching, expecting it to, I don\u2019t know, improve? It does, actually, get better right in the middle, where we finally receive some character development, the story progresses and most importantly \u2013 some of the most important questions are answered. But then it worsens yet again. The rest feels forced and the series stops at such a moment that it leaves you with huge disappointment. Why is it over so suddenly? It desperately calls for a continuation, it does.\\n\\n\r\nSetting, though, is where the series excels. True, this whole \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-hype might be getting a tad annoying, however \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d adapts the theme perfectly. It is a warped world, nevertheless it doesn\u2019t feel that sickly abstract. The \u201cChains\u201d are yet another embodiment of human fears \u2013 and so is the \u201cAbyss\u201d itself. It doesn\u2019t feel like the kind of place you would want to end up in, precisely. Watching a fantasy series set in such scenery feels just refreshing. The references to the original \u201cAlice\u201d are subtle and often misleading, which is also accomplished very well.\\n\\n\r\nART (7)\\n\r\nSomething is missing. The characters look wonderfully colourful and detailed at first, the surroundings are promising, but then the quality becomes an issue. With each episode, more and more flaws can be noticed. Even fight scenes tend to become dull, since those often follow the pattern of slashing, cutting, slashing and a little bit more of slashing. The worst thing is, though, how the vividness and energy of characters is lost through a dull palette. Who, in the world, robbed those poor guys of their colours, making them look just boring? What appears pretty \u2013 the hair does, oh, and Sharon\u2019s dresses. Good job, but that\u2019s it. Why does Oz look even more boring than he actually is, I ask? The series has a completely washed-out look which pains me a lot, since I was really looking forward to enjoying the graphics. (Apparently, the quality in the few special episodes outruns the TV animation a lot. Too bad it was rushed, too bad.)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9)\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura does an outstanding job capturing the magic of the setting in \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d. The music itself is simply excellent and stands out in the series\u2019 overall look. It is charming, at other times has a mysterious tone to it, or dramatic, fitting well with what is going on the screen. Never exaggerated. Although the score might not appear anything exceptional in the beginning, the viewer soon begins to realise that it without it, the Victorian atmosphere couldn\u2019t be captured as good. The soundtrack is equally pleasant to the ear while not watching the show, too.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting is quite well-done. Junko Minagawa does a good job playing the part of Oz, Ayako Kawasumi is a fine Alice, and Ishida Akira excels as always in his role (even though the character himself is not very likable). The seiy\u00fb operate their voices perfectly, creating very emotionally-convincing cast and pretty much making up for the flaws of the characters themselves. Here, I can\u2019t complain.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending sequences are nothing special in this case. Cute songs go along with the animation (the first ending, in particular, is full of annoying spoilers, so watch out), however they are not notable enough to make one feel like spending that additional time watching both OP and ED. They simply don\u2019t get in the way.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5)\\n\r\nThis is exactly where the series\u2019 biggest weakness lies \u2013 its character cast which is particularly weak, boring and clich\u00e9. Starting from the main character, aforementioned Oz, it becomes extremely tiresome and the characters don\u2019t develop much. Oz is a good definition of a typical sh\u00f4nen main lead. He is brave, adventurous, protective of his friends and clumsy when it comes to love. He also has family issues to make him more of a dramatic rebel, and a whiner for a side-kick. Oz\u2019s actions throughout the series are easily predictable and more than often he falls into banal traumas, being the kind of person who wants to save the day, become a hero and protect his princess. Sorry, this might be going well with the story, but as a character Oz is a failure.\\n\\n\r\nGilbert is, fortunately, a different story. He changes a lot \u2013 his personality becomes completely unlike, save for a few specific features that are necessary for some progress in the story (no, his loyalty to Oz is NOT a plot device for fangirl issues). Contrary to the first male lead, he keeps calm and generally stays rather dependable, when it comes to satisfying the fans. His actions certainly aren\u2019t very surprising, as it all revolves around Oz anyway; but at least he did not make me want to murder someone whenever he appeared on the screen. Alas, one more thing must be brought up here as well, namely \u2013 Gilbert being a magnet for fans. No-one can deny his typically attractive traits (cold and introverted chain-smoker, sorry), but hey, haven\u2019t I already said something about stereotypes in this series?\\n\\n\r\nThe creation of Alice turns out to be a disappointment after a few episodes. She starts off as a madwoman, a crazy sadist who cares little about who or what she might destroy while immersing herself in bloody, vicious fights. But Alice is a tsundere character \u2013 and being a genuine tsundere in \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d, she can\u2019t possibly stay this way throughout the series. An attractive, moody glutton - which she ends as \u2013 obviously arouses the interest of others, and soon the relationship between her and Oz becomes a major problem in the story. Yes. Alice, the wild Chain who only has any regard for herself, is a crying little girl inside. I can\u2019t deny the charm of tsundere characters, but this just doesn\u2019t seem right.\\n\\n\r\nNo other character really deserves any special words of praise here, sadly. There\u2019s the hyped \u201cMad Hatter\u201d Break, a particularly annoying it\u2019s-a-secret type of pretty boy; a cast of supposedly evil manifestations of malevolence; and others who exist merely for the purpose of creating a background for the main leads. There are also Sharon and Jack who have the potential to make great characters, but are mostly neglected or idealised; there is a representative of the rare male tsundere specimen, Elliot. And there\u2019s Vincent who is much creepier than he would normally be supposed to. They all might seem colourful at first, however inside they are not as interesting as they appear.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (7)\\n\r\nTo be honest, this series is quite boring. All the big talk about how different and remarkable it is, and what I see is an average fantasy adventure with mediocre art and particularly annoying character cast. But it has potential \u2013 which had been wasted, unfortunately. If only the series developed in a different manner, maybe I would have been able to enjoy it more. For now, I can\u2019t say anything special about it. Felt as if I was rewatching something else, just another episode of already known series, and it really does not bring much into the genre. It certainly isn\u2019t bad, not at all, yet it\u2019s still nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7)\\n\r\nHaving complained a lot about the flaws in \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d, I still can\u2019t criticise the series as a whole. It has its drawbacks, just like any other show, and pluses; most notably the incredible atmosphere of a well-designed, interesting world. The one thing I simply don\u2019t understand is how overrated it is becoming \u2013 all because of the fuss made over new adaptations of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d which are now apparently inspiring people all over the world, while years ago it was still an eerie fairytale, more of a madman\u2019s dream. The new versions, however, go well with the tastes of nowadays\u2019 viewers who know what they want to see, but expect the shows to demonstrate a certain level of creativity and innovation as well. It kills those shows. \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d is such a series with much power and weak realisation - a great concept trapped in a mediocre, clich\u00e9-filled box.\\n",

            "content": "The Story:\r\nI rated the Story of Pandora Hearts a full 10 because the series simply has one of the most amazing stories i've seen so far in anime. The story is well written with multiple twists and the cliffhangers at the end of each episode really get you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next episode. The story also has some elements from Alice in Wonderland but they are all modified to fit the anime story. \r\nThe Art:\r\nPandora Hearts is drawn and animated quite well and i quite like the Victorian style of buildings and clothing. Still the animation is not evennearly perfect but has improved a bit from the first episode. Overall the art is good but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice actors and soundtrack to this anime are well picked and fit very well. I would've given it a 10 as well but the new ending theme let me down a bit, it does not fit the quite dark theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIf you like Alice in Wonderland you will find some familiar characters in Pandora Hearts such as the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat. Even though they are not like in the original book, they still share some personality traits with their original counterparts. The main characters and their relationships have been well designed as well, i'm sure there's pretty much all character types in this anime from tsundere to the silent, emotionless type.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBecause of mystery surrounding this series and the exciting twists i really enjoy Pandora Hearts very much. I've not been disappointed with any of the episodes so far and it just seems to get better all the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite a few minor mistakes, this anime is one of the best, if not THE best anime series this year. Not all people are going to enjoy Pandora Hearts but i sure do, and i recommend checking it out. It gets better after the few first confusing episodes :)",

            "content": "To summarize briefly, Pandora Hearts is an average anime with potential to be so much more. I have no idea why it ended up as a semi-finished series that leaves the viewer a little disappointed in some aspects.\r\nI am getting ahead of myself.\r\nStory: If you like good story and very little fillers, you might enjoy this one too.\r\nThe setting is gloomy and sometimes alot more horrifying than the characters' reactions indicate. Still the characters try to have fun and take it the best they can, which mostly works out, luckily.\r\nThere is not much else to say without spoilers. Moving on.\r\nCharacters: Xerxes Break and Gilbert Nightrayare well-done and evolve throughout the series. Alot of background story gets revealed bit by bit, making it incredibly fun to watch those two grow. Break spices up the series with his appearance and behaviour, causing some laughs and headshaking, but definitely not in a bad way.\\n\r\nOz and Alice sometimes feel like a lost couple and other episodes just remind me of Ai Yori Aoshi, as sick as that might sound. Alice's character development is deep and, like most other things in the series, pieced together in a giant mosaic. Oz on the other hand seems like an immature brat, there to fill the role of the protagonist, because no one else would take it.\\n\r\nThe villains in general pose a good change in pace and add to a great plot, and you got many, the Baskervilles, the Will of the Abyss and even some from the heroes' own ranks, each with their own goals.\\n\r\nNow why did I give the characters a 5, I seem to be praising them too much for that.... well, so many characters want to be told in painful detail, that leads to confusion and for a 25 episode anime you should set a limit somewhere. I only pointed out some good parts, but there are just as many bad, if not more.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: The animations were pretty and reminded of Get Backers at times, especially with the characters getting small and chubby, which adds alot to the comedy. Apart from that, at times the scenes were a little static, but beautiful still. Artwork was really good and made the watch worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: Especially the music felt a little like .hack//sign, and was powerful and beautiful. There is nothing to moan about here, I can only say, it fit the show very well.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing and last complaints: Does Pandora Hearts really fit a 7? Or the Characters really a 5? I guess you have to see for yourself.\\n\r\nI loved all of it up to about episode 22. Then it quickly came to an end, leaving me unsatisfied and with the lack of a showdown that fit the tension buildup from the past dozen episodes. I truly believe, if someone had thought about what they were doing there, and extended Pandora Hearts to 30 episodes, they could have concluded with a -bam- instead of a tiny bell, finishing many of the little plotlines that seem to be continued in the manga at least. I was just very disappointed, because I liked the plot, I liked the humor and even most characters, but the ending did not live up to the first two thirds of the show.",

The attention to detail is very sharp like the clothing and plot. If you haven't read the manga then i suggest you do, it tells u everything from episodes so far with a few spoilers. But the anime itself follows the manga very very closely and giving the same manga titles as the anime titles. The story of Alice and Oz's adventuress outbreak of discovery, pain and realisation is immense and addictive leaving mecurious at the end of each episode. Even though several things like memory loss and contractors were seen in a couple of animes, but adding the originality and mystery is definately what makes this anime worth watching. And this is definately a anime for everyone who likes, a bit of comedy, mystery and adventure but even if you dont atleast read the manga since this series is what i think the best anime released at spring fall 09.",

            "content": "(This is my first review ever.)\r\nOh, dear. I'm shocked at the overall positive vibe people have for this show. Was I watching something else by mistake?\r\nThe story itself is serviceable, perhaps even interesting, but it's buried under a glacial pace. They managed to cover about 12 episodes' worth of material in 25 episodes, which seems like the director was suddenly told just before they went on air that he had twice as much time as he thought he did. I just read that the manga is still going while the anime has finished. Oh wait, no. It didn't finish. It ended. Finishing sounds like theygave you some kind of resolution. I challenge you to find someone who can honestly say they liked slapdash episode 25.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only 2 characters they try to explore, one of which is Oz, but in Pandora Hearts' 25 episodes you learn far less about him than say, the entire cast of Cowboy Bebop in the same amount of time. Everyone else is generally one-dimensional, though the second explored character turns out to be surprisingly well-rounded.\\n\\n\r\nThe good news is that Oz does develop slightly. That's all the good news I have.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the show's 9-hour run, the characters are rather crudely drawn and spend the majority of their time sitting or standing still. It's been a long time since I've seen an animated show with so little animation. Every episode is stuffed with padding...slowly sliding pictures of scenery or whatnot with recaps thrown in to desperately take up screen time.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure what's up with MyAnimeList. When I write the review, it wants me to rate the \"Art,\" but when I submit, it says \"Animation.\" Those are different things, man! Art is 3, Animation is 2.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8 was a turning point in the series because there was finally decent art, interesting camera angles, and 9 (amazingly enough) has some animation in it...a brief fight scene! On the down side, some of the frequent flashbacks begin to flash back to earlier in the SAME episode! There was even a scene where all the characters are talking while facing away from the camera so they didn't have to animate anything at all! In the entire show, there are only about 3-4 episodes that are really animated.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some things I liked about the show. The music box theme is pleasant and sticks in your head, though by the end of the show they're opening the watch just to play the tune. The main theme is reimagined several times in interesting ways. The voice acting is well-done.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the character designs are nice, although everyone's clothes billow out and hover (due to lack of animation). The first plot twist was completely unexpected and handled nicely. I also found one character's bloodthirsty fixation on eating animals charming.\\n\\n\r\nBut those are just shiny bits glimmering from a sea of slow and muck.\\n\\n\r\n(4) Bad.\\n\r\nActually, you know what? I'm going to drop it to (1) Unwatchable. It's cruel to pretend that you're going to go somewhere, then don't.\\n\\n\r\nI kept watching, hoping it would get better. The second half of the show is a decent start to a show, with mysteries and interesting characters introduced, but then poof, the show ends and you're left wondering why they (and you) even bothered.",

            "content": "Ah, what do we wonder have here? A fine lot, a fine lot indeed, all wonderfully fat and skinny and in between. Come to tea then to wonder? Hmm? A wonderland you say? A wonderland! A wonderland? Fallen down the rabbit hole, you wonder? Bees in your bonnets? Butterflies in your stomach? Bats in your belfry? No need to wonder... You're already here, Wonder! It's wonderland! A wonderfully wonderful wonder of a wonderland, Wonder. But you must have wondered by now if Wonderland's the name, Mr. Wonder? No, Mrs. Wonder. It's-\r\n...the Abyss.\r\nW-what the hell? Who's there?\r\nPandora Hearts was adapted by a manga of the samename by Jun Mochizuki. Produced by Xebec, and directed by Takao Kato, the story takes place in a universe of two different dimensions... of sorts: a humanity inhabited Victorian era-esque setting of corsets and petticoats, and a macabre reimagining of Lewis Caroll's Wonderland, the latter infested with eldritch abominations known as Chains with apparent appetites for manflesh. There's very little doubt that this show took its inspiration from Alice in Wonderland. We follow Oz Vessalius, a somewhat mischievous, but otherwise goodhearted youth and heir to one of the four great dukedoms of the realm. Due to circumstances involving a seemingly brief stint in the Abyss, a white-themed Alice choking him within an inch of his life and a red-themed Alice, henceforth known as simply Alice, enslaving/contracting with whatever was left, Oz, the chosen one, the red-themed Alice, and the loyal attendants/oddly dispositioned allies of the Chain-smoking agency dubbed Pandora, set off to unravel the mysteries of this Abyss and its governess, its Will. Adventure with sprinkles of madness, this show is sure to satisfy shounen itches.\\n\\n\r\nIntrospection atop heaps of despair, this show is also sure to interest those looking for a little more. A caveat of note toward this otherwise sensationalist review: existentialism. Most of the main characters are experiencing or have gone through some form of existentialist crisis. Personal existentialist crises framed with questions such as... Why was I born? Why do I continue to live? Is there any reason for me to? There's Oz, with his eerily resigned nature toward distressing events and his stilted affirmation toward martyrdom stemming from the trauma of being an unwanted son. There's Alice, with her past memories' absence and the anguish of being perceived incomplete, the outsider, alone. Self-sacrifice for self-gratification. Suspended animation, or rather, its sensation. In fact, most of the main cast are experiencing or have experienced these issues at some point or another, and most are pursuing numerous truths, the truth behind the numerous tragedies connected to the Abyss, the truth behind Will of the Abyss, the truth behind the Abyss itself. But most interestingly of all these veracities are the ones that are personal. For Oz and Alice specifically, they need the truth in confronting their own demons before progressing elsewhere, no matter how painful that may be.\\n\\n\r\nThen after, is finding the truth behind the melody. \u201cLacie\u201d in all its reiterative forms, more predominantly as a simple music box number, is a work of art. Played on its own many times throughout the show, without words, with more than just feelings, this melody weaves a tale of its own. Rather than one of one-sided angst, it croons of tragedy as it compels its listeners to muse why music so beautiful, a product of which can only find in happy days, is so sad. Coupled with details of the story seen and spoken, the musical yarn is given clarity. The story, in turn, is given weight. Crafted by the talents of one Ms. Yuki Kaiijura, who composed the rest of the OST, a special mention must be said of the OP, \u201cParallel Hearts,\u201d by Kaijura's Fiction Junction. With a similarly soul-rending violin solo at the beginning and haunting vocals throughout, the crescendos and decrescendos of the song match well with the fluctuating intensity of the visuals, even if those visuals do little more than introduce the settings and cast members. The EDs, ED1 \u201cmaze,\u201d and ED2 \u201cWatashi wo Mitsukete,\u201d translated \u201cFind Me,\u201d by savage genius are of a more obligatory note by comparison. ED1, which hosts its own pretty and well-paced dynamics, is comprised mainly of Alice, suspended, vulnerable, insecure because of her lack of an identity, interspaced by Oz providing just that. ED2 is of a lighter toned portrayals of the major recurring characters accompanied by singing that wouldn't be half bad if it stayed on pitch towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is consistent, nothing as eye-catchingly comparable as some of more scenic and uncanny set pieces, the notable exception coming to mind being all those murderous dolls from the latter, save those demarcatedly anime forms of stylized humor, deliberately deformed head sizes, facial expressions, and whatnot. Funny for those who like that humor, and honestly, it'd be rare to find an anime fan that wasn't, but there's no denying that, on its own, it's silly to a fault. And that quality's a problem for a show like this, especially at its inception. Here I am, breathing in the setting, the atmosphere, the substance of the established relationships, the gravity of the sinister elements at play, and then a stupid anime mug later, my immersion's shattered, and I'm left disgruntled trying to re-piece it into a semblance or even shell of what it was from earlier. \\n\\n\r\nIt becomes less of an issue the further on the story progresses, but the comedy, however balanced with its dramatic counterpart never really changes from this aforementioned nature, and then a new issue erupts revolving around the characters. We see our main cast in serious situations. We see our main cast in silly ones. Yet we never see much in between, and because of that, the relationships in this show lack real grounding. Real relationships constitute more than just stress and hijinks; they are made up of normal moments, of people sharing their interests in fairly realistic ways. That doesn't mean humor can't be implemented to spice these moments up, but if they are to feel sincere, then they can't be more than just elements. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's another bothersome feature that has less to do with the animation and more to do with the direction. Eyes are said to be windows to the soul; it's especially true for anime, since eyes are an effective way of demonstrating powerful emotions without the need for any further body language. It's an attractive for production studios running under tight budgets, but Pandora Hearts abuses it so much on the male main protagonist that it becomes sensationally meaningless, and I'd argue it's uncharacteristic of Oz to be eliciting such pained eye expressions every episode to other episode. Such direction has to be used sparingly if the intent behind them is to signal that shit's hit the fan, because if the show as a whole is polluted with them, then it's hard to take them seriously.\\n\\n\r\nLastly is this show's heavy-handed reliance on flashbacks. Flashbacks are viable means of characterization and plot progression, especially when the object of them is to coax drama. Anyone who's a fan of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica would attest to their effectiveness when used properly. However, Pandora Hearts does two things wrong with them. One, it uses them incessantly. Two, it uses them right before or during the majority of the series' numerous dire situations. The dramatic value a flashback may carry over to a narrative diffuses the more often it is used. Coupled with the fact that it's often used when it's convenient, to introduce it right at the moment where we are supposed to care about characters the most, it borders on contrivance. The only flashbacks I find reasonable are the ones around Alice, whom the audience is supposed to regard as somewhat mysterious, one of the major plot drives being that she's unlocking memories as she goes. It also helps that those memories are also pretty tragic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it. Filled with execution flaws, but nonetheless layered with substantive ambition and terrific music, minding the rough start it's a show to try out when you have the time. That's me, and before I break into anymore literary nonsense, I think I'm going to get a new hat.

            "content": "If I was told : 'Hey, there's another season of Pandora Hearts' I would believe it... \r\nI feel like something is still missing after 25 episodes. If I was to delete the few last episode from my mind and write this review, I would have been able put a way better score. I often say : When the Ending is bad the whole thing becomes bad. This 'rule' apply to Pandora Hearts. In fact... it's like it is made for this show.\r\nPandora Hearts had a lot of potential !\r\nThe First Episodes were mysterious and I had a lot of question on my mind. I haveto say many of them are still unanswered or I feel like the given answer is lame. [WATCH OUT FOR POSSIBLE SPOILER!] Oz sins was his very existence ? Why ?... Because his father never wanted him ? So he send him into Abyss ? And Also, he send him into Abyss because The Will wanted him ? Is that me or that's a lot of Coincidence !?![END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER] I was really disappointed and that's only one example of the Weird Answer. Somehow I feel like the 'Tragedy of Sabrie' is also REALLY Lacking. It was mysterious and interesting and that's a good thing but as a writer you have to answer the questions in the End. Pandora Hearts didn't.\\n\r\nI get the main idea... I think but I had to 'Guess' many of them from what we see. I would have like to know more in details what happened and more importantly, the WHY of those event. The Baskerville killed all those people following Glen's order but why ? Why did he order that in the first place ?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I should read the Manga but, seriously... Do I want to reach the same ending ?\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending was ridiculous. Was it the lack of a real enemy the whole time ? In the End, you reach a point where there's no real enemy and maybe that was the problem with the whole story. They couldn't find a way to end it so they ended it this lame way by making Oz's Father and his chain the 'Temporary' Bad Guy.\\n\\n\r\nI still would 'recommend' it for the interesting plot but sadly it was rushed and the ending solve nothing at all. Oz say it, in the end. He said he would still search to 'solve' the mysteries. That's why I said, I would believe if someone told me there was another season. Sadly, there is no such thing and this... This was the Real Ending !\\n\\n\r\nTherefore... \\n\r\nSTORY:: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Art. This looked like some of the First Naruto Episode. I remember them... Do you ? They were 'OK' and it was years ago ! Pandora Hearts isn't that old and the Graphic are horrible. Some scene were good but other... they were horrible. I'm thinking of the Scene at the End where he sees 'Griffon' his father's Chains painting or something on the wall. He's all shocked staring at it. Seriously... His eyes are juste getting 'BIG - SMALL - BIG - SMALL' and his hair darker on his forehead. But Still, I can deal with a Style that look more 'Old' or 'Out of date'. That really isn't the thing that screw thing us for the Show.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore...\\n\r\nART:: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say against the Music. The Intro was good. The second ending felt a Little out of place but it was Ok. The show wasn't all dark either so it's ok. The Soundtrack were good. Kajiura Yuki's music is always good and was going great with the show. However, the song were nothing new. I remember the song from 'Mai-Hime' and they sound really similar. I feel like I can hear 'Mezame' everywhere in those almost. I think the only song from her that are slightly different are those in Xenosaga. But this review isn't about her music ! Eh-eh. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore...\\n\r\nMUSIC:: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nHow can you make people love character they don't know and don't understand. I love Break and... Hey, that's the only Character we were given real answer with ! Oz is annoying. Nothing to say about him really. He's the main Character. He keeps saying that he doesn't care if he dies. Then why should I care ? Is he really important ? He doesn't get anything at all. To me he was just a selfish young boy. And, Good News everyone ! His Fate is still unsure cuz, he still have the Symbol on his chest and he will surely dies when it's full even if Gil helps him slowing the process down. Maybe, that something would have been something good to add in the ending or something...\\n\r\nAlice was a good character... until they made her do some totally random stuff. I get it she's suppose to be the Tsundere character but, seriously ?... Her character became ridiculous at time and then it's hard to take her seriously. Also, I wish her background would have been put to light more than that with Jack and eventually, leading to the whole Tragedy thing and then... To Oz. The pieces are still messed up for the story it's no different for the Character. Vincent and Gilbert are also totally in the darkness for me. To me, Vincent is still a murder. He killed Alice and asked the Will to save Gil and him and Gilbert doesn't care about what happened ? How did he get hurt like that anyway ? I wish we knew more about them. I felt like they were somehow important. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the character that really needed more airtime... Glen ? and probably, The Will. They tried to make us think.. 'those are the bad guys' without giving us any real answer as 'Why ?' and then.. 'Why not ?' Glen is the Bad guy. He made the Tragedy happen. We barely know why we barely know what happened between Jack and him. Why calling Jack a Hero ? He died without doing nothing... no ? \\n\\n\r\nI've read somewhere someone saying the Pandora Hearts has the best character development and all. Makes my day. I would have believe it but... The Ending rushed thing for the Character also and makes me still wonder stuff about them so no... The Character are incomplete as well.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore... \\n\r\nCHARACTER:: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Pandora Hearts ?... I did. Yes. I did. I was hooked. Every episode, I told myself that's the Last One for today and I still watched another one after ! Yes, I enjoyed it but as I was reaching the End, somehow... I wasn't that interested in it anymore. I would still recommend it... and I will probably add the Manga to my 'I want to read that..' List for some other time.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore... \\n\r\nENJOYMENT:: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever... The Rushed and Lame ending force me to throw...\\n\r\nOVERALL:: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I had expectation too high on the ending and got disappointed by my own fault... \\n\r\nWho knows !",

            "content": "Every now and then you come across an anime with all the right tools for success but ends up having to fight an uphill battle against unfortunate surrounding factors. Take a manga that's nowhere near complete, hand it off to a studio with an unimpressive track record, and what do you get? Well, honestly now that I think about it, a lot of adaptations of manga/LNs/VNs fit this criterion, but today I'll be highlighting yet another unfortunate case in Pandora Hearts. An anime with a compelling backdrop but not a clue as to how to handle it in the long run. Whilst the show mayhave come out half-baked, I'd be remiss to leave out mention of its solid foundation\\n\\n\r\nThe world Pandora Hearts presents within its 25 episode run is one that makes no qualms in making parallels with Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland primarily. It plays with various concepts and names from famous fairy tales and ghost stories as well. The story of Pandora Hearts is an interesting attempt at mixing of fantasy, action, horror, mystery, and comedy.The plot unfurls a tale spanning a century revolving around an event known as \"Tragedy of Sabrie\". More often than not, plot advancement comes from looking back at these events and seeing what each shocking revelation does to each character and their resolve to move forward. That said as far as titles labeled the \"shounen\" tag go, Pandora Hearts is rather slow and it's very obvious that providing exhilarating action is not top priority here. After a while, it becomes clear the story prefers to flesh out elements of the setting and the central mystery as opposed to providing fight scenes in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow pace isn't something I'd wholly chalk up to the lack of immediately epic plotting however and that's where on of the major failings of the plot lies. Most of the show's major revelations are shoved into 1-2 episode events that are sandwiched between....not really all that much. There're some pretty lengthy stretches here in there that ended up being filled with very trite, very anime-typical comedy which did nothing for me. Comedic timing is also a foreign concept to Pandora Hearts for the most part as the characters often make random \"funny\" quips during otherwise serious dialogue exchanges. The meat can be pretty delicious here, but there's way too much fat I found unpalatable. This problem also makes it so that the plot-twists are unevenly spaced out. You get a collection of perspective-changing developments in one episode, none for a fair stretch of time, and then yet another cluster of twists. Episodes 21 and 22, in particular, end up being rather dizzying as a result of this. An unfortunate side-effect of the plot developments in Pandora Hearts is that they give rise to many, many questions and character arcs that no series of just 25 episodes is capable of handling properly. Being an adaptation of an incomplete monthly series that presumably didn't sell well enough to warrant a second, this was to be expected. What can't be excused, however, is how poorly thought out final episodes were. The anime sticks with the storyline of its parent manga with blind faith until the last three episodes come along and it becomes clear that the story is nowhere near a satisfying stopping point. This, of course, resulted in the anime attempting to create its own ending and it completely betrays the efforts the show had put into all of it's interesting variables by barely addressing any of them. I'm not really a manga purist, so I say that script-writers should feel free to inject their own ideas into an adaptation though they should do it under one of 2 conditions.\\n\\n\r\n1. Make it their own pet-project of sorts early on. This is undoubtedly very difficult to do as it means not only making a different ending but giving the story a different narrative purpose. Go out on a limb and change not just the ending, but the entire 2nd half or something. Make it so it has a different set of ideas or themes as well so that the adaptation can be viewed as its own thing that can even be preferred over the source rather than just a shittier version of the source with a conclusion that seems to have been cobbled together at the last minute. Examples: Fullmetal Alchemist, Bokurano, Planetes, and Gankutsuou\\n\\n\r\nOr....\\n\\n\r\n2. Make sure that the added content doesn't conflict with conflict with the main canon so as to effectively close off all hope for a sequel. Example: Noragami and the 1st season of Knights of Sidonia, which both ended with climaxes that weren't in the original manga nor did they make it impossible for a sequel to happen without major retcons.\\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts opts for neither of these options and goes for an ending that not only plays around with the established canon but is also inconclusive. For those of you who've seen Claymore, think of that title's finale, but with even more unanswered questions and a much more rushed anticlimax (yes it's that lame).\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the actual cast goes. they do manage to get fleshed out to a remarkable degree. For the most part, however, the series banks on the character arc of Oz Vessalius (the protagonist) to a point at which actually becomes a bit of a detriment. The writers seem to have a hard-on for exploiting his emotional trauma for all it's worth. And for what? To have Oz angst and fret, and then eventually man up a little and say that he'll make a change for the better. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well, the thing is his development is cyclical, as in it resets from time to time. We see him fluctuate from emotional highs to lows several times over in the same way and it ends up becoming a tad repetitious. That said he's far from what I'd call a bad character exactly. The characters Oz meets on his journey never encourage him to develop into an unstoppable badass (he's actually quite weak physically throughout) so much as they challenge his value system. He eventually realizes the problems that lie with his childish heroics. It's a shame that his more introspective moments of sadness were far too numerous and lengthy for the simple points they got across.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, in particular, do develop a fair bit in the present, but I'd be lying If I said it wasn't more interesting to see how they ended up becoming who they are. I'm not normally a fan of using flashbacks excessively, but given how all the important clues to the central mystery lie in the past, I can allow Pandora Hearts some lee-way. There really isn't any going further without taking a good long look back. Because of this, I can't say the characters \"develop\" as much as you might like to hear that, but the main cast (Oz, Alice, Gilbert, and Break) is made up of individuals that you can fully understand and sympathize with. Alice, herself is a pretty simple tsundere type through and through though unlike others of her type she doesn't really exude arrogance to mask weakness as she's strong as hell. Her simplistic nature and arrogance come from the fact that she lacks her memory of the traumatic events of a time long before her meeting with Oz. Not the most original character, but as an epicenter to the grand mystery she doesn't detract much from the series. There really isn't all that much to say about the characters besides looking at how they are built up, because it's actually difficult to talk about them without spoiling key plot twists (and trust me there are a lot of key plot-twists) once we finally have a strong grasp on the main players, the show comes to it's abrupt ending.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, there's no escaping the fact that the series doesn't really deliver. Sure the series has neat set-pieces, but excessively drab, dark and grainy color palette doesn't do them much favor. There's also this odd, blurry filter blurs the outlines of objects in the foreground that I found distracting. The fight scenes are also not up to par as they lack inspired choreography tactics and overall direction. Audio-wise, Pandora Hearts holds up just fine. Whilst not the best I've heard of her work, Yuki Kajiura's score does a fine job of picking up some of the slack during the slower moments and mediocre fight scenes. This track in particular that's used whenever Alice is going all out against a foe is typically better then everything happening onscreen. Kajiura's tendency towards pieces with moody melancholic chants fits a morose title like this one to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame that with as much momentum Pandora Hearts was gaining that it had to succumb not only to its own shortcomings but to the same fate as many adaptations of many monthly manga before it. As it is, watching Pandora Hearts is akin to piecing together a vast jigsaw puzzle, only to discover that half the pieces are missing towards the end. There's not much waiting at the end of this rabbit hole.",

            "content": "Next time you pick up an anime to watch, beware! \r\nThe curse of the unfinished manga may be in it. \r\nTo be quite honest, if the only mistake of Pandora Hearts was having an open ending due to the manga not being finished I wouldn't have given such a low rating to it. Let's just say that the open (and bad) ending was the cherry on the top. \r\n\tOz Bezarius, son of a nobleman is about to come of age and thus, a ceremony to celebrate this fact will be held in a mansion that hides many secrets behind it. While exploring outsidethe place, Oz starts to see, in his mind, a disturbed girl who is in a room full of toys. Still confused about what he saw, the young man returns to the mansion and the ritual starts. When the ceremony is about to finish, Oz finds himself  surrounded by mysterious people who want to send him to the Abyss, a place said to be a prison in where creatures called Chains will take the bad guys to places from which they can't escape. \\n\r\n\tThe boy ends up being sent to the Abyss and there he meets with the girl he saw before. He finds out that her name is Alice, a Chain and she tells him she is the only way for him to get out of that cursed place. In order to do that he needs to seal a contract which consists on lending his body to the Chain. Oz agrees to it and together with Alice, the Black Rabbit, they leave the Abyss only to find themselves 10 years in the future in front of three people who were just about to go rescue him. \\n\r\n\tSharon, Xerxes Break and Raven work for Pandora, a group of people who hunts wild Chains and Chains that have signed a contract with humans (called Illegal Contractors). Upon finding out that Oz made a deal with B-Rabbit they decide to take them to Pandora's Headquarters. Before they can do that, however, they are attacked by a Chain and are saved by Alice. The girl then, reveals that she only wants to find her lost memories that are shattered throughout the world. Believing that these memories might be related to a tragedy that took place 100 years ago, Alice and Oz are sent in a journey to find out more about Alice's past. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhile this sounds promising, as far as story goes, very little happens after this. And this basically summarizes the 4 first episodes. After that we have very little development overall. Lots of episodes are filled with information, that in the end turns up useless. If the story wouldn't be finished in the anime anyway then it might as well have been compressed into 12 or 13 episodes. Watching 25 episodes only to get nothing in the end gave out a feeling of a huge waste of time. \\n\\n\r\n\tThere are some good points to the series, however. The problem is that they walk hand in hand with counterpoints. The main characters are well developed, even though the feeling I had was that they were developed to no purpose in the end. The soundtrack is from Kajiura Yuki, which is enough to know that we aren't dealing with crappy stuff here. Unfortunately, Kajiura's excellence was put to a bad use. The songs are repetitive and used in wrong moments, showing that more important than a good composition is a good sound direction. The art ranges from beautiful to average and even the many references to Alice in the Wonderland present in the show add up for nothing.  \\n\\n\r\n\tUp to a point it was enjoyable watching Pandora Hearts, but as the end drew closer and nothing happened to help clarify the main points I felt kinda annoyed for having watched it at all. The lack of respect from the studios is becoming chronic and Pandora Hearts ends up being another anime on an already overcrowded list with shows that could have been something but turns out average due to bad production.",

It's from Square Enix, and they make the whole scene really amazing. Let's relate it to some games, ..like, kingdom hearts, a boy lost in his way? To tell the truth, this is the first time I've ever seen related to that game, that's why I like to watch it over and over again. Even though I didn't finish it yet since it's still airing, I know the left episodes for the viewers to watch will be moreinspiring episodes. I've also read its manga itself. Of course, the scenes shall be the same, except from the animations of course. And I am telling you; this series shall be very great with lots of episodes and seasons to come, this is adventure and fantasy!",

            "content": "When you lose everything and end up with nothing, how do you pick yourself up and move on? Do you lash out in anger and bitterness, hiding your wounds? Do you allow the emptiness inside you to shut out any emotional reaction, numbly accepting your fate? Do you desperately search everywhere for what remains of you, hoping to piece yourself back together? Or do you fear losing again so much that you spend all your time protecting what you already have, nearly crushing it in your tight grasp?\r\nWith each of these suggestions, I refer to a particular character in the story whose struggle with lossreflects one of these patterns. This theme of loss and the struggle to regain or find acceptance is by no means a new one to either drama or anime/manga, but in Pandora Hearts it is approached in a sensitive, original, and surprisingly light-hearted, pleasing manner. Though emotionally gripping, Pandora Hearts is rarely dark and angsty, favouring quirky, likeable characters and a humourous, tongue-in-cheek storytelling style.\\n\\n\r\nOverview\\n\r\nThe XEBEC-produced art/animation quality may be somewhat lacking, but the irresistibly charming Pandora Hearts is sure to make you fall in love with its beautifully crafted story, characters, fantasy world, and music.\\n\\n\r\nPros:  \\n\r\n-\tmost loveable, original and well-developed cast I\u2019ve seen in a long time\\n\r\n-\tdetailed, interesting \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-themed world\\n\r\n-\tstory contains few \u201cfiller\u201d episodes and is perfectly paced, sure to leave you gasping for more\\n\r\n-\temotional, memorable OST by .hack//SIGN & Noir (and many more) composer Yuki Kajiura\\n\r\n-\tone of those anime that has a bit of everything: drama, action, humour, even hints of romance\\n\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n-\tsub-par art quality, rather unacceptable by today\u2019s standards\\n\r\n-\tweak, disappointing ending; many story threads left hanging without resolution\\n\r\n-\tsome unavoidably clich\u00e9 moments and a protagonist who is often ineffectual and, worse, annoying in his willingness to lay down his life\\n\r\n-\tno clear antagonist in the story, though this isn\u2019t really a problem until the very last episodes\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\r\n15-year old Oz Vessalius is the typical spoiled selfish noble kid, playing pranks all day, teasing his servant and best friend Gilbert, gaining favours from his indulgent uncle Oscar. Then, on the night of his coming-of-age-ceremony, time freezes and Oz is forced into the Abyss by mysterious strangers. Trapped in this nightmarish alternate dimension, he meets a strange, devilish young girl named Alice, who is really a Chain (a sort of \u201cmonster\u201d of the Abyss). They form a Contract: Alice decides to help Oz return to his world, while he promises to search for her missing memories. As they find out more about her, it turns out there\u2019s a lot he doesn\u2019t know about the past either\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a somewhat well-worn path \u2013 disaster befalls na\u00efve youngster, he meets mysterious girl, they discover new things, make friends and beat bad guys \u2013 but the difference is that the characters who fill all the traditional roles are so original and interesting. Alice, as the heroine of the story, is refreshingly powerful and strong-willed, with a bad mouth, a meat fetish, and a wicked laugh  \u2013 and a surprising sensitivity. Oz, on the other hand, is earnest and soft-hearted, though he oddly doesn\u2019t seem to care too strongly about anything.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also plenty of mysteries to be solved and plot twists to be revealed. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that the plot is the anime\u2019s strongest point. Not quite. Most of the \u201cplot\u201d really has little to do with the present situation at hand and is more about exploring the characters\u2019 pasts. In fact, almost all of the really interesting moments in the anime are actually revelations about the past. As you might expect, all this jumping back and forth between past and present, real and alternate dimensions, while fascinating, can leave one confused and overwhelmed. Lastly, I can\u2019t neglect the fact that the ending is truly dismal. Like many anime (it seems), a promising beginning, middle and even climax is no guarantee of a satisfying ending. When you reach the final episode I\u2019m sure you, too, will be thinking, \u201cWhat? They can't leave it at that - there must be some mistake!!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10) \\n\r\nThere\u2019s no way Pandora Hearts gets anything less than full score on this one. The characters are simply enrapturing. It\u2019s hard to pick a favourite because there are so many good choices! For starters, the designs are original, enticing, and complement the characters\u2019 personalities well. Oz, despite being 15, has the vacant, vulnerable look of a younger boy, suggesting his innocence and fragility. Alice looks fiery and ferocious with her red jacket, demonically pointy hair, and long high-heeled boots; but her short stature and smooth, childlike features render her cute and approachable. Gilbert is astonishingly handsome, dark, and mysterious when he first appears as Raven in full black attire; as soon as his hat comes off, however, (so to speak) he becomes comical with his messy \u201cseaweed\u201d hair, his emotional tantrums, and his self-conscious cigarettes. Two other characters I feel deserve special mention: Xerxes Break, a silly yet understatedly dangerous character whose loose sleeves flop over his hands, whose smile is always shaped unnervingly into a V, and who wears a freaky rattling puppet-doll on his shoulder called Emily; and Vincent Nightray, who has two different-colored eyes, one yellow and one red, as if to represent his unpredictable, split personality (at times saccharinely sweet; at others cold-bloodedly cruel and deceptive).\\n\\n\r\nEach character is quirky, with multiple sides to their personality. Oz occasionally shows a hyper-romantic, flirtatious side. Alice, as mentioned earlier, will do anything for meat. Gilbert has an incurable phobia of cats. Sharon, a girl who is older than she looks, likes young boys and seems to have a thing for Alice. Break is addicted to candy and other sweet things. Vincent is disturbingly obsessed with his brother. And so on. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters also have incredible chemistry together. Oz and Alice have this cute little \"You're my man-servant, do what I say!\" \"Hahaha, of course Alice! (but not really!)\" thing going on, with semi-romantic undertones. Oz and Gilbert, meanwhile, have an endearing \"master and servant\" relationship that's complicated by the fact that Gilbert looks (and is) much older than his \"master\" (and made hilarious by the fact that Oz can still get away with teasing him.) Naturally, Gil and Alice find themselves caught in a struggle for the affections of their master/man-servant Oz, hurling funny names at each other that soon become familiar (\"Stupid rabbit!\" \"Seaweed hair!\") - though when it comes to Break, they are united in their icy distrust of the slippery, duplicitous character.\\n\\n\r\nThe true strength of the characters lies in their multi-facetedness. No character in the main cast feels \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad.\u201d For much of the story, there is even no clear antagonist, as each suspicious individual is shown one by one to be pure-hearted in some way. Somehow, the anime hardly suffers for this lack of \u201ctrue evil,\u201d which I view as a testament to the strength of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character development, the entire anime basically revolves around the characters\u2019 individual backstories. There is nary a character in the main cast who we do not see some kind of flashback of. In a way, the characters\u2019 pasts define who they are even more distinctly than the present action. Strangely, I found this worked very well, leading one to speculate fascinatingly about what must have happened before the main story. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (6/10)\\n\r\nBy today\u2019s standards, as well as the standards set by the rest of the anime, the art really sticks out like a sore thumb. And let me get this clear that I don\u2019t in any way mean Jun Mochizuki\u2019s original designs; I\u2019m talking about the frame-by-frame art quality of the anime, which was produced by studio XEBEC. Compared to contemporaries in the same genre that I\u2019ve been watching such as Kuroshitsuji and Nabari no Ou, the art and animation really has a lot of catching up to do. Unpolished, often with very unappealing colour palettes, and few extremely eye-catching or original backdrops, I wondered frequently why they could not have done this beautiful story justice with a higher budget. Without the charms of Mochizuki\u2019s character designs, the art would nearly render this anime unwatchable. The opening of an anime should be its one greatest chance to dazzle and woo the audience with flashy, high-budget sequences; yet Pandora Hearts is one of the only good anime I\u2019ve watched where the quality of the opening animation failed to impress me at all. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a beautifully conceived opening with wonderful music and fascinating visuals, but the animation itself is little beyond lacklustre.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Voice Acting (9/10)\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura\u2019s work truly is beautiful. It\u2019s hard to say anything bad about it. When it comes to emotional drama, suspenseful themes, heart-wrenching themes, and tragic themes, she is the master. Her English-language insert piece, \"Everytime you kissed me,\" is a thorough success, and the ubiquitous \"music box\" theme she created for Pandora Hearts, \"Lacie,\" is hauntingly memorable. But I can be nit-picky. The themes can get slightly repetitive and, if you\u2019ve heard her previous work, it'll probably feel a little deja vu. The endings and opening, while excellent, are not extraordinarily exceptional. In the end, the one point I knocked off comes down to the music not being extremely original, just very good.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing really left to be desired from the Japanese voice acting. Everything is just as it should be. The boyish, suave Junko Minagawa (Ryoma Echizen , Ritsuka Aoyagi) is the perfect choice as Oz, while listening to Kosuke Toriumi (Yuri Lowell, Kiba Inuzuka)\u2019s sexy voice as Gilbert is like eating chocolate ice cream, and Akira Ishida (Gaara, Kaworu Nagisa, Athrun Zala, many others) does a spectacular job as the eccentric, foppish Break (and Emily!), as usual. In all respects, a very strong cast.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Pandora Hearts has its share of flaws, and probably won't please absolutely everyone (action fans, why are you still here?!), but once immersed in its lovely, charming little world, its intoxication is a very, very pleasant experience. (9/10)",

            "content": "I would just like to say that this is the very first anime I've given a 10 to without watching it in its entirety. I've always enjoyed twists on Alice in Wonderland and I love the darker genre of anime so needless to say Pandora Hearts drew me in right away. \r\nThe synopsis doesn't do the story justice. Imagine being 15 and having everything and then being sucked into a world that is similar to a broken toy box where the dolls try to eat you. Thats just what Oz Bezarius goes through on his coming of age ceremony on his birthday. I won't saymuch more or else I could spoil something, but trust me that the story is up to par.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was brilliant. It's hard for me to watch an anime with bad artwork so I try to choose those with characters that are pleasing to look at. The fight scenes and magic are also very well played in this anime. I think my only complaint is not with the art-work itself, but with the quality. Having to wait each week you take what you get and sometimes the colors/etc. look dull in the fan-subs.\\n\\n\r\nI love the music! This is one of the few anime that I just can't get enough of the opening theme. Parallel Hearts by Function Junction is awesome. If you have time look it up on YouTube...there are a lot of people who have done piano and accoustic versions of it that are just wonderful. I also really like the music box melody and just in general the music is great throughout. It presents the anime with a whimsical and yet forboding feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing. Theres something for everyone from the crazy and weird humored (Break) to the broody and mysterious (Raven) to the over-powered and short tempered girl (Alice) to the flirty kid who has a lot more pain hidden than you'd think (Oz) and even the girl that hardly talks but knows how to take down anyone (Echo). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall both get a perfect 10. This is probably the first anime in a long time that I just can't get enough of. Though the entire series isn't out yet after you watch a few episodes you'll be sitting on your computer each Saturday waiting for the next one to come out too!",

            "content": "Imagine your reality falling into pieces on your fifteenth birthday, pushed into a broken toy box and relentlessly pursued by people you barely know.\r\nPushed aside and left broken, do you accept death in the name of saving another's life, desperately looking for pieces of yourself to confirm your existence? Knowing nothing about yourself, wanting to find out, yet scared of finding out, how do you move on? How do you protect something you once lost, in fear of losing it again, suffocating it with your loyalty and inability to let it leave your sight?\r\nPandora Hearts explores the story of Oz Vessalius ( or Bezarius, asI'm used to ), a boy whose life is thrown into chaos on his fifteenth birthday, at his coming-of-ceremony. The anime, I'd say, has an overarching theme of loss and self-discovery.\\n\\n\r\nThe Abyss is a deep, dark place where sinners are dragged into-a place that Oz stopped believing in until he was thrown in. With the discovery of a pocket watch that sings a haunting tune, strange things begin happening and Oz meets a young girl called Alice, a Chain from the Abyss with the form of a black rabbit once her suppressed power is unleashed, who is searching for her lost memories.\\n\\n\r\nI won't reveal anymore. The whole charm of the anime is found in the characters and the past shrouded in mystery. Oz, Alice, and his faithful servant, Gilbert, begin their quest to search for pieces of memory that Alice is searching for.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, it looks like a normal anime. Questing for memories while defeating enemies but that's exactly where we're misled. The pieces of Alice's memory are intertwined with others', and for the most part, the plot involves flashbacks of the characters' pasts. One fragment only leads to more questions. Pandora Hearts' strongest point is its characters. The characters are never one-sided and they are so skilfully woven that we see begin to slowly see the flaws in them. Why does Oz accept everything so light-heartedly? Nothing seems to bother him at all but as we move on, we see a darkness emerge, once layered and locked away.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, the anime retains its timely comedy, providing a light-hearted adventure for the person watching. Alice and Gilbert are constantly fighting for Oz's attention, coming up with nicknames like \"Seaweed Head\" and \"Stupid rabbit\". Oz leaves them to their own antics, only to be unwillingly dragged in and pulled from both sides. Oz, disturbingly calm about everything, with a policy to accept everything as it is because anything can happen. He has also been shown with a tendency to flirt, much like his uncle.\\n\\n\r\nAlice, while meat-loving, sarcastic, tsundere-like and shows some signs of sadism, has a sweet and vulnerable side. Gilbert, while short-tempered and sensitive, is gentle and hold a fierce loyalty to Oz. The only time Alice and Gilbert cooperate with each other is when yet another interesting character, Xerxes Break slips in ( quite literally ). Break is one of those manipulative characters who believes in using others and being used. He also likes to pop out of the strangest places, but he, too, has a larger part than simply being a \"minor\" character. His mistress, Sharon, is a deceptively sweet-looking character who, in punishing Break, shows no hesitance.\\n\\n\r\nVincent Nightray, a man who, at times is, sweet while other times, scarily crazed and shows an alarming obsession for his older brother. Then, although he didn't have much screen time, Eliot Nightray and his attendant, Leo. Eliot was truly a crucial character who played a large part in Oz's development. There also some undertones of hinted romance but that doesn't play a large part.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes passed by too fast for me to realise that I was almost at the end. Oz, as a character, peels away the protective layers he had unconsciously wrapped around himself and slowly starts to face himself. He, Alice and Gilbert have grown undeniably closer and it's time to face past demons. The mystery behind what truly happened in the past is left as a question mark and in that aspect, I believe the anime could have ended off better.\\n\\n\r\nEven then, the plot did a great job. I'd say, honestly, it didn't feel like there was \"evil\" like in some anime, there's pointedly evil people who do the most horrible things. But in this, you slowly start to realise that things are not as they seem and that's exactly what makes this a classic watch. The plot wasn't perfect, I admit, there were certain clich\u00e9s but the idea of building something with pieces of memories and at the same time, building the characters' pasts solidly, they did a wonderful job. I did cry once, at that important part of Eliot and Oz's meeting.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the OSTs, they were perfect. I love Kajiura Yuki's music and using the English piece \"Everytime You Kissed Me\" by Emily Bindiger really raised the quality of the anime. The OST is one of the things that gave me goosebumps. One thing I had a problem with, though, is that it tended to become repetitive. At some point, I realised that the same OSTs were repeating and it didn't have as much impact as it should have. Even so, the OST really did help to make this a top-notch and haunting anime. The voice acting was great. There were times when it kind of slipped and you start to wonder if Oz's voice actor is a female but I think she did a really great job of voicing Oz. It was deceiving because I always thought it was a male ( except for those few times she had to scream ). The voice actors manage to bring out the feelings and the characters they are. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation appealed to me, but in today's standards, it hardly stands out. The animation, however, holds this certain fluidity and childishness in young characters, showing that, perhaps, the story isn't as deep as it seems and we shouldn't look too much into it. The animation remained smooth throughout so I don't think it was much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts is worth your time and effort. But I wouldn't say that it would appeal to all fans who might be more inclined to other genres. I really enjoyed it, hence the full score. It's still a great watch so give it a try!",

(sorry MAL this just had to be said don't worry I focus only on the anime from now on)\r\nPandora Hearts is a anime/manga that is completely unique, seriously I've read over 200 manga's (i haven't added them all to my list on this site btw) and searched through hundreds more to find one similar to this and I can't findone that matches the suspence, mystery, action, and down right awesomeness this anime offers. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that the first episode is kind of confusing. So many things are introduced that some people i guess, can't handle the new world that this anime introduces. But as the anime goes on you start wanting more, so many questions so little clues, and the answers you slowly get not only make your jaw drop to the floor, but add so many more questions that need to be answered. (seriously it makes you want to learn Japanese so you can watch the next episode that much sooner) This anime really sparks your curousity. The very characters in this anime seem to be a mystery all themselves, I mean the first line of the anime is \"Oz Bezarius, your sin is, your very existence\" and then you at home watching this think \"What the heck? That's just a kid, what could be so horrible about his existence that he is thrown into a prison for the worst criminals out there?\" And the questions don't end there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is, just like in the manga, so beautifully done it's like looking into a window of our own past. This world resembles one from the Victorian era in europe or later, with dukes, and kings, and parties more like balls, with castles and mansions so wonderous it makes you feel like you've gone make in time. The charaters of this story are also drawn fabulously with their very characteristics drawn into their beings. It doesn't take you long to remeber who's who in this anime. (which is a problem i've had in the past with other animes, and also having more characters with western names also helps!)\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is just great! Not only are the opening and closing themes catchy and memorable, the battle music and just any time music gives this anime a more present time sound and feel. The characters voices match the characters themselves perfectly and are not annoying in anyway,(i hate when characters have annoying voices they are a total turn off) even the chains (creatures of the Abyss/monsters) voices sound match them perfectly.   \\n\\n\r\nI'm trying my best not to spoil anything about the characters so I'm only saying their charateeristics, but if you feel like I spoiled something for you I deeply apologize. \\n\r\nOz Bezarius- fifteen years old and future duke of the Bezarius household. He's kind of childish, for a boy who is now having his coming-of-age ceremony. He trust others easily and cares about others a bit to much and maybe doesn't care enough for himself. He loves his little sister Ada and loves to tease his servant/friend gil who is one year younger than him. He is very kind but his mysterious past gives him a bit of a dark side. He is a character who you easily love and is the \"hero\" of this story. \\n\r\nGil- Oz's most loyal servant and friend. He tries his best in all things he does and is deeply ashamed of his failures. His biggest fear is cats and helps Oz get away from his duties and play around and explore.\\n\r\nAlice- the mysterious chain whose true form looks so human that you tend to forget that she isn't. Her other names include: Bea Rabbit, black rabbit, and most famously The Blood stained Black Rabbit. Her power is unlike any other chain. She is a girl who speaks her mind and doesn't let Oz forget that he is her servant and should feel honoured that he is contracted with her. Her favourite foods include meat, meat and more meat and to her the world is her playground. Her past in one of the main points and mystery of this  story and what her memories hold are the answers to many questions.\\n\r\nSharon- a seemingly young girl who Oz meets at his coming of age ceremony. Her cute mannerism and charming smile make you believe she is no one of importance, but her warning she leaves Oz with makes you wonder who in the world is she?\\n\r\nBreak- a strange man with a doll on hisleft shoulder named Emily. He is Sharon's servant, who's odd manner makes him more than meets the eye.\\n\r\nThis is just a few of the character's in this story but they are the ones I feel are most necessary to know about before watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review is pretty long (not inteaded) but I hope I have given you a better idea about how amazing and unique this anime is. (i mean i like unique things right?) And if you are not satisfied or this review doesn't help you i deeply apologize. But if you want more and are not satified with the 8 (soon 9) episodes available. I highly recommend the manga and if you want more then just the 17 chapters available in english, message me about the next twenty chapters where I can tell you where the raws and their english translations are. Again I highly recommend this anime I know the more popular it is the sooner an english dub will be made.",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts is a prime example of wasted potential. It starts out with an interesting premise that grabs you at the start, but after a few episodes, it\u2019s nothing but downhill from there until it finally crashes and burns at the end of its 25-episode run.\r\nWhy do I say this?\r\nThere are many interesting plot threads and ideas that are introduced at various points in the story, but they are almost never followed through with or they\u2019re executed in a way that, frankly, makes them boring. For example, when we learn about the four dukedoms of Pandora, I get the sense that there\u2019s a lot ofhistory and political machinations going on in the background but it hardly ever gets explored, instead focusing on the development of our main heroes, Oz and Alice (which doesn\u2019t sound that bad, but more on that later). Then, we are introduced to the main antagonists, the Baskervilles, who seem really cool and threatening at first, but when we meet them, are like Team Rocket without the silly speeches. In other words, they\u2019re there just to have antagonists in the show and don't do a whole lot to further the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe cherry on top was the notably craptastic anime-only ending. I have never even read the manga and I could tell the ending was shoddily put together at the last minute, just to have some sort of conclusion, but honestly, I\u2019d rather have an open ending over what they did here. For fear of being too spoilery, I will just say that the writers thought to throw in a bunch of generic Chains to provide some sort of \u201cultimate challenge\u201d for the protagonists, but as a result, it comes off as completely random and badly-written.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s move on to the protagonists beginning with Oz. Oz is a lovely young fellow \u2013 cheerful, caring, loyal, and brave. However, he\u2019s apathetic, taking everything in stride even when he\u2019s faced with some terrible Chains in the Abyss. It\u2019s completely unrealistic and makes it hard for anyone to connect with him. How can you care about a character who, well, doesn\u2019t care? To his credit, he does get some character development but it either never follows through (e.g. his father issues) or it takes the form of someone lecturing him (this is probably more the fault of the writers than an actual character flaw, though).\\n\\n\r\nThen, there\u2019s Alice, Pandora Heart\u2019s main tsundere. She doesn\u2019t end up being nearly as interesting as she first presents herself to be, although her little quirks make her more endearing than Oz, such as her insistence that Oz is her manservant and her fondness for meat (LOL since when does a rabbit like meat so much?). Still, I\u2019m afraid to say she doesn\u2019t have much depth to her, the most being her desire to regain all the fragments of her memory. The rest of the time, she\u2019s relegated to being a source of humour and/or romantic tension with Oz or, in her B-Rabbit form, being the series own deus ex machina.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some notable characters \u2013 namely Gil, Break, and Vincent \u2013 who receive some notable time and developing on top of interesting histories and colourful personalities, but they\u2019re supporting characters who must eventually step back to let the main plot take center stage.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, overall, it\u2019s poor. There are some nice designs floating around, but when it comes down to making everything move, it\u2019s lacking, especially for such a recent and (relatively) short series. I\u2019ve seen longer and older series with equal or better animation, to be honest. I swear, I have never seen so much floating hair and clothes in anime in my life \u2013 it was like a gust of wind went by and the animators simply took a single frame from that and kept it for the entire sequence while keeping the mouths moving. Even in the opening sequence (which are nearly always of high quality), there\u2019s a shot of Oz running that looks odd and clunky.\\n\\n\r\nMost reviews will also point out the lovely music, but then it\u2019s by Kajiura Yuki, so that\u2019s a given. If you\u2019ve heard Kajiura\u2019s music before, you\u2019ll recognize her style almost immediately, so whether that\u2019s a positive or a negative is up to you. For me, it\u2019s generally a positive since she pulls through with another solid soundtrack, but personally, I\u2019d like to see her try something different from what she usually composes. For Pandora Heart\u2019s purposes, though, it\u2019s good listening material here, although certain tracks tend to get overplayed. Voice acting was pretty solid, so no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Pandora Hearts began as a very promising series with a lot of great ideas that could have continued being great until the end if executed properly. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t happen and the series falls flat on its face by the halfway point. I would say either read the manga (which I\u2019m told is better?) or find another fantasy series.",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts is an anime that draws inspiration and many thematic elements from the story Alice in Wonderland.   It is about a young aristocrat named Oz Bezarius, the heir of a noble house, who becomes the victim of a dark ceremony in the first episode and is cast down into the \"Abyss\" - a prison like area inhabited by monsters called Chains.  While there, he meets the Chain known as Alice, the Black Rabbit.\r\nThe show starts out incredibly strong, but its strength doesn't last long at all.  The overlying problem with the show is that it doesn't seem to know whatdirection it wants to go in.  You are initially presented with a dark and gothic horror that almost immediately makes way for super deformed art and bright, flashing colours.  The show remains this way, tying together ridiculous anime tropes and scenes right next to its dark and gritty storyline.  Alice quickly moves from a creepy and dangerous entity to a glutton and comic relief character.  I think a bit more focus in either area would have been fantastic, but as it is Pandora Hearts can be disorientating and very dissonant.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great.  Oz is a typical shounen lead, complete with a tendency to risk himself for others that borders on suicidal.  It's quite stereotypical, but not to the point that I hated whenever he appeared on screen, and he at least presented himself in this honest way for the majority of the show.  However the other characters are fantastic.  Gilbert is written extremely well and undergoes a lot of development throughout the show, and Xerxes Break eventually ends up as a complete scene stealer as soon as he is given even a hint of his backstory.  Alice, however, never quite moves past her brutal introduction and despite being the center of the entire story she quickly fades in and out of obscurity for episodes at a time.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack from Yuki Kajiura is extremely strong, and has several pieces that match up to her great scores from Kara no Kyoukai.  Some tracks are often described as repetitive, but I had no issue with this myself.  I do think that a couple of times a song choice for a scene may have been less then amazing, but the music itself was very good.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads me to the ending - there are massive plot points that never get resolved and I wish I had known that going in.  For such a great premise and beginning so many things slip away through the story that it is really kind of infuriating.  The ending of the series is anime only, and like many other poor anime adaption endings you will be able to pick up the exact moment where the story veers off.  Anime only ends can be done right - but this one wasn't.  Nothing was answered, and the mysteries that Oz and Alice often mentioned resolving were simply ignored until the end.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the biggest shame is how much more could have been fit into 25 episodes, where instead the writers wasted absurd amounts of time with super deformed art and typical anime filler scenarios.  There are many plot points that are deemed as important to the main characters that never go anywhere and end up being a complete waste of screen time. The most infuriating part comes towards the end of the show, where you should be spending your time getting your answers to the questions you've built up, an entire episode is instead spent on showing everybody drunk.  Put simply I kind of wish the series had cut some of the bullshit, a lot of the comedy moments were poor and completely out of place.  \\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts is a fun ride and there are some FANTASTIC moments, but ultimately your destination ends up being a hole in the ground that goes straight to the Abyss of Anime-Ending-Only Hell.  There are no side trips to Resolution or Answers, you just go straight into the pit.  And since I've already visited, I'll try to warn you not to.",

            "content": "Oh Pandora Hearts, how you have let me down.\r\nI'm kicking off this review by saying that I didn't watch this at anyone's request. A friend of mine mentioned watching it in passing and with nothing else to go on I threw myself headfirst into it.\r\nPandora Hearts had potential which is a downright shame because it wasted it by veering off into \"nothing-is-explained land.\"\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe initial premise was awesome. Dark, horrific, desperate. A lot of the story elements in Pandora Hearts are drawn from Alice in Wonderland and twisted into darker themes. The basic premise is that Oz Vessalius, a spoiled rich kid, is thrown intothe Abyss which is basically hell. Oz is forced to make a contract with a Chain called Alice to escape from the Abyss, and is captured by the mysterious organization Pandora upon his return.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the serious themes mostly stop there. Much of the plot is wasted on comedy which is unsuccessfully placed next to a story attempting to also be serious, leading to the comedy ruining the mood countless times. I cringed so much, because they'd have a great scene going and then wreck it with jokes that usually weren't funny anyway.\\n\r\nThere was also great potential in Oz's contract. He has a brand of a clock on his chest and when the hand makes a full rotation, he will die. But this never comes into effect during the show. Pandora Hearts ends with the hand on Oz's clock only having made two moves during the entire show. Since this anime ended up different from the manga in its final episodes, the writers could easily have made the clock move more and more and end with Oz's death or the hand making its final turn. In the beginning of the show, Oz and Gilbert were obsessed with trying to find a way to negate Oz's contract so that he wouldn't die, but this issue is abandoned soon enough and never comes into play again.\\n\r\nPandora Hearts also wasted too much time developing its characters. Now, this normally isn't a bad thing, but it's detrimental when you have a 25-episode anime with no chance of a second season and you instead spend all the time on characters' backstories, letting the plot take a backseat; because the result is well-developed characters that get an abrupt end. The show almost seems to me as if the makers were following the manga all the way through, then abruptly realized they were at 24 out of 25 episodes and were like \"Oh shit guess we better wrap this up.\" That's pretty lazy writing, especially considering manga doesn't have a set amount of chapters when it starts being made, while anime is only licensed for a certain amount of episodes at a time. The point I'm trying to make here is that the manga could afford to spend a lot of time developing the characters and bring the story back later, while the anime can't really do that. Even if Pandora Hearts had gotten a second season, I know from experience that not as many people watch the second season of a show. So spending all your time on characters and pretty much abandoning the plot is a poor choice.\\n\r\nAnother issue I had with the story is that it's chugging along, and then shortly before the ending (episode 20 to be exact), there is an absolutely pointless filler episode where Alice gets drunk and a lot of \"comedic\" nonsense takes place. I was watching this and fuming that they wasted a whole episode on essentially nothing happening. Filler episodes are marginally more acceptable in the beginning of the show, but certainly not at the end.\\n\r\nBecause of this poor choice of pacing, the last episode is a terrible ending. It doesn't even have a \"last episode\" feel to it. It starts out like a typical episode and there's even more of that mood-ruining comedy. Then the story reaches its (pretty boring) climax and it's over halfway through the episode. The rest of the episode is just the characters doing stuff. They even played the regular opening and ending themes during the last episode, which I have come to be greatly annoyed by because it makes it seem like any other episode. Using the opening theme in the last episode is generally more acceptable to me than using the ending theme.\\n\r\nSo many questions that were built up in the early episodes are completely abandoned. At the very least they could have attempted to answer some of them.\\n\r\nThe issues with the story basically all boil down to better planning. The story couldn't figure out which way it wanted to go, leading to multiple confusing moments. The character development could have been placed so as to cause minimal slowdown issues. Questions could have been answered effectively if the writers had looked up and realized a wall was right ahead and they were driving into it.\\n\r\nAll in all, Pandora Hearts had great potential for a dark show that was wasted time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nPandora Hearts was made by a fairly new studio, so the art and animation aren't too great, but they're not particularly bad either. They were pretty average.\\n\r\nThe only issue I had with it was the use of fanservice which I thought was pretty poorly placed and unnecessary (then again, fanservice is rarely necessary. But in this story it didn't seem appropriate at all).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nHot damn do I love the OST of this show. Yuki Kaijura, who also did the soundtrack for Madoka Magica, does not disappoint. The OST is gorgeous and orchestral and really fits the dark theme they were originally trying for. You might say I'm biased because I'm a sucker for minor-key orchestral songs, but the soundtrack of this show is really very good. I especially love the watch's music box-esque theme and how they would play it at the very end of each episode.\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Parallel Hearts, is badass as hell (though I do wish they had changed it when they changed the ending song because using the same opening while not changing the ending gets pretty old), and the first ending song, Catcher in the Maze, is really pretty and awesome and I especially love the full version. I didn't really like the second ending though, and in my opinion they should have switched the two ending songs, or just not changed the ending song at all.\\n\r\nI also really love the insert song, \"Every Time You Kissed Me,\" performed by Emily Bindiger, that was played during the final episode. I think it's a really subtle and nice touch that the key of the song and the music for it is built around the watch's theme. I also like how they got an American singer to perform the song, rather than a Japanese person singing in English (I'm looking at you, second Future Diary OP).\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting, long story short this anime will never get a dub (aside from fandubs), so I watched it subbed. Even though I don't consider myself to be a good judge of Japanese voice acting, I thought the voices in this show were amazing. Oz's voice actress in particular blew me away because I couldn't make up my mind whether it was a man or a woman until I looked it up and discovered that a woman was voicing him.\\n\r\nOz's voice was the particular standout, but I thought all around the voice acting was really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nAs I said before, most of the screentime of this show was given to developing the characters and explaining their backstories. I think Gilbert especially got a lot of really good character development going on for him. In addition, once Xerxes Break's backstory is explained, he goes from being the ambiguous, quirky trickster to a really interesting character.\\n\r\nI thought a lot of characters weren't explained, however. The white-haired version of Alice that keeps popping up throughout the show doesn't really get much of an explanation and while I do remember her purpose in the show, it wasn't fulfilled in my opinion. Also, Oz's sister, the Baskervilles, and the students at the academy (one of whom was playing the watch's song on the piano; names escape me) didn't get appropriate screentime to explain themselves.\\n\r\nAlso, even though Alice is my favorite character in Pandora Hearts, I do agree with someone else's review: the show didn't explore the potential Alice had to be a dark and crazy creature of the Abyss. Once she leaves the Abyss, her sly nature goes away and she's pretty much reduced to a gluttonous tsundere. And I think that's a downright shame considering she could have turned on Oz and Gilbert, or left them to pursue her own ambitions (Like getting her memories back. Could we have an explanation for why they weren't recovered by the end rather than just \"well we haven't had any luck with that oh well\").\\n\r\nI do like the hinted romance between Oz and Alice, and how it was left open for the viewer to decide if they wanted anything to happen or not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI took a break after watching the first seven or eight episodes, but quickly marathoned the rest of the show after reading an announcement that the site I was watching it on was shutting down. I probably would have taken my time with this show if I hadn't been worried about losing access, so even though I watched it fairly quickly, I was pretty reluctant.\\n\r\nAnd I've already mentioned my gripes with the mistimed comedy that resulted in glaring tone issues compared to the story attempting to be dark. That factors into the enjoyment score.\\n\r\nI also noticed a lot of parallels between this story and Fullmetal Alchemist (the manga and the 03 anime), which didn't help my enjoyment levels, since I enjoy FMA so much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nIt's kind of unfortunate that at one point in the show I was considering scoring it a 9, then it ended up as a 5 ultimately.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty shabby and the show leaves a lot of holes and hanging questions, but the characters were overall pretty solid and the music fantastic. So I'd recommend watching Pandora Hearts if you have spare time on your hands. It's not really a priority.",

            "content": "What gives people the strength to go on after they have fallen? What makes them strive for the perspective of a bright future? Seeking to answer those questions, \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d gives the impression of a charming, unique series that differs from its counterparts through adapting a popular scheme, but not entirely living off it. Why, then, is it nothing amazing in particular?\r\nSTORY (7)\r\nGood beginning. This series starts with really nicely developed foundations. It seems very promising; we get to know Oz Vessalius, your typical young hero-wannabe, but as soon as Alice shows up, things start getting interesting. Oz ends up in the twisted realm of\u201cAbyss\u201d, only to be saved by the mad rabbit, however nothing comes free of charge. And nothing is the same when he goes back to his world.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I ask: when and why did it go downhill? What happened to the fascinating, dark mood this show kept in the beginning? When did it become a clich\u00e9-filled sh\u00f4nen adventure with hardly any development overall? I had high hopes for the series and kept watching, expecting it to, I don\u2019t know, improve? It does, actually, get better right in the middle, where we finally receive some character development, the story progresses and most importantly \u2013 some of the most important questions are answered. But then it worsens yet again. The rest feels forced and the series stops at such a moment that it leaves you with huge disappointment. Why is it over so suddenly? It desperately calls for a continuation, it does.\\n\\n\r\nSetting, though, is where the series excels. True, this whole \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-hype might be getting a tad annoying, however \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d adapts the theme perfectly. It is a warped world, nevertheless it doesn\u2019t feel that sickly abstract. The \u201cChains\u201d are yet another embodiment of human fears \u2013 and so is the \u201cAbyss\u201d itself. It doesn\u2019t feel like the kind of place you would want to end up in, precisely. Watching a fantasy series set in such scenery feels just refreshing. The references to the original \u201cAlice\u201d are subtle and often misleading, which is also accomplished very well.\\n\\n\r\nART (7)\\n\r\nSomething is missing. The characters look wonderfully colourful and detailed at first, the surroundings are promising, but then the quality becomes an issue. With each episode, more and more flaws can be noticed. Even fight scenes tend to become dull, since those often follow the pattern of slashing, cutting, slashing and a little bit more of slashing. The worst thing is, though, how the vividness and energy of characters is lost through a dull palette. Who, in the world, robbed those poor guys of their colours, making them look just boring? What appears pretty \u2013 the hair does, oh, and Sharon\u2019s dresses. Good job, but that\u2019s it. Why does Oz look even more boring than he actually is, I ask? The series has a completely washed-out look which pains me a lot, since I was really looking forward to enjoying the graphics. (Apparently, the quality in the few special episodes outruns the TV animation a lot. Too bad it was rushed, too bad.)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9)\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura does an outstanding job capturing the magic of the setting in \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d. The music itself is simply excellent and stands out in the series\u2019 overall look. It is charming, at other times has a mysterious tone to it, or dramatic, fitting well with what is going on the screen. Never exaggerated. Although the score might not appear anything exceptional in the beginning, the viewer soon begins to realise that it without it, the Victorian atmosphere couldn\u2019t be captured as good. The soundtrack is equally pleasant to the ear while not watching the show, too.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting is quite well-done. Junko Minagawa does a good job playing the part of Oz, Ayako Kawasumi is a fine Alice, and Ishida Akira excels as always in his role (even though the character himself is not very likable). The seiy\u00fb operate their voices perfectly, creating very emotionally-convincing cast and pretty much making up for the flaws of the characters themselves. Here, I can\u2019t complain.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending sequences are nothing special in this case. Cute songs go along with the animation (the first ending, in particular, is full of annoying spoilers, so watch out), however they are not notable enough to make one feel like spending that additional time watching both OP and ED. They simply don\u2019t get in the way.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5)\\n\r\nThis is exactly where the series\u2019 biggest weakness lies \u2013 its character cast which is particularly weak, boring and clich\u00e9. Starting from the main character, aforementioned Oz, it becomes extremely tiresome and the characters don\u2019t develop much. Oz is a good definition of a typical sh\u00f4nen main lead. He is brave, adventurous, protective of his friends and clumsy when it comes to love. He also has family issues to make him more of a dramatic rebel, and a whiner for a side-kick. Oz\u2019s actions throughout the series are easily predictable and more than often he falls into banal traumas, being the kind of person who wants to save the day, become a hero and protect his princess. Sorry, this might be going well with the story, but as a character Oz is a failure.\\n\\n\r\nGilbert is, fortunately, a different story. He changes a lot \u2013 his personality becomes completely unlike, save for a few specific features that are necessary for some progress in the story (no, his loyalty to Oz is NOT a plot device for fangirl issues). Contrary to the first male lead, he keeps calm and generally stays rather dependable, when it comes to satisfying the fans. His actions certainly aren\u2019t very surprising, as it all revolves around Oz anyway; but at least he did not make me want to murder someone whenever he appeared on the screen. Alas, one more thing must be brought up here as well, namely \u2013 Gilbert being a magnet for fans. No-one can deny his typically attractive traits (cold and introverted chain-smoker, sorry), but hey, haven\u2019t I already said something about stereotypes in this series?\\n\\n\r\nThe creation of Alice turns out to be a disappointment after a few episodes. She starts off as a madwoman, a crazy sadist who cares little about who or what she might destroy while immersing herself in bloody, vicious fights. But Alice is a tsundere character \u2013 and being a genuine tsundere in \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d, she can\u2019t possibly stay this way throughout the series. An attractive, moody glutton - which she ends as \u2013 obviously arouses the interest of others, and soon the relationship between her and Oz becomes a major problem in the story. Yes. Alice, the wild Chain who only has any regard for herself, is a crying little girl inside. I can\u2019t deny the charm of tsundere characters, but this just doesn\u2019t seem right.\\n\\n\r\nNo other character really deserves any special words of praise here, sadly. There\u2019s the hyped \u201cMad Hatter\u201d Break, a particularly annoying it\u2019s-a-secret type of pretty boy; a cast of supposedly evil manifestations of malevolence; and others who exist merely for the purpose of creating a background for the main leads. There are also Sharon and Jack who have the potential to make great characters, but are mostly neglected or idealised; there is a representative of the rare male tsundere specimen, Elliot. And there\u2019s Vincent who is much creepier than he would normally be supposed to. They all might seem colourful at first, however inside they are not as interesting as they appear.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (7)\\n\r\nTo be honest, this series is quite boring. All the big talk about how different and remarkable it is, and what I see is an average fantasy adventure with mediocre art and particularly annoying character cast. But it has potential \u2013 which had been wasted, unfortunately. If only the series developed in a different manner, maybe I would have been able to enjoy it more. For now, I can\u2019t say anything special about it. Felt as if I was rewatching something else, just another episode of already known series, and it really does not bring much into the genre. It certainly isn\u2019t bad, not at all, yet it\u2019s still nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7)\\n\r\nHaving complained a lot about the flaws in \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d, I still can\u2019t criticise the series as a whole. It has its drawbacks, just like any other show, and pluses; most notably the incredible atmosphere of a well-designed, interesting world. The one thing I simply don\u2019t understand is how overrated it is becoming \u2013 all because of the fuss made over new adaptations of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d which are now apparently inspiring people all over the world, while years ago it was still an eerie fairytale, more of a madman\u2019s dream. The new versions, however, go well with the tastes of nowadays\u2019 viewers who know what they want to see, but expect the shows to demonstrate a certain level of creativity and innovation as well. It kills those shows. \u201cPandora Hearts\u201d is such a series with much power and weak realisation - a great concept trapped in a mediocre, clich\u00e9-filled box.\\n",

            "content": "The Story:\r\nI rated the Story of Pandora Hearts a full 10 because the series simply has one of the most amazing stories i've seen so far in anime. The story is well written with multiple twists and the cliffhangers at the end of each episode really get you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next episode. The story also has some elements from Alice in Wonderland but they are all modified to fit the anime story. \r\nThe Art:\r\nPandora Hearts is drawn and animated quite well and i quite like the Victorian style of buildings and clothing. Still the animation is not evennearly perfect but has improved a bit from the first episode. Overall the art is good but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice actors and soundtrack to this anime are well picked and fit very well. I would've given it a 10 as well but the new ending theme let me down a bit, it does not fit the quite dark theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIf you like Alice in Wonderland you will find some familiar characters in Pandora Hearts such as the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat. Even though they are not like in the original book, they still share some personality traits with their original counterparts. The main characters and their relationships have been well designed as well, i'm sure there's pretty much all character types in this anime from tsundere to the silent, emotionless type.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBecause of mystery surrounding this series and the exciting twists i really enjoy Pandora Hearts very much. I've not been disappointed with any of the episodes so far and it just seems to get better all the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDespite a few minor mistakes, this anime is one of the best, if not THE best anime series this year. Not all people are going to enjoy Pandora Hearts but i sure do, and i recommend checking it out. It gets better after the few first confusing episodes :)",

            "content": "To summarize briefly, Pandora Hearts is an average anime with potential to be so much more. I have no idea why it ended up as a semi-finished series that leaves the viewer a little disappointed in some aspects.\r\nI am getting ahead of myself.\r\nStory: If you like good story and very little fillers, you might enjoy this one too.\r\nThe setting is gloomy and sometimes alot more horrifying than the characters' reactions indicate. Still the characters try to have fun and take it the best they can, which mostly works out, luckily.\r\nThere is not much else to say without spoilers. Moving on.\r\nCharacters: Xerxes Break and Gilbert Nightrayare well-done and evolve throughout the series. Alot of background story gets revealed bit by bit, making it incredibly fun to watch those two grow. Break spices up the series with his appearance and behaviour, causing some laughs and headshaking, but definitely not in a bad way.\\n\r\nOz and Alice sometimes feel like a lost couple and other episodes just remind me of Ai Yori Aoshi, as sick as that might sound. Alice's character development is deep and, like most other things in the series, pieced together in a giant mosaic. Oz on the other hand seems like an immature brat, there to fill the role of the protagonist, because no one else would take it.\\n\r\nThe villains in general pose a good change in pace and add to a great plot, and you got many, the Baskervilles, the Will of the Abyss and even some from the heroes' own ranks, each with their own goals.\\n\r\nNow why did I give the characters a 5, I seem to be praising them too much for that.... well, so many characters want to be told in painful detail, that leads to confusion and for a 25 episode anime you should set a limit somewhere. I only pointed out some good parts, but there are just as many bad, if not more.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: The animations were pretty and reminded of Get Backers at times, especially with the characters getting small and chubby, which adds alot to the comedy. Apart from that, at times the scenes were a little static, but beautiful still. Artwork was really good and made the watch worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: Especially the music felt a little like .hack//sign, and was powerful and beautiful. There is nothing to moan about here, I can only say, it fit the show very well.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing and last complaints: Does Pandora Hearts really fit a 7? Or the Characters really a 5? I guess you have to see for yourself.\\n\r\nI loved all of it up to about episode 22. Then it quickly came to an end, leaving me unsatisfied and with the lack of a showdown that fit the tension buildup from the past dozen episodes. I truly believe, if someone had thought about what they were doing there, and extended Pandora Hearts to 30 episodes, they could have concluded with a -bam- instead of a tiny bell, finishing many of the little plotlines that seem to be continued in the manga at least. I was just very disappointed, because I liked the plot, I liked the humor and even most characters, but the ending did not live up to the first two thirds of the show.",

The attention to detail is very sharp like the clothing and plot. If you haven't read the manga then i suggest you do, it tells u everything from episodes so far with a few spoilers. But the anime itself follows the manga very very closely and giving the same manga titles as the anime titles. The story of Alice and Oz's adventuress outbreak of discovery, pain and realisation is immense and addictive leaving mecurious at the end of each episode. Even though several things like memory loss and contractors were seen in a couple of animes, but adding the originality and mystery is definately what makes this anime worth watching. And this is definately a anime for everyone who likes, a bit of comedy, mystery and adventure but even if you dont atleast read the manga since this series is what i think the best anime released at spring fall 09.",

            "content": "(This is my first review ever.)\r\nOh, dear. I'm shocked at the overall positive vibe people have for this show. Was I watching something else by mistake?\r\nThe story itself is serviceable, perhaps even interesting, but it's buried under a glacial pace. They managed to cover about 12 episodes' worth of material in 25 episodes, which seems like the director was suddenly told just before they went on air that he had twice as much time as he thought he did. I just read that the manga is still going while the anime has finished. Oh wait, no. It didn't finish. It ended. Finishing sounds like theygave you some kind of resolution. I challenge you to find someone who can honestly say they liked slapdash episode 25.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only 2 characters they try to explore, one of which is Oz, but in Pandora Hearts' 25 episodes you learn far less about him than say, the entire cast of Cowboy Bebop in the same amount of time. Everyone else is generally one-dimensional, though the second explored character turns out to be surprisingly well-rounded.\\n\\n\r\nThe good news is that Oz does develop slightly. That's all the good news I have.\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the show's 9-hour run, the characters are rather crudely drawn and spend the majority of their time sitting or standing still. It's been a long time since I've seen an animated show with so little animation. Every episode is stuffed with padding...slowly sliding pictures of scenery or whatnot with recaps thrown in to desperately take up screen time.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure what's up with MyAnimeList. When I write the review, it wants me to rate the \"Art,\" but when I submit, it says \"Animation.\" Those are different things, man! Art is 3, Animation is 2.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8 was a turning point in the series because there was finally decent art, interesting camera angles, and 9 (amazingly enough) has some animation in it...a brief fight scene! On the down side, some of the frequent flashbacks begin to flash back to earlier in the SAME episode! There was even a scene where all the characters are talking while facing away from the camera so they didn't have to animate anything at all! In the entire show, there are only about 3-4 episodes that are really animated.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some things I liked about the show. The music box theme is pleasant and sticks in your head, though by the end of the show they're opening the watch just to play the tune. The main theme is reimagined several times in interesting ways. The voice acting is well-done.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, the character designs are nice, although everyone's clothes billow out and hover (due to lack of animation). The first plot twist was completely unexpected and handled nicely. I also found one character's bloodthirsty fixation on eating animals charming.\\n\\n\r\nBut those are just shiny bits glimmering from a sea of slow and muck.\\n\\n\r\n(4) Bad.\\n\r\nActually, you know what? I'm going to drop it to (1) Unwatchable. It's cruel to pretend that you're going to go somewhere, then don't.\\n\\n\r\nI kept watching, hoping it would get better. The second half of the show is a decent start to a show, with mysteries and interesting characters introduced, but then poof, the show ends and you're left wondering why they (and you) even bothered.",

It's wonderland! A wonderfully wonderful wonder of a wonderland, Wonder. But you must have wondered by now if Wonderland's the name, Mr. Wonder? No, Mrs. Wonder. It's-\r\n...the Abyss.\r\nW-what the hell? Who's there?\r\nPandora Hearts was adapted by a manga of the samename by Jun Mochizuki. Produced by Xebec, and directed by Takao Kato, the story takes place in a universe of two different dimensions... of sorts: a humanity inhabited Victorian era-esque setting of corsets and petticoats, and a macabre reimagining of Lewis Caroll's Wonderland, the latter infested with eldritch abominations known as Chains with apparent appetites for manflesh. There's very little doubt that this show took its inspiration from Alice in Wonderland. We follow Oz Vessalius, a somewhat mischievous, but otherwise goodhearted youth and heir to one of the four great dukedoms of the realm. Due to circumstances involving a seemingly brief stint in the Abyss, a white-themed Alice choking him within an inch of his life and a red-themed Alice, henceforth known as simply Alice, enslaving/contracting with whatever was left, Oz, the chosen one, the red-themed Alice, and the loyal attendants/oddly dispositioned allies of the Chain-smoking agency dubbed Pandora, set off to unravel the mysteries of this Abyss and its governess, its Will. Adventure with sprinkles of madness, this show is sure to satisfy shounen itches.\\n\\n\r\nIntrospection atop heaps of despair, this show is also sure to interest those looking for a little more. A caveat of note toward this otherwise sensationalist review: existentialism. Most of the main characters are experiencing or have gone through some form of existentialist crisis. Personal existentialist crises framed with questions such as... Why was I born? Why do I continue to live? Is there any reason for me to? There's Oz, with his eerily resigned nature toward distressing events and his stilted affirmation toward martyrdom stemming from the trauma of being an unwanted son. There's Alice, with her past memories' absence and the anguish of being perceived incomplete, the outsider, alone. Self-sacrifice for self-gratification. Suspended animation, or rather, its sensation. In fact, most of the main cast are experiencing or have experienced these issues at some point or another, and most are pursuing numerous truths, the truth behind the numerous tragedies connected to the Abyss, the truth behind Will of the Abyss, the truth behind the Abyss itself. But most interestingly of all these veracities are the ones that are personal. For Oz and Alice specifically, they need the truth in confronting their own demons before progressing elsewhere, no matter how painful that may be.\\n\\n\r\nThen after, is finding the truth behind the melody. \u201cLacie\u201d in all its reiterative forms, more predominantly as a simple music box number, is a work of art. Played on its own many times throughout the show, without words, with more than just feelings, this melody weaves a tale of its own. Rather than one of one-sided angst, it croons of tragedy as it compels its listeners to muse why music so beautiful, a product of which can only find in happy days, is so sad. Coupled with details of the story seen and spoken, the musical yarn is given clarity. The story, in turn, is given weight. Crafted by the talents of one Ms. Yuki Kaiijura, who composed the rest of the OST, a special mention must be said of the OP, \u201cParallel Hearts,\u201d by Kaijura's Fiction Junction. With a similarly soul-rending violin solo at the beginning and haunting vocals throughout, the crescendos and decrescendos of the song match well with the fluctuating intensity of the visuals, even if those visuals do little more than introduce the settings and cast members. The EDs, ED1 \u201cmaze,\u201d and ED2 \u201cWatashi wo Mitsukete,\u201d translated \u201cFind Me,\u201d by savage genius are of a more obligatory note by comparison. ED1, which hosts its own pretty and well-paced dynamics, is comprised mainly of Alice, suspended, vulnerable, insecure because of her lack of an identity, interspaced by Oz providing just that. ED2 is of a lighter toned portrayals of the major recurring characters accompanied by singing that wouldn't be half bad if it stayed on pitch towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is consistent, nothing as eye-catchingly comparable as some of more scenic and uncanny set pieces, the notable exception coming to mind being all those murderous dolls from the latter, save those demarcatedly anime forms of stylized humor, deliberately deformed head sizes, facial expressions, and whatnot. Funny for those who like that humor, and honestly, it'd be rare to find an anime fan that wasn't, but there's no denying that, on its own, it's silly to a fault. And that quality's a problem for a show like this, especially at its inception. Here I am, breathing in the setting, the atmosphere, the substance of the established relationships, the gravity of the sinister elements at play, and then a stupid anime mug later, my immersion's shattered, and I'm left disgruntled trying to re-piece it into a semblance or even shell of what it was from earlier. \\n\\n\r\nIt becomes less of an issue the further on the story progresses, but the comedy, however balanced with its dramatic counterpart never really changes from this aforementioned nature, and then a new issue erupts revolving around the characters. We see our main cast in serious situations. We see our main cast in silly ones. Yet we never see much in between, and because of that, the relationships in this show lack real grounding. Real relationships constitute more than just stress and hijinks; they are made up of normal moments, of people sharing their interests in fairly realistic ways. That doesn't mean humor can't be implemented to spice these moments up, but if they are to feel sincere, then they can't be more than just elements. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's another bothersome feature that has less to do with the animation and more to do with the direction. Eyes are said to be windows to the soul; it's especially true for anime, since eyes are an effective way of demonstrating powerful emotions without the need for any further body language. It's an attractive for production studios running under tight budgets, but Pandora Hearts abuses it so much on the male main protagonist that it becomes sensationally meaningless, and I'd argue it's uncharacteristic of Oz to be eliciting such pained eye expressions every episode to other episode. Such direction has to be used sparingly if the intent behind them is to signal that shit's hit the fan, because if the show as a whole is polluted with them, then it's hard to take them seriously.\\n\\n\r\nLastly is this show's heavy-handed reliance on flashbacks. Flashbacks are viable means of characterization and plot progression, especially when the object of them is to coax drama. Anyone who's a fan of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica would attest to their effectiveness when used properly. However, Pandora Hearts does two things wrong with them. One, it uses them incessantly. Two, it uses them right before or during the majority of the series' numerous dire situations. The dramatic value a flashback may carry over to a narrative diffuses the more often it is used. Coupled with the fact that it's often used when it's convenient, to introduce it right at the moment where we are supposed to care about characters the most, it borders on contrivance. The only flashbacks I find reasonable are the ones around Alice, whom the audience is supposed to regard as somewhat mysterious, one of the major plot drives being that she's unlocking memories as she goes. It also helps that those memories are also pretty tragic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it. Filled with execution flaws, but nonetheless layered with substantive ambition and terrific music, minding the rough start it's a show to try out when you have the time. That's me, and before I break into anymore literary nonsense, I think I'm going to get a new hat. The one I'm currently wearing is rather nice, but it's kind of old and, to be honest, I think it's giving me migraines. Could be the trapped dust, or maybe it's the mercury. How's that idiom go? Mad as a-\\n\\n\r\n...the Abyss.\\n\\n\r\nW-who keeps saying that? \\n\\n\r\nI give Pandora Hearts a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "If I was told : 'Hey, there's another season of Pandora Hearts' I would believe it... \r\nI feel like something is still missing after 25 episodes. If I was to delete the few last episode from my mind and write this review, I would have been able put a way better score. I often say : When the Ending is bad the whole thing becomes bad. This 'rule' apply to Pandora Hearts. In fact... it's like it is made for this show.\r\nPandora Hearts had a lot of potential !\r\nThe First Episodes were mysterious and I had a lot of question on my mind. I haveto say many of them are still unanswered or I feel like the given answer is lame. [WATCH OUT FOR POSSIBLE SPOILER!] Oz sins was his very existence ? Why ?... Because his father never wanted him ? So he send him into Abyss ? And Also, he send him into Abyss because The Will wanted him ? Is that me or that's a lot of Coincidence !?![END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER] I was really disappointed and that's only one example of the Weird Answer. Somehow I feel like the 'Tragedy of Sabrie' is also REALLY Lacking. It was mysterious and interesting and that's a good thing but as a writer you have to answer the questions in the End. Pandora Hearts didn't.\\n\r\nI get the main idea... I think but I had to 'Guess' many of them from what we see. I would have like to know more in details what happened and more importantly, the WHY of those event. The Baskerville killed all those people following Glen's order but why ? Why did he order that in the first place ?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I should read the Manga but, seriously... Do I want to reach the same ending ?\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending was ridiculous. Was it the lack of a real enemy the whole time ? In the End, you reach a point where there's no real enemy and maybe that was the problem with the whole story. They couldn't find a way to end it so they ended it this lame way by making Oz's Father and his chain the 'Temporary' Bad Guy.\\n\\n\r\nI still would 'recommend' it for the interesting plot but sadly it was rushed and the ending solve nothing at all. Oz say it, in the end. He said he would still search to 'solve' the mysteries. That's why I said, I would believe if someone told me there was another season. Sadly, there is no such thing and this... This was the Real Ending !\\n\\n\r\nTherefore... \\n\r\nSTORY:: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Art. This looked like some of the First Naruto Episode. I remember them... Do you ? They were 'OK' and it was years ago ! Pandora Hearts isn't that old and the Graphic are horrible. Some scene were good but other... they were horrible. I'm thinking of the Scene at the End where he sees 'Griffon' his father's Chains painting or something on the wall. He's all shocked staring at it. Seriously... His eyes are juste getting 'BIG - SMALL - BIG - SMALL' and his hair darker on his forehead. But Still, I can deal with a Style that look more 'Old' or 'Out of date'. That really isn't the thing that screw thing us for the Show.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore...\\n\r\nART:: 6\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to say against the Music. The Intro was good. The second ending felt a Little out of place but it was Ok. The show wasn't all dark either so it's ok. The Soundtrack were good. Kajiura Yuki's music is always good and was going great with the show. However, the song were nothing new. I remember the song from 'Mai-Hime' and they sound really similar. I feel like I can hear 'Mezame' everywhere in those almost. I think the only song from her that are slightly different are those in Xenosaga. But this review isn't about her music ! Eh-eh. \\n\\n\r\nTherefore...\\n\r\nMUSIC:: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nHow can you make people love character they don't know and don't understand. I love Break and... Hey, that's the only Character we were given real answer with ! Oz is annoying. Nothing to say about him really. He's the main Character. He keeps saying that he doesn't care if he dies. Then why should I care ? Is he really important ? He doesn't get anything at all. To me he was just a selfish young boy. And, Good News everyone ! His Fate is still unsure cuz, he still have the Symbol on his chest and he will surely dies when it's full even if Gil helps him slowing the process down. Maybe, that something would have been something good to add in the ending or something...\\n\r\nAlice was a good character... until they made her do some totally random stuff. I get it she's suppose to be the Tsundere character but, seriously ?... Her character became ridiculous at time and then it's hard to take her seriously. Also, I wish her background would have been put to light more than that with Jack and eventually, leading to the whole Tragedy thing and then... To Oz. The pieces are still messed up for the story it's no different for the Character. Vincent and Gilbert are also totally in the darkness for me. To me, Vincent is still a murder. He killed Alice and asked the Will to save Gil and him and Gilbert doesn't care about what happened ? How did he get hurt like that anyway ? I wish we knew more about them. I felt like they were somehow important. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the character that really needed more airtime... Glen ? and probably, The Will. They tried to make us think.. 'those are the bad guys' without giving us any real answer as 'Why ?' and then.. 'Why not ?' Glen is the Bad guy. He made the Tragedy happen. We barely know why we barely know what happened between Jack and him. Why calling Jack a Hero ? He died without doing nothing... no ? \\n\\n\r\nI've read somewhere someone saying the Pandora Hearts has the best character development and all. Makes my day. I would have believe it but... The Ending rushed thing for the Character also and makes me still wonder stuff about them so no... The Character are incomplete as well.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore... \\n\r\nCHARACTER:: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Pandora Hearts ?... I did. Yes. I did. I was hooked. Every episode, I told myself that's the Last One for today and I still watched another one after ! Yes, I enjoyed it but as I was reaching the End, somehow... I wasn't that interested in it anymore. I would still recommend it... and I will probably add the Manga to my 'I want to read that..' List for some other time.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore... \\n\r\nENJOYMENT:: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever... The Rushed and Lame ending force me to throw...\\n\r\nOVERALL:: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I had expectation too high on the ending and got disappointed by my own fault... \\n\r\nWho knows !",

            "content": "Every now and then you come across an anime with all the right tools for success but ends up having to fight an uphill battle against unfortunate surrounding factors. Take a manga that's nowhere near complete, hand it off to a studio with an unimpressive track record, and what do you get? Well, honestly now that I think about it, a lot of adaptations of manga/LNs/VNs fit this criterion, but today I'll be highlighting yet another unfortunate case in Pandora Hearts. An anime with a compelling backdrop but not a clue as to how to handle it in the long run. Whilst the show mayhave come out half-baked, I'd be remiss to leave out mention of its solid foundation\\n\\n\r\nThe world Pandora Hearts presents within its 25 episode run is one that makes no qualms in making parallels with Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland primarily. It plays with various concepts and names from famous fairy tales and ghost stories as well. The story of Pandora Hearts is an interesting attempt at mixing of fantasy, action, horror, mystery, and comedy.The plot unfurls a tale spanning a century revolving around an event known as \"Tragedy of Sabrie\". More often than not, plot advancement comes from looking back at these events and seeing what each shocking revelation does to each character and their resolve to move forward. That said as far as titles labeled the \"shounen\" tag go, Pandora Hearts is rather slow and it's very obvious that providing exhilarating action is not top priority here. After a while, it becomes clear the story prefers to flesh out elements of the setting and the central mystery as opposed to providing fight scenes in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe slow pace isn't something I'd wholly chalk up to the lack of immediately epic plotting however and that's where on of the major failings of the plot lies. Most of the show's major revelations are shoved into 1-2 episode events that are sandwiched between....not really all that much. There're some pretty lengthy stretches here in there that ended up being filled with very trite, very anime-typical comedy which did nothing for me. Comedic timing is also a foreign concept to Pandora Hearts for the most part as the characters often make random \"funny\" quips during otherwise serious dialogue exchanges. The meat can be pretty delicious here, but there's way too much fat I found unpalatable. This problem also makes it so that the plot-twists are unevenly spaced out. You get a collection of perspective-changing developments in one episode, none for a fair stretch of time, and then yet another cluster of twists. Episodes 21 and 22, in particular, end up being rather dizzying as a result of this. An unfortunate side-effect of the plot developments in Pandora Hearts is that they give rise to many, many questions and character arcs that no series of just 25 episodes is capable of handling properly. Being an adaptation of an incomplete monthly series that presumably didn't sell well enough to warrant a second, this was to be expected. What can't be excused, however, is how poorly thought out final episodes were. The anime sticks with the storyline of its parent manga with blind faith until the last three episodes come along and it becomes clear that the story is nowhere near a satisfying stopping point. This, of course, resulted in the anime attempting to create its own ending and it completely betrays the efforts the show had put into all of it's interesting variables by barely addressing any of them. I'm not really a manga purist, so I say that script-writers should feel free to inject their own ideas into an adaptation though they should do it under one of 2 conditions.\\n\\n\r\n1. Make it their own pet-project of sorts early on. This is undoubtedly very difficult to do as it means not only making a different ending but giving the story a different narrative purpose. Go out on a limb and change not just the ending, but the entire 2nd half or something. Make it so it has a different set of ideas or themes as well so that the adaptation can be viewed as its own thing that can even be preferred over the source rather than just a shittier version of the source with a conclusion that seems to have been cobbled together at the last minute. Examples: Fullmetal Alchemist, Bokurano, Planetes, and Gankutsuou\\n\\n\r\nOr....\\n\\n\r\n2. Make sure that the added content doesn't conflict with conflict with the main canon so as to effectively close off all hope for a sequel. Example: Noragami and the 1st season of Knights of Sidonia, which both ended with climaxes that weren't in the original manga nor did they make it impossible for a sequel to happen without major retcons.\\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts opts for neither of these options and goes for an ending that not only plays around with the established canon but is also inconclusive. For those of you who've seen Claymore, think of that title's finale, but with even more unanswered questions and a much more rushed anticlimax (yes it's that lame).\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the actual cast goes. they do manage to get fleshed out to a remarkable degree. For the most part, however, the series banks on the character arc of Oz Vessalius (the protagonist) to a point at which actually becomes a bit of a detriment. The writers seem to have a hard-on for exploiting his emotional trauma for all it's worth. And for what? To have Oz angst and fret, and then eventually man up a little and say that he'll make a change for the better. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well, the thing is his development is cyclical, as in it resets from time to time. We see him fluctuate from emotional highs to lows several times over in the same way and it ends up becoming a tad repetitious. That said he's far from what I'd call a bad character exactly. The characters Oz meets on his journey never encourage him to develop into an unstoppable badass (he's actually quite weak physically throughout) so much as they challenge his value system. He eventually realizes the problems that lie with his childish heroics. It's a shame that his more introspective moments of sadness were far too numerous and lengthy for the simple points they got across.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, in particular, do develop a fair bit in the present, but I'd be lying If I said it wasn't more interesting to see how they ended up becoming who they are. I'm not normally a fan of using flashbacks excessively, but given how all the important clues to the central mystery lie in the past, I can allow Pandora Hearts some lee-way. There really isn't any going further without taking a good long look back. Because of this, I can't say the characters \"develop\" as much as you might like to hear that, but the main cast (Oz, Alice, Gilbert, and Break) is made up of individuals that you can fully understand and sympathize with. Alice, herself is a pretty simple tsundere type through and through though unlike others of her type she doesn't really exude arrogance to mask weakness as she's strong as hell. Her simplistic nature and arrogance come from the fact that she lacks her memory of the traumatic events of a time long before her meeting with Oz. Not the most original character, but as an epicenter to the grand mystery she doesn't detract much from the series. There really isn't all that much to say about the characters besides looking at how they are built up, because it's actually difficult to talk about them without spoiling key plot twists (and trust me there are a lot of key plot-twists) once we finally have a strong grasp on the main players, the show comes to it's abrupt ending.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, there's no escaping the fact that the series doesn't really deliver. Sure the series has neat set-pieces, but excessively drab, dark and grainy color palette doesn't do them much favor. There's also this odd, blurry filter blurs the outlines of objects in the foreground that I found distracting. The fight scenes are also not up to par as they lack inspired choreography tactics and overall direction. Audio-wise, Pandora Hearts holds up just fine. Whilst not the best I've heard of her work, Yuki Kajiura's score does a fine job of picking up some of the slack during the slower moments and mediocre fight scenes. This track in particular that's used whenever Alice is going all out against a foe is typically better then everything happening onscreen. Kajiura's tendency towards pieces with moody melancholic chants fits a morose title like this one to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame that with as much momentum Pandora Hearts was gaining that it had to succumb not only to its own shortcomings but to the same fate as many adaptations of many monthly manga before it. As it is, watching Pandora Hearts is akin to piecing together a vast jigsaw puzzle, only to discover that half the pieces are missing towards the end. There's not much waiting at the end of this rabbit hole.",

            "content": "Next time you pick up an anime to watch, beware! \r\nThe curse of the unfinished manga may be in it. \r\nTo be quite honest, if the only mistake of Pandora Hearts was having an open ending due to the manga not being finished I wouldn't have given such a low rating to it. Let's just say that the open (and bad) ending was the cherry on the top. \r\n\tOz Bezarius, son of a nobleman is about to come of age and thus, a ceremony to celebrate this fact will be held in a mansion that hides many secrets behind it. While exploring outsidethe place, Oz starts to see, in his mind, a disturbed girl who is in a room full of toys. Still confused about what he saw, the young man returns to the mansion and the ritual starts. When the ceremony is about to finish, Oz finds himself  surrounded by mysterious people who want to send him to the Abyss, a place said to be a prison in where creatures called Chains will take the bad guys to places from which they can't escape. \\n\r\n\tThe boy ends up being sent to the Abyss and there he meets with the girl he saw before. He finds out that her name is Alice, a Chain and she tells him she is the only way for him to get out of that cursed place. In order to do that he needs to seal a contract which consists on lending his body to the Chain. Oz agrees to it and together with Alice, the Black Rabbit, they leave the Abyss only to find themselves 10 years in the future in front of three people who were just about to go rescue him. \\n\r\n\tSharon, Xerxes Break and Raven work for Pandora, a group of people who hunts wild Chains and Chains that have signed a contract with humans (called Illegal Contractors). Upon finding out that Oz made a deal with B-Rabbit they decide to take them to Pandora's Headquarters. Before they can do that, however, they are attacked by a Chain and are saved by Alice. The girl then, reveals that she only wants to find her lost memories that are shattered throughout the world. Believing that these memories might be related to a tragedy that took place 100 years ago, Alice and Oz are sent in a journey to find out more about Alice's past. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhile this sounds promising, as far as story goes, very little happens after this. And this basically summarizes the 4 first episodes. After that we have very little development overall. Lots of episodes are filled with information, that in the end turns up useless. If the story wouldn't be finished in the anime anyway then it might as well have been compressed into 12 or 13 episodes. Watching 25 episodes only to get nothing in the end gave out a feeling of a huge waste of time. \\n\\n\r\n\tThere are some good points to the series, however. The problem is that they walk hand in hand with counterpoints. The main characters are well developed, even though the feeling I had was that they were developed to no purpose in the end. The soundtrack is from Kajiura Yuki, which is enough to know that we aren't dealing with crappy stuff here. Unfortunately, Kajiura's excellence was put to a bad use. The songs are repetitive and used in wrong moments, showing that more important than a good composition is a good sound direction. The art ranges from beautiful to average and even the many references to Alice in the Wonderland present in the show add up for nothing.  \\n\\n\r\n\tUp to a point it was enjoyable watching Pandora Hearts, but as the end drew closer and nothing happened to help clarify the main points I felt kinda annoyed for having watched it at all. The lack of respect from the studios is becoming chronic and Pandora Hearts ends up being another anime on an already overcrowded list with shows that could have been something but turns out average due to bad production.",

To tell the truth, this is the first time I've ever seen related to that game, that's why I like to watch it over and over again. Even though I didn't finish it yet since it's still airing, I know the left episodes for the viewers to watch will be moreinspiring episodes. I've also read its manga itself.

Simply put, I was intrigued with the dark elements, found myself honestly amused with the jokes, and entertained with the twists that came with it. Which led me to read themanga, which actually I think is better than its anime counterpart in terms of explaining and conveying what the artist wanted to convey.

The story is mysterious, beautiful, and kept me interested the whole way through.\r\nArt: The art in both the anime and manga is amazing. It is not too shounen or shoujo and is very pleasant to look at.\r\nSound: The music in this anime isn't the best quality to the anime but I found thesoundtrack to be beautiful and worth listening to when not watching the anime. Another part to sound that I find very important is the voice actors. The voice actors in Pandora Hearts do a wonderful job of portraying the characters personalities. No character was too high pitched. (which I find very annoying.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Pandora Hearts have amazing backround stories that unravel throughout the anime. They have unique personalities and character design. If you are like me, and like to cosplay, this anime is very good because the characters have beautiful, unique outfits.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime was dramatic but it had its funny moments, and by \"funny\" I mean \"laugh out loud funny\" I found myself laughing outloud (unexpextedly) at some of the episodes of this anime. As for the fanservice in this anime it is mostly BL (boy love) moments between Oz and Gil. But it isn't overboard like some anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give this anime a 10. The ONLY problem I found with this anime was the ending. If you could even call it that. The anime left many mysteries unanswered but fortunately the anime follows the manga very well and the manga answers everything for you in the end. I recommend watching the anime AND reading the manga if you want to fully complete this series.\\n\\n\r\nHope you watch and enjoy this anime! ^^",

            "content": "I've only given a 10-star rating to a handful of animes.  And this is one of them.\r\n\"Abyss\" was supposed to be a legend, a tale to frighten young children, a horrific place where evil people were taken.  But Oz Bezarius discovers the truth for himself.  After being forced into Abyss when his coming-of-age ceremony gets crashed, Abyss turns out to be a separate dimension that looks like a giant broken toybox.  And the only way to leave is to make a contract with a being named Alice, who sometimes exists in the form of an impertinent young girl, and at othertimes as a giant anthropomorphic rabbit.  Once they return to our world, things start to really get interesting\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to give a summary of Pandora Hearts, since it has so much content.  It's mostly a drama, but there is some action/adventure.  The setting is late 19th-century Europe (probably England).  As it progresses, plot twists and turns keep coming.  Questions pile up.  Who is the strange man that appears in Oz's dreams?  Why does his father avoid him?  Why is he called the \"key of abyss\"?  Who is Alice really?  Why are her and Gil's memories missing?  What was the tragedy of Sabrie?  How is everything connected?  There's so many story lines going on, puzzles to solve, and clues coming up, that you don't have time to get bored.  \\n\\n\r\nMemories is a key theme of the story.  Several characters have lost their memory.  There are frequent flashbacks.  Events are often told out of order, as they're retold to the main characters rather than when they happened during the story timeline.   (Which helps keep you in anticipation for when the events to be revealed.)  At the beginning of most episodes is a brief recap of the last events of the previous one.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n***Storytelling***\\n\r\nThe pacing is excellent.  Some animes have a lot of content in the beginning, and then sort of sputter out.  Others have a slow pace, but then rush to finish everything in the end.  Others have \"filler\" episodes that mess up the pacing or add content that's out of character.  But this one, it's perfect.  The overall tone of the story is dark, even tragic.  But tons of humor is added, so things never get oppressive.  You've probably seen some of the themes before in other animes (making a contract with a supernatural being, searching for missing memories, references to \"Alice in Wonderland,\" an other-dimensional \"broken toybox\").  But even if some plot points are cliches, they work here.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who have read the manga already, the stories are practically identical.  I didn't notice any filler episodes.  The ending is done well, fitting in with events in the manga.  It provides a satisfying ending, but still leaves some questions hanging, allowing for a possible second season (the manga is still ongoing at this time).\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Art and Animation***\\n\r\nExcellent, in my opinion, but I can understand if some people might not like it.  There's something about it that feels very \"classic.\"  When I first started watching it, I though it might be something from the 90's but it was actually aired in 2009.  Animes made within the past few years have a certain slickness.  But this one has beautifully done motion animation that resembles classic animation.  Many of the backgrounds also have the classic hand-painted look.   The color palette looks old-fashioned.  Colors often look washed out or faded, and pale yellow and olive green are common.  The character drawings also do a great job trying to imitate the manga art.  Black lines on characters are extended or enlarged to provide mild shadows, which is commonly done in manga, but rare in anime.  Overall, it look more \"hand-crafted\" than most animes that have come out in the past 5 years.  I liked that, since I felt it gave it a more timeless look, but I can understand if others think it's boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Music***\\n\r\nThe composer (Yuki Kajiura) also did the music for Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, so some of the scores sound reminiscent of TRC.  But I liked the music on TRC, so that's fine for me.  The music box theme is also an extremely iconic tune, and ties the story together very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Characters***\\n\r\nGreat.  There are many memorable characters.  Each is distinct, and many have secrets they're hiding (even Oz).  That's one of the most intriguing parts of the story.  Who are these people really?  What are their pasts?\\n\\n\\n\r\n***Potentially objectionable content***\\n\r\nNot a lot compared to most animes out there.  Very little swearing.   Vincent is a total psycho.  His habit of stabbing and slicing stuffed animals is disturbing.  And he mistreats his servant girl.  There are some scenes with bloody bodies.  There's also quite a bit of bloodless action and fight scenes.  Some of the \"chains\" (beings of abyss) take the forms of creepy and disturbing dolls.  There's other stuff, but it's fairly mild.  There's a scene where everyone gets drunk and gets silly, and Alice partially succeeds in taking off all her clothes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really loved Pandora Hearts.  It's one you can watch several times and still enjoy.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nOz Vessalius, heir to one of the duke houses, has just turned fifteen. His life is rich and carefree, darkened only by the constant absence of his father. At his coming-of-age ceremony, however, everything changes. For no reason that he can discern, he's cast into the prison known as the \"Abyss\", only to be saved by a \"chain\" known as Alice, the bloodstained black rabbit. It is unknown why was he cast into Abyss, how does Alice factor into it all, and what does the organization known as \"Pandora\" want with him. [Source: Anime News Network]\r\nExcellent story. It has many multiple twists, cliffhangers, etc withsome elements from Alice in Wonderland, but it all fits into the story. It has very little fillers, which I like VERY much.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nCompared to the anime of today, it isn't anything. The animation isn't anything better.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Voice Acting:\\n\r\nSome of the music is memorable, some of the music (actually, one of the EDs is one of them) isn't. Some of the ending themes do not fit for the dark theme of the anime. That ending theme is Watashi wo Mitsukete, but even that is quite catchy for me. There really should be some background noise, e.g. birds singing, cicadas, etc.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of voice acting, (watched Japanese dubbed, English subs) everything is done well. I disliked very few of the voice actors, like Oz's sister, but it was very fitting for the character (Ada being very girlish).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEach and every character is lovable. Alice is a meat-loving, hotheaded Chain with a soft side. Gilbert is a loyal gunner. Xerxes is a Chain with good skill, carefree and dangerous at times. Oz is energetic, optimistic, and puts himself before others. There are so much lovable ones and a few that I dislike.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBecause of its mysteries, characters, and much much more, I enjoyed this anime a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's an anime with its share of flaws, but still watchable.",

            "content": "Sorry to say this but the anime disappointed me. It was only 25 episodes, which isn't nearly enough to tell the entire story, I get that. However, the value of this series isn't one or two significant parts that you can pick and animate and then fill in the missing cracks of the story with random plots for convenience. It's the entire story. The value of this series lies in how the entire story is told because just one or two of the significant events alone are not enough fully show how amazing this series is. That's why the anime, which is only 25 episodes,did an appalling job with Pandora Hearts. \\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts is a series that builds. Let's say you watch a sports anime (KnB or Haikyuu for example) based off of a manga. Do you only pick one game to animate and then skip the final game? If I saw that, I'd give that anime a 0/10. Pandora Hearts is similar to that. Each significant event sets the stage for the final scene. The real ending of Pandora Hearts left me breathless, my head was in turmoil, and without all that building, I would not have reacted the way I did with the manga. \\n\\n\r\nIf the anime was original without a manga (Which is what I'm partially treating it as), then It'd get an average score from me. \\n\\n\r\nThe manga is absolutely amazing. You get the entire story and the value of it is worth more than the anime. To even compare the anime to the manga is like comparing a candle to the sun. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict here is, read the manga. It's way better.",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts Series Review *Possible Spoilers *\r\nTechnically speaking the artwork for the first few issues of the manga is amateur with irregular proportions, awkward facial expressions, and relatively simple backgrounds and designs; however, since Jun Mochizuki (the creator) was just starting out as a mangaka that is to be expected. By issue 15 (around a year after the manga\u2019s release) her artwork is equal to her contemporaries. Her ability to convey emotion, use of continuity and character designs is where her strength as an artist and a writer truly shines. Characters in the series often say one thing, but think or mean something completely differentand Mochgizuki-sensei is able to effectively show what the character might be feeling rather then what he or she might be saying through various gestures and facial expressions which creates a beautiful sense of atmosphere, personality and emotion. Also bear in mind that Mochizuki-sensei, like many female mangaka of shonen series, draws many of her characters in a very bishonen style (as a female reader I cannot complain), so just be wary if you are the kind of reader who is bothered by bishonen men in a shonen series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother potential flaw of the series for some viewers/readers is the fact that, like Death Note, no one ever stops talking. Pandora Hearts is not a series that you can just pick-up and start reading or watching at random; it has a progressive, complex storyline that is riveted with dialogue and I would recommend reading/watching the series more then once in order to fully understand and appreciate the story. However, I caution the anime only watchers that due to the intriguingly developed plot and characters the 25 episode anime series barely reaches the surface of the story only covering the first 32 issues of the manga before catching-up to the manga thus forcing the anime series to end just as its starting. Because of this the anime suffers and is barely even able to enter truly compelling aspects of the series making the anime more of an introduction or trailer to the series rather then full series, Pandora Hearts is a series that absolutely requires you to read the manga in order to fully enjoy. Luckily, aside from the final three episodes which come off as pointless, lazy and barely watchable, the anime remains relatively faithful to the manga and free of fillers (thankfully), which makes it quite easy to get into the manga afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is nothing special. It is rather mediocre for an anime series made in 2009 especially in comparison to series such as Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood (2009) or Black Butler (2008) which were released roughly around the same time (then again comparing Xebec to anything by Aniplex is like comparing cheese to the Holy Grail, so the cheaper animation style is to be expected). Aside from a few instances of stuff characters and backgrounds with nothing more then moving mouths or frames, the anime doesn\u2019t fail to capture the more subtle expressions and gestures of the characters that Mochigizuki-sensei so skilfully produced in the manga. Despite being a Shonen series Pandora Hearts (both manga and anime) doesn\u2019t have the usual amount of action you would expect from its genre, especially in the earlier episodes/issues. Nevertheless the action portions of the series of both the anime and manga are interesting and engaging. The manga scenes are drawn so the reader can understand the situation and can occasionally produce some truly astonishing imagery, while creating a dramatic atmosphere that can evoke an emotional response when desired which is successfully recreated in the anime series. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the low production value of the anime series, the addition of voice actors and dramatic music is used effectively to feelings of action, humour and drama in many ways the manga cannot. As of yet, a dub of Pandora Hearts has not been released so I have no comments regarding the English voice actors however, most of the seiyu are top notch at portraying their respective characters in an effective manner. Junko Minagawa successfully conveys the childlike innocence, and damaged disposition of Oz Vessalius. Ayako Kawasumi is able to capture the tomboyish, brash, yet fragile nature of Alice. Toriumi Kousuke is able to successful portray Gilbert\u2019s overly protective, anxious attitude while still maintaining the sullen, attractive, loyal personality that makes the fan girls squeal with glee. Hanazawa Kana is able to capture both the sweet and terrifying aspects of Sharon\u2019s character, and the legendary seiyu Ishida Akira masterfully portrays the humorous, carefree, sly, dangerous nature of Xerxes Break. There is also a wide range of secondary characters such as Elliot, Leo, Echo, Vincent and the Baskervilles whose voice actors tend to be hit or miss. Some voice actors such as renowned Jun Fukuyama (most famous for playing Lelouch from Code Geass) brilliantly portrays the chilling, emotional disturbed character of Vincent Nightray. However, some voice actors such as Hirofumi Nojima as Elliot Nightray and Akeno Watanabe as Leo fail to effectively convey the personality and quirks that make the characters so enjoyable to read in the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is an excellent balance between tragedy and light heartedness which makes it all the more enjoyable and I was personally surprised I enjoyed the series as much as I did. The characters are the highlight of the series for me, every character has some sort of personal flaw or past issue that influences and impacts their current actions and assists in their development. For fear of spoilers I will not reveal too much, however I will say that the first impressions you get of the characters will either be wrong or they will change later on in the series. I find that the characters react to situations and develop more like real people then regular manga/anime characters do which makes them all the more relatable and enjoyable. I also enjoy the Alice in Wonderland motif present throughout the series. Mochigizuki-sensei integrates characters, plots and themes from Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland into her own story thus creating personalities, plot points, and weapons in ways that are neither absurdly surreal like the in Dragon\u2019s Lair II (apologises to fans of the series) nor overly whimsical like the Disney adaptation of the story but clever, innovative and sometimes dark ways. Overall Pandora Hearts is well developed, emotional satisfying series that has a progressive, complex plot with surprising innovative characters and some dark, violent turns and interesting twists that do not seem forced or contrived. Despite the flaws in the anime series, I feel that it is a great introduction to the series and well worth checking out. Nevertheless, the true heart of the story lies in the manga and is definitely one underrated series worth checking out. I give the anime series a 6/10 for providing a great introduction to the series, great voice actors, no fillers, mediocre animation, and a terrible ending. I give the manga and series as a whole 8.5/10 for outstanding character development, attractive artwork, emotional response, and complex storyline. \\n",

Its kinda under-budget feeling. I don't know if they where but itseems like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The music is good I guess? It fits at-lease.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10): The main characters you'll have to see for yourself if you'll like them, but my biggest disappointment is how early the anime ends and we see no character development, some important characters to the plot are barley shown too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10): My biggest enjoyments in this is seeing certain events animated but that's about it.",

It's not the first or last anime to use concepts from Alice in Wonderland, so I didn't think that the act of pulling ideas from Alice was so original but the derivations themselves were a good effort to dosomething new.

            "content": "So I had finished the manga not too long ago, and decided to check up on the anime again. I watched the anime back when I was a little younger so my rating is about to change on it. Honestly, Pandora Hearts made me sad (within the manga and anime) because it was so pitiful. Usually if the manga is good, the anime has to be awesome. But..in this case...I don't know what happened. \r\nI loved the story, and the Alice in Wonderland feel...but for the story to be chopped up and thrown together into an animation just didn't sit right with me. Now whenI first watched this anime, I had no idea about the manga. But after watching it, I felt like I needed to ''complete'' the story properly. \\n\\n\r\nI love Alice, Oz, and Gil. They portrayed them well enough in the anime as much as they did in the manga. No you may be thinking I'm comparing the manga and anime too much, but there's a reason. It's simple. The manga was doing it's job, while the anime seemed like it thrown together in one night only copying fragments. I'm glad I hadn't been reading the manga thoroughly enough before watching the anime, or this review would be more violent. It was sometimes even confusing to watch, only because it wasn't giving the full story.  It made the anime seem like it wasn't a good story...but it really was. Even when I think back now, the anime didn't even make full since...for instance Jack randomly showing up but no one acknowledging who he was or how he was important. Luckily once I read about him, my brain went ''Ohhhh, so that's who he was..'' \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story was jumbled all over the place, I did like the art and soundtracks. There weren't any that stuck out to me, but it wasn't dreadful or randomly placed. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, I just wish I got something better and more from this as I did reading about it. If you have a good feeling on it, be my guest. Honestly, I'd say the manga is worth it way more though. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(I should probably go review the manga now, since that's all I've been dwelling on..sorry..lol)",

I really really love this anime and I can watch it even more three times or maybe all over again and again. \r\nWhat I like about this anime is the storyline and character development. Most anime would focus on the adventures of the main character and forget the role of the other characters making the storyline ugly, but this anime has a very good character development and the storyline makes the viewers curious on what's next and what happened that makes them want more. I'm quite surprised that it isnot that popular, or maybe others just haven't discovered it yet.\\n\\n\r\nI for example was just watching Kamigami no Asobi and found this anime on the advertisements. It suits my needs for at that time I was looking for anime to watch next. Luckily I found this so I searched for a trailer and it looks very interesting so I tried it (I'm a sucker for adventure, magical anime). At first I was watching it alone but my other friends was wondering why I was so hooked up with my laptop so they tried watching it too and then viola! I was suddenly watching with everyone!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really cute and interesting too. Moreover I like the way Break and Alice was drawn especially Gilbert, Oz and Jack. The sound effects are really cool and great and I love the instrumental song \"Lacie\" just as the opening theme song too. I really enjoyed watching it so I was really devastated to find out that there is no Season 2 *sob* Like, seriously? this anime is great and I think it deserves a second season! but Oh well, there might be other factors why it was not pushed through so I'm just thankful that there's the anime version,(though fans would still more like the anime version) but All in All, this was really a great anime!\\n\\n\r\nKudos to those who made it and thank you for creating such a very nice anime!",

            "content": "This was mentioned in previous reviews, yet unfortunate enough to require mentioning again: such wasted potential. The animated version of the otherwise well woven story line of the manga was tremendously lacking. To be fair, the manga had only just concluded last year while the anime was produced in its early years of serialization. Nevertheless, the anime is far from dispelling justice to its preceding manga, and the animation was--in my opinion--subpar. A major concern was the over usage of still-shots with minor movement edited in, and thus added a drollness throughout-- even during action scenes. Honestly, I would love if this could be redoneto better capture the essence of what the manga had offered.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: During his coming of age ceremony Oz Vessalius, the 15-year old heir to the house of Vessalius and one of the four great duke houses, is set upon by hooded strangers who condemn him for the sin of being alive and banish him into the depths of 'Abyss,' an otherworldly dimension out of lore and legend. Desperate to return home, Oz happens upon a chain, one of the denizens of Abyss, by the name of Alice whom he makes a contract with in order for them both to escape and discover for what sin he wasbanished for, the contents of Alice's missing memories, and the true nature of Abyss itself.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Pandora Hearts is fairly small and mainly features the members of Pandora, the organization which Oz and Alice join which manages illegal contractors and searches for information pertaining to Abyss. The main cast was highly self-involved in that a great many of the character interactions and dialogue took place between the same 5-6 people which worked well if the viewer enjoyed the characters on screen but poorly if they found them unrelatable or tiring. \\n\\n\r\nAlice's contractor and the protagonist of the story, Oz is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to his characterization - succeeding in some areas while appearing pretty plain or boring in others. He is kind and cheerful and more or less par for the course insofar as he is the lead of a shounen anime however there are a few character traits that set him apart; for better or for worse. One thing that the show draws specific attention to, especially in the latter half of its run, is Oz's selflessness and its impact on his friends. Like many other lead characters he is quick to take the bullet for someone else and exists somewhere between being heroic and suicidal however Pandora Hearts offers a fair critique of his mindset and it can be self-serving and problematic. In this way, Oz presents a fairly compelling character with potential for development and a strict ideology by which he lives but this is where his uniqueness more or less ends. His only other noticeable character trait is that he adapts to situations quickly and takes them for granted and while this isn't something that all that many characters exhibit it plays out in an unpleasurable fashion making it seem more like he is detached from the proceedings rather than coming to terms with them. Oz receives adequate character development however because of how the show plays out it would seem the bulk of his development exists beyond the last episode which is unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nAlice, the renowned Black Rabbit and the chain who is contracted to Oz, doesn't quite offer the same potential that her contractor does. While Oz has some pros and cons to his characterization, Alice is pretty plain and whatever strengths the show attempted to attribute to her where trivialized by how it ultimately handled her as a character. Upon introduction she is brash, powerful, and mysterious - she claims Oz is her servant much to the dismay of Oz's actual servant Gilbert and is desperate to find her missing memories in order to discover who she really is. At face-value this sounds like a great character and she might have been had the show treated her better. Her earlier forward and blunt attitude is quickly warped to the point where most of her interactions with Oz in the mid and late section of the show mirror that of a tsundere rather than a genuine, lonely, sorrowful person like the show makes her out to be beneath the surface. She is reduced from a powerful being from another dimension to the jealous and doting love-interest in a relationship that didn't have a whole lot of reasoning behind it. Oz and Alice are similar in several ways and they could make a good romantic couple however their characterization didn't play out well in this regard and they both felt further stereotypical within their roles because of it. Furthermore, because her search for her memories somewhat disappears for a while as the plot ventures elsewhere, the show seems to lose track of what to do with her as a character and so she receives a great many of the show's cute and comedic bits which again contrast poorly with her supposed solitary and depressed self.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main characters are fairly decent and each offer compelling enough backstory however they are often overruled by the screen time of Oz and Alice and characters like Xerxes Break don't get any real insight until pretty late into the show. All in all the main two characters were pretty poor with Oz offering a few points of redemption while the remainder of the cast was more interesting yet eclipsed by nature of their role within the story.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation I felt were pretty typical - capable of presenting the story and its characters in coherent form yet failing to do so extravagantly or in unique ways. The character designs vary from fairly muted and normal like in the cases of Oz and his uncle to fairly outlandish such as Break and the Cheshire Cat though all of them fit well within the gothic aesthetic established by the show and so at the very least the style present is consistent and in-theme. The animation itself was standard and there weren't many places where it either improved or declined and so it was safe in this way while failing to excite me as a viewer outside of a rare few instances. \\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters may have proved a source of wasted potential amidst a few infrequent successes the story is much the same though perhaps greater in scale in its dichotomy of pros and cons. Like Alice, the premise of the story and the world at first glance appears quite interesting as a great many mysteries arise early on that kept me wanting to know more all the way through - the show worked well in this way, providing engaging questions which I wanted answered. To upend this compelling attribute, the show spends very little time resolving or adding to these mysteries, only visiting them during infrequent, climactic points of the show and never concluding them in full but allowing them to hang unresolved. This would work fine if the show offered engaging beyond these mysteries with which to satisfy its viewer however this is not the case and what I found to be the most interesting part of the show trails off into obscurity while the show itself spends its time on ultimately trivial things. \\n\\n\r\nTo speak more extensively about one of the plot's major issues, the pacing of the show, especially in its latter episodes, is troublesome at worst and by the ending 3-4 episodes is outright appalling. The climax of the show arrives without any preface given to either its reason or context within the show and plays out uninterestingly with no major players or antagonists to be found despite the show featuring more than a few of these. The beginning of each episode in the final episodes of the show jumps location so often and with so little preface that it often led to the initial feeling that I had skipped an episode by accident however this was not the case and the setting of the end of the show presents itself with neither preamble nor prior reasoning. \\n\\n\r\nWith that all said and done, the show does provide an interesting set of mysteries that kept my interest but between the pacing of the show, the out of place characterization, and the overall lack of nearly any resolution the plot and story fall flat for me despite what strengths it brings to the table. \\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was far and away the strongest element of Pandora Hearts and was composed by the brilliant Kajiura Yuki. To those like me who aim to pick up this show almost entirely because of her presence in it I would say that she delivers exceedingly well however her work does not make up for the show itself. Kajirua's work goes well with the gothic aesthetic of the anime and the many strings and forlorn melodies of the soundtrack mirror the tragedy and sorrow of some of the show's major plot points beautifully. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nPandora Hearts for me was unfortunately one of those cases of wasted potential where the premise was good and the characters, at face value, could have been truly interesting and compelling in their own right but the show wasn't able to live up to what it was capable of. The main characters felt highly stereotypical for their roles as the shounen hero and heroine and offered little in redemptive qualities for their shortcomings and because of this the show felt all the more forgettable when in many other circumstances it would have avoided being so.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave Pandora Hearts a 5 because it took what could have been an interesting story with compelling characters and twisted into something less than enjoyable - the show made less and less sense as it continued on and the more interesting characters and the world itself took a backseat to the forced antics of Oz and Alice. The show might be worth a watch due to its mystery elements and its musical score however I don't feel that many viewers would arrive at the end feeling sated in any way.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Pandora Hearts to fans of mystery and more specifically fans of the gothic aesthetic as the mystery elements of the show are where it most succeeds and the visuals mirror the tone and setting well. The relationship between Alice and Oz is hardly worth picking up in a romantic sense as their are far more legitimate and entertaining stories than Pandora Hearts in this regard and the action sequences of the show are both intermittent and dull in their execution.",

            "content": "Oh, my favourite underrated anime...\r\nI have really fallen in love with this fairy tale-like, sweet story, which is at the same time very mature, sometimes dark and I cannot decide whether it's optimistic or pesimistic. I'm not even against calling this emo.\r\nCreators of all kinds will probably never get tired of the Alice in Wonderland inspiration. And there's nothing wrong about that. In this case, the character designs AND the plot are slightly inspired by it, but in the end, the story is completely original and I enjoyed every piece of it. It's the kind of story that makes you want to know, what's next,whats next?!! If you get angry because of the way they end the anime, go ahead and read the manga. You will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nI love the art... in the manga. Anime adaptation will almost never reach the quality of the manga drawing style and that's the sad reality. The result is just average. But you can still enjoy those bishounens and colorful tea parties!\\n\\n\r\nOooh, soundtrack from Yuki Kajiura. If there was nothing else, I would watch Pandora Hearts just because of this! In her older works (.hack//Sign), she used to create music which was great by itself, but it didn't work that well in combination with the anime. Later on (Kara no Kyoukai, Madoka or Fate/Zero, for example), her music started to be better in enhancing the atmosphere and didn't consume so much of your attention by itself. Which is the case of Pandora Hearts. The music is one of the strongest points here.\\n\\n\r\nI think I'm not spoiling when I say that the characters are not what they seem to be. Really, you never know, who is good and bad, or who will turn out to be the good/bad guy. They probably don't know it themselves. Actually, the concept of good and evil is one of the first things which will Pandora Hearts gladly blow up for you.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that I've given you enough reasons to watch this. I feel like I should give you also some cons, but I really cannot think of any. Oh, there is that one. It ends. And the anime end is not what the story deserves. But up to that point, it's great.",

The story was original, however, I just feel that more could have been done to develop anything in the story, yes,ANYTHING.

            "content": "Tell me, Oz. Where in the world are you? - Xerxes Break\r\nWelcome to Alice in Wonderland with anime characters! Also, we're all mad here! ^.^ Hope you have fun.\r\nWell, let's just say that it's your fifteenth birthday. It's definitely a good, fun day. You are surrounded by family and friends that love you. And when you reach the climax: BAM! Your world falls apart. You lose everything. You have no idea where you are, what's happening or what you're supposed to do. You don't really know what to believe anymore. Everything you once knew is gone. Now then, what are you going to do?\r\nStory: 8out of 10\\n\r\nPandora Hearts tells the story of a young boy named Oz Vessalius. He is the heir to one of the four Duke Houses, the most powerful families at the time. Oz turns fifteen on the first episode, and his having his coming-of-age party thingy, where he'll take the responsibilities of the Vessalius household. Then, some cloaked people appear and send him to the Abyss. The Abyss is a dark, broken toyhouse- like place. There's no order in Abyss. The people who have sinned greatly are said to be sent there. And it's an one-way trip. And what's this thing about how Oz's greatest sin is his very existence? Well, that's for him to know and for you who are reading this to find out.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 7 out of 10\\n\r\nArtwork is good, I'll give it that. Characters are very well drawn, detailed and all. Backgrounds, nope. They're all blurry, just to show that, I don't know, they're in a city, forest or something. The only place which is carefully detailed is the Abyss, which is the main location. It is literally Alice in Wonderland- like. The art gets, like literally old and like it's been kept in a dusty place sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7 out of 10\\n\r\nMusic is beautiful, fits the era and everything. It's haunting at times which fits the story and character moods. OP is good, kinda classical music. It could be just a bit more upbeat, but it's still good. EDs are a bit disappointing. The first one is pretty cool music, but it gets darker than the show needs to be and the second one is very light. Literally, bipolar disorder endings. But overall, good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 out of 10\\n\r\nThe characters are this show's strongest point. Oz is always cheerful, joking and so-called flirting. Well, beneath it all, he's shattered, and accepts things as they are, cuz he's afraid of changing them or what's going to happen if they change. He's afraid of telling people very seriously what's right and wrong, cuz he doesn't want to lose them. He gets better. Alice is a bossy, arrogant, wild and kind of sadistic girl. Most of that comes since she lived in the Abyss, but it's about to change. She starts to understand the world for what it is. Raven/Gilbert is all shrouded in black, but his personality, not really. Character worth mentioning are Xerxes Break and Vincent Nightray. Xerxes Break is an eccentric, kind of manipulative, mad hatter type character. Well, even that ain't enough to not make him the darkest of them all. Vincent, (or Vince, that's how I like calling him) Gilbert's brother is charming and sweet with everybody but horror and sadism are what identify him. There are a lot of other characters, but you'll have to see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Pandora Hearts is a good anime. I guess the reason why some people don't like it is cuz it ends without solving 80% of it. Well, that's the author's answer for, you know, buy the manga. But if you don't mind that, this anime will surely get to you. You'll be literally lost in Wonderland.",

            "content": "OK, short version, take your mouse and click the arrow to take you the other direction. \r\nGet far from this show of indecisive characters, pointless enemies, and plot holes, no plot chasms so deep you find cavemen, dinosaurs, and a cackling maniac smearing feces on turtles.\r\nI'll wait... \r\nStill here? Ok, I can understand that this is going to take a little more convincing.\r\nStory: 3\r\n     Starts out fine. Oz, a 15 year old, seemingly carefree noble is attacked at his Bar Mitzvah (j.k.) and is pulled into a world called abyss where he meets a crazy woman named Alice.  Alice isa chain, she has random weird powers and is stronger than a bunch of other chains but seems to need this kid to escape abyss.  Within 15 minutes and only one brief talk they form a blood pact, or maybe they just kiss, and escape from a interesting and truly terrifying alternate universe (by the way, they don't come back).  Poof, Oz is back, and he brought a friend (wink) however in those 15 minutes in prison, 10 years have passed.  Seriously.  Oz's best friend and servant, Gilbert, has become a man and seems to have spent the last 10 years nursing a semi for little Oz with the intent to bring him back from abyss.  \\n\r\n     Thus the great adventure begins, the cards are in order, the players are all set, onward to discover why Oz was sent to some crazy place for what seems like no reason.  On to helping Alice free herself from abyss forever and regain her lost memories.  On to, oh wait Gilbert has his master back so now...ah whatever, he'll be smart or something to help Oz and Alice.  No matter what we should get some superpower battles, intelligent plot twists, and maybe a little romance between the characters...right? \\n\r\nNo.\\n\r\nThe plot hits the ground and the resulting explosion causes the aforementioned chasm with yours truly looking for more turtles.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI don't know art, but the abyss is well done and when there are those brief moments of action they are visually appealing.  The art is not a problem but it can't help the struggling convoluted plot or crawling character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nAgain not really an expert, but I think this was Pandora Hearts best feature.  The opening was very good (I'm a sucker for percussion and violin) and the more classical background sound in scenes was a good choice for this anime, which was really trying to be a drama.  The story failed, but at least the music added some heft to individual scenes.  Also, the music when B. Rabbit comes out to fight is, it must be said, very exciting and maybe even epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nOne character must be mentioned.  The only one with a true backstory, development, and comedy (fyi, he's also crazy) Xerxes Break.  The only ray of light in the bowels of the earth. This story has parallels to Alice in Wonderland, even stealing a name, and in that context Xerxes Break is the mad hatter, enough said.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nI think its clear by now that I don't like this show. So it stands to reason that my enjoyment of this series was equivalent to grinding my eyes away with sandpaper.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nI doubt I can convince you that this isn't some a$$hole troll trying to keep you away.  For me, anime is only worth watching if 1) the characters are enjoyable, stirring, or well made 2) the plot is well written and leads somewhere, and 3) the sound and art match and add to the intended tone of the anime (or if you want to be a purist, the manga).\\n\r\nA show can be worth watching if at least two of these three conditions are met.  Unfortunately, Pandora Hearts only succeeds in the third condition, that is simply not enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you still feel that you want to give this show a try feel free, your conditions may be different or this show may personally be more your style.  It wasn't for me.",

We have dukedoms who strive to protect the world from this dark other-worldly dimension known as the Abyss and the creatures or \"chains\" that escape from it.  We follow the main character, Oz, as his life is intertwined with a fate he can't escape after his coming-of-age ceremony.  He meets a chain named Alice and from then on nothing is ever the same.  I liked this anime because I found the story to be unique.  You have a world filled with darkness, yet you have characters, suchas Oz, who strive to find the light.  With that said, the characters are all complicated and unique in their own way, each somehow tied with the darkness slowly engulfing the world.  The story moves at a smooth pace, though in all honesty, the end is a bit rushed and then it just falls flat.  However, if you find yourself a fan of this anime, I highly recommend the manga, which is absolute perfection and my all-time favorite hands down no questions asked.",

But in the end, there will be a satisfaction about the story.\r\nART (9): Some Character designs are very common but some are also standouts especially the characters that were adapted from Alice in Wonderland. Square Enix is responsible for animation so no doubt its good as well.\r\nSOUND(10): The show has beautiful background music and some catchy tunes as well. The background music is very reminiscent of Tsubasa Chronicles, an anime that was lauded for its musical score. The 2ND ED Theme is a favorite of mine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8): Diversity in character personalities is somewhat limited. Most of them have half-serious and half- comedic characteristics but all in all it works on the characters and their physical design.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9): I enjoyed the series. At first the story is somewhat confusing but when you get to the end, you will be satisfied on it was finished. Remember that patience is always rewarded. Try watching Pandora Hearts.

            "content": "Summary: This is one of those anime that you will shed a tear over finishing. It was just SO damn good. I am not a huge manga fan but I am most certainly going to figure out where the anime left off and read the rest of the manga because they've setup such an amazing story I absolutely need to know where it ends. That unfortunately is the one major flaw with this piece, it was so good but stopped too early. There is a ton left uncovered and though it ended in acceptable place I think they could have wrapped it up a bitbetter. One thing I will say is the big reveal in the final episode... I saw that coming from the second episode and were glad they through it in because I feared you would never know. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's epic, hands down. There is a ton of mystery, lots of amazing concepts, and a cool and mysterious concept. How does Alice relate to the Will of the Abyss. How does Jack play into everything. What are the true motivations of the Baskervilles. What is the deal with Vincent? There are just a few of the many questions you will learn about. If you like a slowly unfolding mystery with a hint of fighting and a splash of darkness you will enjoy this. Also, the fact that a lot of the themes are slight homages to Alice and wonderland (expect to see Alice, Chesire Neko, the Mad Hatter and others) is interesting, even if the story really isn't about Alice in Wonderland.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's good but nothing amazing. I liked the diversity of character models but the art is a bit dated for how epic the show is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI am a HUGE fan of metal intros (think Absolute Duo, Trinity Soul) but this is the best intro song an anime has ever had. I found myself watching the intro at least twice between every single episode. The OST is enchanting and I suggest checking it out. They use the music to very strongly amplify the mood of important scenes; kudos to the sound director this is epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI liked them all. They each had their own unique personalities and quirks and I loved getting to know each of them. Each character grows and evolves substantially and even though they are often lighthearted and silly that just helps to get to know them better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI looked forward to every episode. I had quite a few VERY late nights watching this after work. I actually stopped at 23/25 for about 4 days because I was going to be so sad it was over. The story paces itself well, unfolding bits and pieces of mystery and character development at a very nice pace. There is shocking twists spread throughout, even up through the last 10 minutes of the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved it. I highly suggest if this genre even remotely interests you that you give this a chance. It was a LOT of fun and I am looking forward to unfolding the rest of the story via the manga. Enjoy!",

We've got altogether different people who create scenes of and outcomes of such ambiguity that they could not even be solved within a series (season, if ever). My favorite character? Rufus Barma.\r\nUnfortunately, the emotional impact that satisfied me in the manga was not as strong as in this anime. All I saw was a blur of scenes that I don't even bother to rewatch. Perhaps this is also for the sake of ambiguity?\r\nThe animation is a common flaw ofEnix wherein they mix very good stills with drafted ones. However, they've adapted Mochizuki's art, particularly his shadowing technique, which I think gave more impact on the scenes wherein they were used.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of Yuki Kajiura's work, I had enjoyed listening to her contribution for the OST. Particularly those tracks that feature FictionJunction. Again, it is Wakana's voice that sets the tone for their chorals.\\n\\n\r\nI would generally recommend that this anime would have another season and that the omake should be watched in between episodes, for motivation.\\n\r\nRating: 75%",

What is his connection with Glen Baskerville?\" and a lot more. Including my main question \"What will happen to Oz and Alice once the seal is completed? Will they be dragged into the Abbys?

Pandora Hearts is a soft adaption of Alice in Wonderland with a huge twist. The complexity of it all is beautiful, and the overall tone of the story is unlike any other. \r\nThe music is a 10/10. The melody of the music box is beautiful, and the background music for each scene is very appropriate. There is something haunting about the music and it fits well with the beautiful plot. \r\nThe art is a 5/10. After reading the plot,you almost expect something as stunning as the artwork of Fate/Zero. However, the artwork is not great, and the action scenes have don't have very much that went into them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development is 1/10. Viewers are not lead to feel very strongly about any of the characters. The characters are shrouded in mystery until the very end of episode 25 and we don't fully understand their backstories. The only reason you care is due to the heavy mystery... which is not resolved in this anime. The dialogue is confusing and awful, and it is very forced. \\n\\n\r\nPlot execution is a 2/10. For episodes 1-7, episodes 11-15 and episodes 21-22. The execution is beautiful. However, for the other episodes, there is forced comedy with a horrible attempt at character development. It creates a huge distance between the plot and characters. Not well executed at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had a strong start, but it had huge ups and downs with a less than satisfying ending. The anime is not at all average due to the plot, however. It seems the producers of the anime did not take the time to make this anime as great as it could've been. \\n",

            "content": "When you are just a kid, you hear some fairy tales about dragon and knight; and of course some famous stories like Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland. And for Alice, is about a story where a girl call Alice found some sort of hole and accidentally she fell in Wonderland.\r\nAnd with this story, it spans motion media: like notably Disney 1951 color animation film and later this year 2010 Tim Burton version of Alice (here we call Alice in Horrorland! LOL) \r\nSpeaking of childhood and movie experience, time for my review on my experience with Xebec anime adaption of Pandore Hearts.\r\nFor shortintro, Pandora Hearts is create by mangaka Mochizuki Jun; and the manga is base on Alice in Wonderland with the only thing is that: Alice is not the main lead, though she is the main female lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Oz Vessalius, the heir of the Vessalius Dukedom who going to become 15 and is undergo a ceremony to celebrate his coming age. Unfortunately, his little party was crash by the Basketville Dukedom. So he was send to the Abyss (something like the deepest level in hell) for his 'so-call sins' for out of no reason. Down there, he got out with the help of Black Rabbit Alice. As she also want to got out to find the fragment of her past memory.\\n\\n\r\nJust as i start watching it, i happen to compare another anime/manga which somehow similar to Pandora: That's Nabari no Ou. Here's why:\\n\\n\r\n-The main character is a helpless whimp, a plot device\\n\r\n-They are searching something together with the other main lead\\n\r\n-Supporting character are powerful character, the main character is a weakling\\n\\n\r\nAnd luckily, Pandora is not another Nabari.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot in Pandora is not device driven, but character driven. At the start of the series, you were introduce mostly the basic in Pandora: the Abyss, the 4 Noble Dukedom, Chain. But as the series goes, you were introduce even more of the character. Plus, you find out that mostly the character that Oz come across are some how tie in to the most important event that was set way back ago. Means you will get fragment by fragment, pieces by pieces from the character back stories and put them together in your head. It can be annoying and confusing, but you will start questioning what is going on. That's Pandora strong point but also one of their weakness, because mostly these character you seen are involved and then later come and gone. You might forget the last character you seen and focusing the new one. So pay attention if you don't want to get mess up.\\n\\n\r\nThe character in Pandora were a least better than Nabari, actually the main lead. Oz from start was a happy go lucky fellow, accept what was here now; with a fake smile. He was a useless whimp from start but starting a least episode 19, 20 that's where FINALLY he become a real main character, changing from motion less device to a moving device. Of course he couldn't done it alone to get here, you also get other like Gil, Sharon, Break and other. But for Break, though he just a supporting character, but he play out being a very fun making but yet wise with some past agenda character. I also like seiyuu Ishida Akira how he make Break a fun looking man. One of my favorite character in Pandora. Other i find completely annoying and needless like Oz uncle, and Alice; the character i though is gonna be cool but yet annoy. Though Kawasumi Ayako put a good work on Alice voice role but her character felt like only knows how to bitch around that she is great and powerful (Sorry, no offense), but she is powerful and cool too. Mostly when you come across the series; you find some of the character from the classic Alice in Wonderland are being stylize by the hand of Mochizuki-sensei. The Rabbit, Alice, Mad Hatter, Cheshire Cat, by so far is the character i know from the classic Alice that are related or appear in a different form. \\n\\n\r\nAnd overall on the character, only i see Oz who have good change on his personalty while the rest are just taking a few step for change.\\n\\n\r\nVisual presentation for Pandora should be vital because we talk about 'English Gothic Visual', something like Kuroshisuji. Mochizuki-sensei was able pull up the 'light version' of Kuroshisuji in the manga, but Xebec was able to pull those pretty visual in it. From the character clothes, Chain, even the house was good enough presented here. Is like 'Alice in Fantasy-Manga-land' unlike Tim Burton version.\\n\\n\r\nVisually disappointed was the action scene, to watch the whole series with poorly animated action is like torment in my boring-ness. Xebec, maybe not the type of studio that's is well animated action; is watching Naruto: they cross blade for 10 sec. then later enter a whole minute of needless talk (in Naruto, WORST! the whole god-damm 10,15 minute) and they fight for a few sec. or enter another desperate talk scene or whatever annoying stuff they can put. But luckily to say a least is that normal character animation was decent enough to watch and some of the gimmick in show was good and funny. Enough to keep you entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, no need to say: KAIJURA YUKI-SAMA!!!!!!!!! FICTION JUNCTION!!!!!!! SAVAGE GENIUS!!!!!!! need review on that?......OK, maybe some commented:\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say Kaijura-sama who knows doing Kara no Kyoukai OST is here being the main composer for Pandora. You get nostalgic feel from hearing Kaijura-sama trademark symphony music with modern music fusion and of course a perfect music to fit one of the gentle/sadden/other good  moment in Pandora. The opening by FICTION, though i admit is not my favorite but i applaud their vocal. So i skip that every time is start. (Sorry...^^) The 2 ending by Savage Genius was enough to put a ring on my ear. The 1st ending was a bit rush but with with the keyboard in the music makes it catching in my hearing; the 2nd ending was smooth and sentimental, makes a perfect ending to the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the show is like time machine ride where you travel to the past and present and the unthinkable. As you gone through those time you collect piece of the puzzle and you put them together into picture. Unfortunately, that picture is incompletely. Pandora anime left out some of mysteries that are yet to uncover. But thankfully no, as to follow and respect the original manga story line (I don't know Xebec are following that). And a least Xebec is a smart ass to wrap the whole anime with their own anime conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nPandora Heart anime was not a great anime, but a good anime that should decent to watch and enjoy. Though the boring action scene, Alice bitching around, or some left out conclusion. But the story about the boy who fell and meet 'Alice in the Abyss' was something you might find it fantasize and don't forget the pretty visual that are shown through the series.",

The visual descriptions of the characters, the subtle humor that's depicted, the soft but memorizing music, and most of all the concept of the plot. \r\nI found it very fascinating for a show like this to have such great quality with themes and have a good story line. I loved all the characters and found humorous bits actually funny. \r\nHowever the ending disappoint me for many reasons. I did not like how choppyit seemed and it left out so many details among the characters. The show ends up having all these loose ends having no where to tie them. A big disappointment indeed. But before the ending I loved it's sound, the art and it all leads up to a great theme with a great story and great characters. Two thumbs up.",

It follows him into the Abyss where he meets Alice. They together search for her memories and discover the secrets of the Four Great Houses.\r\nThe animation and soundtrack was okay but nothing stellar. If you are only basing the anime on this, then you are in the wrong place.\r\nHowever, if you are watching for the deeper story and characters then you are in the right place!\r\nThe character development is good. You learn the origin and history ofeach character. There aren't many unnecessary characters and they all have some role to play in the story. Even the more minor characters are receiving at least some development. You also understand where all the characters are coming from and the experiences that they've gone through.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Pandora Hearts overall. They were always adding new elements and details to the story. When you think the story is going one way, there is always an element of surprise and many plot twists! The producers always threw in a curve ball.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of potential but didn't pull through all the way. I first watched the anime and really liked what was going on but it ended abruptly.\\n\r\nWith only 25 episodes, you only get a fraction of the overall story.  I definitely recommend the manga (which is a definite 10) to anyone who reads it. To anyone who liked the anime, you should definitely continue on to get the full story. The manga will not disappoint!",

            "content": "Well to begin Pandora heart has a certain great originality from it and by borrowing from a great universe like alice in wonderland it makes the world thats in it even more interesting. \r\nThe story in some ways can be confusing because they give you bits you might wanted to know earlier as the anime goes on. The pace is good and natural with a good combination of humor , talking and fight scenes. One might say that the story has a little bit of madness in it that can be hard to follow but the method behind this madness will show itself.  Theentire aspect of the abyss as they call it was one of the things that really pulled me in as i watched it and how the rules and contract worked. I think as you watch the anime you will have questions that keep popping up but i promise that when one watches it you will get most of them answered in different ways.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor me what adds to how interesting this anime is the great soundtrack that follows it. It has everything from goofy sounding ones to great battle music to beautiful yet sad ones. If you feel like you recognise some of the types of music that might be  because you have watched anime like Tsubasa chronicle there the composer is the same and that makes it even better and deepens the understanding on why the music in this anime is so great. \\n\\n\r\nFor me who really loves alice in wonderland i find few characters i dont get slight exited abiout seeing and how their portrayed in different ways.\\n\r\nThe main characters would be Oz Bezarius and Alice. Oz is slight cliche in a sence that he feels like a weak character that always needs to be protected kinda like kuroshitsuji/ Black Butler. Yet he has a distant and almost dead personality which he has gotten from his younger days. Alice is a character who takes on the role of Oz protector in some ways but she also argues and have heir own opinions combined with a slight childish personality. But she is as many characterrs in this anime interesting in many ways that will be seen as one watches the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIm bias in many ways but i enjoyed this anime alot. It got the creepy and yet interesting story combined with characters that are all interesting in their different ways. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the review i think i have stated every reason for loving this anime and i struggle to find bad points about it. But there are times there i felt that a better explanation would be better or that the mc could grow some extra balls and not always be a damsel in distress. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i hesitant about giving it a 9 although i really feel it deserves it but there are parts of me that makes me want to give it a 8 because it has parts that i might have liked better in other ways.",

Alice kicks some serious butt throught the series andis by far the most intresting character because she is somewhat a mystery untill the middle to end of the series. This series gives off a demented almost horror like theme but that makes it so great from the fighting scenes to the bits of romance and comedy this series is great and has everything any horror/romance and action lover would want but the series also has a deep story line and many lovable characters. Love alice in wonderland? This series is almost like a more demented version of it and its also much deeper and much more interesting and it has all your lovable characters like Alice,The mad hatter and the cheshire cat (A much hotter verison of it XP) I reccomend this anime to everyone because its outstanding in everyway\\n\r\n Thanks for reading hope you enjoy Pandora hearts!!!!",

            "content": "This anime is quite amazing. The way how the story is developing in every episode makes want to see more and more. The story is about Oz. Oz is the hair of the dukes house and he turn fifteen years old when suddenly he ends up knowing nothing about his self and the people that surround him. \r\nOz is trying to figure out the connection between him and the girl he (Alice) meets in the will of the abyss but that is one of the mysteries he is trying to solve. Many are the characters that are getting involve in Oz's story and the plotis getting more and more mysterious as you move towards the end of the anime. Oz is also struggling to find his origin and the fact that his father was always blaming Oz for being born into this world is a fact that makes the story to complicated but at the same time very interesting and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI also loved the sound tracks of this series. I could say that the music played in this series is maybe the best of what iv heart up until now in shows. Its interesting to listen to these tracks and to see how they manage to keep you in a state of agony and suspense in order for us to keep on watching Pandora Hearts. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this series are quite interesting despite the fact that i personally dislike the way Oz is presented in Pandora Hearts. Oz is presented as a young noble who desires to know about his past and origin. Oz is always trying to protect his only friend and servant Gilbert who always cares, obey and protects his master. I personal would like to see Oz as a character that would take main part in the scenes where action takes place. Meaning that unfortunately his a  most of the times but he is also unaware of the incidences taking place in the series due to the fact that he has that desire to know first of all about his self. Who he is ? Why he was born ? \\n\\n\r\nGilbert is a brave young man ready to be sacrificed for his master. Later on the story he acquires a power fro the will of the abyss and he becomes Raven.    \\n\\n\r\nAlice is the girl that is bound with Oz, she is somehow the reason for Oz's existence. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough i don't wanna say anything more in order not to spoil you guys i would like to say few things about the weaknesses and the positive things about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nweaknesses: Weak ending, the ending was indeed disappointing due to the fact that many questions about the hero adnd the story are left unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nPros: Perfect developed story\\n\r\n- Series that combine almost everything >>> Drama, Action, Comedy, Romance, Psychological, Supernatural, Fantasy.",

Truly you would want to watch the season 2 because in this season, it's like not much questions were answered, but they have established relationships of characters.\r\n[A/N: You might agree or not with all the thingsI wrote down here, but of course, this is my opinion, I would love to hear you opinion as well. =)\\n\r\nPlease excuse any incorrect grammar, etc. And thanks for reading!\\n\r\n-black faerie, Yui]\\n",

That's why I'm copy pasting it so people can see it in my current, hopefully not-3-hours long profile.\r\nTell me, Oz. Where in the world are you? - Xerxes Break\r\nWelcome to Alice in Wonderland with anime characters! Also, we're all mad here! ^.^ Hope you have fun.\r\nWell, let's just say that it's your fifteenth birthday. It's definitely a good, fun day. You are surrounded by family and friends that love you. And when you reach the climax: BAM! Your world falls apart. Youlose everything. You have no idea where you are, what's happening or what you're supposed to do. You don't really know what to believe anymore. Everything you once knew is gone. Now then, what are you going to do?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 out of 10\\n\r\nPandora Hearts tells the story of a young boy named Oz Vessalius. He is the heir to one of the four Duke Houses, the most powerful families at the time. Oz turns fifteen on the first episode, and his having his coming-of-age party thingy, where he'll take the responsibilities of the Vessalius household. Then, some cloaked people appear and send him to the Abyss. The Abyss is a dark, broken toyhouse- like place. There's no order in Abyss. The people who have sinned greatly are said to be sent there. And it's an one-way trip. And what's this thing about how Oz's greatest sin is his very existence? Well, that's for him to know and for you who are reading this to find out.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 7 out of 10\\n\r\nArtwork is good, I'll give it that. Characters are very well drawn, detailed and all. Backgrounds, nope. They're all blurry, just to show that, I don't know, they're in a city, forest or something. The only place which is carefully detailed is the Abyss, which is the main location. It is literally Alice in Wonderland- like. The art gets, like literally old and like it's been kept in a dusty place sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7 out of 10\\n\r\nMusic is beautiful, fits the era and everything. It's haunting at times which fits the story and character moods. OP is good, kinda classical music. It could be just a bit more upbeat, but it's still good. EDs are a bit disappointing. The first one is pretty cool music, but it gets darker than the show needs to be and the second one is very light. Literally, bipolar disorder endings. But overall, good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 out of 10\\n\r\nThe characters are this show's strongest point. Oz is always cheerful, joking and so-called flirting. Well, beneath it all, he's shattered, and accepts things as they are, cuz he's afraid of changing them or what's going to happen if they change. He's afraid of telling people very seriously what's right and wrong, cuz he doesn't want to lose them. He gets better. Alice is a bossy, arrogant, wild and kind of sadistic girl. Most of that comes since she lived in the Abyss, but it's about to change. She starts to understand the world for what it is. Raven/Gilbert is all shrouded in black, but his personality, not really. Character worth mentioning are Xerxes Break and Vincent Nightray. Xerxes Break is an eccentric, kind of manipulative, mad hatter type character. Well, even that ain't enough to not make him the darkest of them all. Vincent, (or Vince, that's how I like calling him) Gilbert's brother is charming and sweet with everybody but horror and sadism are what identify him. There are a lot of other characters, but you'll have to see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Pandora Hearts is a good anime. I guess the reason why some people don't like it is cuz it ends without solving 80% of it. Well, that's the author's answer for, you know, buy the manga. But if you don't mind that, this anime will surely get to you. You'll be literally lost in Wonderland.",

            "content": "The story in this anime is a creative and refreshing one, albeit odd at times. It does a good job of keeping you in suspense of whats to come while giving you action that is first class. While not ground breaking the action is always a thing of beauty (if you think that sort of thing is beautiful). But to be honest the main reason why the action is the first thing that comes to my mind is because what made it so spectacular is the musical arrangement by Yuki Kajiura. Now let me state that I'm a huge fan of her work, the wayshe captivates you through a simple song is amazing, but when I first hear this song play in the background of the first fight I instantly looked up the song and wanted to just hear the song as an OST. This was my first time hearing Yuki Kajiura's music. Even the opening song is a top notch anime song that is among my favorites.\\n\r\nBut other than the music I love the interactions between our main characters Alice and Oz. The way the two interact is just so fun to watch and I honestly can't decide which character I prefer.\\n\r\nNow this anime certainly has some odd things that happen, most obviously the odd connection to Wizard of OZ, which to my knowledge has no connection to the book or the movie at all. (maybe it has some connection to Alice In Chains, but that is even more unlikely)\\n\r\nEither way this is a great anime worth a watch any day in my book, its weird and has unexpected turns that keep you interested from beginning to end. Though, at least for me, what really makes this anime so great is the music.\\n\r\nThanks Yuki Kajiura! Keep making amazing songs that we can all enjoy.",

            "content": "The first powerful episodes which introduced the exciting setting and the villains left me hooked! I loved how the hero was thrown in an alternate dimension and had to fight his way out of there. Despite being young, the hero managed to leave a good and noble impression. I couldn't wait for the next episode. The excitement continued for some time but eventually it started to gradually dissappear.\r\nLet me give you a overview of my ratings:\r\nStory (7): At first the story was good. Noble houses, hell-like dimension, mysterious clocks, everything seemed good. Then, however, the things started piling up and interest became confusion. And theend just screamed for \"we don't have a lot of time, let's finish this anime quickly!\" and then there were these parts and episodes which I can only classify as fillers because they just messed with the characters and whatever they tried, it ended up being boring istead.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8): Nice Victorian era Europe, my personal favourite style. All the characters were beautifully made too. Artists obviously thought they were funny because they used some kind of strange shaders(?) on the girls heads and what's even stranger, they changed their colours during the anime. So often girls would have blue stripes across their hair. Can't really say more because I watched a fansub release with really shitty raws claiming to be 720p.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): I liked the pocketwatch song and the violin part in the OP. Everything else was boring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6): At first they were worth a 8 but then as with everything else in the anime, it became confusing. Who is who? Why are they hiding it? In the end, every character remained a mystery (not in the good way) and in addition all of them changed their attitudes many times. For example Alice was torn between being a bitch and being a \"companion\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): Well I watched it till the end and it got my fantasy working. That's all I need from an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAdd it together and you have 7.\\n\\n\r\nI alsa love how they introduced the cool idea of the contractor getting hurt when the chain does and then just forgot about it for the rest of the show. Also, how an illegal contractor would die when the chain is slain but later in the show an illegal contractor just fainted after his chain was defeated. There were probably a lot of other bad things I didn't mention but I'll let you find them out yourself.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the first half of the show was good, sometimes even very good but at one time the series just degenerated and it makes me question if the whole team making Pandora Hearts was replaced. A good anime but had potential to be better.",

This is somehow good, but there is some norm to that and it was broken. I had so many questions to this fable, and those questions wasn't answered, so I decided to not watch this anime.\r\nDrawing is also horrible. It is new anime, but drawing is still in old style or just because of using bad rendering system.\r\nSound was somehow better than else but it loops; it was strange noises, so there is also minus. \r\nCharacter or maybe \"characters\", I still don't know... Anyway Ozis very annoying. Xerxes is a girl or a boy? He sound like a man, but who knows... He was stranger, that is sure. Gilbert - another example from the family of Xerxes, just like twin. Alice is just a milf in younger body :D\\n\\n\r\nThis is strange in this anime - hairs, faces, silhouettes, personalities was treated like shoujo anime. Some just in manly bodies.\\n\r\nI couldn't take it anymore, so, I dropped this anime after 3 eposides\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy by watching whose 3 episodes. Hopefully, that I knew, that this way it would be so bad.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway...I've spend more time to write this, than by watching this ;)\\n\r\nFinal score is 4",

The main protagonist, a kid with spunk, clearly outclasses Shinji in both class and personality. The main antagonist is really great to, reminding me of deep characters such as griffith from berserk, or Dio from Jojo's bizzare adventure.

A couple of big reveals occur during the 24 episodes, but the pacing of the showis completely lost around episodes 10-14. If the show were separated in two, I would probably rate the first season a solid 8 or 9. However, it seems pretty obvious that the script was simply not finished, so the show goes from solving a mystery to solving suicidal tendencies and completely forgetting why the characters were doing what they were doing in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nI decided to view this immediately after watching Zetsuen no Tempest, which I fount absolutely amazing. Perhaps the negative aspects of Pandora Hearts are more visible due to that, but if I had to choose between these two somewhat similar shows, there would be no shadow of a doubt that I'd pick Zetsuen no Tempest.",

            "content": "First envision the classic image of wonderland. You might recall the Mad Hatter's crazy tea parties, the Queens obsession with head removal, Alice's curiosity, or all of the funny creatures such as the Doormouse, March hare, Jabberwock. All of these familiar characters become monsters, namely 'chains.' These chains can fight on their contractors behalf, in a twisted dark version of wonderland where everyone is trying to unravel a great and mysterious tragedy from years ago.\r\nThe contractors are all quite loveable, and they each have their own unique set of flaws and struggles, and all the while their chains mirror their personalities.\r\nHaving read the manga, Iwill say that the anime does not quite reach the same depth, and it is much darker. However if you have read the manga and would like to see the characters personalities in motion, it is more comedic than dark, and it seems to focus more on the filler scenes from the manga, tacking on a rather slapdash ending. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you haven't read the manga, it is still a fun watch, but you get merely a taste of the chaos that the manga contains. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Yuji Kajiura is phenomenal, and makes of for some of the flaws of Xebec.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is tremendously well done, all the voices exactly as I would imagine them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an entertaining show!",

It's not only an adventure, fantasy, supernatural anime but somehow, I think it also involves a LOT of mystery. Every time you watch an episode, there would always be questions you would ask and the answers that will be revealed later on are very unpredictable. This is also one of the reasons why I was so attached in watching it. It was kind of a waste that the ending did not suit the whole anime.\r\nArt 10\r\nI don't need to explainthis so much but I think the art's very good. Each character looks attractive and each dimension of every world are very well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nI love the music. From the comedic scenes, the climatic ones, the creepy atmosphere, and everything. The music was very well suited to each kind of scenes and they were all greatly composed. (I loved Lacie's melody so muchhhh)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nThis is the very first anime where I liked ALL of the characters. From the major ones to the minor ones. They were all unique in every way. The seiyuus were also good too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nBefore when I had asked for anime recommendations, people recommended me to watch Pandora Hearts so I watched it. Now, I recommend everyone to watch this anime if you want adventure, fantasy, mystery and shippable characters (no romance).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "This anime is like a huge fly trap for me. As soon as I watched the first episode, I was hooked, and I couldn't get off. Finishing the anime in one night, I moved onto the manga the next day. The anime itself is amazing. I love the soundtracks, especially the one played by the Pocket Watch (Lacie). The plot line is something I would never be able to come up with. It has a lot of twists and turns, and overall, be a bit confusing, but that's what makes it amazing. Even with the confusion, its plot line can be very straight forward. Although,the ending was very abrupt, and left many questions unanswered, it was just extremely good. Now that I've moved onto the manga, many questions that I wondered have finally been answered, but with answers, more questions pop up. I really enjoyed this anime overall. But, there are some things I wish I could change. I would love to add a more romantic relationship between Alice and Oz. I find those two adorable, and I think a a bond of love would make the storyline even greater. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite characters would be Xerxes Break. His character is kind of what Alice calls him. A clown. A twisted one, at that. His character is so carefree, yet also very dangerous and intimidating. I love this character because he'll always smile in a fight, whether hes winning or losing. \\n\\n\r\nAnother one of my favorite characters is Alice. Alice is a very abnormal character. This obsessive meat eater's personality changes so quick, I find it enjoyable. First, she'll be afraid, next she'll be angry, happy, and then sad. All in a mere 5 minutes. The main reason why I absolutely love her is because of how adorable she is. When I saw her cry, I felt like crying myself.",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts Review \u2665\r\nPlot :: There is something really special about this. Although the plot includes elements and themes from other works, like Alice In Wonderland, \u00a0it also has it's own originality added into the mix that gives it a spark! Many elements are deprived from the Victorian era, gothic, and a dark fantasy feel. \u00a0I truly enjoyed the story presented in Pandora Hearts. However, a lot of details aren't given away to you upfront and sometimes you will become utterly confused about certain situations. There are many plot twists. \u00a0But I love how it keeps you guessing. The story feels like it was reallywell thought out. The plot twists don't feel forced or rushed. The only negatives I have with it is the pacing can be a bit slow and explanations are usually vague, only to be explained much later. Its hard to explain much about the plot since it becomes more complicated as you travel further. You would need to find out for yourself. Overall, I absolutely love the plot!! I give it a score of 9/10 {Great!}\u00a0\\n\\n\r\n*Note* The story doesn't end at episode 22. The Manga series is ongoing, so if you want to find out what happens next, I would suggest reading the manga! :] The ending of the Anime doesn't give a clear solution and isn't complete. \u00a0The rest of the story is covered in the Manga and it reviles the mysteries in a creative matter!\\n\\n\r\nArt :: For the most part, I think the artwork and style is beautiful. I love the character designs and drawing style used. As for animation, it certainly wasn't the most smooth or vivid. It appeared to have an old fashioned sort of look, which suits the anime's theme well. At times the animation is a bit choppy and inconsistent, but I wouldn't say it's awful. \u00a0At times the animation improves while other times it dips in quality. For some this may be bothersome, but I found I didn't have much of an issue with it. I give art an animation a score of 7/10 {Good}\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound :: The music consists of instrumentals that remind me of a theater presentation. The opening and ending \u00a0themes are beautiful and I like many of the background music in the show. At times though, music can be a bit too loud and drowned out voices. However, this doesn't happen to often, but I noticed it. Pandora Hearts has a nice soundtrack. (: \u00a0For voice acting, I would say is pretty good!! Sometimes the quality of the recordings can dip as well, but overall I don't have much complaints about sound! ^-^ \u00a0The Anime is only done with Japanese dubs, so their is no English dubs available, just English subs. I give music and sound a score of 7/10 {Good}\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :: I think the characters have something really special. They aren't completely generic or overly cliched. They present interesting personalities. I found myself enjoying many of the characters in the story. I give characters a score of 8/10 {Very Good!}\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment :: All in All, I love this Anime. I think the true heart of this series lies within the captivating story and variety of characters, these are the strongest points within Pandora Hearts and what I fell in love with. \u00a0This is why PH has become a favorite Anime of mine. I would recommend reading the Manga series as well. The story gets better and the twists are carried out beautifully. The artwork is also stunning!!",

            "content": "Story (7/10):\r\nI can't spoil and I won't. But this story is pretty good, till you get to the end. After episode 25 you think something like: \"Ok... the end, what happens next.\" You are going to search for season two, but there isn't one. I think a good story is about wondering. What will happen next? Why do characters do the things they do? Why is the world as it is? You begin your story with a little kid that plays with his sister and looks every part the innocent, na\u00efve person. Then you hear that he has done something terrible. That kind of momentsmade the story for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nI am a sucker for this kind of things. Te explain myself, I am going to redirect you towards the outfits of Xerxes and Alice. They look awesome. The world itself looks like any normal world, but the clothing has a high level of design. Really, for the people that love cosplay, here is your anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhy not a 10? The music is made by Yuki Kajiura. She makes beautifull music, doesn't matter what kind of anime you're watching. I think the soundtrack is just what it has to be. At times that you get a magnificent fight, the music is energetic. At the time that Oz has a nervous breakdown, the music is sad. The music really makes the anime better. And if that happens, the music deserves a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nThis I can defend with ease. The best part of this show are the characters. They are all different, hate eachoter, love eachother. If you want a relaxed superhero, you can get it. If you like little boys, you can have it. If you like someone who likes little boys, yeah, you get the point.  I will tell something about the characters and you have to decide if you think about them like I do.\\n\\n\r\nOz Bezarius: When I first saw him, I hated him. He was childish, ignorant, na\u00efve and he wanted to save everyone. But actually they are good characteristics and he is a perfect protagaonist. He has strong ideals and a sense of justice. But the best part about watching him, is seeing him move on. It doesn't matter what is thrown at him, he just marches on. In that way he even go me to like him.\\n\\n\r\nAlice: Yeah, what to say about a rabit who eats meat. She is arrogant, strong, possesive. She always calls Oz her manservant and Break Clown, she also calls Raven Seaweed-head. Her world is pretty clear. She always has something to say and she doesn't look back. This gives a nice contrast with Oz. You have Oz, a happy-sad boy on one side and Alice, an agressive, possesive rabit-girl on the other side. \\n\\n\r\nRaven: Mysterious, a loner, someon who doesn't want to be known. Or at least, that's what he at first looks like. Just put him in the same room with Alice and he shows his true colours. Just steal his hat and you will see what for kind of person he is. He and Alice always fight. They both want Oz to love them. But they have a common enemy, Xerxes Break. When you see them fight, you almost think of something as a brother-sister relationship. It's almost cute. Raven isn't interesting to watch, it are his relations with other people in the show that make him interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nXerxes Break: The last person I'm going to talk about. He alone gets a 10 out of 10 every time I see him. He is maybe the best character I have ever seen. You don't know much about him, but you see him act and the more he acts, the more you understand him. He is happy, teasing and he likes candy, but at the same time he is sad, angry, chaotic and coughs up blood. It's mostly his aura that fools you. When you see him, you think he is a clown, like Alice says, but if you see him fight against Cheshire, you don't know what to think. Is he really that strong? And that even gets worse when he is surrounded. He doesn't feel powerfull, but when you see him fight, you see that he is powerfull. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nSeeing the characters is fun, but the end ruins it. It's as simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nIf this show had a better ending, it would have gotten a 10 and I wouldn't have hesitated to say that this was the best anime ever. The characters were deep, the sound good. The ending ruined it. If you would like to see a better ending, or if you want to know more about any of the characters, read the manga. It's actually the better of the two, no discussion.",

            "content": "First thing I have to say, this anime deserves better rating. I really enjoyed this one. Such a pity that there won't be a second season. To be honest, I don't like manga at all. I think manga is really boring and it annoys me to read that, not to hear sounds, music, not to see colors and movement. However this anime. I just cannot stay like that. This anime might force me to read the manga. In other words, I was totally caught by this anime.\r\nI found this anime very similar to Kuroshitsuji, Madoka Magica, Noir etc. Dark atmosphere and very interesting transformation ofthe main hero who is trying to  reveal the past and the future of all the mysteries around him. \\n\\n\r\nThere are few very good personal stories that made me think about my own life. And not just about mine. The characters are funny and cool but they all hide something inside their souls. Something dark (not evil just covered in darkness) that is waiting to be revealed. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes were quite good. Not the best I have seen but not the worst either. A bit above average I would say. But one very important thing. The soundtrack. Oh my... Yuki Kajiura is one of the best composers I know. Not talking just about anime. Her music is really amazing and brings the real epicness to this anime (not only in this one though). I actually looked for this anime because of the music from it that I heard somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo the result. This anime is definitely worth watching for everyone who likes dark anime with some deep thoughts. Only one thing is that there is no season two. But that changes nothing about the awesomeness of this piece. \\n\\n\r\nOh one important thing I forgot to mention. If you like stories like Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz, you will definitely enjoy this anime ^^. Heh just look at the names of two main characters and there is more, much moreeeee...",

            "content": "Pandora Hearts was a very pleasant surprise; I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. This is shonen done right. I'd like to note that I haven't read the manga yet, but am eager to do so now.\r\nIn particular, I was impressed with the character development (especially with the protagonist Oz). While I believe many of the characters have some good development and backstory, Oz's character was a joy to watch. You'll see people acknowledging how he is able to \"accept things as they are\" during the first half of the series or so, meaning he is rather complacent. He also alwaysacts so cheerful and relatively carefree that as a I didn't even realize how much pain and confusion he was harboring until later in the series (as a viewer that impresses me). To me this showed a realistic representation of a troubled, confused person. Many anime series tend to overdramatize characters' angst, and while it is apparent that Oz has some chips on his shoulders, I found myself really feeling for him. It is wonderful to see him grow and change during the series. He gains respect for himself, which was so fantastic to watch. I realize this description may sound rather confusing to someone who isn't familiar with the series, so I'll stop here. I think you just need to watch and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've read online this anime follows the manga rather closely, which I can very much respect. Often times I find anime series catch up with the manga's story, and then the people behind the anime create some sort of plot to complete the show that often feels out of place (one of the exceptions to this that I can think of off the top of my head is Fullmetal Alchemist). So while I very much respect how they decided to end the anime, it also does leave a lot of loose ends both with the plot and some characters. To me, this just means that I want to pick up the manga to continue the story.\\n\\n\r\nI'll also note that opening theme and a lot of the background music is very good and catchy. The animation is nice too, although it does use some sort of texture (I think??) or something to enhance the Victorian/artistocratic-like era of the story. I'm afraid I can't really describe it better than that, my apologies.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this series. Now I want to read the manga! (If only it was available for iPad... *grumble*)",

It's well balanced out between the funny and serious parts, so that there are no filler episodes. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, which I can see, because the manga is still coming out.\r\nArt: 6\r\nThe art is fine, but I don't like the way the shadow underneath the bangs is solid black instead of a darker shade or how the shine in Sharon's hair is light green. But i like the costume design and the backgrounds a lot.\r\nSound: 8\r\nI like the melody inthe pocket watch a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all amazing, they all have strange characteristics that I love about them. The only people who seems normal are Oz and Gil, but if everyone was weird it wouldn't be as good, and Gil is awesome even if he is normal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't stop watching!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt is the best anime I've ever watched!\\n\\n",

Has decent story, where you get the usual idiot, selfless protagonist guy trying to help every living thing he finds.\r\nThe story sort of has an ending. Yet it leaves a lot of mysteries and plot-knots to be untied. You are left with one view of the characters at the end of anime. However, if you read on about the story in manga or plot summary, you would find out a very different, unexpected, plot twisted view.",

I really wish that more people would read the manga before judging the series because of the anime. While the anime isn't absolutely horrible, its a far cry from what Jun Mochizuki was able to mold it into in the manga.\r\n Jun Mochizuki is an amazing author whos able to create a story where every little detail connects. She creates amazing in-depth villains and characters, and is able to make a complicated yet amazing manga that leaves you emotional and wanting more. The anime, however, leaves holes incharacters, plot, and ultimately rushes things. I think PH had the potential to become an amazing anime but unfortunately that potential was wasted. I highly recommend reading the manga before watching the anime, or not watching the anime at all.",
