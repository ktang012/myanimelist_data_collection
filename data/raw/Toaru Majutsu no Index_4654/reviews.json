            "content": "*to those who are too lazy to read and just want a quick summary, skip to the final paragraph*\r\nOne of the greatest battles that mankind has ever witnessed is the battle between science and religion, a battle that is still being fought today. So just imagine, what will happen if people with supernatural abilities existed and both these sides got hold of people whose special abilities that are nothing short of miraculous? So how exactly does this relate to To Aru Majutsu no Index? Well I suppose a short summary of the story is in order.\r\nNow To Aru Majutsu no Index (which I would justrefer to now as Majutsu no Index) is set in a world where both science and magic coexist. Kamijou Touma, you regular high school kid lives within a place called Academy City, the so called \u201cutopia of science\u201d as well as an utopia for a new type of people known as ESPers, people who can have supernatural abilities by controlling the laws of science. Kamijou Touma, being a student in the Academy City, has a strange power called \u201cImagine Breaker\u201d, a skill which allows him to dispel anything magical or is a product of ESPer powers. On the other hand, there is Index Prohibitorum Librorum (or Index for short), a nun who has the superhuman ability to remember virtually anything and has memorized in her mind 103,000 grimoires concerning magic that is prohibited by the church or is otherwise just far too dangerous to be used. One day, Touma found a starving Index hanging in his balcony after being chased by mysterious men, begging him for food. This is where the story starts as Touma finds himself in the middle of all the problems concerned with letting a walking manual for destruction live in his house.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you gotta admit, the idea of science and magic clashing against each other is a pretty freaking good concept, and a good concept always mean a good anime right? Well, Majutsu no Index had pretty much everything that a good anime has: a good concept, interesting premises, and a recipe for romance. Unfortunately, it failed to use its full potential as an anime because of certain mistakes made by the producers of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s start off with the story. As I\u2019ve said, Majutsu no index is set on interesting premises yet it failed to fully utilize all of its hidden potential. You see, one of the biggest problems here is, or the lack thereof, of a main antagonist because what happened is that the anime was split into two sides : the magic side and the science side. \\n\\n\r\nThe magic side is the side concerned with magic aspect of the anime. The plots concerning this side usually just revolves around people who are relentlessly trying to kidnap Index to learn the secrets in her head and wreak havoc upon the earth, those who want to save Index from her perfect memory, which they claim would kill her if they don\u2019t brainwash her every year since she would remember every detail she sees and ultimately overload her brain, and the church which is responsible for pretty much all of Index\u2019s problems. And obviously, it\u2019s Touma\u2019s job to protect Index which he usually does by talking and punching the said magicians into submission. Though that way of solving things isn\u2019t really all that bad, what really makes the magic side so terrible is that it\u2019s quite episodic when it comes to plot. The plot from one arc to another just doesn\u2019t add up and that makes it quite terrible: the fact that it has no continuality.\\n\\n\r\nThe science side on the other hand, is a heck lot more interesting in terms of plot than the magic side. It revolves around the concept of leveling up ESPers. You see, the thing with ESPers is that they are ranked using levels, starting from level 0 (which is by the way, Touma\u2019s level) and above. This is done in order to measure how strong an ESPer is with level 0 being weakest, virtually having no powers, and those with higher levels having stronger powers. The current highest level ESPers have been able to attain is level 5, a title which seven different people in Academy City hold. The story focuses on two of these level 5 ESPers, namely Misaka Mikoto, who was the ability to control electricity and is a friend to Touma, and The Accelerator, who can control and redirect vectors at will. What happened is that Academy City decided to create the first level 6 ESPer, and there are only two ways to do it: Either have a level 5 ESPer kill roughly 128 other level 5 ESPers, or to have a level 5 ESPer kill 20,000 level 3 ESPers. Seeing as they only have seven level 5 ESPers, they opted for the other method: have a level 5 ESPer, namely The Accelerator, kill 20,000 level 3 ESPers. Now the question is where do they get 20,000 level 3 ESPers? \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed by now, yes, I am biased towards the science side of the story but there is a good reason for that. As I\u2019ve said, what this series lacks is the presence of a main antagonist, and what the science side gives is just that, along with a solid plot. On the other hand, the magic side is, as I\u2019ve mentioned, quite episodic in nature, jumping around from one antagonist to the other and having no clear goal as to where it would lead the story next after one conflict is solved. This is one of the biggest downfalls of Majutsu no Index and is one of the main reasons as to why it fails to live up to its potential. Another problem with this anime is that the magic and science side of the story almost never crosses each other, despite the fact that they should be two sides of the same coin. This is especially annoying from time to time because it causes quite a few plotholes in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the problems with Majutsu no Index lies in its characters. I\u2019m not saying that they are bad, it\u2019s just that they are so clich\u00e9 it hurts. We have Kamijou Touma, who\u2019s definition of unlucky is seeing naked chicks and getting \u201cin touch\u201d with the ladies (gee, I haven\u2019t seen that before), Index, who is your regular hyperactive loli, Misaka, nicknamed biribiri, who is your run-of-the-mill tsundere, and others who would take too long to mention. But of course, that isn\u2019t the real problem, as clich\u00e9 characters can still be interesting despite the fact that they are, well, clich\u00e9. \\n\\n\r\nThe real problem is that the makers of the anime desperately try to make Touma, the main character, look badass when in fact, he\u2019s not. And for the sake of doing this, they pretty much confine most of the other characters to the sidelines. This becomes very apparent during the latter half of the show, when pretty much every problem ends up being solved when Touma punches the antagonist in the face.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, not all of the characters are bad. Take Accelerator for example. Aside from being the main antagonist for the majority of the science side plotline, he is also the one of the few characters that received a noticeable amount of character development. As the story introduced him as an evil psycho who is willing to kill tens of thousands to gain power, he was later shown to have a softer side who cares for others more than he seems .Other than him, most of the other anime characters just receive minimal amounts of development, maybe aside for one more character though discussing her here could spoil the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, the only redeeming feature Majutsu no Index has is in its animation and music. The Art was just the way I like it, clean, smooth, and shiny just like most of the newer animes today, though there are times when the movements seem a little bit choppy but this is barely noticeable and doesn\u2019t really affect the overall experience of watching this anime. The music on the other hand is just plain freaking awesome. The first and second openings, both J-pop songs, where sung by Kawada Mami which are in my opinion, just perfect for the theme of the anime: fast-paced and somehow had a futuristic tune to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I\u2019d have to say that To Aru Majutsu no Index is more or less an average anime. It\u2019s an anime with a good concept and interesting premises, it just happened to have been unable to fully utilize its full potential. Still though, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a bad anime. It does have moments where it shines and shows some pretty amazing scenes. Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t maintain that level of goodness throughout which becomes one of its downfalls. So this isn\u2019t really something that I would personally recommend, but if you\u2019re stuck with nothing to watch, or maybe you\u2019re one those who have a liking for shounen animes with a little bit of romance here and there then why not give this a shot. Who knows, you might come to like it more than I did. \\n\\n\r\nSo to provide a quick summary, here are a list of pros and cons:\\n\\n\r\n+ It has a good concept: Science against Magic\\n\r\n+The openings, both sung by Kawada Mami, were awesome J-pop songs\\n\r\n+The art was clean and smooth \\n\r\n+The Science side of the story had a good plotline \\n\r\n+The Accelerator is just a badass antagonist\\n\\n\r\n-The anime was unable to use its full potential and due to half of the story, the magic side, being terrible\\n\r\n-The makers of the anime were trying too hard to make the protagonist of the story, Touma, look badass despite the fact that he was not\\n\r\n-The animation can get a little choppy at times, though this isn\u2019t too noticeable\\n\r\n-The characters are quite clich\u00e9\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review.

            "content": "\"Then would you accompany me to the depth of hell?\" - Index\r\n\"When magic and science crosses path, what will happen?\" is how I would have liked to start this review. However the answer to that would have simply be \"nothing\" since, although both sides exists in the same place, there were hardly any interaction between them. So instead, I will begin by asking Index what she meant by accompanying her to the depth of hell. She was hardly present for half the show and during the rare occasions when she is in an episode, she gets sidelined and become a minor character with absolutely noimpact to the story (beside biting Touma on the head). \\n\\n\r\nSo what happened to those 103,000 magical texts? With the exception of the first few episodes and the last episode or two, where Index as a character actually matters to the plot, there is practically zero reference to the 103,000 magical texts for 80% of the show. Granted the production studio (J.C. Staff) wanted to follow the novel as closely as possible (and they did a very good job at it), it is understandable for the abrupt ending to the story thus far. But it still makes no sense for the story\u2019s centerpiece to be dangling here and there with no sense of purpose in the various story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nIf one were to ignore the problems mentioned above, then the overall production quality of Toaru Majutsu no Index is actually quite good. Decent animation from J.C. Staff (though sometimes the distant shots seem lacking in detail) plus a great cast of seiyu make this anime a pleasant watch to those who don\u2019t really mind a poor storyline. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, the mini arcs throughout the show which introduces and help create character developments are great in themselves. However, once the dust settles, it always makes me wonder what happen to the story that was suppose to center around Index. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, most were introduced to compliment the particular story arc (with the exception of the main protagonists). Afterward, they will tend to \u201cfade\u201d to the back sometimes making a few seconds appearance here and there with no significance. In terms of character development, not much observable changes occurred for the male protagonist and Index which can be attributed to the faithful following of the novel (since there wasn\u2019t that much matter to talk about at the time of the anime production). On the other hand the co-heroine/main protagonist, Mikoto, of the Railgun series (a spinoff of Toaru Majutsu no Index) did show considerable character growth which makes her shine like a bright star among the group of relatively static characters.\\n\\n\r\nThose familiar with Shana will instantly ring a bell in their head as they watch the first OP of this series. If the OP does not make you go \"OMG, this sounds similar to Shana\u2019s OP!\", then perhaps watching the daily interaction between Index and Touma will help ring some bells. To be more precise, one can even replace Index with Shana and voila, you have yourself Shakugan no Shana III. The point I am trying to make here is the similarities between the two anime. \\n\\n\r\n1. From the same production company. \\n\r\n2. At least one of their OP theme is sang by the same singer (Kawada Mami). \\n\r\n3. Shana = Index, Yuji = Touma.\\n\\n\r\nSo what am I trying to say here? It means that if you enjoy watching Shakugan no Shana, feel free to give this anime a try. The magician (magic) vs esper (science) theme advertised by Toaru Majutsu no Index does have its selling points, but I just think it desperately need a sequel to really link the various bits and pieces together. I enjoyed the mini arcs (whether they are filler or not), those irrelevant mini stories were very entertaining and they help keep my mind off Index. But once I start thinking deeper into the character ties and relationships, there is just something missing about the purpose of Index. Perhaps a hopeful sequel will fill in the missing puzzles, but as things stand right now the story really hurts the show.",

            "content": "To Aru Majutsu no Index (or TAMI for short) is the very definition of a generic anime. Theres nothing good here but its not necessarily bad. Some characters are likeable and entertaining but that makes up such a small percentage of the enormous cast that its just not worth it. TAMI is about a guy named Touma who lives in a city thats entire purpose is being a school for Espers (see: Psychics) although nobody actually reads minds and its more they all have a certain power. So nobody is psychic at all. Touma discovers a young girl hanging on his balcony whos a magicianbeing chased and he helps her. They become friends and have adventures. Thats TAMI in a nutshell, they tried having some main story throughout the whole thing but nothing important was revealed and the series couldnt keep a story arc going past 3 episodes. And thats where this show really falls to mediocrity. By constantly changing the focus of the story to some new threat and introducing 1-4 new characters every 3-5 episodes you lose the whole point of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are just so two dimensional and uninteresting that you dont care for their story at all. Not to mention they all have to have some gimmick to distinguish them from another character.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as genre goes TAMI is a shonen type action show but thats being too generous in my opinion. TAMI's action scenes never go past 1-3 actions before they have to talk for 90% of the fight about something that wont even matter once the conflict is resolved, and all the main character ever does is punch people. \\n\\n\r\nTAMI isnt necessarily bad but its just so plain that you find yourself wondering why you're even bothering with it? It tries to be funny but always throws the same gags at you that you just dont care for them. I think theres some wasted potential here and thats a shame because I really wanted to like this show\\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "To Aru Majutsu no Index is an action, comedy set in a modern (or perhaps slightly futuristic) city called Academy City. The entire city is basically composed of several schools that teach the usage of Esper; a scientific kind of magic. \r\nThe story revolves around the protagonist Kamijou Touma, as he is caught between tensions and events involving conflicts between Magic and Esper (science). While the first few episodes were quite promising, hinting at a huge power struggle between two sides, with Touma being in the center of attention, the rest was quite the letdown. There wasn't any deep story. The main plot simply getsshoved into the background and To Aru Majutsu no Index becomes a somewhat repetitive, episodic 2/3 episode-per-plot anime. Despite the great entrance leading to an episodic series, however, I admit it was still enjoyable to watch. The plots are simple, but watching Kamijou Touma go through each challenge in his way was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are definitely the strongest points of To Aru Majutsu no Index. The art is simply amazing. Movements and actions flow smoothly, showing just how many panels the creators drew to create each episode. CG effects are wonderfully done; with the sun shining brightly and casting beams of light on Academy City. The opening songs fit the action theme of To Aru Majutsu no Index very well, and the relaxing ending songs tone down viewers' excitement after watching the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were great and unique in terms of personality, but development was stagnant. Each character had a unique personality that you can identify and tag them with. Touma is a carefree, friendly guy who's always there to help out his friends, while Index is mischievous and spoiled on the outside, deep down she cares much about everyone around her. However, without much character development, they pretty much stay the same throughout the 24 episodes of To Aru Majutsu no Index. But overall, I think this can be overlooked, as once you become attached to them, development won't degrade the characters' uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching To Aru Majutsu no Index on a weekly basis. It was a good anime overall, despite the lack of a concrete central plot. Just watching how Touma deals with situations and interact with those around him is purely enjoyable. Definitely give To Aru Majutsu no Index a try!",

Index, probably the only likable character, is only displayed in the first arc, and then only gets cameos, (although she is a main character, cough cough).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally don't find this anime very enjoyable, it is bland and completely boring at times, and only has a few scenes that remotely catch my interest. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: heh",

            "content": "A Somewhat Unlucky Boy\r\nAcademy City, the Mecca of Science, is where most of it's denizens are student that have been scientifically engineered to be espers, or wielders of certain unique abilities: manipulating electricity, teleportation and controlling natural forces.\r\nTouma is a student in the Esper Development Program, with very unique skill, the ability to negate supernatural powers, like the ones manifested by other Espers. This, of course, nullifies his good fortune as well: vending machines devour his yen, his cellphone crushed into silicon fragments by his foot, and he has to attend extra classes during the summer.\r\nBut fate isn't done with Touma, ready to twistthe string of his destiny around it's cold slender fingers. Enter Index, hanging to dry from Touma's balcony, a church sister being hunted by... magicians. The plot has an interesting hook, the conflict between science and magic. The first four episodes prove to be interesting, serving as a prelude to what would be a plot line epic in proportions. But Toaru Majutsu no Index [no Index] quickly shifts gears, abandoning an expansive story, for smaller three to four episode arcs surrounding the various characters. It's amusing but for the most part leaves you asking: Why does this matter?. Though the last episode does give some hope, hinting at a conflict between science and magic, that's about to build, brim and explode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable, if somewhat cliched. Touma is the can-do hero that attempts to save 'everyone'. Misaka is a shining star in somewhat average cast. Her love/hate relationships with both the lead and her friend Kuroko coupled with her superiority complex is amusing. One of the plots faults is the harem that is accidentally formed. Harems cause symptoms of shallow character interaction and plots driven by mindless love polygons. Shades of these indicators are found in no Index, but hopefully the 'harem factor' won\u2019t be a crutch for the plot in the future.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the art is excellent. The palette is bright and vibrant, painting Academy City alive. Cool silvers and grays are layered on the natural colors woven in between the streets. Action scenes are fluid and are filled with some intense scenes on this backdrop. Character models are drawn well, the magician's being the most interesting of the bunch. Kiori and Stiyl seem otherworldly in their outlandish clothing. There were irritating bits of fanservice unappealing because the heroines, for the most part, were flat chested.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was engaging, a techno flare that fit the whole scientific motif. Neither opening was exceptional, their upbeat chords danced about, setting the appropriate mood. The voice acting wasn't noteworthy, though some of the voices became grating. Index's voice had an annoying timbre that scratched at the senses. \\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of the show made my enjoyment of the program, mixed. Some of the chapters were splendid, balancing humor, drama, and action while others made me want to drop the program all together. I have hope for the second season, which promises a return to the whole conflict between magic and science, which intrigued me in the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThe ambition of the plot quickly disappears and what remains is a cast of likable characters, great art, and a promise. Hopefully Toaru Majutsu no Index will deliver on that promise. The small gems of story telling give me confidence that there is still hope for the exploration of the main theme presented. We can only hope.",

            "content": "The beef on the plate before you smells wonderful. Its color indicates that it has spent just about the right amount of time on the grill. Surrounded by finely cooked and cut potatoes and some vegetables for the fresh taste's sake, with a glass of delicious wine towering nearby, the seemingly delicious meat only waits for you to enjoy your meal.\r\nIt's funny, really. In a way, Toaru Majutsu no Index is deceptive. The first few episodes promise you a really intriguing (if not epic) story. The presentation is phenomenal; the opening is great, events that unfold in episode 1 already get you hooked and thereare already some interesting characters whom you want to know more about. Hungrily, you venture onwards for more.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the episodes after the terrific first impressions, however, you start to notice a few things. First, it's only minor details that go unexplained, but you start to worry when it does not stop there. Before long, the show refuses to explain even more about certain events or characters. Soon, the story is all over the place, and with its failing ability to present itself properly or consistently, you begin to lose interest gradually over the course of the entire ride.\\n\\n\r\nRemember the meal I mentioned before? The potatoes are just fine, the vegetables are okay and the wine is actually quite good. The meat, however, tastes awful. When you (try to) cut through it, you realize that it is far from done. The meat is pink, and the two or three pieces you try to chew on end up spat out on the floor.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the side dishes were okay, the main meal was plain bad. In a way, Index is the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2\\n\r\nBefore anything, let me just say that in its core, Index is probably a very good show with regards to the story. However, there is one thing with this story that damages the show badly - the way it is presented. And I'm not exaggerating things, because it really is that severe. The concept of the entire show (Science vs Magic) is really interesting, and the sides shown of both parties are sometimes genuinely good. All things considered though, nothing actually ever happens between them until the last one or two episodes. Index, the main heroine of the anime (I think?), carries surprisingly little importance to the plot for the most part. Mostly forced into a few scenes purely for the sake of comic, what is revealed about her at the very start of the show (which is supposed to carry a lot of weight in the actual plot) is never mentioned until, again, almost the very end of it all, and even there it doesn't matter as much as it should. These are just some of many examples of things the show presents but forgets to handle or elaborate on.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the entire show is split into several arcs, each handling its own sub-story and characters. While a minority of these arcs are quite decent, the rest of them remain uninteresting, and some even make you question what importance they actually hold to the main plot. The main problem with the arcs is, yet again, the fact that the show forgets to handle everyone and everything that happens in a proper way. Characters who're just being given some depth are suddenly wiped out of existence (figuratively speaking) with the coming of a new story or arc. Events remain unexplained, both within themselves and how they connect to everything else, until you simply start to not care anymore. Simply put, while everything has a potential of being great and interesting, the show treats its contents with little care, telling us many stories and presenting us to a lot of different characters, only to barely tie the knots on not more than a select few of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nThe art of Toaru Majutsu no Index is, truth be told, very good. While everything is coated with a simple style and charm, the liveliness in both characters and places is presented excellently through not too extreme methods of drawing. Colors come out nicely and blend together in a pretty way where they should, nothing or no one looks too deformed or incomplete, even from a distance. While a flaw can be spotted in the art here and there, it's nothing that will deviate you from the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nThe music fits in the moment, so to speak. While the tracks of the show give the right effect to all events that occur and set the mood right most of the time, there's nothing here that'll stick with you once the moments have passed. The music, while good, is often forgettable, but it serves its purpose in the show. As for the two openings, they are actually epic. They set the tone right for what's to come, and as standalones in an MP3-player, they're still a pleasure to listen to. The endings are also decent, though not on par with the openings. Finally, sound effects. Everything sounds like it should, whether we're talking about explosions, footsteps, laughs or anything else. Nothing bad, yet nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7\\n\r\nConsidering how I bashed the story section of this show, it may come as a surprise that the characters are being given a (significantly) higher score. However, while they were presented dreadfully together with the story, you actually cared for what you knew about them. Save for a few characters (including Index herself, ironically), most of them made you laugh, feel emotions, or care enough to finish watching the show altogether. Yet, it was rather frustrating when the show kept blowing away characters after their stories were told, since you really want to know more about some of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nBack to the low scores. Index had every opportunity to become a good show. Most of the characters were interesting, the plot and setting were fresh and intriguing, and even the background details such as art and sound pleased. Nevertheless, thanks to the catastrophical presentation and handling of everything, what cound've been an epic experience was lost.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5\\n\r\nAll things considered, even if the main plot failed, the show wasn't impossible to finish. The several stories, for what it's worth, were decent sometimes, and other elements such as nice characters helped carry me through the ride. In the end, however, it truly is a shame. I really wanted to like what Index truly was trying to tell, but it was impossible considering the scattered everything was.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the main meal failed to deliver, the side dishes were okay. Even if the meat wasn't even close to edible, you could leave the table knowing that at least the rest of the food pleased you. It is possible that the chef might have learned from his or her mistakes, and maybe, just maybe, the next dinner will be a winner.",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index starts off strong, but quickly fizzles out. I, like many others, was intrigued by the fantastic world described in the first few episodes, a world where everybody has a superpower, as well as the mystery surrounding the title character. Sadly, the series fails to deliver a single solid story past the first arc and stumbles blindly onward to a barely sub-par ending.\r\nThe anime actually had me hooked at the first few minutes of the first episode. The character of Touma, who inexplicably possesses the power to nullify any supernatural force with his right hand (and also seems to attract misfortune, somethingI can relate with) was very appealing. Upon his encounter with Index, a girl who inexplicably has perfect memory recall, things really started to take off. Now there were two mysterious characters and a decent plot to go with one of them. By the third episode, I was convinced that I was in for a rare masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly I was concerned about Touma, because his mysterious power is essentially god-mode, and overpowered characters tend to ruin a story. I set those concerns aside, though, reasoning that the title character is Index, not Touma. Little did I know that after the first arc concluded, the title character would have little to no influence in the overall plot, in some cases barely managing to make an appearance in most later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nVery few of the characters past the two main ones are genuinely likable. I have to admit I liked Touma's teacher, Komoe. She provided some of the best comic relief, but didn't do much else aside from acting as a plot device. Index's two guardians, central to the plot of the first arc, were also among the better personalities. At the very least, they weren't completely unlikeable. The same can't be said for the rest of the cast: almost offensively dull supporting characters; a series of super-powerful girls, each who thinks her life is the worst and she'd be better off dead; a select few villains to do battle with Touma; and behind-the-scenes bad guys who never do anything but make vague references to the story. Before I move on, I'd like to give an honorable mention to Accelerator. He had probably the coolest power of them all, and would have made my list of likable characters if he had dropped the angsty emo-kid act. Just one more wasted character among many.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing they did right, though, it was the art and animation. But if all your anime can do is look good, there's hardly any point to it. Overall I have to say I was really disappointed with Toaru Majutsu no Index. It had such a great buildup and they could have done great things with it, but once Index was no longer a central part of the story it all fell flat. I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. I watched it from start to finish, and now I wish I hadn't.",

            "content": "\"Such misfortune!\"\r\nIt's somewhat apt that I happened to choose that as the opening quote to this review, because it really does sum up To Aru Majutsu no Index rather nicely - that is, an anime filled with misfortune.\r\nInitially, Index got off to an...interesting start, it wasn't particularly bad, nor was it particularly good either, it was just interesting. We are introduced to our main character Touma, rather interestingly, Touma is not the stereotypical useless protagonist so often seen in shows like Index; don't get me wrong, at his core, he's just a variation on the plain nice guy, but this nice guy also happens tohave one of the most overpowered abilities in the history of fiction: the ability to negate literally any form of supernatural ability that happens to come his way with his right hand. \\n\\n\r\nHowever cool it is to have a main character who has an ability that, in most cases, is reserved for the most powerful of powerful enemies, having this power also presents a couple of immediate problems for the show, the first of which being that there is near enough no risk whatsoever when Touma fights; it doesn't matter what the situation is, Touma will undoubtedly get out of it using his hand of God (a rather ironic statement if you've actually seen the show), as shown during the Accelerator and Sherry Cromwell fights, you could quite literally throw the most powerful supernatural abilities at this guy and he will negate them instantly. Consequently, this also makes none of his fights remotely interesting if they have anything to do with supernatural abilities, as he will just spam his Deus Ex Machina ability repeatedly in order to get out of whatever predicament he's in.\\n\\n\r\nOur other main character is Index, and the moment she is introduced to the show, things immediately go downhill, and it's not just her character (which I'll get back to later), the show itself breaks two rules of writing that should never be broken: \\n\\n\r\n1) It throws out lots of random terminology.\\n\r\n2) The story doesn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThat first one is a trap the writer fell into all too fast, right from Index's introduction we are suddenly given an influx of terminology that we are supposed to remember, things like \"Necessarius\", \"Dedicatus545\", \"Johann's Pen\", \"Imagine Breaker\", \"Judgment\", \"Esper\" and \"Anti-Skill\" just to name a few out of the dozens of terms that populate Index's world, there is literally no point in trying to remember them all, especially not the magic spells which are frankly ridiculous in terms of naming length. Now, as you no doubt know, throwing out random terminology in the hopes that some of it will stick does NOT make a story, frankly, they're nothing but a bunch of meaningless words that are, at most, given a three line explanation as to what they actually mean. Worse still, the terminology doesn't stop, and we are continuously hammered with terms that make it seem like the show is ridiculously complex and would take nothing short of a quantum physicist to understand everything that goes on. Don't get me wrong, there are shows that have done exactly what Index did, Haruhi is guilty of it, Shakugan no Shana is most definitely guilty of it, but the major difference between those two shows and this one is that Shana and Haruhi actually made progress in their story.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me onto my other point.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Index is that the story doesn't go anywhere - at all. The first series does nothing more than introduce certain characters, and give out lots of random side stories that do nothing but hinder what little progress the story makes; there are literally only three arcs in Index that actually serve to deliver something that's beneficial to the story at all, those being the first arc, the Sisters arc and the finale. Admittedly, the character development that Accelerator received in his own little stand alone arc was rather good, but one character getting developed when there are more characters and terms than the writers can keep track of is nothing but a minutely small achievement when there's so much that the story has to tell. Honestly, it's hard to tell what exactly is going on in Index half the time, there are arcs in which characters that were key in the beginning are totally swept aside, arcs in which characters I thought were nothing more than minor extras are reintroduced and are suddenly given total importance (with absolutely no foreshadowing whatsoever), and, of course, a beach episode.\\n\\n\r\nNone of this is helped by some of the worst writing I've ever seen. There's bad writing, then there's bad writing and then there's To Aru Majutsu no Index. There are several times in which a character is delivering a monologue that not only seems completely out of context, they're usually random and worse still, they don't make sense. An example of one such monologue is in the first arc of the series, Touma happens to be engaging in life or death combat with a character who happens to be hunting Index, Touma, our ever rational hero, then proceeds to start a speech about friendship that not only doesn't make sense, but somehow wins over said villain; it's one moment of utter stupidity amongst hundreds of others in Index. The lapses in logic in Index only get worse as the series goes along, this is not helped by the plot holes that the series induces upon itself later on in the series (especially in the beach episode), and we're left with a series that certainly seems to want to do something with all its terminology and characters, it's just abstaining vehemently from doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip-side of this, Index does at least look okay, which is surprising considering that this is J.C. Staff animating here. The character designs look good, the spells and abilities look pretty decent, and the fights look nice as well; it's definitely not perfect, there are several times in the series in which the quality of the animation dips drastically, and several abilities lack the impact that they should considering how powerful they're meant to be, which is more along the lines of what I've come to expect from J.C. Staff. Oh and the fan-service, it would most definitely not be complete without the fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the main themes are generic and utterly forgettable at the end of the day, and the rest of the OST is passable at best, there's no major stand-out themes in it so I won't dwell. The voice actors do nothing more than an average job, the already bad writing delving further into horrible melodrama due to some of the female seiyuu coming out with really hollow performances at times; the only two voice actors who deserve a mention are Yuka Iguchi as Index and Nobuhiko Okamoto as Accelerator, both of which are here for very opposite reasons. Iguchi is mentioned because she manages to turn Index from a generic loli-tsundere, into a horrendously annoying one; her performance as Index is tantamount to taking pieces of broken chalk and scratching them down a chalkboard. As for Okamoto, he manages to deliver a performance as Accelerator that captures his sadistic personality rather well, and also manages to act well in the scenes when Accelerator isn't finding new ways to deflect people with his vectors.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing about the voice acting, try listening to the many Misaka clones keep repeating \"Misaka Misaka\" all the time, I guarantee that you will never want to hear that name ever again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the characters, they're a rather interesting bunch, each having some form of cool ability or special magical power that's almost interesting enough to make you want to see what it does.\\n\\n\r\nNearly every single one of them is characterised horribly. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Touma is a variation on the stereotypical useless hero, but don't let that \"variation\" part fool you, he's just as idiotic and naive as nearly every single other character in this archetype. Fueled by his idiotic need to save every person around him regardless of the risk to his own life - oh wait, that statement is redundant considering who he is - Touma's only real saving grace is that he can actually do something rather than get overshadowed by a far superior female lead. \\n\\n\r\nAccelerator is hands down the best character in the show; he is after all the only character to receive some good character development, and manages to be as sadistic and twisted as I first imagined him to be. He's deeper than he actually first appears, has a cool ability, and watching his stand alone arc made me think that somehow Index was about to improve.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many people who believe Mikoto to be the best character in the show; unfortunately, I cannot agree with this statement as Mikoto doesn't remain the focus of the show anywhere near enough to warrant the term \"best character\", not to mention she's somewhat inconsistent, developing tsundere characteristics whenever the plot feels it to be appropriate then dropping them as the story demands only for them to appear again at random intervals. Her characterisation in Index is nothing more than very mediocre at best and if you really want to have a better opinion of her, it's much easier to watch To Aru Kagaku no Railgun (which is actually much better than Index anyway).\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast (aside from Index who I'll cover in a moment) are a random bunch of almost remotely interesting characters, and most of them hit the stereotypes rather well, there's plenty of loli's in the show, a lesbian, big boobs, blonde haired delinquents...nearly every single stereotype is hit at some point by Index.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the titular character in the title is the biggest offender of them all.\\n\\n\r\nIndex is not just a bad character, she is the worst type of loli-tsundere around. My argument for why I think tsunderes are bad would have to be Index, she is perhaps one of the most ungrateful little brats in animation, whose only real purpose is to make the main characters life worse, and more than likely win in the harem that he forms (I neglected to mention that, but oh well). There are very few characters I want to see die more than Index, in fact, if I had the chance, I would personally ensure that she does get killed off - and I would be the one doing the killing. She somehow manages to make every episode she's in worse (this isn't helped by her appalling voice actor) and I saw her turning into a loli-tsundere 5 episodes before she actually did. Index is the kind of character that needs to be slapped repeatedly until she understands that she's a bad character, then slapped some more for good measure; frankly the one redeeming thing about the random side stories is that she doesn't feature prominently in them (if at all).\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, To Aru Majutsu no Index has its moments; the way that the story is structured means you can marathon through an arc and come back to it without really forgetting where you are in the story - wait, that statement is redundant too. And despite my major gripes with the writing and characters, Index is hugely enjoyable, if I was to base my score for this series based off enjoyment, this would be a very different review.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a shame that isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Index is an anime that suffers from poor writing, an extreme lack of story and poor characters (as well as characterisation), and manages to carve itself into a level of anime that's usually only reserved for travesties like Mars of Destruction - it has its moments sure, but then again nearly every anime does. \\n\\n\r\nWhat a waste.",

Conclusion :\r\nI like this Anime despite the fact it got off target halfway through. They did a good job of developing the other charactersin the show but then by the time you finish the series, you're expecting Season 2. Basically it felt like one giant introduction episode, introducing us to the characters and the plot, but then we never get to the real deal. As you can see, I don't have much to complain, this Anime has potential if they're able to get back to the main plot. I'm expecting them to give us a Season 2 ( I guess if Season 1 did well enough, the novel and manga are still going). It's a nice Anime to watch as long as you're not expecting a great deal out of it ( especially story wise, since it's obviously incomplete ). Perhaps by the time you read this Season 2 will be out. For now you can just await for the \"Toaru Kagaku no Rail Gun\" side story...",

            "content": "Ever since people started thinking, gathering in groups and building villages and cities, there was always the one question that some people asked themselves and even though most people probably didn't really care in the first place, they later started asking the same questions. It was a matter of time until that question was raised. \"What are we?\", \"Where do we come from?\", \"Why are we on earth?\", are the ones I am talking about and one answer became popular quickly: God! Religion was founded in the early days and while having it hard at first, the religion that in the end came out ontop in the western world was Christianity. Not always through peaceful means, but they somehow managed to make people believe them. But the church doesn't really have the monopole of answering these questions. Science did not always played a role as big as it does now, hell it even was forbidden to oppose the church by using science for some time! The war between science and church though has always been going on, Galilei, who was imprisoned for spreading the truth he found out through scientific mediums, probably is the best example for it and while it certainly did cool down a lot, there probably are still people fighting about it right now! Ladies and Gentlemen, today's topic shall be the Anime with the oh so interesting topic of science and church, Today's topic is To Aru Majutsu no Index!\\n\\n\r\nAs this is a Review for both seasons of Index, I will go on and give two scores for every category!\\n\\n\r\nStory:To Aru Majutsu no Index or Index as I will call it for short, revolves around Kamijou Touma, a middle school student that lives in Academic City, a city solely dedicated to science development and Esper training. It is technologically advanced and around 80% of the people living there are students. In this city there are different ranks of Espers, telling their strength, going from Level 0, people that don't have any ability, up to Level 5, which are the 7 strongest ability users in the entire world. Our Main Protagonist Kamijou though unfortunately only is Level 0 and doesn't have any ability at all, except for one thing: His right hand can destroy any Magic or Ability! One day as he comes home to his apartment, he suddenly finds an oddly dressed catholic sister hanging on his balcony, muttering that she is hungry. After taking her in, she explains to him that her name is Index and she has memorized 103000 Grimoires in her mind. She tells him of the existence of Magic as well and that some kind of evil organization is after her.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of Index is really interesting, featuring the earlier mentioned differences between the Church and science, but it's nothing that the show focuses on too long. While the enemies often are either from some kind of church or some evil scientific organization, it doesn't feel anything but a mere excuse to have a new antagonist. The setting still remains really interesting, but more for the reasons of Academic City being one of the coolest cities that I have seen in a Franchise so far, featuring underground organizations, a realistic set of population, meaning it is not perfect and a really interesting society where students are able to rule a lot. Also the whole Esper system is really well thought through and was a lot of fun to think about, even if it certainly is not the main point of Index.\\n\r\nIndex Story itself consists of many arcs, bound together to an overarcing story, that is not too significant yet, but might get soon. Every single arc is built the same way, there is some light hearted fun going on, something bad happens and everyone freaks out. Then some Plot Twists happen, the bad guy is getting figured out, he fights Touma and everything ends. Of course for the most time it is not as easy as that and surely isn't as dull as it probably just sounded. What this show does really well though, is the pacing. It never feels rushed and never drags once it really got going. Even though it has a few difficulties getting into the arc at the beginning, as the light hearted parts often drag out a little. As the arc gets more story focused though, the show starts to throw in a good amount of twists before ending in a for the most amazingly climatic and epic fight, that basically consists of our main characters holding epic speeches and punching everyone in their face! Believe it or not, it is a lot of fun to watch! If the show really has one big problem though, than it is the getting into it! The first few episodes of Index are pretty hard to watch, not because the story is bad, but due to another reason...\\n\r\nIndex: 8.5/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:The characters of Index are by far it's weakest points! The first character is Index. Index is a catholic sister, with the ability of remembering everything she has once seen. This ability is getting used by the church, as she had to read 103.000 grimoires for the church and remember every single one of them. She now has to take care of them and keep people away from looking into it. Index rarely really gets active in the show itself and for the most part only is the reason for things to happen. If she starts acting on her own though, it often gets pretty cool and the power of the grimoires hidden within her mind is not to underestimate. The second main character is Kamijou Touma. He is your generic Light Novel Protagonist, being the guy that wants to save everything and holds epic speeches, why the antagonist is wrong. His catchphrase is the sentence \"Fukou da\" which in English means \"Such misfortune\", as he sees himself as an incredibly unlucky person. There is not a lot more to him though, as he is pretty blant. It takes a lot of time, to really get used to him, since at the beginning he is really annoying and only gets really likeable in the second season. It's not that he changes a lot, but the one thing that is different, is that he is a lot more badass later on and while not being a good character, he at least is really cool! In short, the longer the series goes on, the better the main characters get!\\n\r\nThe character cast around those two characters is huge, introducing at least one new character every single arc (there are a lot of arcs...) and keeping most of them for use later on. Every single one of them though, especially those that are getting used more often, are really well fleshed out and are by far not as one dimensional as the two main character are. They are a lot more interesting than Index and Touma are and every new side character is a great addition to the already amazing cast of side characters. I am looking forward to getting more of those in the coming seasons.\\n\r\nThe last problem in the character section that Index has, is the character interaction, which the comedy relief scenes are focused on. The problem is that while the interactions are funny when seeing Index biting Touma the first time, as she seems to be doing it second episode, it gets boring really quick. The two characters are way too boring to produce anything amazing outside of fights and most of the side characters can't really safe that either. There were some points when I simply had to laugh out loud, but those were pretty rare. The comedy itself was just something that was overused to a point that I was not able to do anything but facepalm at times.\\n\r\nIndex: 7.2/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:Index for the most part doesn't look too amazing. The Slice of Life comedy scenes look pretty generic and there is nothing standing out at all. When it gets serious though and they start to animate fights, they do a pretty good job at it! There are not too many stills and the animation itself is pretty fluent and while it still is not too amazing it certainly is above average! The Animation quality gets better in the second season, but still is in comparison to other Anime of that time nothing to noteworthy. The backgrounds often look pretty good though, especially when being the Academic City itself, surprising with a good amount of details. At some points the lighting is something that pleased me as well, even though that was rather rare in the show itself and happened more in the movie. The CGI though, looks pretty bad and that doesn't get better in the second season either. Unfortunately they use exactly that CGI for the backgrounds as well. It's not as clearly noticeable then though.\\n\r\nIndex: 7.5/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:The Soundtrack of Index was composed by I've, a Japanese techno sound production group. The Soundtrack itself is what I consider to be rather average. There are some tracks that are pretty cool and those are the ones that either show up as soon as some kind of mystery accures or as soon as people start fighting. In the more quite parts of the show though, the soundtrack was pretty generic and couldn't quite match up to the ones of others. The Openings on the other hand were all pretty much amazing! Every single one of them had more of a techno vibe to them. Every single one was sung by Kawada Mami, which did a really good job at it! They did a good job at preparing you for what was to come in the Anime itself, while getting you hyped if the last episode ended on a cliffhanger. In total the RailDex Franchise has amazing Openings. The endings were all quite good, but definitely skippable. They were nice to hear once or twice but after that, there was no real need to listen to them any more. The Voice Acting was splendid and leaves nothing to be desired as far as the emotions go. As my Japanese is not that good, I will refrain from saying more than that!\\n\r\nIndex: 8.1/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 8.1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn total To Aru Majutsu no Index is really good show, that has it's only big fault in it's main characters, but even that is something to get used to after a while. It convinces with a good story, a huge but likeable character cast and simply the amount of fun you have watching Touma punch someone in his face. It has amazing pacing and a skill to climax it amazingly well, making every arc somewhat epic!\\n\r\nNow as I calculated the scores I gave To Aru Majutsu no Index and it's second season (Story, Characters, Art, Sound and my personal Enjoyment), I came to a score of 7.94/10 for the first season and a score of 8,14/10 for the second season. Both are amazing even though they are flawed. The pure fun watching them turns around a lot! As it stands now the first season of Index has been licensed by FUNimation, but the second has not been picked up yet. The first season is also available on the FUNimation Website for legal streaming.\\n\r\nAnd with that, I hope you enjoyed this Review of Index and I see you next post!\\n\\n\r\nFollow me on Twitter: @Korigaming , Wordpress: korisanime.wordpress.com\\n\r\nDon't forget to subscribe and tell me your opinion by posting it on my wall!",

            "content": "To Aru Majutsu no Index is yet another anime adaptation by JC Staff based on a light novel series published by ASCII Media Works. This is a show that has as many good things as it does bad things.\r\nStory: The premise of To Aru Majutsu no Index (Index from now on) had me intrigued from the beginning, a story which is based on a science vs magic/religion is the type of plot I can really get into. However the way the story is executed turned the anime into something that could have been a great show with a deep and interesting plot into an animewith long and confusing dialogue that was so in love with its own world that you would wish everyone would stop talking for at least 1 minute. The action that the show would offer you would often get interrupted by more explanation and exposition about the situation and it would hurt the pacing and momentum that the show itself built. The story itself is also very \"episodic\" in a way. The show has been segmented into many different mini-arcs which followed a pretty basic 2-3 episode long outline:\\n\r\n- Main character gets dragged into a weird situation\\n\r\n- Main character finds an antagonist behind the events\\n\r\n- Main character and antagonist fight\\n\r\n- Main character wins but ends up in the hospital\\n\r\nI am not joking every arc on this anime ends with the main character hospitalized. However despite all these details the story of the anime can still be enjoyable and interesting at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I have no complains with the animation on this anime. It is very well made and its very flashy when in comes to battles and backgrounds. This is a good looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Apart from the great OP songs from the ever-sweet Kawada Mami. There is not much else to say about the sound department on Index. It does the job well enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Another one of the issues I have with the anime is the way the characters are handled. The actual characters on the show are all interesting on their own way however the anime is only fixated on the main MALE lead Touma, while every other character takes a supporting role cast. In every arc we see Touma encounter a new character, and for those 2-3 episode we see the new character and Touma be the focus of the show but once that is over we barely ever see that character again, or it only lurks in the background. This condition is so extreme not even the \"main\" female character Index, whose name is on the anime title, escapes this reality. For the first 4-5 episodes we are introduced and aquainted with Index, however past that point she is almost non existent and is only shown for the sake of having at least the most minimal screen time on each episode. Such threatement for the characters really lessened the enjoyment I could've had watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though i have mostly complained here, I still liked this anime. Im a little sad that it didnt live up to its full potential but its not a bad show on its own right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Despite the terrible handling of the characters and the story, To Aru Majutsu no Index manages to be an entertaining show for those who enjoy magic and supernatural abilities. And I would recommend it for anyone who wants to kill time.",

            "content": "This review will cover both seasons of A Certain Magical Index as well a bit of the movie called A Certain Magical Index The Miracle of Endymion.\r\nI have a complex relationship with the Raildex series. Ever since I was introduced to the series from my group of friends my opinion of the RailDex series has been all over the place. On one hand, I really adored certain elements of the series such as Sisters arc in Railgun S and the first arc of Index while I hated such as Touma Gary Sue preachy power-ups speeches and the contrived Silent Party Arc of Railgun S. Needlessto say I enjoyed the Raildex for what it is despite its numerous flaws. Now unlike Full Metal Panic, Inazuma Eleven and Legend of The Galactic Heroes I didn\u2019t get excited for Index Season 3 at all mainly because I didn\u2019t like A Certain Magical Index all that much. Apart from the first arc as well arcs that have Accelerator focused I honestly cannot the life of me stand the series mainly because it\u2019s a badly paced action harem that is filled with plot conveniences, asspulls and terrible writing. This was basically my first watch of A Certain Magical Index in a nutshell and it wasn\u2019t a happy experience for me at all. One day when I was out looking for anime to buy a month before season 3 began airing I saw both seasons of A Certain Magical Index in an anime sell. I originally wanted to get Higurashi When They Cry Season 1 but the series was sold out. Rather then waiting for Higurashi to come back in stock in the following I decided to give A Certain Magical Index a second chance by not only buying the series but I also re-watching the series. Now with said did my opinion of A Certain Magical Index changed for the better or for the worse. Let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nAcademy City is a central point for all scientific environments housing espers capable of displaying incredible super psychic powers. The story follows a level zero esper named Touma_Kamijou who as he was leaving his home comes across a young none named Index hanging outside of his balcony. She says that she\u2019s on a run from dangerous sorcerers who want to use her as a tool where they can access the 1003000 million forbidden magical text that she memorised in her head. Getting dragged into the world of magicians and psychics Touma decides to project Index at all cost even if he will cost him his life. Touma has a unique power called Imagine Breaker which grants him the power to nullify any kind of magic and psychical ability that someone throws at him with on touch.\\n\r\nThe story follows a Level 0 esper named Touma who always seemed to have bad luck thanks to his right hand. His right hand has the ability to nullify any esper ability that they throw at him.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk the things I don\u2019t like about let\u2019s talk about things that liked and that is first 6 episodes. Right out the gate, the first six episodes aka the first arc contained a lot of top-tier storytelling as despite being simple on paper it\u2019s very well executed thanks to its great story elements that were well thought out especially at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final thing that I liked about Index was the arcs that featured Accelerator. Not only these arcs were nicely paced but it was nicely well written as after the sister\u2019s arc he goes a series of redemption arcs where despite being evil in nature he tries to make all the bad things he has previously done. I honestly had fun watching these arcs more than watching any arc that involved Touma.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the show slowly starts to show it\u2019s ugly true tensions which I will talk about in a bit but for now, am going to talk about the things I don\u2019t like about Index because there is a lot of them that ultimately plague the series.\\n\r\nThe first problem that I had with Index it that the show literally throws every sci-fi plot device element possible including insanity completely scientific explanations, evil organizations, church conspiracy, religious holy artefacts and cloning experiments and guess what\u2019s? This show absolutely sucks at explaining all of these plot points to the viewer and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t help that 80% of the dialogue is dedicated to explanation and drowning on and on with overally completed explanations for just about everything. What makes this worse is how sometimes these plot elements only show up for one time like angel or golems while others never show up all. Case in point the vampires stuff in the second arc of Index. This lack of explanations towards really hurts the worldbuilding in Index as it show tries to make Academy City this epic city that is filled with life and mystery but it ultimately failed and as a result, your left with a world that is quite frankly empty in execution.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the show messy execution is only made of how bad the direction in this series is. For example, in episode 14 of the second season, Touma wanted to use a bathroom. Instead of knocking through the door this incompetent dumbass bares in the bathroom where he sees a naked girl showering. Instead of dumbass saying sorry like a normal for entering in the bathroom without knocking this dumbass just stands there and acts all shocked like a fool as he stares a naked girl. To add insult to injury he does it again with the second door only this time Touma gets head bitten by Index. That scene alone from episode 14 of S2 really highlights how shit the comedy is as well general direction as the shit comedy could have easily been avoided.\\n\\n\r\nThe second worst thing about A Certain Magical Index is the pacing. Now because the majority of the arcs are only 6 to 2 episodes long you can expect theses arcs to rushed as hell as the series does a poor job what is happening on screen seemed theses plot elements seemed to mostly pop up from nowhere without any building or even tension. The only arcs that didn\u2019t suffer from the rushed pacing were arcs that featured Accelerator as those arcs were nicely paced where the series its time of explaining what is happening in a set arc that features Accelerator. Yes, he did appear in the Sisters and Academy City Invasion Arcs but least he was kickass in those arcs and he wasn\u2019t a bore compared to the lifeless overpowered Gary Sue Touma.\\n\r\nAfter Season 1 the only thing I was looking forward was the Accelerator arcs because they were nicely written and unpredictable compared to the arcs that feature Touma\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the worst thing about the series I\u2019m going to quickly talk about the movie because it sucks as it just seemed to follow every bad anime movie plot based on a popular anime series imaginable.\\n\r\nYes, the movie may have production values and all but it\u2019s ultimately matter when you have aboustly no substance to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought the unexplained stuff and pacing were bad you ain\u2019t seen nothing because the problem that is going to talk about now killed the series for me and that problem is that A Certain Magical Index is a harem series disguised as a sci-fi battle anime.\\n\r\nWords cannot describe of how pissed I when I was done watching both seasons of Index that I literally found the show true intentions as all this time I was watching a badly directed harem series that has doesn\u2019t have much substance at all.\\n\\n\r\n>> What are you talking about me this show ain\u2019t a harem at all.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let me explain.\\n\r\nAfter the first arc was over aka episode 6 the series seemed to feature set arc girl that was meant to be on Touma side the problem is apart from Misaka where she had some character development every single girl is literally a plot device for the narrative for each arc plus Touma was always the one that protects set girl from danger for each arc where the girls for each don\u2019t do much to defend themselves. Not only that but the show throws in every harem cliche you have ever seen such as the innocent guy entering in bathrooms without knocking while a set girl is naked and the girl punches/kicks the guy for breaching it. It was that point where I lose all hope for A Certain Magical Index because the series went from being intriguing sci-fi anime that devolved into this shameful harem sci-fi action feast that doesn\u2019t respect the viewers time.\\n\r\nOverall the story of A Certain Magical Index is at best-wasted potential and at worst it\u2019s one of the lousiest stories I have ever seen.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf there were two words to describe the charterers in A Certain Magical Index is wasted potential. Apart from two characters the characters in Index are a bunch of bland stereotypes who barely developed in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAm not kidding when I say this but Touma is one of my most hated male anime protagonists I have ever seen. Seriously this guy is not only bland to the absolute core but also an overpowered Gary Sue who loves to give out these stupid and forced justice speeches.\\n\\n\r\nThe chararter Index is not much better as despite being decent in the first 6 episodes she just this annoying little brat who barely does anything apart bite Touma head for a living.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully we have Misaka who is by far the best thing to come out from this lacklustre character cast. She may appear as this generic tomboy at first however unlike most other anime tomboys she has a very good reason of why she acts the way she does. She has a reputation of being one of the strongest espers of Academy City in such a young age. It makes perfect sense of why she wanted to act though to keep her reputation intact. This alone really add so much dept to her chararter and it really makes her presence in the anime much more memorable. On top all that she has one of the most original backstories I have seen while and while it was better executed in Railgun S but it\u2019s was still nicely executed here.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as a adore Misaka I feel like she highlights how bad the characterisation in the series is because she along with Accelerator are great characters while the other characters are interesting as rocks.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this is a character named Kuroko aka Misaka\u2019s roommate and best friend. I really enjoyed her in Railgun as she was this badass girl who is capable of talking down criminals using her esper ability teleportation. Kuroko had some good characters in Railgun S1. She may have this unhealthy crush of Misaka but other than that she was a character that I enjoyed in Railgun.\\n\r\nIndex on the other hand despite coming out a year before the season 1 took everything that I liked about her character and turned her into an unfunny, annoying and one-dimensional brat where the only thing that she does other than plot reason is to be an obsessive creepy lover for Misaka.\\n\\n\r\nThe final character that I want to talk about is Accelerator. I really liked him. He starts off as this ruthless psychotic villain who is willing to kill thousands of Misaka clones just he can surpass level 5. The interesting thing about Accelerator as a chararter is how the show slowly tries to make him a decent human being later on after the sister\u2019s arc we see him actually see him trying to attempt redemption with all the bad things that he has done. He also starts caring for someone where he is willing to look after and protect a young girl named Misaka Last Order. He\u2019s is by far the second best thing about this entire show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall despite having two good supporting the characters in A Certain Magical Index was lacklustre and poorly executed.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhile the plot and characters were a failure the visuals were pretty good. A Certain Magical Index is like watching a beautiful fireworks display of explosives colours.  The background scenery has this shining electrifying urban colour palette that goes a fantastic job of capturing the life of Academia City. The characters designs were pretty cool for the most part as they all look clean and appealing to look at\\n\r\nThe animation in Index is pretty great stuff especially coming from J.C Staff who well knows of making well animated in the series. There was a lot of fulfilment movement when the characters are fighting.\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the visuals is how some of the female characters look pretty similar to each other as many of the female characters seemed to have loli facial structure even though some of the characters in the series are older.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nCompared to the soundtrack of Railgun the soundtrack in Index is just okay. While there were a few good tracks in the show that fit the show very fell many of the tracks were not that memorable let alone with the show at times.\\n\r\nAll the opening themes Index were pretty good and memorable in their own ways especially opening 3 No buts!\u201d by Mami Kawada which is one of my favourite anime openings of all time.\\n\r\nThe ending themes on the other are just okay and not that memorable in my eyes.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good for what it is as all the Seiyuus did a pretty good with the roles that they were given.\\n\r\nThe dub is very good and I consider to be Funimation better dubs. It is very well acted and the dialogue for the dub was nicely handled. My favourite performances in the dub were Austin Tindle as Accelerator, Brittney Karbowski as Misaka and Micah Solusod as Touma. Overall very good dub.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nA Certain Magical Index is a mess. While it did have some strong aspects that were enjoyable such as Misaka, the Accelerator arcs and production values.\\n\r\nHowever, the shows negatives, unfortunately, outweigh the positives. The story was a terribly written mess that exposes itself as a shitty harem. The pacing was bad, the poor used side characters and the main characters like Touma and Index were awful.\\n\r\nEven though I don\u2019t like this show I still recommend it to people who want to watch a fun sci-fi anime that has some interesting things in it. Just don\u2019t buy into the hype from people about this series as it will only disappoint you greatly if you're an experienced anime fan such as myself.\\n\r\nFinal Score 4.5/10",

            "content": "Largely a compilation of various archetypes and cliches meant to produce something to hold over the Shana crowd until the inevitable Season 3, To Aru Majutsu no Index embodies the same animation style, similar story progression, and yet another myriad of needlessly confusing terminology. However, Index does manage to possess some very different characters than it's spiritual predecessor that add some freshness to an otherwise tired production.\r\nIf there's one thing you can't fault J.C. Staff on, it's the animation. Sharp, crisp, with a signature pallet and inspired character design, Index can be a treat to look at. Consistent in its appearance throughout, it does afine job of carrying a sharp appearance, even though it does not strive to be anything beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another matter. The opening and ending themes just aren't up to the quality of the animation and, for me at least, seemed to drag down the sequences. Generic BGM throughout didn't help, though vocal performances are of note. Yuka Iguchi and Rina Satou especially as Index and Misaka add great energy and depth to their respective character's lines. The rest of the cast isn't bad either, ranging from enjoyable to decent. What a complete waste of Mamiko Noto though.\\n\\n\r\nThese performances were also greatly amplified by a very likeable cast. Index is a real charmer from the get-go and Misaka's firecracker personality really adds something to the dynamic of the Index-Touma-Misaka triangle. I have no complaints about Touma personally, but he is another generic male lead with a built-in deus ex machina. Fortunately, it isn't the be-all end-all solution it appears to be. The supporting cast is enjoyable, but so many of them are sparsely seen, with some disappearing as quickly as they appear, that it's easy to forget or just not care about them.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are intriguing enough to keep watching, the plot isn't. Functioning on an individual arc setup, it's too disjointed with too little themes carried over from arc to arc to make it worth the effort. While Index lacks its spiritual predecessor's romantic angst, at least said angst helped carry the story over each individual arc. Here, Index has few if any ties throughout, burning bridges as quickly as it can construct them. Add in the previously mentioned myriad of complicated terminology that perpetuates the dialogue of the series, and even the strongest attention spans may be jolted by this one.\\n\\n\r\nSo what can be said about it as a whole? It's certainly not a terrible series, but there's too much wasted potential. The character relationships are stagnant and the poignant characters of each arc are gone with the next. It's more a compilation of side stories than a full-bodied plot, heavy on the dialogue but short-handed on plot or character development. But it is likeable, and nice to look at, and with some luck, the franchise will become more focused in the future. For now, it's disposable eye candy. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give To Aru Majutsu no Index a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "After watching (and enjoying) A Certain Scientific Railgun, I was very excited to start this show. Railgun is meant to be as a spinoff for one of the side characters in Index, so I was very curious to see what the main story actually is. To my dismay, however, I learned that Index, despite being the main story, is overwhelmingly average and mediocre compared to Railgun. I doubt I would have enjoyed this at all if there weren't any of the side characters from Railgun to keep things somewhat interesting.\r\nMuch like most anime that I have gripes with, my main two issues are the storyand the characters. Let's begin with the story: in a single word, I would describe it as disjointed. The story is split into several small arcs that feel like they have very little to do with one another; in addition, none of the arcs are particularly interesting (aside from the one that featured the MC from Railgun). The \"magic\" side of the show feels generic and offers absolutely nothing new to anyone who has ever seen any show like this. Overall, most of the episodes failed to keep my interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my other biggest problem, or more specifically the character motivations. The main character is basically copy-pasted from any other superpower harem anime and he has a martyr complex to the point of attempting to sacrifice himself every chance he gets for a character (usually a girl) that he literally just met. And of course, on the other side of this, every girl he meets ends up inexplicably developing feelings for him because he seems to care so much and because fuck it he's the main character. Almost none of the characters are developed and the majority of them are not interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThis series ultimately serves as a far inferior complement to the much more enjoyable and well-written A Certain Scientific Railgun. If I hadn't enjoyed Railgun so much I likely would've dropped this fairly quickly. Although an anime doesn't need to have complex/interesting characters to be enjoyable (see: Hataraku Maou-Sama!), nor does it need to have a particularly original story, not having either ends up only further exposing the flaws of the show. And this show certainly had many flaws exposed.",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index is an anime that can make you feel murderous, and then make you feel bad about yourself because you know that these feelings make you not nearly as moral or righteous as the main character in the series. If you were an antagonist in this anime, you would lose because you don't have the power of PUPPIES AND RAINBOWS AND A DREAM OF EVERYONE SMILING HAPPILY TOGETHER AND NOT HAVING TO FIGHT. \r\nPros:\r\n-Interesting concept\r\nCons: \r\n-Terrible execution of said concept\r\nHaving a world of science and magic and one boy that sort of stands between them is interesting...in theory. His ability to nullifypowers and the abilities of other characters could all have come together to create some epic battle scenes and stories...but why would they do that when they could just completely cop out? Instead of a story with twists and turns and deep meaning, the makers of this series (whoever you consider that to be) decided to make something where the main character wins every time via a holier-than-thou attitude and hax.\\n\r\n Here is the formula for this show:\\n\r\n1.There's a bad guy(s) with amazing powers and a damsel that needs saving (or at least the main character decides that she does).\\n\r\n2. The main character attempts to save the damsel, despite having practically no power in comparison to the enemy.\\n\r\n3. Main character gets whooped UNTIL he gives a long, drawn out, repetitive, hackneyed speech about how much his opponent sucks and how they aren't good enough and need to be happier/kinder/more thoughtful.\\n\r\n4. He magically beats the snot out of them with his glorious fists of virtue.\\n\r\n5. Damsel falls in love with him. Oh, and throw in some fanservice/the main character getting beaten up by one of his numerous love interests somewhere. \\n\\n\r\n One thing that bothers me the most about this anime is how logic apparently doesn't apply to it. One antagonist in particular needs to do complex calculations in his mind to use his powers\u2014calculations that can be pretty challenging with a calculator and a formula in front of your face\u2014yet they seriously want me to believe that he's beaten by the main character because the main character \"has street fighting skills\"? The enemy doesn't even have to get near him to attack for God's sake! Sure, he can nullify some of his enemy's power, but with only his right hand to null attacks I'm fairly positive that his enemy could have come up with SOMETHING to counter that. \"Oh, but the opponent relies too much on his power and thinks he's unbeatable.\" Yeah, but do you truly believe that after someone realized the person that they're fighting could cancel out their power that they wouldn't think of a way to avoid getting close to them? That someone would have to be a moron. And really, all of the people who want the main character dead just keep using the same tactics? \"What, he can cancel out all powers and has beaten every single thing we've thrown at him? Well, send out another magic user/esper after him. It's bound to work eventually.\" NO, NO IT'S NOT.  Is it really that hard to hire a freelancing goon to make him disappear? I think not. Honestly, it's enough to make you...well, rant on MAL. Another thing is how the girls, without fail, always. need. saving. Many of them have powers vastly superior to his, yet they still need him to, what? Be moral? What does he have that they don't, other than lack of a likable personality and of powers? \\n\\n\r\nThe best parts of this show are probably the fight scenes...if you put them on mute when the main character starts talking. Actually, the best ones usually don't involve him because all he does is use the same moves over and over again, like a five-year-old playing a fighting game and only pressing x. \\n\\n\r\nIs the show horrendous? No. Is it infuriating? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Addicting? At times, adding to the infuriation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this most certainly isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but the glaring flaws definitely brought out a lot of rage. If what I've mentioned previously doesn't bother you in a series and you're considering watching it, go for it I suppose. Although you should also be warned that his main female counterpart, Index, is also painfully obnoxious, so beware.",

            "content": "Ok, i\u2019ve been meaning to write a review for a show for a while now, and now i finally got the time.  So here it is. \r\n[3]Story:  So the story is pretty simple. The setting is a future world where we have espers, highly evolved science, magicians, guys with random powers no one knows shit about, well you get the deal.  So our main guy is Touma, a complete noob (ya, really.). He has been haunted by misfortune since he was born, and he is unable to use magic or esper abilitys. What he do have though, is a random power noone knows shit about. Cool eh? Apparently his right hand possess the power to break any esper ability, spell and what not. the downside is that Touma himself can\u2019t use magic or anything like that. Anyway, he meets this girl called index who apparently memorizes everything she sees, and she has memorized a whole book with spells in it. So a shit load of stuff happens, Touma meets some weird people, kick some ass, and then kicks some more ass. Then we go to the next arc. I should add that this show is so heavily divided into arcs that every arc could be a new season. This can be a good thing in some cases, but here it is not. Anyway, so the first arc was about his saving Index life bla bla. the next arc is about Misaka, a side character. Guess what the arc after that is about? Ye, Misaka. This show could really be called \u201cToaru majutsu no Misaka\u201d. She\u2019s one of those side characters that really steal the show.  So the story gets a pretty low score, basically because it makes to heavy use of arcs and don\u2019t bind them togheter. The main female character, which the show is even named after, is basically forgotten. Bad. \\n\\n\r\n[7]Art: The art was good, animations were good.  I have nothing to complain about. I should add that im no art expert whatsoever, so this is a score that don\u2019t influence the final score as much as other things.  \\n\\n\r\n[4]Sound: OP was fine, ED was meh. This doesn\u2019t really matter in the rating of the show, but its fun mentioning!. Anyway, the music used in the show isn\u2019t really something we haven\u2019t heard before, but ye, it wasn\u2019t that good. Its like, you don\u2019t notice there even is a soundtrack, its just there because without it, it would sound weird! \\n\r\n  The voice acting was like the soundtrack, just a little better. I liked Misakas voice though.. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Characters: for me one of the most important aspects of a show is the characters. The characters in this show was really hard to like, except for Misaka. She atleast, have some development. The other characters were all kinda meh. It seems some people likes Index, and ye ok, she wasn\u2019t all that bad BUT. She has like 0 screen time. Zero. I atleast didn\u2019t like her, no development, to little screen time. As for the main character, he is hard to like imo. Its not that he got to little screen time, its just that he\u2019s very unoriginal, boring, full of fail and somehow, liked by all the other characters. He\u2019s sort of like the main character in school days, just that he doesn\u2019t fuck everything that comes in his way. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Enjoyment: well, If you have read the whole thing here above, you probably know what you\u2019r about to read now. Ye, I didn\u2019t like the show that much. Sure it got its sunny moments sometimes,  it got me chuckle a time or two, but it just doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that the show is fail. Fail fail fail. Im going to go ahead and give the show a 5. The show is still airing (seen 20 episodes right now), and if the ending somehow is very, very good then the score may be raised to a 6. But as it seems now, the show isn\u2019t heading that way. If you want to turn off your brain and just watch something, watch this, and think of it like \u201ctoaru majutsu no Misaka\u201d. You could skip the first arc for all what it matters. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading ! \\n",

            "content": "We have an egotistical alchemist with reality manipulation, a murderous psychic with vector control, and a magician with rampaging golems. You know what they all need in common? A good punch to the face... \r\n...courtesy of a Mr. T\u014dma Kamij\u014d right fist. Sourced from Kazuma Kamachi's light novel franchise (and later, manga series), A Certain Magical Index follows the misfortunes of Kamij\u014d when a rather eventful encounter with a nun hanging from his dorm room balcony throws headlong into friction-filled world of science and magic. Science, through Academy City, where he currently studies to realize his supposedly untapped potential as an esper. Magic, through Index,where he eventually ends up cares and protects her from forces that target her, in part, due to the 103,000 grimoires locked within the recesses of her photographic mind. And then there's his right hand, Imagine Breaker (Yes, he has a name for it), which has the mysterious congenital ability to negate any all paranormal and supernatural abilities that it comes in contact with. Produced by J.C. Staff, with direction by Hiroshi Nishikiori, script by Seishi Minakami and Masanao Akahoshi, and character designs, original and adaptation, by Kiyotaka Haimura and Yuichi Tanaka, respectively, it avoids an annoyingly lazy cop out common in a lot of contemporary low fantasy fiction: that science and magic are one and the same. Understanding that they are effectively separate allows for new avenues of potential in the setting to be explored.\\n\\n\r\nOne is that it allows the story to cover a wide range of interesting premises without the shackling constraints a tight system of logic. One on the magical end revolves around vampires, a girl, and the inadvertent destruction of her entire village that unwittingly turned, her family included. Another on the science spectrum revolves around clones, a girl, and the inadvertent massacre of over 10,000 of them for an experiment. Two is that it permits the story to set up a rich, multilayered universe that facilitates exchanges of the two sides that are both intra and well as inter, among as well as between. Academy City as well as other research communities scattered throughout serve as the domains of science, while the multiple denominations of the Church serve as the realms of magic. For those both sides who know that both worlds exist, their reactions toward each other come about as mixed relationships of either cooperation, tolerance, or animosity. Speaking of which, three is that it prompts the story to hover around a rather engaging overall natural antagonism. In other words, it sets the stage for a grand scale sense of intrigue. The underlying tension between these two powers remains in constant danger of roiling and boiling over, threatening the shakily established truce that allows sorcerers and psychics to survive without constantly being at each others throats.\\n\\n\r\nA couple other things commendable about Index are its OPs and EDs. The OPs and EDs, respectively, keep to one particular artist group, though they all cover one particular musical theme. While the pacing and atmosphere for OP1 and OP2, \u201cPSI-missing\u201d and \u201cmasterpiece\u201d by Kawada Mami, are drastically different, the former more mellow and melancholy than the latter, which is more dynamic and climactic, they both have that techno feeling that matches the show's technologically advanced setting: radio noise, voice distancing, auto- tuning, irregular rhythm lagging, and/or abnormal beat skipping, among other separate electronic embellishments by the keyboard, electric guitar, drum set, and synth. ED1 and ED2 \u201cRimless ~Fuchinashi no Sekai~\u201d or \u201cRimless ~ Rimless World ~\u201d and \u201cChigaikoto ~ Sukoshi Dake M\u014d Ichido ~\u201d or \u201cOath ~ Just a Bit, One More Time ~\u201d by IKU have the same techno add-ins, but come off more mellow and relaxed. My favorite, though has to be ED2, because I just prefer straight old singing. The electronic embellishments, which can admittedly muck up the melody at times, complements the vocals in this song quite nicely by adding a sense of breathe and broadness.\\n\\n\r\nBear in mind, though, the term \u201cpotential.\u201d I wouldn't be able to comprehend much even if it was possible to prove on paper, but since the show tries to present esper abilities as a matter of physics, I can do this much to explain my critique on Index. You have the sum total of Index's premises as an object on the very top of a flight of stairs. Compared to the ground below, it has a relatively large amount of potential, or potential energy when placed on the edge of a flight of stairs. That potential energy is utilized when force pushes the sac down the stairs, converting that potential energy to execution, or kinetic energy. Yet the force was only so great and proper as for the object to drop a few steps before coming to a full stop. Relative to the ground, a significant amount of potential energy remains. Why? Because it was a weak ass push. Or rather, because it's poorly written. Not to the point where the plot doesn't make any serious sense, but to the point that it unravels in such a ridiculous fashion that it's hard to take seriously. For a show that indulges a lot of action, there's an awful lot of talking that occurs back and forth in during those segments, their goals, their abilities, how they're really going to bust each others' shits this time if they don't desist, to the point where the participants should just go ahead and share their life stories, dating preferences, and money saving tips over stew while they're at it. The money part especially, since the decent visuals are what probably took up much of the show's budget. One scene had Kamijo looking like he was running in place during a fight for about a minute while his opponent spoke on. Basically, there's a lack of urgency where the context so desperately requires it. What isn't lacking is the amount of exposition that was needed to define each character and situation the audience is introduced to to make the developments in the show comprehensible to follow. Because we are, more or less, told rather than shown who so and so is and what so and so means, it makes it that much more difficult to emotionally invest ourselves it in what's happening to who. This especially pertains to our main male protagonist whenever he touts off one of his sermons, sermons which blur the line between righteousness and self-righteousness, because at the end of the day, he usually has to smack someone to get the point across. It might be because the pacing for each arc was rushed, but it also might be due to how much time is wasted trying to initially show something gimmicky instead of solid, a major offender of this being Index herself, who's, funnily enough, a lot of bite, literally speaking, among other things, yet little bite, metaphorically speaking, to show on her own. There's myriad conveniences that the show likes to throw to advance the plot at the expense of belief, like how Kamijo can magically... scratch that, scientifically reattach a severed arm with seemingly no permanent consequence to his health. There's the fan service, which is so obnoxiously shoehorned in at times that it stomps whatever semblance of belief remained with spiked shoes. Or would you prefer a bare foot? Or feet, considering the show also has harem undertones?\\n\\n\r\nIt was poorly executed, poorly written, poorly planned... I've concluded as much. But all in all, in spite of its setbacks, Index has so much potential in the premise and setting that the portions of the show that weren't quite as messed up stood out quite positively. Hopefully, future productions of this franchise will utilize better scripting.\\n\\n\r\nI give A Certain Magical Index a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "If I had to use one word to describe this series, it would be: Confusing.\r\nA Certain Magical Index is the exact type of anime, that sucks you in like a black hole in the starting episodes...and then leaves you hanging. \r\nThe setting is great, the future, an academy city full off students, robots everywhere, people with supernatural powers empowered by science and on the other side there are bona fide sorcerers wielding magic that stems from a religious background (Christianity to be exact). There are HUGE possibilities in this setting for really intriguing stories and characters to emerge. And the starting episode sets the storyup incredibly well. There is just one problem...\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the whole series devolves into a confusing mess quickly. The protagonists who had the chance to be well-rounded leaders of the story, turn out to be simple tropes hastily thrown together (in the wrong mix). The support characters are initially very interesting, but turn out to be nothing but one dimensional plot devices and most of them are only there for one episode, never to be seen again. \\n\\n\r\nToma, the main protagonist seem to change personalities from episode to episode (and from scene to scene), sometimes being an indecisive dunce and in the next scene he is the assertive badass of the century. Index, the second protagonist is even more confusing, being the damsel in distress, the tragic heroine with immense power, the tsundere and the comic relief moe all in one, also changing personalities from scene to scene. It feels like the producers of the series wanted to create complex characters with many sides, but ended up with a schizophrenic mess of personality traits and tropes that just don't match and end up conflicting each other at every step.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the storyline....or the lack of one. The first few episodes introduces the world and the buds of a great story that starts to gain momentum, but then turns around and throws a monkey wrench in it. And then a box full of monkey wrenches. The story keeps throwing seemingly random tropes at the viewer, to the point, that I spent more time exclaiming \"what?\", \"huh?\" and \"why?\" at the screen than actually enjoying the anime. Characters emerge from nowhere, do something incredibly important to the story and then vanish forever. Things happen that are never explained or even hinted at before or after the fact and even the characters gain and lose powers without warning, totally unexplained, acting only as mere plot devices. Furthermore, even the main characters doesn't seem to have arcs or any character development whatsoever, they just lurch into the next episode like zombies. Not that anyone would notice with that lack of coherent personalities. It all feels like the creators had a bunch of different stories written up and the characters are nothing but mere afterthoughts, vessels for these stories, without any soul. This fact alone makes it incredibly hard to like any of the characters, even the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can praise beside the great setting is the art direction. Everything looks beautiful, the character designs are great (however they do feel like each of them was stolen from different anime) and the backdrops, the scenes, the settings and the animation quality are all top notch. Too bad the story and the characters are so messed up, this could've been a really unique and engaging series.",

            "content": "In order to enjoy this anime one has to realize that these are story arcs each having a number of episodes. Each of these arcs have some sort of boss battle in each end. Too bad most of the bosses aren't too impressive. And the finale doesn't weave all the arcs into one. \r\nThe story is too shounen oriented which will deter those that are looking for depth. It is unfortunate since there is  potential for the storyline which in turn is trying too hard to be deep with the inclusion of quasi-physics theories that only drags it down.\r\nPacing-wise it feels way too slow.A good amount of time is spent on needless talking even though the viewer already knows what's going to happen. Most of the time viewers will feel that the story should go to the boss battles as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately there's the art and animation. The high-production value is almost prevalent throughout all 24 episodes. Lighting, character design, backdrop, etc. I find the loliness of the girls' character designs disturbing. Then again the artist (as well as fans of the female character designs of TAMNI) likes lolis so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nBGM is average at best so that leaves us with the techno-oriented OPs and EDs which are almost memorable and fits the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that spans 24 episodes there's little to no character development. No problem with that. Most shounen action animes stick to this formula. It's just that they didn't stand out too much.\\n\\n\r\nAmidst all its flaws, I did enjoy TAMNI because I just needed to shrink my anime backlog. But it just can't stand out from the season's batch. Maybe because it's from an unfinished manga; maybe because it only touched around volume 6 of the said manga. I don't know. It just felt empty after watching it.",

            "content": "*to those who are too lazy to read and just want a quick summary, skip to the final paragraph*\r\nOne of the greatest battles that mankind has ever witnessed is the battle between science and religion, a battle that is still being fought today. So just imagine, what will happen if people with supernatural abilities existed and both these sides got hold of people whose special abilities that are nothing short of miraculous? So how exactly does this relate to To Aru Majutsu no Index? Well I suppose a short summary of the story is in order.\r\nNow To Aru Majutsu no Index (which I would justrefer to now as Majutsu no Index) is set in a world where both science and magic coexist. Kamijou Touma, you regular high school kid lives within a place called Academy City, the so called \u201cutopia of science\u201d as well as an utopia for a new type of people known as ESPers, people who can have supernatural abilities by controlling the laws of science. Kamijou Touma, being a student in the Academy City, has a strange power called \u201cImagine Breaker\u201d, a skill which allows him to dispel anything magical or is a product of ESPer powers. On the other hand, there is Index Prohibitorum Librorum (or Index for short), a nun who has the superhuman ability to remember virtually anything and has memorized in her mind 103,000 grimoires concerning magic that is prohibited by the church or is otherwise just far too dangerous to be used. One day, Touma found a starving Index hanging in his balcony after being chased by mysterious men, begging him for food. This is where the story starts as Touma finds himself in the middle of all the problems concerned with letting a walking manual for destruction live in his house.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you gotta admit, the idea of science and magic clashing against each other is a pretty freaking good concept, and a good concept always mean a good anime right? Well, Majutsu no Index had pretty much everything that a good anime has: a good concept, interesting premises, and a recipe for romance. Unfortunately, it failed to use its full potential as an anime because of certain mistakes made by the producers of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s start off with the story. As I\u2019ve said, Majutsu no index is set on interesting premises yet it failed to fully utilize all of its hidden potential. You see, one of the biggest problems here is, or the lack thereof, of a main antagonist because what happened is that the anime was split into two sides : the magic side and the science side. \\n\\n\r\nThe magic side is the side concerned with magic aspect of the anime. The plots concerning this side usually just revolves around people who are relentlessly trying to kidnap Index to learn the secrets in her head and wreak havoc upon the earth, those who want to save Index from her perfect memory, which they claim would kill her if they don\u2019t brainwash her every year since she would remember every detail she sees and ultimately overload her brain, and the church which is responsible for pretty much all of Index\u2019s problems. And obviously, it\u2019s Touma\u2019s job to protect Index which he usually does by talking and punching the said magicians into submission. Though that way of solving things isn\u2019t really all that bad, what really makes the magic side so terrible is that it\u2019s quite episodic when it comes to plot. The plot from one arc to another just doesn\u2019t add up and that makes it quite terrible: the fact that it has no continuality.\\n\\n\r\nThe science side on the other hand, is a heck lot more interesting in terms of plot than the magic side. It revolves around the concept of leveling up ESPers. You see, the thing with ESPers is that they are ranked using levels, starting from level 0 (which is by the way, Touma\u2019s level) and above. This is done in order to measure how strong an ESPer is with level 0 being weakest, virtually having no powers, and those with higher levels having stronger powers. The current highest level ESPers have been able to attain is level 5, a title which seven different people in Academy City hold. The story focuses on two of these level 5 ESPers, namely Misaka Mikoto, who was the ability to control electricity and is a friend to Touma, and The Accelerator, who can control and redirect vectors at will. What happened is that Academy City decided to create the first level 6 ESPer, and there are only two ways to do it: Either have a level 5 ESPer kill roughly 128 other level 5 ESPers, or to have a level 5 ESPer kill 20,000 level 3 ESPers. Seeing as they only have seven level 5 ESPers, they opted for the other method: have a level 5 ESPer, namely The Accelerator, kill 20,000 level 3 ESPers. Now the question is where do they get 20,000 level 3 ESPers? \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed by now, yes, I am biased towards the science side of the story but there is a good reason for that. As I\u2019ve said, what this series lacks is the presence of a main antagonist, and what the science side gives is just that, along with a solid plot. On the other hand, the magic side is, as I\u2019ve mentioned, quite episodic in nature, jumping around from one antagonist to the other and having no clear goal as to where it would lead the story next after one conflict is solved. This is one of the biggest downfalls of Majutsu no Index and is one of the main reasons as to why it fails to live up to its potential. Another problem with this anime is that the magic and science side of the story almost never crosses each other, despite the fact that they should be two sides of the same coin. This is especially annoying from time to time because it causes quite a few plotholes in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the problems with Majutsu no Index lies in its characters. I\u2019m not saying that they are bad, it\u2019s just that they are so clich\u00e9 it hurts. We have Kamijou Touma, who\u2019s definition of unlucky is seeing naked chicks and getting \u201cin touch\u201d with the ladies (gee, I haven\u2019t seen that before), Index, who is your regular hyperactive loli, Misaka, nicknamed biribiri, who is your run-of-the-mill tsundere, and others who would take too long to mention. But of course, that isn\u2019t the real problem, as clich\u00e9 characters can still be interesting despite the fact that they are, well, clich\u00e9. \\n\\n\r\nThe real problem is that the makers of the anime desperately try to make Touma, the main character, look badass when in fact, he\u2019s not. And for the sake of doing this, they pretty much confine most of the other characters to the sidelines. This becomes very apparent during the latter half of the show, when pretty much every problem ends up being solved when Touma punches the antagonist in the face.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, not all of the characters are bad. Take Accelerator for example. Aside from being the main antagonist for the majority of the science side plotline, he is also the one of the few characters that received a noticeable amount of character development. As the story introduced him as an evil psycho who is willing to kill tens of thousands to gain power, he was later shown to have a softer side who cares for others more than he seems .Other than him, most of the other anime characters just receive minimal amounts of development, maybe aside for one more character though discussing her here could spoil the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, the only redeeming feature Majutsu no Index has is in its animation and music. The Art was just the way I like it, clean, smooth, and shiny just like most of the newer animes today, though there are times when the movements seem a little bit choppy but this is barely noticeable and doesn\u2019t really affect the overall experience of watching this anime. The music on the other hand is just plain freaking awesome. The first and second openings, both J-pop songs, where sung by Kawada Mami which are in my opinion, just perfect for the theme of the anime: fast-paced and somehow had a futuristic tune to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I\u2019d have to say that To Aru Majutsu no Index is more or less an average anime. It\u2019s an anime with a good concept and interesting premises, it just happened to have been unable to fully utilize its full potential. Still though, that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a bad anime. It does have moments where it shines and shows some pretty amazing scenes. Unfortunately, it couldn\u2019t maintain that level of goodness throughout which becomes one of its downfalls. So this isn\u2019t really something that I would personally recommend, but if you\u2019re stuck with nothing to watch, or maybe you\u2019re one those who have a liking for shounen animes with a little bit of romance here and there then why not give this a shot. Who knows, you might come to like it more than I did. \\n\\n\r\nSo to provide a quick summary, here are a list of pros and cons:\\n\\n\r\n+ It has a good concept: Science against Magic\\n\r\n+The openings, both sung by Kawada Mami, were awesome J-pop songs\\n\r\n+The art was clean and smooth \\n\r\n+The Science side of the story had a good plotline \\n\r\n+The Accelerator is just a badass antagonist\\n\\n\r\n-The anime was unable to use its full potential and due to half of the story, the magic side, being terrible\\n\r\n-The makers of the anime were trying too hard to make the protagonist of the story, Touma, look badass despite the fact that he was not\\n\r\n-The animation can get a little choppy at times, though this isn\u2019t too noticeable\\n\r\n-The characters are quite clich\u00e9\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review.

            "content": "\"Then would you accompany me to the depth of hell?\" - Index\r\n\"When magic and science crosses path, what will happen?\" is how I would have liked to start this review. However the answer to that would have simply be \"nothing\" since, although both sides exists in the same place, there were hardly any interaction between them. So instead, I will begin by asking Index what she meant by accompanying her to the depth of hell. She was hardly present for half the show and during the rare occasions when she is in an episode, she gets sidelined and become a minor character with absolutely noimpact to the story (beside biting Touma on the head). \\n\\n\r\nSo what happened to those 103,000 magical texts? With the exception of the first few episodes and the last episode or two, where Index as a character actually matters to the plot, there is practically zero reference to the 103,000 magical texts for 80% of the show. Granted the production studio (J.C. Staff) wanted to follow the novel as closely as possible (and they did a very good job at it), it is understandable for the abrupt ending to the story thus far. But it still makes no sense for the story\u2019s centerpiece to be dangling here and there with no sense of purpose in the various story arcs.\\n\\n\r\nIf one were to ignore the problems mentioned above, then the overall production quality of Toaru Majutsu no Index is actually quite good. Decent animation from J.C. Staff (though sometimes the distant shots seem lacking in detail) plus a great cast of seiyu make this anime a pleasant watch to those who don\u2019t really mind a poor storyline. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, the mini arcs throughout the show which introduces and help create character developments are great in themselves. However, once the dust settles, it always makes me wonder what happen to the story that was suppose to center around Index. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, most were introduced to compliment the particular story arc (with the exception of the main protagonists). Afterward, they will tend to \u201cfade\u201d to the back sometimes making a few seconds appearance here and there with no significance. In terms of character development, not much observable changes occurred for the male protagonist and Index which can be attributed to the faithful following of the novel (since there wasn\u2019t that much matter to talk about at the time of the anime production). On the other hand the co-heroine/main protagonist, Mikoto, of the Railgun series (a spinoff of Toaru Majutsu no Index) did show considerable character growth which makes her shine like a bright star among the group of relatively static characters.\\n\\n\r\nThose familiar with Shana will instantly ring a bell in their head as they watch the first OP of this series. If the OP does not make you go \"OMG, this sounds similar to Shana\u2019s OP!\", then perhaps watching the daily interaction between Index and Touma will help ring some bells. To be more precise, one can even replace Index with Shana and voila, you have yourself Shakugan no Shana III. The point I am trying to make here is the similarities between the two anime. \\n\\n\r\n1. From the same production company. \\n\r\n2. At least one of their OP theme is sang by the same singer (Kawada Mami). \\n\r\n3. Shana = Index, Yuji = Touma.\\n\\n\r\nSo what am I trying to say here? It means that if you enjoy watching Shakugan no Shana, feel free to give this anime a try. The magician (magic) vs esper (science) theme advertised by Toaru Majutsu no Index does have its selling points, but I just think it desperately need a sequel to really link the various bits and pieces together. I enjoyed the mini arcs (whether they are filler or not), those irrelevant mini stories were very entertaining and they help keep my mind off Index. But once I start thinking deeper into the character ties and relationships, there is just something missing about the purpose of Index. Perhaps a hopeful sequel will fill in the missing puzzles, but as things stand right now the story really hurts the show.",

Some characters are likeable and entertaining but that makes up such a small percentage of the enormous cast that its just not worth it. TAMI is about a guy named Touma who lives in a city thats entire purpose is being a school for Espers (see: Psychics) although nobody actually reads minds and its more they all have a certain power. So nobody is psychic at all. Touma discovers a young girl hanging on his balcony whos a magicianbeing chased and he helps her. They become friends and have adventures. Thats TAMI in a nutshell, they tried having some main story throughout the whole thing but nothing important was revealed and the series couldnt keep a story arc going past 3 episodes. And thats where this show really falls to mediocrity. By constantly changing the focus of the story to some new threat and introducing 1-4 new characters every 3-5 episodes you lose the whole point of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are just so two dimensional and uninteresting that you dont care for their story at all. Not to mention they all have to have some gimmick to distinguish them from another character.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as genre goes TAMI is a shonen type action show but thats being too generous in my opinion. TAMI's action scenes never go past 1-3 actions before they have to talk for 90% of the fight about something that wont even matter once the conflict is resolved, and all the main character ever does is punch people. \\n\\n\r\nTAMI isnt necessarily bad but its just so plain that you find yourself wondering why you're even bothering with it? It tries to be funny but always throws the same gags at you that you just dont care for them. I think theres some wasted potential here and thats a shame because I really wanted to like this show\\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "To Aru Majutsu no Index is an action, comedy set in a modern (or perhaps slightly futuristic) city called Academy City. The entire city is basically composed of several schools that teach the usage of Esper; a scientific kind of magic. \r\nThe story revolves around the protagonist Kamijou Touma, as he is caught between tensions and events involving conflicts between Magic and Esper (science). While the first few episodes were quite promising, hinting at a huge power struggle between two sides, with Touma being in the center of attention, the rest was quite the letdown. There wasn't any deep story. The main plot simply getsshoved into the background and To Aru Majutsu no Index becomes a somewhat repetitive, episodic 2/3 episode-per-plot anime. Despite the great entrance leading to an episodic series, however, I admit it was still enjoyable to watch. The plots are simple, but watching Kamijou Touma go through each challenge in his way was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are definitely the strongest points of To Aru Majutsu no Index. The art is simply amazing. Movements and actions flow smoothly, showing just how many panels the creators drew to create each episode. CG effects are wonderfully done; with the sun shining brightly and casting beams of light on Academy City. The opening songs fit the action theme of To Aru Majutsu no Index very well, and the relaxing ending songs tone down viewers' excitement after watching the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were great and unique in terms of personality, but development was stagnant. Each character had a unique personality that you can identify and tag them with. Touma is a carefree, friendly guy who's always there to help out his friends, while Index is mischievous and spoiled on the outside, deep down she cares much about everyone around her. However, without much character development, they pretty much stay the same throughout the 24 episodes of To Aru Majutsu no Index. But overall, I think this can be overlooked, as once you become attached to them, development won't degrade the characters' uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching To Aru Majutsu no Index on a weekly basis. It was a good anime overall, despite the lack of a concrete central plot. Just watching how Touma deals with situations and interact with those around him is purely enjoyable. Definitely give To Aru Majutsu no Index a try!",

The individual events would be a lot better had they been conveyed in a better manner.\r\nArt: Perhaps the only strong point to this anime, the anime is detailed and well done. The motions are fluid, the colors are stonge and catch the eye, and shadings are well done. Not much else to say.\r\nSound: The music is typical and boring, just the kind of music one would skip to get to the anime. It is stereotypical music of the action anime, with notmuch thought put into it except probably &quot;Hey, that sounds cool!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are okay, with the main character being, actually, quite unlikable. He's one of those characters with no feeling, and somehow always has the solution with failure. The only twist, he was annesia, typical of the usual soap opera. : P\\n\r\n&quot;I, have annesia&quot; (Calculon, Futurama)\\n\r\nThe other characters, some of them completely random and unnessasary, don't get enough airtime. Index, probably the only likable character, is only displayed in the first arc, and then only gets cameos, (although she is a main character, cough cough).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally don't find this anime very enjoyable, it is bland and completely boring at times, and only has a few scenes that remotely catch my interest. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: heh",

            "content": "A Somewhat Unlucky Boy\r\nAcademy City, the Mecca of Science, is where most of it's denizens are student that have been scientifically engineered to be espers, or wielders of certain unique abilities: manipulating electricity, teleportation and controlling natural forces.\r\nTouma is a student in the Esper Development Program, with very unique skill, the ability to negate supernatural powers, like the ones manifested by other Espers. This, of course, nullifies his good fortune as well: vending machines devour his yen, his cellphone crushed into silicon fragments by his foot, and he has to attend extra classes during the summer.\r\nBut fate isn't done with Touma, ready to twistthe string of his destiny around it's cold slender fingers. Enter Index, hanging to dry from Touma's balcony, a church sister being hunted by... magicians. The plot has an interesting hook, the conflict between science and magic. The first four episodes prove to be interesting, serving as a prelude to what would be a plot line epic in proportions. But Toaru Majutsu no Index [no Index] quickly shifts gears, abandoning an expansive story, for smaller three to four episode arcs surrounding the various characters. It's amusing but for the most part leaves you asking: Why does this matter?. Though the last episode does give some hope, hinting at a conflict between science and magic, that's about to build, brim and explode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable, if somewhat cliched. Touma is the can-do hero that attempts to save 'everyone'. Misaka is a shining star in somewhat average cast. Her love/hate relationships with both the lead and her friend Kuroko coupled with her superiority complex is amusing. One of the plots faults is the harem that is accidentally formed. Harems cause symptoms of shallow character interaction and plots driven by mindless love polygons. Shades of these indicators are found in no Index, but hopefully the 'harem factor' won\u2019t be a crutch for the plot in the future.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the art is excellent. The palette is bright and vibrant, painting Academy City alive. Cool silvers and grays are layered on the natural colors woven in between the streets. Action scenes are fluid and are filled with some intense scenes on this backdrop. Character models are drawn well, the magician's being the most interesting of the bunch. Kiori and Stiyl seem otherworldly in their outlandish clothing. There were irritating bits of fanservice unappealing because the heroines, for the most part, were flat chested.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was engaging, a techno flare that fit the whole scientific motif. Neither opening was exceptional, their upbeat chords danced about, setting the appropriate mood. The voice acting wasn't noteworthy, though some of the voices became grating. Index's voice had an annoying timbre that scratched at the senses. \\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of the show made my enjoyment of the program, mixed. Some of the chapters were splendid, balancing humor, drama, and action while others made me want to drop the program all together. I have hope for the second season, which promises a return to the whole conflict between magic and science, which intrigued me in the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThe ambition of the plot quickly disappears and what remains is a cast of likable characters, great art, and a promise. Hopefully Toaru Majutsu no Index will deliver on that promise. The small gems of story telling give me confidence that there is still hope for the exploration of the main theme presented. We can only hope.",

            "content": "The beef on the plate before you smells wonderful. Its color indicates that it has spent just about the right amount of time on the grill. Surrounded by finely cooked and cut potatoes and some vegetables for the fresh taste's sake, with a glass of delicious wine towering nearby, the seemingly delicious meat only waits for you to enjoy your meal.\r\nIt's funny, really. In a way, Toaru Majutsu no Index is deceptive. The first few episodes promise you a really intriguing (if not epic) story. The presentation is phenomenal; the opening is great, events that unfold in episode 1 already get you hooked and thereare already some interesting characters whom you want to know more about. Hungrily, you venture onwards for more.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the episodes after the terrific first impressions, however, you start to notice a few things. First, it's only minor details that go unexplained, but you start to worry when it does not stop there. Before long, the show refuses to explain even more about certain events or characters. Soon, the story is all over the place, and with its failing ability to present itself properly or consistently, you begin to lose interest gradually over the course of the entire ride.\\n\\n\r\nRemember the meal I mentioned before? The potatoes are just fine, the vegetables are okay and the wine is actually quite good. The meat, however, tastes awful. When you (try to) cut through it, you realize that it is far from done. The meat is pink, and the two or three pieces you try to chew on end up spat out on the floor.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the side dishes were okay, the main meal was plain bad. In a way, Index is the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2\\n\r\nBefore anything, let me just say that in its core, Index is probably a very good show with regards to the story. However, there is one thing with this story that damages the show badly - the way it is presented. And I'm not exaggerating things, because it really is that severe. The concept of the entire show (Science vs Magic) is really interesting, and the sides shown of both parties are sometimes genuinely good. All things considered though, nothing actually ever happens between them until the last one or two episodes. Index, the main heroine of the anime (I think?), carries surprisingly little importance to the plot for the most part. Mostly forced into a few scenes purely for the sake of comic, what is revealed about her at the very start of the show (which is supposed to carry a lot of weight in the actual plot) is never mentioned until, again, almost the very end of it all, and even there it doesn't matter as much as it should. These are just some of many examples of things the show presents but forgets to handle or elaborate on.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the entire show is split into several arcs, each handling its own sub-story and characters. While a minority of these arcs are quite decent, the rest of them remain uninteresting, and some even make you question what importance they actually hold to the main plot. The main problem with the arcs is, yet again, the fact that the show forgets to handle everyone and everything that happens in a proper way. Characters who're just being given some depth are suddenly wiped out of existence (figuratively speaking) with the coming of a new story or arc. Events remain unexplained, both within themselves and how they connect to everything else, until you simply start to not care anymore. Simply put, while everything has a potential of being great and interesting, the show treats its contents with little care, telling us many stories and presenting us to a lot of different characters, only to barely tie the knots on not more than a select few of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nThe art of Toaru Majutsu no Index is, truth be told, very good. While everything is coated with a simple style and charm, the liveliness in both characters and places is presented excellently through not too extreme methods of drawing. Colors come out nicely and blend together in a pretty way where they should, nothing or no one looks too deformed or incomplete, even from a distance. While a flaw can be spotted in the art here and there, it's nothing that will deviate you from the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nThe music fits in the moment, so to speak. While the tracks of the show give the right effect to all events that occur and set the mood right most of the time, there's nothing here that'll stick with you once the moments have passed. The music, while good, is often forgettable, but it serves its purpose in the show. As for the two openings, they are actually epic. They set the tone right for what's to come, and as standalones in an MP3-player, they're still a pleasure to listen to. The endings are also decent, though not on par with the openings. Finally, sound effects. Everything sounds like it should, whether we're talking about explosions, footsteps, laughs or anything else. Nothing bad, yet nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7\\n\r\nConsidering how I bashed the story section of this show, it may come as a surprise that the characters are being given a (significantly) higher score. However, while they were presented dreadfully together with the story, you actually cared for what you knew about them. Save for a few characters (including Index herself, ironically), most of them made you laugh, feel emotions, or care enough to finish watching the show altogether. Yet, it was rather frustrating when the show kept blowing away characters after their stories were told, since you really want to know more about some of them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3\\n\r\nBack to the low scores. Index had every opportunity to become a good show. Most of the characters were interesting, the plot and setting were fresh and intriguing, and even the background details such as art and sound pleased. Nevertheless, thanks to the catastrophical presentation and handling of everything, what cound've been an epic experience was lost.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5\\n\r\nAll things considered, even if the main plot failed, the show wasn't impossible to finish. The several stories, for what it's worth, were decent sometimes, and other elements such as nice characters helped carry me through the ride. In the end, however, it truly is a shame. I really wanted to like what Index truly was trying to tell, but it was impossible considering the scattered everything was.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the main meal failed to deliver, the side dishes were okay. Even if the meat wasn't even close to edible, you could leave the table knowing that at least the rest of the food pleased you. It is possible that the chef might have learned from his or her mistakes, and maybe, just maybe, the next dinner will be a winner.",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index starts off strong, but quickly fizzles out. I, like many others, was intrigued by the fantastic world described in the first few episodes, a world where everybody has a superpower, as well as the mystery surrounding the title character. Sadly, the series fails to deliver a single solid story past the first arc and stumbles blindly onward to a barely sub-par ending.\r\nThe anime actually had me hooked at the first few minutes of the first episode. The character of Touma, who inexplicably possesses the power to nullify any supernatural force with his right hand (and also seems to attract misfortune, somethingI can relate with) was very appealing. Upon his encounter with Index, a girl who inexplicably has perfect memory recall, things really started to take off. Now there were two mysterious characters and a decent plot to go with one of them. By the third episode, I was convinced that I was in for a rare masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly I was concerned about Touma, because his mysterious power is essentially god-mode, and overpowered characters tend to ruin a story. I set those concerns aside, though, reasoning that the title character is Index, not Touma. Little did I know that after the first arc concluded, the title character would have little to no influence in the overall plot, in some cases barely managing to make an appearance in most later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nVery few of the characters past the two main ones are genuinely likable. I have to admit I liked Touma's teacher, Komoe. She provided some of the best comic relief, but didn't do much else aside from acting as a plot device. Index's two guardians, central to the plot of the first arc, were also among the better personalities. At the very least, they weren't completely unlikeable. The same can't be said for the rest of the cast: almost offensively dull supporting characters; a series of super-powerful girls, each who thinks her life is the worst and she'd be better off dead; a select few villains to do battle with Touma; and behind-the-scenes bad guys who never do anything but make vague references to the story. Before I move on, I'd like to give an honorable mention to Accelerator. He had probably the coolest power of them all, and would have made my list of likable characters if he had dropped the angsty emo-kid act. Just one more wasted character among many.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing they did right, though, it was the art and animation. But if all your anime can do is look good, there's hardly any point to it. Overall I have to say I was really disappointed with Toaru Majutsu no Index. It had such a great buildup and they could have done great things with it, but once Index was no longer a central part of the story it all fell flat. I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. I watched it from start to finish, and now I wish I hadn't.",

            "content": "\"Such misfortune!\"\r\nIt's somewhat apt that I happened to choose that as the opening quote to this review, because it really does sum up To Aru Majutsu no Index rather nicely - that is, an anime filled with misfortune.\r\nInitially, Index got off to an...interesting start, it wasn't particularly bad, nor was it particularly good either, it was just interesting. We are introduced to our main character Touma, rather interestingly, Touma is not the stereotypical useless protagonist so often seen in shows like Index; don't get me wrong, at his core, he's just a variation on the plain nice guy, but this nice guy also happens tohave one of the most overpowered abilities in the history of fiction: the ability to negate literally any form of supernatural ability that happens to come his way with his right hand. \\n\\n\r\nHowever cool it is to have a main character who has an ability that, in most cases, is reserved for the most powerful of powerful enemies, having this power also presents a couple of immediate problems for the show, the first of which being that there is near enough no risk whatsoever when Touma fights; it doesn't matter what the situation is, Touma will undoubtedly get out of it using his hand of God (a rather ironic statement if you've actually seen the show), as shown during the Accelerator and Sherry Cromwell fights, you could quite literally throw the most powerful supernatural abilities at this guy and he will negate them instantly. Consequently, this also makes none of his fights remotely interesting if they have anything to do with supernatural abilities, as he will just spam his Deus Ex Machina ability repeatedly in order to get out of whatever predicament he's in.\\n\\n\r\nOur other main character is Index, and the moment she is introduced to the show, things immediately go downhill, and it's not just her character (which I'll get back to later), the show itself breaks two rules of writing that should never be broken: \\n\\n\r\n1) It throws out lots of random terminology.\\n\r\n2) The story doesn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThat first one is a trap the writer fell into all too fast, right from Index's introduction we are suddenly given an influx of terminology that we are supposed to remember, things like \"Necessarius\", \"Dedicatus545\", \"Johann's Pen\", \"Imagine Breaker\", \"Judgment\", \"Esper\" and \"Anti-Skill\" just to name a few out of the dozens of terms that populate Index's world, there is literally no point in trying to remember them all, especially not the magic spells which are frankly ridiculous in terms of naming length. Now, as you no doubt know, throwing out random terminology in the hopes that some of it will stick does NOT make a story, frankly, they're nothing but a bunch of meaningless words that are, at most, given a three line explanation as to what they actually mean. Worse still, the terminology doesn't stop, and we are continuously hammered with terms that make it seem like the show is ridiculously complex and would take nothing short of a quantum physicist to understand everything that goes on. Don't get me wrong, there are shows that have done exactly what Index did, Haruhi is guilty of it, Shakugan no Shana is most definitely guilty of it, but the major difference between those two shows and this one is that Shana and Haruhi actually made progress in their story.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me onto my other point.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Index is that the story doesn't go anywhere - at all. The first series does nothing more than introduce certain characters, and give out lots of random side stories that do nothing but hinder what little progress the story makes; there are literally only three arcs in Index that actually serve to deliver something that's beneficial to the story at all, those being the first arc, the Sisters arc and the finale. Admittedly, the character development that Accelerator received in his own little stand alone arc was rather good, but one character getting developed when there are more characters and terms than the writers can keep track of is nothing but a minutely small achievement when there's so much that the story has to tell. Honestly, it's hard to tell what exactly is going on in Index half the time, there are arcs in which characters that were key in the beginning are totally swept aside, arcs in which characters I thought were nothing more than minor extras are reintroduced and are suddenly given total importance (with absolutely no foreshadowing whatsoever), and, of course, a beach episode.\\n\\n\r\nNone of this is helped by some of the worst writing I've ever seen. There's bad writing, then there's bad writing and then there's To Aru Majutsu no Index. There are several times in which a character is delivering a monologue that not only seems completely out of context, they're usually random and worse still, they don't make sense. An example of one such monologue is in the first arc of the series, Touma happens to be engaging in life or death combat with a character who happens to be hunting Index, Touma, our ever rational hero, then proceeds to start a speech about friendship that not only doesn't make sense, but somehow wins over said villain; it's one moment of utter stupidity amongst hundreds of others in Index. The lapses in logic in Index only get worse as the series goes along, this is not helped by the plot holes that the series induces upon itself later on in the series (especially in the beach episode), and we're left with a series that certainly seems to want to do something with all its terminology and characters, it's just abstaining vehemently from doing so.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip-side of this, Index does at least look okay, which is surprising considering that this is J.C. Staff animating here. The character designs look good, the spells and abilities look pretty decent, and the fights look nice as well; it's definitely not perfect, there are several times in the series in which the quality of the animation dips drastically, and several abilities lack the impact that they should considering how powerful they're meant to be, which is more along the lines of what I've come to expect from J.C. Staff. Oh and the fan-service, it would most definitely not be complete without the fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the main themes are generic and utterly forgettable at the end of the day, and the rest of the OST is passable at best, there's no major stand-out themes in it so I won't dwell. The voice actors do nothing more than an average job, the already bad writing delving further into horrible melodrama due to some of the female seiyuu coming out with really hollow performances at times; the only two voice actors who deserve a mention are Yuka Iguchi as Index and Nobuhiko Okamoto as Accelerator, both of which are here for very opposite reasons. Iguchi is mentioned because she manages to turn Index from a generic loli-tsundere, into a horrendously annoying one; her performance as Index is tantamount to taking pieces of broken chalk and scratching them down a chalkboard. As for Okamoto, he manages to deliver a performance as Accelerator that captures his sadistic personality rather well, and also manages to act well in the scenes when Accelerator isn't finding new ways to deflect people with his vectors.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing about the voice acting, try listening to the many Misaka clones keep repeating \"Misaka Misaka\" all the time, I guarantee that you will never want to hear that name ever again.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the characters, they're a rather interesting bunch, each having some form of cool ability or special magical power that's almost interesting enough to make you want to see what it does.\\n\\n\r\nNearly every single one of them is characterised horribly. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Touma is a variation on the stereotypical useless hero, but don't let that \"variation\" part fool you, he's just as idiotic and naive as nearly every single other character in this archetype. Fueled by his idiotic need to save every person around him regardless of the risk to his own life - oh wait, that statement is redundant considering who he is - Touma's only real saving grace is that he can actually do something rather than get overshadowed by a far superior female lead. \\n\\n\r\nAccelerator is hands down the best character in the show; he is after all the only character to receive some good character development, and manages to be as sadistic and twisted as I first imagined him to be. He's deeper than he actually first appears, has a cool ability, and watching his stand alone arc made me think that somehow Index was about to improve.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many people who believe Mikoto to be the best character in the show; unfortunately, I cannot agree with this statement as Mikoto doesn't remain the focus of the show anywhere near enough to warrant the term \"best character\", not to mention she's somewhat inconsistent, developing tsundere characteristics whenever the plot feels it to be appropriate then dropping them as the story demands only for them to appear again at random intervals. Her characterisation in Index is nothing more than very mediocre at best and if you really want to have a better opinion of her, it's much easier to watch To Aru Kagaku no Railgun (which is actually much better than Index anyway).\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast (aside from Index who I'll cover in a moment) are a random bunch of almost remotely interesting characters, and most of them hit the stereotypes rather well, there's plenty of loli's in the show, a lesbian, big boobs, blonde haired delinquents...nearly every single stereotype is hit at some point by Index.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the titular character in the title is the biggest offender of them all.\\n\\n\r\nIndex is not just a bad character, she is the worst type of loli-tsundere around. My argument for why I think tsunderes are bad would have to be Index, she is perhaps one of the most ungrateful little brats in animation, whose only real purpose is to make the main characters life worse, and more than likely win in the harem that he forms (I neglected to mention that, but oh well). There are very few characters I want to see die more than Index, in fact, if I had the chance, I would personally ensure that she does get killed off - and I would be the one doing the killing. She somehow manages to make every episode she's in worse (this isn't helped by her appalling voice actor) and I saw her turning into a loli-tsundere 5 episodes before she actually did. Index is the kind of character that needs to be slapped repeatedly until she understands that she's a bad character, then slapped some more for good measure; frankly the one redeeming thing about the random side stories is that she doesn't feature prominently in them (if at all).\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, To Aru Majutsu no Index has its moments; the way that the story is structured means you can marathon through an arc and come back to it without really forgetting where you are in the story - wait, that statement is redundant too. And despite my major gripes with the writing and characters, Index is hugely enjoyable, if I was to base my score for this series based off enjoyment, this would be a very different review.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just a shame that isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Index is an anime that suffers from poor writing, an extreme lack of story and poor characters (as well as characterisation), and manages to carve itself into a level of anime that's usually only reserved for travesties like Mars of Destruction - it has its moments sure, but then again nearly every anime does. \\n\\n\r\nWhat a waste.",

Pros\r\n+ Science vs Magic Plot\r\n+ Interesting and likeable characters ( girls )\r\n+ Accidental harem\r\n+ HD Quality\r\n+ Humorous with popular references here and there ( leek )\r\n. Cons\r\n- After Episode 10 it's character development for the other characters\r\n- Not enough time to get back to the main plot ( Season 2 I assume? )\r\n- Feels like a giant introduction / setup ( Novel and Manga still going )\r\n- Some characters feel like filler, hopefully they'll have some use later on\r\n. Conclusion :\r\nI like this Anime despite the fact it got off target halfway through. They did a good job of developing the other charactersin the show but then by the time you finish the series, you're expecting Season 2. Basically it felt like one giant introduction episode, introducing us to the characters and the plot, but then we never get to the real deal. As you can see, I don't have much to complain, this Anime has potential if they're able to get back to the main plot. I'm expecting them to give us a Season 2 ( I guess if Season 1 did well enough, the novel and manga are still going). It's a nice Anime to watch as long as you're not expecting a great deal out of it ( especially story wise, since it's obviously incomplete ). Perhaps by the time you read this Season 2 will be out. For now you can just await for the \"Toaru Kagaku no Rail Gun\" side story...",

            "content": "Ever since people started thinking, gathering in groups and building villages and cities, there was always the one question that some people asked themselves and even though most people probably didn't really care in the first place, they later started asking the same questions. It was a matter of time until that question was raised. \"What are we?\", \"Where do we come from?\", \"Why are we on earth?\", are the ones I am talking about and one answer became popular quickly: God! Religion was founded in the early days and while having it hard at first, the religion that in the end came out ontop in the western world was Christianity. Not always through peaceful means, but they somehow managed to make people believe them. But the church doesn't really have the monopole of answering these questions. Science did not always played a role as big as it does now, hell it even was forbidden to oppose the church by using science for some time! The war between science and church though has always been going on, Galilei, who was imprisoned for spreading the truth he found out through scientific mediums, probably is the best example for it and while it certainly did cool down a lot, there probably are still people fighting about it right now! Ladies and Gentlemen, today's topic shall be the Anime with the oh so interesting topic of science and church, Today's topic is To Aru Majutsu no Index!\\n\\n\r\nAs this is a Review for both seasons of Index, I will go on and give two scores for every category!\\n\\n\r\nStory:To Aru Majutsu no Index or Index as I will call it for short, revolves around Kamijou Touma, a middle school student that lives in Academic City, a city solely dedicated to science development and Esper training. It is technologically advanced and around 80% of the people living there are students. In this city there are different ranks of Espers, telling their strength, going from Level 0, people that don't have any ability, up to Level 5, which are the 7 strongest ability users in the entire world. Our Main Protagonist Kamijou though unfortunately only is Level 0 and doesn't have any ability at all, except for one thing: His right hand can destroy any Magic or Ability! One day as he comes home to his apartment, he suddenly finds an oddly dressed catholic sister hanging on his balcony, muttering that she is hungry. After taking her in, she explains to him that her name is Index and she has memorized 103000 Grimoires in her mind. She tells him of the existence of Magic as well and that some kind of evil organization is after her.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of Index is really interesting, featuring the earlier mentioned differences between the Church and science, but it's nothing that the show focuses on too long. While the enemies often are either from some kind of church or some evil scientific organization, it doesn't feel anything but a mere excuse to have a new antagonist. The setting still remains really interesting, but more for the reasons of Academic City being one of the coolest cities that I have seen in a Franchise so far, featuring underground organizations, a realistic set of population, meaning it is not perfect and a really interesting society where students are able to rule a lot. Also the whole Esper system is really well thought through and was a lot of fun to think about, even if it certainly is not the main point of Index.\\n\r\nIndex Story itself consists of many arcs, bound together to an overarcing story, that is not too significant yet, but might get soon. Every single arc is built the same way, there is some light hearted fun going on, something bad happens and everyone freaks out. Then some Plot Twists happen, the bad guy is getting figured out, he fights Touma and everything ends. Of course for the most time it is not as easy as that and surely isn't as dull as it probably just sounded. What this show does really well though, is the pacing. It never feels rushed and never drags once it really got going. Even though it has a few difficulties getting into the arc at the beginning, as the light hearted parts often drag out a little. As the arc gets more story focused though, the show starts to throw in a good amount of twists before ending in a for the most amazingly climatic and epic fight, that basically consists of our main characters holding epic speeches and punching everyone in their face! Believe it or not, it is a lot of fun to watch! If the show really has one big problem though, than it is the getting into it! The first few episodes of Index are pretty hard to watch, not because the story is bad, but due to another reason...\\n\r\nIndex: 8.5/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:The characters of Index are by far it's weakest points! The first character is Index. Index is a catholic sister, with the ability of remembering everything she has once seen. This ability is getting used by the church, as she had to read 103.000 grimoires for the church and remember every single one of them. She now has to take care of them and keep people away from looking into it. Index rarely really gets active in the show itself and for the most part only is the reason for things to happen. If she starts acting on her own though, it often gets pretty cool and the power of the grimoires hidden within her mind is not to underestimate. The second main character is Kamijou Touma. He is your generic Light Novel Protagonist, being the guy that wants to save everything and holds epic speeches, why the antagonist is wrong. His catchphrase is the sentence \"Fukou da\" which in English means \"Such misfortune\", as he sees himself as an incredibly unlucky person. There is not a lot more to him though, as he is pretty blant. It takes a lot of time, to really get used to him, since at the beginning he is really annoying and only gets really likeable in the second season. It's not that he changes a lot, but the one thing that is different, is that he is a lot more badass later on and while not being a good character, he at least is really cool! In short, the longer the series goes on, the better the main characters get!\\n\r\nThe character cast around those two characters is huge, introducing at least one new character every single arc (there are a lot of arcs...) and keeping most of them for use later on. Every single one of them though, especially those that are getting used more often, are really well fleshed out and are by far not as one dimensional as the two main character are. They are a lot more interesting than Index and Touma are and every new side character is a great addition to the already amazing cast of side characters. I am looking forward to getting more of those in the coming seasons.\\n\r\nThe last problem in the character section that Index has, is the character interaction, which the comedy relief scenes are focused on. The problem is that while the interactions are funny when seeing Index biting Touma the first time, as she seems to be doing it second episode, it gets boring really quick. The two characters are way too boring to produce anything amazing outside of fights and most of the side characters can't really safe that either. There were some points when I simply had to laugh out loud, but those were pretty rare. The comedy itself was just something that was overused to a point that I was not able to do anything but facepalm at times.\\n\r\nIndex: 7.2/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:Index for the most part doesn't look too amazing. The Slice of Life comedy scenes look pretty generic and there is nothing standing out at all. When it gets serious though and they start to animate fights, they do a pretty good job at it! There are not too many stills and the animation itself is pretty fluent and while it still is not too amazing it certainly is above average! The Animation quality gets better in the second season, but still is in comparison to other Anime of that time nothing to noteworthy. The backgrounds often look pretty good though, especially when being the Academic City itself, surprising with a good amount of details. At some points the lighting is something that pleased me as well, even though that was rather rare in the show itself and happened more in the movie. The CGI though, looks pretty bad and that doesn't get better in the second season either. Unfortunately they use exactly that CGI for the backgrounds as well. It's not as clearly noticeable then though.\\n\r\nIndex: 7.5/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:The Soundtrack of Index was composed by I've, a Japanese techno sound production group. The Soundtrack itself is what I consider to be rather average. There are some tracks that are pretty cool and those are the ones that either show up as soon as some kind of mystery accures or as soon as people start fighting. In the more quite parts of the show though, the soundtrack was pretty generic and couldn't quite match up to the ones of others. The Openings on the other hand were all pretty much amazing! Every single one of them had more of a techno vibe to them. Every single one was sung by Kawada Mami, which did a really good job at it! They did a good job at preparing you for what was to come in the Anime itself, while getting you hyped if the last episode ended on a cliffhanger. In total the RailDex Franchise has amazing Openings. The endings were all quite good, but definitely skippable. They were nice to hear once or twice but after that, there was no real need to listen to them any more. The Voice Acting was splendid and leaves nothing to be desired as far as the emotions go. As my Japanese is not that good, I will refrain from saying more than that!\\n\r\nIndex: 8.1/10\\n\r\nIndex II: 8.1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn total To Aru Majutsu no Index is really good show, that has it's only big fault in it's main characters, but even that is something to get used to after a while. It convinces with a good story, a huge but likeable character cast and simply the amount of fun you have watching Touma punch someone in his face. It has amazing pacing and a skill to climax it amazingly well, making every arc somewhat epic!\\n\r\nNow as I calculated the scores I gave To Aru Majutsu no Index and it's second season (Story, Characters, Art, Sound and my personal Enjoyment), I came to a score of 7.94/10 for the first season and a score of 8,14/10 for the second season. Both are amazing even though they are flawed. The pure fun watching them turns around a lot! As it stands now the first season of Index has been licensed by FUNimation, but the second has not been picked up yet. The first season is also available on the FUNimation Website for legal streaming.\\n\r\nAnd with that, I hope you enjoyed this Review of Index and I see you next post!\\n\\n\r\nFollow me on Twitter: @Korigaming , Wordpress: korisanime.wordpress.com\\n\r\nDon't forget to subscribe and tell me your opinion by posting it on my wall!",

            "content": "To Aru Majutsu no Index is yet another anime adaptation by JC Staff based on a light novel series published by ASCII Media Works. This is a show that has as many good things as it does bad things.\r\nStory: The premise of To Aru Majutsu no Index (Index from now on) had me intrigued from the beginning, a story which is based on a science vs magic/religion is the type of plot I can really get into. However the way the story is executed turned the anime into something that could have been a great show with a deep and interesting plot into an animewith long and confusing dialogue that was so in love with its own world that you would wish everyone would stop talking for at least 1 minute. The action that the show would offer you would often get interrupted by more explanation and exposition about the situation and it would hurt the pacing and momentum that the show itself built. The story itself is also very \"episodic\" in a way. The show has been segmented into many different mini-arcs which followed a pretty basic 2-3 episode long outline:\\n\r\n- Main character gets dragged into a weird situation\\n\r\n- Main character finds an antagonist behind the events\\n\r\n- Main character and antagonist fight\\n\r\n- Main character wins but ends up in the hospital\\n\r\nI am not joking every arc on this anime ends with the main character hospitalized. However despite all these details the story of the anime can still be enjoyable and interesting at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I have no complains with the animation on this anime. It is very well made and its very flashy when in comes to battles and backgrounds. This is a good looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Apart from the great OP songs from the ever-sweet Kawada Mami. There is not much else to say about the sound department on Index. It does the job well enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Another one of the issues I have with the anime is the way the characters are handled. The actual characters on the show are all interesting on their own way however the anime is only fixated on the main MALE lead Touma, while every other character takes a supporting role cast. In every arc we see Touma encounter a new character, and for those 2-3 episode we see the new character and Touma be the focus of the show but once that is over we barely ever see that character again, or it only lurks in the background. This condition is so extreme not even the \"main\" female character Index, whose name is on the anime title, escapes this reality. For the first 4-5 episodes we are introduced and aquainted with Index, however past that point she is almost non existent and is only shown for the sake of having at least the most minimal screen time on each episode. Such threatement for the characters really lessened the enjoyment I could've had watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though i have mostly complained here, I still liked this anime. Im a little sad that it didnt live up to its full potential but its not a bad show on its own right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Despite the terrible handling of the characters and the story, To Aru Majutsu no Index manages to be an entertaining show for those who enjoy magic and supernatural abilities. And I would recommend it for anyone who wants to kill time.",

            "content": "This review will cover both seasons of A Certain Magical Index as well a bit of the movie called A Certain Magical Index The Miracle of Endymion.\r\nI have a complex relationship with the Raildex series. Ever since I was introduced to the series from my group of friends my opinion of the RailDex series has been all over the place. On one hand, I really adored certain elements of the series such as Sisters arc in Railgun S and the first arc of Index while I hated such as Touma Gary Sue preachy power-ups speeches and the contrived Silent Party Arc of Railgun S. Needlessto say I enjoyed the Raildex for what it is despite its numerous flaws. Now unlike Full Metal Panic, Inazuma Eleven and Legend of The Galactic Heroes I didn\u2019t get excited for Index Season 3 at all mainly because I didn\u2019t like A Certain Magical Index all that much. Apart from the first arc as well arcs that have Accelerator focused I honestly cannot the life of me stand the series mainly because it\u2019s a badly paced action harem that is filled with plot conveniences, asspulls and terrible writing. This was basically my first watch of A Certain Magical Index in a nutshell and it wasn\u2019t a happy experience for me at all. One day when I was out looking for anime to buy a month before season 3 began airing I saw both seasons of A Certain Magical Index in an anime sell. I originally wanted to get Higurashi When They Cry Season 1 but the series was sold out. Rather then waiting for Higurashi to come back in stock in the following I decided to give A Certain Magical Index a second chance by not only buying the series but I also re-watching the series. Now with said did my opinion of A Certain Magical Index changed for the better or for the worse. Let\u2019s find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nAcademy City is a central point for all scientific environments housing espers capable of displaying incredible super psychic powers. The story follows a level zero esper named Touma_Kamijou who as he was leaving his home comes across a young none named Index hanging outside of his balcony. She says that she\u2019s on a run from dangerous sorcerers who want to use her as a tool where they can access the 1003000 million forbidden magical text that she memorised in her head. Getting dragged into the world of magicians and psychics Touma decides to project Index at all cost even if he will cost him his life. Touma has a unique power called Imagine Breaker which grants him the power to nullify any kind of magic and psychical ability that someone throws at him with on touch.\\n\r\nThe story follows a Level 0 esper named Touma who always seemed to have bad luck thanks to his right hand. His right hand has the ability to nullify any esper ability that they throw at him.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk the things I don\u2019t like about let\u2019s talk about things that liked and that is first 6 episodes. Right out the gate, the first six episodes aka the first arc contained a lot of top-tier storytelling as despite being simple on paper it\u2019s very well executed thanks to its great story elements that were well thought out especially at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final thing that I liked about Index was the arcs that featured Accelerator. Not only these arcs were nicely paced but it was nicely well written as after the sister\u2019s arc he goes a series of redemption arcs where despite being evil in nature he tries to make all the bad things he has previously done. I honestly had fun watching these arcs more than watching any arc that involved Touma.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the show slowly starts to show it\u2019s ugly true tensions which I will talk about in a bit but for now, am going to talk about the things I don\u2019t like about Index because there is a lot of them that ultimately plague the series.\\n\r\nThe first problem that I had with Index it that the show literally throws every sci-fi plot device element possible including insanity completely scientific explanations, evil organizations, church conspiracy, religious holy artefacts and cloning experiments and guess what\u2019s? This show absolutely sucks at explaining all of these plot points to the viewer and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t help that 80% of the dialogue is dedicated to explanation and drowning on and on with overally completed explanations for just about everything. What makes this worse is how sometimes these plot elements only show up for one time like angel or golems while others never show up all. Case in point the vampires stuff in the second arc of Index. This lack of explanations towards really hurts the worldbuilding in Index as it show tries to make Academy City this epic city that is filled with life and mystery but it ultimately failed and as a result, your left with a world that is quite frankly empty in execution.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the show messy execution is only made of how bad the direction in this series is. For example, in episode 14 of the second season, Touma wanted to use a bathroom. Instead of knocking through the door this incompetent dumbass bares in the bathroom where he sees a naked girl showering. Instead of dumbass saying sorry like a normal for entering in the bathroom without knocking this dumbass just stands there and acts all shocked like a fool as he stares a naked girl. To add insult to injury he does it again with the second door only this time Touma gets head bitten by Index. That scene alone from episode 14 of S2 really highlights how shit the comedy is as well general direction as the shit comedy could have easily been avoided.\\n\\n\r\nThe second worst thing about A Certain Magical Index is the pacing. Now because the majority of the arcs are only 6 to 2 episodes long you can expect theses arcs to rushed as hell as the series does a poor job what is happening on screen seemed theses plot elements seemed to mostly pop up from nowhere without any building or even tension. The only arcs that didn\u2019t suffer from the rushed pacing were arcs that featured Accelerator as those arcs were nicely paced where the series its time of explaining what is happening in a set arc that features Accelerator. Yes, he did appear in the Sisters and Academy City Invasion Arcs but least he was kickass in those arcs and he wasn\u2019t a bore compared to the lifeless overpowered Gary Sue Touma.\\n\r\nAfter Season 1 the only thing I was looking forward was the Accelerator arcs because they were nicely written and unpredictable compared to the arcs that feature Touma\\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about the worst thing about the series I\u2019m going to quickly talk about the movie because it sucks as it just seemed to follow every bad anime movie plot based on a popular anime series imaginable.\\n\r\nYes, the movie may have production values and all but it\u2019s ultimately matter when you have aboustly no substance to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you thought the unexplained stuff and pacing were bad you ain\u2019t seen nothing because the problem that is going to talk about now killed the series for me and that problem is that A Certain Magical Index is a harem series disguised as a sci-fi battle anime.\\n\r\nWords cannot describe of how pissed I when I was done watching both seasons of Index that I literally found the show true intentions as all this time I was watching a badly directed harem series that has doesn\u2019t have much substance at all.\\n\\n\r\n>> What are you talking about me this show ain\u2019t a harem at all.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let me explain.\\n\r\nAfter the first arc was over aka episode 6 the series seemed to feature set arc girl that was meant to be on Touma side the problem is apart from Misaka where she had some character development every single girl is literally a plot device for the narrative for each arc plus Touma was always the one that protects set girl from danger for each arc where the girls for each don\u2019t do much to defend themselves. Not only that but the show throws in every harem cliche you have ever seen such as the innocent guy entering in bathrooms without knocking while a set girl is naked and the girl punches/kicks the guy for breaching it. It was that point where I lose all hope for A Certain Magical Index because the series went from being intriguing sci-fi anime that devolved into this shameful harem sci-fi action feast that doesn\u2019t respect the viewers time.\\n\r\nOverall the story of A Certain Magical Index is at best-wasted potential and at worst it\u2019s one of the lousiest stories I have ever seen.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIf there were two words to describe the charterers in A Certain Magical Index is wasted potential. Apart from two characters the characters in Index are a bunch of bland stereotypes who barely developed in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAm not kidding when I say this but Touma is one of my most hated male anime protagonists I have ever seen. Seriously this guy is not only bland to the absolute core but also an overpowered Gary Sue who loves to give out these stupid and forced justice speeches.\\n\\n\r\nThe chararter Index is not much better as despite being decent in the first 6 episodes she just this annoying little brat who barely does anything apart bite Touma head for a living.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully we have Misaka who is by far the best thing to come out from this lacklustre character cast. She may appear as this generic tomboy at first however unlike most other anime tomboys she has a very good reason of why she acts the way she does. She has a reputation of being one of the strongest espers of Academy City in such a young age. It makes perfect sense of why she wanted to act though to keep her reputation intact. This alone really add so much dept to her chararter and it really makes her presence in the anime much more memorable. On top all that she has one of the most original backstories I have seen while and while it was better executed in Railgun S but it\u2019s was still nicely executed here.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as a adore Misaka I feel like she highlights how bad the characterisation in the series is because she along with Accelerator are great characters while the other characters are interesting as rocks.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this is a character named Kuroko aka Misaka\u2019s roommate and best friend. I really enjoyed her in Railgun as she was this badass girl who is capable of talking down criminals using her esper ability teleportation. Kuroko had some good characters in Railgun S1. She may have this unhealthy crush of Misaka but other than that she was a character that I enjoyed in Railgun.\\n\r\nIndex on the other hand despite coming out a year before the season 1 took everything that I liked about her character and turned her into an unfunny, annoying and one-dimensional brat where the only thing that she does other than plot reason is to be an obsessive creepy lover for Misaka.\\n\\n\r\nThe final character that I want to talk about is Accelerator. I really liked him. He starts off as this ruthless psychotic villain who is willing to kill thousands of Misaka clones just he can surpass level 5. The interesting thing about Accelerator as a chararter is how the show slowly tries to make him a decent human being later on after the sister\u2019s arc we see him actually see him trying to attempt redemption with all the bad things that he has done. He also starts caring for someone where he is willing to look after and protect a young girl named Misaka Last Order. He\u2019s is by far the second best thing about this entire show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall despite having two good supporting the characters in A Certain Magical Index was lacklustre and poorly executed.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhile the plot and characters were a failure the visuals were pretty good. A Certain Magical Index is like watching a beautiful fireworks display of explosives colours.  The background scenery has this shining electrifying urban colour palette that goes a fantastic job of capturing the life of Academia City. The characters designs were pretty cool for the most part as they all look clean and appealing to look at\\n\r\nThe animation in Index is pretty great stuff especially coming from J.C Staff who well knows of making well animated in the series. There was a lot of fulfilment movement when the characters are fighting.\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the visuals is how some of the female characters look pretty similar to each other as many of the female characters seemed to have loli facial structure even though some of the characters in the series are older.\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nCompared to the soundtrack of Railgun the soundtrack in Index is just okay. While there were a few good tracks in the show that fit the show very fell many of the tracks were not that memorable let alone with the show at times.\\n\r\nAll the opening themes Index were pretty good and memorable in their own ways especially opening 3 No buts!\u201d by Mami Kawada which is one of my favourite anime openings of all time.\\n\r\nThe ending themes on the other are just okay and not that memorable in my eyes.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is pretty good for what it is as all the Seiyuus did a pretty good with the roles that they were given.\\n\r\nThe dub is very good and I consider to be Funimation better dubs. It is very well acted and the dialogue for the dub was nicely handled. My favourite performances in the dub were Austin Tindle as Accelerator, Brittney Karbowski as Misaka and Micah Solusod as Touma. Overall very good dub.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nA Certain Magical Index is a mess. While it did have some strong aspects that were enjoyable such as Misaka, the Accelerator arcs and production values.\\n\r\nHowever, the shows negatives, unfortunately, outweigh the positives. The story was a terribly written mess that exposes itself as a shitty harem. The pacing was bad, the poor used side characters and the main characters like Touma and Index were awful.\\n\r\nEven though I don\u2019t like this show I still recommend it to people who want to watch a fun sci-fi anime that has some interesting things in it. Just don\u2019t buy into the hype from people about this series as it will only disappoint you greatly if you're an experienced anime fan such as myself.\\n\r\nFinal Score 4.5/10",

            "content": "Largely a compilation of various archetypes and cliches meant to produce something to hold over the Shana crowd until the inevitable Season 3, To Aru Majutsu no Index embodies the same animation style, similar story progression, and yet another myriad of needlessly confusing terminology. However, Index does manage to possess some very different characters than it's spiritual predecessor that add some freshness to an otherwise tired production.\r\nIf there's one thing you can't fault J.C. Staff on, it's the animation. Sharp, crisp, with a signature pallet and inspired character design, Index can be a treat to look at. Consistent in its appearance throughout, it does afine job of carrying a sharp appearance, even though it does not strive to be anything beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another matter. The opening and ending themes just aren't up to the quality of the animation and, for me at least, seemed to drag down the sequences. Generic BGM throughout didn't help, though vocal performances are of note. Yuka Iguchi and Rina Satou especially as Index and Misaka add great energy and depth to their respective character's lines. The rest of the cast isn't bad either, ranging from enjoyable to decent. What a complete waste of Mamiko Noto though.\\n\\n\r\nThese performances were also greatly amplified by a very likeable cast. Index is a real charmer from the get-go and Misaka's firecracker personality really adds something to the dynamic of the Index-Touma-Misaka triangle. I have no complaints about Touma personally, but he is another generic male lead with a built-in deus ex machina. Fortunately, it isn't the be-all end-all solution it appears to be. The supporting cast is enjoyable, but so many of them are sparsely seen, with some disappearing as quickly as they appear, that it's easy to forget or just not care about them.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are intriguing enough to keep watching, the plot isn't. Functioning on an individual arc setup, it's too disjointed with too little themes carried over from arc to arc to make it worth the effort. While Index lacks its spiritual predecessor's romantic angst, at least said angst helped carry the story over each individual arc. Here, Index has few if any ties throughout, burning bridges as quickly as it can construct them. Add in the previously mentioned myriad of complicated terminology that perpetuates the dialogue of the series, and even the strongest attention spans may be jolted by this one.\\n\\n\r\nSo what can be said about it as a whole? It's certainly not a terrible series, but there's too much wasted potential. The character relationships are stagnant and the poignant characters of each arc are gone with the next. It's more a compilation of side stories than a full-bodied plot, heavy on the dialogue but short-handed on plot or character development. But it is likeable, and nice to look at, and with some luck, the franchise will become more focused in the future. For now, it's disposable eye candy. Nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give To Aru Majutsu no Index a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "After watching (and enjoying) A Certain Scientific Railgun, I was very excited to start this show. Railgun is meant to be as a spinoff for one of the side characters in Index, so I was very curious to see what the main story actually is. To my dismay, however, I learned that Index, despite being the main story, is overwhelmingly average and mediocre compared to Railgun. I doubt I would have enjoyed this at all if there weren't any of the side characters from Railgun to keep things somewhat interesting.\r\nMuch like most anime that I have gripes with, my main two issues are the storyand the characters. Let's begin with the story: in a single word, I would describe it as disjointed. The story is split into several small arcs that feel like they have very little to do with one another; in addition, none of the arcs are particularly interesting (aside from the one that featured the MC from Railgun). The \"magic\" side of the show feels generic and offers absolutely nothing new to anyone who has ever seen any show like this. Overall, most of the episodes failed to keep my interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my other biggest problem, or more specifically the character motivations. The main character is basically copy-pasted from any other superpower harem anime and he has a martyr complex to the point of attempting to sacrifice himself every chance he gets for a character (usually a girl) that he literally just met. And of course, on the other side of this, every girl he meets ends up inexplicably developing feelings for him because he seems to care so much and because fuck it he's the main character. Almost none of the characters are developed and the majority of them are not interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThis series ultimately serves as a far inferior complement to the much more enjoyable and well-written A Certain Scientific Railgun. If I hadn't enjoyed Railgun so much I likely would've dropped this fairly quickly. Although an anime doesn't need to have complex/interesting characters to be enjoyable (see: Hataraku Maou-Sama!), nor does it need to have a particularly original story, not having either ends up only further exposing the flaws of the show. And this show certainly had many flaws exposed.",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index is an anime that can make you feel murderous, and then make you feel bad about yourself because you know that these feelings make you not nearly as moral or righteous as the main character in the series. If you were an antagonist in this anime, you would lose because you don't have the power of PUPPIES AND RAINBOWS AND A DREAM OF EVERYONE SMILING HAPPILY TOGETHER AND NOT HAVING TO FIGHT. \r\nPros:\r\n-Interesting concept\r\nCons: \r\n-Terrible execution of said concept\r\nHaving a world of science and magic and one boy that sort of stands between them is interesting...in theory. His ability to nullifypowers and the abilities of other characters could all have come together to create some epic battle scenes and stories...but why would they do that when they could just completely cop out? Instead of a story with twists and turns and deep meaning, the makers of this series (whoever you consider that to be) decided to make something where the main character wins every time via a holier-than-thou attitude and hax.\\n\r\n Here is the formula for this show:\\n\r\n1.There's a bad guy(s) with amazing powers and a damsel that needs saving (or at least the main character decides that she does).\\n\r\n2. The main character attempts to save the damsel, despite having practically no power in comparison to the enemy.\\n\r\n3. Main character gets whooped UNTIL he gives a long, drawn out, repetitive, hackneyed speech about how much his opponent sucks and how they aren't good enough and need to be happier/kinder/more thoughtful.\\n\r\n4. He magically beats the snot out of them with his glorious fists of virtue.\\n\r\n5. Damsel falls in love with him. Oh, and throw in some fanservice/the main character getting beaten up by one of his numerous love interests somewhere. \\n\\n\r\n One thing that bothers me the most about this anime is how logic apparently doesn't apply to it. One antagonist in particular needs to do complex calculations in his mind to use his powers\u2014calculations that can be pretty challenging with a calculator and a formula in front of your face\u2014yet they seriously want me to believe that he's beaten by the main character because the main character \"has street fighting skills\"? The enemy doesn't even have to get near him to attack for God's sake! Sure, he can nullify some of his enemy's power, but with only his right hand to null attacks I'm fairly positive that his enemy could have come up with SOMETHING to counter that. \"Oh, but the opponent relies too much on his power and thinks he's unbeatable.\" Yeah, but do you truly believe that after someone realized the person that they're fighting could cancel out their power that they wouldn't think of a way to avoid getting close to them? That someone would have to be a moron. And really, all of the people who want the main character dead just keep using the same tactics? \"What, he can cancel out all powers and has beaten every single thing we've thrown at him? Well, send out another magic user/esper after him. It's bound to work eventually.\" NO, NO IT'S NOT.  Is it really that hard to hire a freelancing goon to make him disappear? I think not. Honestly, it's enough to make you...well, rant on MAL. Another thing is how the girls, without fail, always. need. saving. Many of them have powers vastly superior to his, yet they still need him to, what? Be moral? What does he have that they don't, other than lack of a likable personality and of powers? \\n\\n\r\nThe best parts of this show are probably the fight scenes...if you put them on mute when the main character starts talking. Actually, the best ones usually don't involve him because all he does is use the same moves over and over again, like a five-year-old playing a fighting game and only pressing x. \\n\\n\r\nIs the show horrendous? No. Is it infuriating? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Addicting? At times, adding to the infuriation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this most certainly isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but the glaring flaws definitely brought out a lot of rage. If what I've mentioned previously doesn't bother you in a series and you're considering watching it, go for it I suppose. Although you should also be warned that his main female counterpart, Index, is also painfully obnoxious, so beware.",

            "content": "Ok, i\u2019ve been meaning to write a review for a show for a while now, and now i finally got the time.  So here it is. \r\n[3]Story:  So the story is pretty simple. The setting is a future world where we have espers, highly evolved science, magicians, guys with random powers no one knows shit about, well you get the deal.  So our main guy is Touma, a complete noob (ya, really.). He has been haunted by misfortune since he was born, and he is unable to use magic or esper abilitys. What he do have though, is a random power noone knows shit about. Cool eh? Apparently his right hand possess the power to break any esper ability, spell and what not. the downside is that Touma himself can\u2019t use magic or anything like that. Anyway, he meets this girl called index who apparently memorizes everything she sees, and she has memorized a whole book with spells in it. So a shit load of stuff happens, Touma meets some weird people, kick some ass, and then kicks some more ass. Then we go to the next arc. I should add that this show is so heavily divided into arcs that every arc could be a new season. This can be a good thing in some cases, but here it is not. Anyway, so the first arc was about his saving Index life bla bla. the next arc is about Misaka, a side character. Guess what the arc after that is about? Ye, Misaka. This show could really be called \u201cToaru majutsu no Misaka\u201d. She\u2019s one of those side characters that really steal the show.  So the story gets a pretty low score, basically because it makes to heavy use of arcs and don\u2019t bind them togheter. The main female character, which the show is even named after, is basically forgotten. Bad. \\n\\n\r\n[7]Art: The art was good, animations were good.  I have nothing to complain about. I should add that im no art expert whatsoever, so this is a score that don\u2019t influence the final score as much as other things.  \\n\\n\r\n[4]Sound: OP was fine, ED was meh. This doesn\u2019t really matter in the rating of the show, but its fun mentioning!. Anyway, the music used in the show isn\u2019t really something we haven\u2019t heard before, but ye, it wasn\u2019t that good. Its like, you don\u2019t notice there even is a soundtrack, its just there because without it, it would sound weird! \\n\r\n  The voice acting was like the soundtrack, just a little better. I liked Misakas voice though.. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Characters: for me one of the most important aspects of a show is the characters. The characters in this show was really hard to like, except for Misaka. She atleast, have some development. The other characters were all kinda meh. It seems some people likes Index, and ye ok, she wasn\u2019t all that bad BUT. She has like 0 screen time. Zero. I atleast didn\u2019t like her, no development, to little screen time. As for the main character, he is hard to like imo. Its not that he got to little screen time, its just that he\u2019s very unoriginal, boring, full of fail and somehow, liked by all the other characters. He\u2019s sort of like the main character in school days, just that he doesn\u2019t fuck everything that comes in his way. \\n\\n\r\n[5]Enjoyment: well, If you have read the whole thing here above, you probably know what you\u2019r about to read now. Ye, I didn\u2019t like the show that much. Sure it got its sunny moments sometimes,  it got me chuckle a time or two, but it just doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that the show is fail. Fail fail fail. Im going to go ahead and give the show a 5. The show is still airing (seen 20 episodes right now), and if the ending somehow is very, very good then the score may be raised to a 6. But as it seems now, the show isn\u2019t heading that way. If you want to turn off your brain and just watch something, watch this, and think of it like \u201ctoaru majutsu no Misaka\u201d. You could skip the first arc for all what it matters. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading ! \\n",

            "content": "We have an egotistical alchemist with reality manipulation, a murderous psychic with vector control, and a magician with rampaging golems. You know what they all need in common? A good punch to the face... \r\n...courtesy of a Mr. T\u014dma Kamij\u014d right fist. Sourced from Kazuma Kamachi's light novel franchise (and later, manga series), A Certain Magical Index follows the misfortunes of Kamij\u014d when a rather eventful encounter with a nun hanging from his dorm room balcony throws headlong into friction-filled world of science and magic. Science, through Academy City, where he currently studies to realize his supposedly untapped potential as an esper. Magic, through Index,where he eventually ends up cares and protects her from forces that target her, in part, due to the 103,000 grimoires locked within the recesses of her photographic mind. And then there's his right hand, Imagine Breaker (Yes, he has a name for it), which has the mysterious congenital ability to negate any all paranormal and supernatural abilities that it comes in contact with. Produced by J.C. Staff, with direction by Hiroshi Nishikiori, script by Seishi Minakami and Masanao Akahoshi, and character designs, original and adaptation, by Kiyotaka Haimura and Yuichi Tanaka, respectively, it avoids an annoyingly lazy cop out common in a lot of contemporary low fantasy fiction: that science and magic are one and the same. Understanding that they are effectively separate allows for new avenues of potential in the setting to be explored.\\n\\n\r\nOne is that it allows the story to cover a wide range of interesting premises without the shackling constraints a tight system of logic. One on the magical end revolves around vampires, a girl, and the inadvertent destruction of her entire village that unwittingly turned, her family included. Another on the science spectrum revolves around clones, a girl, and the inadvertent massacre of over 10,000 of them for an experiment. Two is that it permits the story to set up a rich, multilayered universe that facilitates exchanges of the two sides that are both intra and well as inter, among as well as between. Academy City as well as other research communities scattered throughout serve as the domains of science, while the multiple denominations of the Church serve as the realms of magic. For those both sides who know that both worlds exist, their reactions toward each other come about as mixed relationships of either cooperation, tolerance, or animosity. Speaking of which, three is that it prompts the story to hover around a rather engaging overall natural antagonism. In other words, it sets the stage for a grand scale sense of intrigue. The underlying tension between these two powers remains in constant danger of roiling and boiling over, threatening the shakily established truce that allows sorcerers and psychics to survive without constantly being at each others throats.\\n\\n\r\nA couple other things commendable about Index are its OPs and EDs. The OPs and EDs, respectively, keep to one particular artist group, though they all cover one particular musical theme. While the pacing and atmosphere for OP1 and OP2, \u201cPSI-missing\u201d and \u201cmasterpiece\u201d by Kawada Mami, are drastically different, the former more mellow and melancholy than the latter, which is more dynamic and climactic, they both have that techno feeling that matches the show's technologically advanced setting: radio noise, voice distancing, auto- tuning, irregular rhythm lagging, and/or abnormal beat skipping, among other separate electronic embellishments by the keyboard, electric guitar, drum set, and synth. ED1 and ED2 \u201cRimless ~Fuchinashi no Sekai~\u201d or \u201cRimless ~ Rimless World ~\u201d and \u201cChigaikoto ~ Sukoshi Dake M\u014d Ichido ~\u201d or \u201cOath ~ Just a Bit, One More Time ~\u201d by IKU have the same techno add-ins, but come off more mellow and relaxed. My favorite, though has to be ED2, because I just prefer straight old singing. The electronic embellishments, which can admittedly muck up the melody at times, complements the vocals in this song quite nicely by adding a sense of breathe and broadness.\\n\\n\r\nBear in mind, though, the term \u201cpotential.\u201d I wouldn't be able to comprehend much even if it was possible to prove on paper, but since the show tries to present esper abilities as a matter of physics, I can do this much to explain my critique on Index. You have the sum total of Index's premises as an object on the very top of a flight of stairs. Compared to the ground below, it has a relatively large amount of potential, or potential energy when placed on the edge of a flight of stairs. That potential energy is utilized when force pushes the sac down the stairs, converting that potential energy to execution, or kinetic energy. Yet the force was only so great and proper as for the object to drop a few steps before coming to a full stop. Relative to the ground, a significant amount of potential energy remains. Why? Because it was a weak ass push. Or rather, because it's poorly written. Not to the point where the plot doesn't make any serious sense, but to the point that it unravels in such a ridiculous fashion that it's hard to take seriously. For a show that indulges a lot of action, there's an awful lot of talking that occurs back and forth in during those segments, their goals, their abilities, how they're really going to bust each others' shits this time if they don't desist, to the point where the participants should just go ahead and share their life stories, dating preferences, and money saving tips over stew while they're at it. The money part especially, since the decent visuals are what probably took up much of the show's budget. One scene had Kamijo looking like he was running in place during a fight for about a minute while his opponent spoke on. Basically, there's a lack of urgency where the context so desperately requires it. What isn't lacking is the amount of exposition that was needed to define each character and situation the audience is introduced to to make the developments in the show comprehensible to follow. Because we are, more or less, told rather than shown who so and so is and what so and so means, it makes it that much more difficult to emotionally invest ourselves it in what's happening to who. This especially pertains to our main male protagonist whenever he touts off one of his sermons, sermons which blur the line between righteousness and self-righteousness, because at the end of the day, he usually has to smack someone to get the point across. It might be because the pacing for each arc was rushed, but it also might be due to how much time is wasted trying to initially show something gimmicky instead of solid, a major offender of this being Index herself, who's, funnily enough, a lot of bite, literally speaking, among other things, yet little bite, metaphorically speaking, to show on her own. There's myriad conveniences that the show likes to throw to advance the plot at the expense of belief, like how Kamijo can magically... scratch that, scientifically reattach a severed arm with seemingly no permanent consequence to his health. There's the fan service, which is so obnoxiously shoehorned in at times that it stomps whatever semblance of belief remained with spiked shoes. Or would you prefer a bare foot? Or feet, considering the show also has harem undertones?\\n\\n\r\nIt was poorly executed, poorly written, poorly planned... I've concluded as much. But all in all, in spite of its setbacks, Index has so much potential in the premise and setting that the portions of the show that weren't quite as messed up stood out quite positively. Hopefully, future productions of this franchise will utilize better scripting.\\n\\n\r\nI give A Certain Magical Index a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "If I had to use one word to describe this series, it would be: Confusing.\r\nA Certain Magical Index is the exact type of anime, that sucks you in like a black hole in the starting episodes...and then leaves you hanging. \r\nThe setting is great, the future, an academy city full off students, robots everywhere, people with supernatural powers empowered by science and on the other side there are bona fide sorcerers wielding magic that stems from a religious background (Christianity to be exact). There are HUGE possibilities in this setting for really intriguing stories and characters to emerge. And the starting episode sets the storyup incredibly well. There is just one problem...\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the whole series devolves into a confusing mess quickly. The protagonists who had the chance to be well-rounded leaders of the story, turn out to be simple tropes hastily thrown together (in the wrong mix). The support characters are initially very interesting, but turn out to be nothing but one dimensional plot devices and most of them are only there for one episode, never to be seen again. \\n\\n\r\nToma, the main protagonist seem to change personalities from episode to episode (and from scene to scene), sometimes being an indecisive dunce and in the next scene he is the assertive badass of the century. Index, the second protagonist is even more confusing, being the damsel in distress, the tragic heroine with immense power, the tsundere and the comic relief moe all in one, also changing personalities from scene to scene. It feels like the producers of the series wanted to create complex characters with many sides, but ended up with a schizophrenic mess of personality traits and tropes that just don't match and end up conflicting each other at every step.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the storyline....or the lack of one. The first few episodes introduces the world and the buds of a great story that starts to gain momentum, but then turns around and throws a monkey wrench in it. And then a box full of monkey wrenches. The story keeps throwing seemingly random tropes at the viewer, to the point, that I spent more time exclaiming \"what?\", \"huh?\" and \"why?\" at the screen than actually enjoying the anime. Characters emerge from nowhere, do something incredibly important to the story and then vanish forever. Things happen that are never explained or even hinted at before or after the fact and even the characters gain and lose powers without warning, totally unexplained, acting only as mere plot devices. Furthermore, even the main characters doesn't seem to have arcs or any character development whatsoever, they just lurch into the next episode like zombies. Not that anyone would notice with that lack of coherent personalities. It all feels like the creators had a bunch of different stories written up and the characters are nothing but mere afterthoughts, vessels for these stories, without any soul. This fact alone makes it incredibly hard to like any of the characters, even the protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can praise beside the great setting is the art direction. Everything looks beautiful, the character designs are great (however they do feel like each of them was stolen from different anime) and the backdrops, the scenes, the settings and the animation quality are all top notch. Too bad the story and the characters are so messed up, this could've been a really unique and engaging series.",

            "content": "In order to enjoy this anime one has to realize that these are story arcs each having a number of episodes. Each of these arcs have some sort of boss battle in each end. Too bad most of the bosses aren't too impressive. And the finale doesn't weave all the arcs into one. \r\nThe story is too shounen oriented which will deter those that are looking for depth. It is unfortunate since there is  potential for the storyline which in turn is trying too hard to be deep with the inclusion of quasi-physics theories that only drags it down.\r\nPacing-wise it feels way too slow.A good amount of time is spent on needless talking even though the viewer already knows what's going to happen. Most of the time viewers will feel that the story should go to the boss battles as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately there's the art and animation. The high-production value is almost prevalent throughout all 24 episodes. Lighting, character design, backdrop, etc. I find the loliness of the girls' character designs disturbing. Then again the artist (as well as fans of the female character designs of TAMNI) likes lolis so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nBGM is average at best so that leaves us with the techno-oriented OPs and EDs which are almost memorable and fits the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that spans 24 episodes there's little to no character development. No problem with that. Most shounen action animes stick to this formula. It's just that they didn't stand out too much.\\n\\n\r\nAmidst all its flaws, I did enjoy TAMNI because I just needed to shrink my anime backlog. But it just can't stand out from the season's batch. Maybe because it's from an unfinished manga; maybe because it only touched around volume 6 of the said manga. I don't know. It just felt empty after watching it.",

            "content": "I decided to watch \"A Certain Magical Index\" after finishing both Railgun and Railgun S. I just finished watching the series yesterday and I thought it was decent. Not the best anime as people claimed it to be...\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story is set in Academy City, a city with a 2.8 million population; 80% of them are students training to become an esper. The story is focused on Touma, who has an ability in his right hand called Imagine Breaker. One day, Touma meets a young English girl named Index who is a nun from Necessarius. Her brain is filled with 103,000 forbidden magical books. \r\nThereare 6 arcs for this season which is called \"Index\", \"Deep Blood\", \"Sisters\", \"Angel Fall\", \"Three Stories\" and \"Kazakiri Hyouka\".  What do you get when you shove down 6 arcs in one season? A rushed out plot with plot holes. I admit, the story was ok but at the same time, it was very confusing. Every time an arc ends, it left me with a lot of questions. They should have focused on 2-3 arcs per season instead of 6 arcs. Each arcs were just rushed out and too quick. For example, the Sisters Arc which I absolutely loved in Railgun S was a disappointing arc here in Index. It only lasted for about 5 episodes whereas in Railgun S, it lasted for 17 episodes. \\n\r\nThere are 2 sides in this show.  The Religion side and the Scientific side. The religion side consists of people or sorcerers who use magics and believe in God. The Scientific side consists of espers who can use abilities. The anime shows both sides but is more focused on the Religion side. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (8/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is ok. A bit choppy on some occasions and some character designs looks weird. Considering this was made back in 2008, I guess it's acceptable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is mostly the same as the one I heard in \"A Certain Scientific Railgun\". I thought the soundtrack was great in Railgun so it's the same here. However, the opening soundtrack is not that great. The 1st OP was ok but the 2nd OP was horrible. The ending soundtrack is somewhat better. The 1st ED is horrible and the 2nd ED is a lot better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nThe only section this anime was very good at. The characters. The characters were hilarious and each one of them had their own distinct personality that is likable. Each one of them also got a character development but it didn't take that long to actually know these characters. Now to introduce some of the MC.\\n\r\nTouma is the main protagonist of the show. He possesses an ability in his right hand called \"Imagine Breaker\" that can nullify any ability or magic that he touches. However, he is a LV. 0 esper.\\n\r\nIndex is one of the main characters of the show. She is a nun from Neccessarius. She wears a uniform called \"The Walking Church\" that prevents her from getting injured. The Church implanted 103,000 forbidden magical books in her brain (not literally). \\n\r\nMisaka is also one of the main characters of the show. She is one of the seven LV 5 espers. Her ability is \"Electromaster\". Basically, she can emit or shoot electricity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first few episodes of the show but as the show progresses, it started to become a bit boring but later picked up in the 2nd half (4th-6th arc). The season finale was horrible. I only enjoyed the last 5 minutes of that episode. The season finale felt like it was rushed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nThe anime had potential but they had to go ruin it by rushing the plot, leaving plot holes and shoving in 6 arcs in 1 season. I'll be watching the 2nd season soon and I just hope they don't rush the plot this time around. To be completely honest, I prefer Railgun over Index.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Decent Story\\n\r\n-Great Animation\\n\r\n-Great Characters\\n\r\n-Few funny moments\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Plot was rushed\\n\r\n-Plot holes\\n\r\n-Way too many arcs in 1 season\\n\r\n-Season Finale was horrible (except the last 5 minutes)\\n\\n",

This anime just want to make my brain cells crushed and having an extreme migraine.\r\nThe story and setting is  near to Shakugan no Shana, SURPRISINGLY!

I even checked if both of them have the same Director and make in the same studio, but no.\r\nIf I want to make a a one word review of this anime it would be.\r\nMOE.\r\nThat's all.\r\nI still can't get the grip on what the fu*k the story is all about, Magicians? Esper? Walking Church? Fu*k...!! Even a detective Anime like Conan, Q or Death Note doesnot make me feel confused as much as this Anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to get fun by watching this anime... GOOD LUCK! \\n\\n\r\nThen there's this Protagonist which is  ok but does not however explained where does he get the Imagine breaker. How? Why? Is he the chosen One? Is he like an invincible protagonist that the story-writer has embedded a God-Mod cheat on him just so that he could beat the crap out of any foes he meet?\\n\\n\r\nThere's just so many lolis in the Anime, I've even suspect that the writer is a child molester or a pervert that been collecting child porn for decades. Because often the Anime smothered your face with ridiculousness of lolis to show their cuteness that is rather annoying and over-used. \\n\\n\r\nI love lolis especially like Shana and Taiga which can stand and fight for herself and still remain tsundere *cough*. But Index are just annoying. What the hell happen with the 103,000 Grimoires that was hyped at the beginning of the Anime? Because later on they keep on distracting viewers into some more non-sense storyline with huge number of new characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey could've just focus on index and the Grimoires and the battle between the Magicians and Esper or some shit that would be interesting. But Instead, we were stuck in the stupid dialogues and short as fu*k battle sequence.\\n\\n\r\nIt's make me wonder even more on how Touma could survive the battle for every damn time! It's exactly like he activated a God-Mod cheat somewhere in his life. There should be a storyline on how he gains it and there should be an antagonist that could devoid the Imagine breaker and cornered Touma where his friends come rescue and it comes to his realization that he needs to train his power.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this interesting setting and characters, we could get a better storyline. But, Fu*k no.. this is what we get, a confusing forth and back storyline that does not properly explain the motivation of protagonist or even the damn antagonist and at the end they just happens to ditch the old characters.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let me get started how some lolis can be a teacher.. Fu*k. The more I keep thinking about this anime.. the more I hate it.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending is ok I guess but not memorable.. \\n\r\nI give my overall ratings of solid 5/10.",

This could aid your ability to understand the extent of Toaru's genuinely captivating and morally driven premise. Nevertheless, i will treat this first installment of the \"Index\" story as the start of its own anime to avoid bias...\r\nAcademy City is introduced as a technologically advanced place in the future, where even magic is a reality; therefore filling the show witha notable sense of wonderment and limitless potential. The Index story begins by showing a clear division between science and magic, and so to sum up: it is not merely a one-dimensional good versus evil, light versus dark conflict... In essence, Toaru Majutsu no Index documents an all out war between science, magic, and morals: the simplified meaning behind this intense 24 episode series...\\n\\n\r\nThis broad, imaginative and inspiring premise not only sets up an interesting stage for a war of corruption - as is typical of humanity, but it also appeals to me as particularly refreshing due to the mentioned minimal limitations of the setup. The intricacies of Index as a whole, and the number of contrasting perspectives involved render it far from a carbon copy of the \"magical power\" driven stereotypes. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters...\\n\r\nWe begin by complimenting Index's genuinely interesting, and appropriately unrelatable world of fantasy, with a blank slate known as the comparatively typical Touma. He is the \"unfortunate\" as he claims, and rather generic male teen protagonist of the show, who serves as the audience's relatable perspective. This greatly helps to minimize the viewers' distance between the many characters, and it gives the show a personality point of reference which allows it to refrain from coming across as too context-reliant. He's not that interesting as a personality due to his predictability, despite how Index makes multiple attempts to define him better as a character. This is acceptable though, as he serves a critically important role in delivering the story in a more personal way to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \"unique\" is often used quite loosely nowadays, though the many characters of Index are the true embodiment of the word. Their personalities all differ greatly, each of the characters have unique selling points, are genuinely interesting, far from generic, and all-over very charming. \"Index\" herself is a worthy example, as she bears a rather tragic background explained early-on, which compliments her apparent innocence as is shown by her cute, quirky and likable personality and aesthetics. Similar methods of development are used with a variety of other predominately female characters, and this really helps to convey their personal wars, perspectives and experiences. From here, Index becomes able to utilize the delicacy of these personalities, alongside the intense and often life-threatening events that occur throughout.\\n\\n\r\nHaving this interesting integration of character development as more of a context point, as opposed to a rigid \"character development section\" maintains the show's consistent intensity. This development brings about a whole world full of attachment values and emotions that generally add a lot more weight, substance, and meaning to the events that later unfold. This helps to reflect the integration of morals, and the personal journeys each character makes. I can't even begin to explain how necessary this was for giving Index a notable sense of power, and so the charming character department is indeed a strong suit.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the content, and this department is certainly not lacking IN SCALE...\\n\r\nAlike the rest of the Toaru franchise, Index is a two-faced hybrid in the way that it incorporates cinematic and action based journeys, alongside more documentative SoL elements (explained above) to form the cohesion between morals, personality and plot. Often this is a dangerous mix, as it can result in \"identity issues\" becoming apparent, but Index uses both of these elements to its advantage. It therefore reflects the show's ability to add a lot of uniquely defining personality and delicate elements to an otherwise very event-driven/plot-biased setup.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many stories told within Index, though too-many if i'm perfectly honest. The initial story plight of \"Index\" as a character, which in turn incorporates a lot of character development, i feel is by far the best. In these first 9 to 10 episodes, Index really comes into its own...  There is a genuine sense of passion in the presentation, which is reinforced by the passion induced in the hearts of the viewers as it manipulates their viewpoint and perspective really effortlessly. It allows for the viewer to associate with the goals of Touma, and adds overwhelming levels of intensity that make out very clear who the enemy is. Index then goes about shifting this perspective, to reveal the moral dilemma our \"enemy\" faced, and therefore the story is appropriately not nearly as simple or one-dimensional as it first seemed.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the presentation...\\n\r\nIndex uptakes a considered approach similar to that of \"Railgun S\" to emphasize \"drama\" and \"dire situations\". There is a lingering intensity present to keep the viewers at the edge of their seats, and so the presentation is particularly cinematic and vivid. When combined with the decent though mildly un-fluid visual presentation, and appropriately intense soundtrack, the audiovisuals are quite appealing.\\n\\n\r\nDownsides...\\n\r\nIf all of the stories were able to reach the high standard, and make the powerful impact that the initial \"Index-oriented\" one did, then we could potentially be looking at a \"10\", but unfortunately i feel as though Index crammed a bit too much content into 24 episodes. Granted that in immediate-presentation terms, Index is of a high standard; though the stories following episode 10 (and therefore the majority of the show) seemed a bit incomplete. They succeeded in delivering a range of perspectives and engaging story arcs that allowed for a good summary of Index's content, though they failed mostly in terms of fluidity.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond \"Index's\" development story, the show began to pace too fast. The drama however was on par, which means that it all seemed a bit \"hyper\", and so the initial richness of the magical context and development etc. seemed to dissipate. It started to progress too fast for the audience to actually absorb and reflect on what was happening, due to the sheer scale of story content, and character development that had to been covered. My main problem with these later arcs is the way that they end very abruptly, and so this really dragged down the show's consistency aspects. Each of these seemed to spontaneously advance to another story, with little consideration of making seamless transitions. This meant that conclusions throughout the show were unclear, as there was not time for any reflection. This is likely to cause undue confusion for viewers, and i just found it disappointing how an anime that clearly showcases its expansive potential, would so blatantly sacrifice its fluidity, giving it an inconsistent flow, where sometimes detrimental episodic techniques such as fast conclusions are incorporated just to get through all of Index's content.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\n+ Premise full of wonderment and potential\\n\r\n+ Charming characters\\n\r\n+ Personality, weight and morals incorporated into the action\\n\r\n+ Very cinematic and dramatic\\n\r\n+ Rich story in the first 10 episodes\\n\r\n+ Decent audiovisuals\\n\\n\r\n- Generic protagonist\\n\r\n- Rushed stories beyond episode 10\\n\r\n- Abrupt and unclear conclusions transitions between stories/arcs\\n\\n\r\n~ I will show you how to co-exist... ~",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index (A Certain Magical Index) is a 48 episode adaptation of the light novel series of the same name respectively.\r\nThe 2 season anime were released between 2008-2011 and a movie released in February this year.\r\nA Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. While some individuals known as Espers possess special powers gained since birth, other individuals denominated Magicians gain their powers upon mastering the power of symbolism, be it from obtaining knowledge from special books known as Grimoires or by using special magic artifacts. While several Magician cults align themselves with ancient religions, Esper powersare usually developed by experimentation and training, thus they are usually aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between magic and science factions for control of the world.\\n\r\nThe story is set in Academy City, a technologically advanced city located in western Tokyo, known for its educational and research institutions. T\u014dma Kamij\u014d is a student in Academy City whose right hand, the Imagine Breaker, has the ability to negate any supernatural powers, but also negates his own luck, much to his chagrin who meets a young girl named Index who is a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, and her mind has been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum\u2014103,000 forbidden magical books the Church has removed from circulation. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic and an adventure with his friends where both collide. T\u014dma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts relating magicians and science-based espers in Academy City. As T\u014dma tries to help and protect his friends, he learns the people he knows are not as they appear and begins to attract the attention of magicians and espers alike as they try to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index and his own special power.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10: Okay, after watching the first few episodes of the series i was overwhelmed by all the information being thrown at me, it left me confused and i nearly gave up on the series, but i stuck through...and my god it was worth it.\\n\r\nAfter the first few confusing episodes, the story started to space out and add more humour to the plot, for example; Index and Toma talking about food and when Toma refuses to buy her anything, she starts trying to eat him which is a recurring theme throughout both series and is always funny to watch, and i was able to enjoy the personalities and relationships between characters without worrying about having more information thrown at me in colossal chunks again, during this 'break' period (because there are multiple occasions you'll find yourself wondering what they're blabbering on about) is when i started to gain an emotional attachment to Misaka and Index, and as every anime fan knows, once you're attached you will keep watching to find out their fate, right? and thats exactly when i admired the story for what it is, and considering anything i say about the story will be a minor spoiler at least, you'll just have to experience it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8: The art is fantastic from any angle you look at it, however, despite the crisp looking and vastly colourful looking animation, its not my type, and i'm very cynical of what male characters look like, and in my opinion, our unfortunate protagonist could have been designed to compete with the more 'handsome' anime characters like Zero from Vampire Knight for example, his appearance and 2D personality makes me wonder exactly what does Misaka see in him? (although his lack of social skills makes a rather amusing scene every now and again) but other than that, the magic battles and alike are spot on what i'd expect from a big budget franchise like this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8: Not much i can say on this one as 3/4 of an AVERAGE episode has magic spells flying about the screen like a fly thats just been sprayed by a can of anti-bug, and my lack of knowledge as to what a REAL fireball sounds like makes this alot more tricky, however, the japanese voice actors are very very good, as youd expect from the japanese actors/actresses, sadly i havent got a chance to watch the english dub version of this series, but ive heard good reviews about it, so how bad can it be? The sound quality is also very good, although the music can be a bit too loud when Toma is giving his overview at the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9: All the characters play their own part in the overall humour of the show; Toma is always found in outrageous situations due to his bad luck, Misaka's roommater Kuroko often does stupid and surreal things to attract the attention of Misaka, Toma is always the 'straight man' in the Toma-Index relationship with Index bossing him about and trying to eat him in every episode.\\n\r\nThe characters (except Stiyl Magnus and Tsuchimikado) are all well flushed out and fit well into the story with their unique personalities, back stories and links to each other , the reason i didnt give the 'character' section a solid 10/10 is because a certain red haired gentleman does something unnecessary and quite frankly stupid in the second season, and with no real motive to back him up, no real back story, his actions just felt really pointless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: After a ton of confusing episodes dotted all over the 48 episode series (and judging by the ending of the second season, there will be at least one more season) and reflecting upon the motives of all the character's actions; ESPECIALLY Accelerator's, i came to a sudden realisation that i had just finished watching an absolute masterpiece, and the magic part? i didnt even realise just how good this series actually was until it was all over, and thats something you dont get alot from shallow anime series you see lately, however, if you're looking for any romance, ecchi or love triangles, look elsewhere, because although its obvious that at some point our clumsy protagonist will end up with one of the main characters, no progress has been made between them at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this series has alot (borderline too much) story, magic and characters, if you want a relaxing anime to watch, one where you dont have to remember something from episode 6 when you're watching episode 30, then, again, dont go near this anime, because its requires you to absorb every last piece of information given to you, and even then, you probably wont expect whatll happen at the end of the episode, but isnt that just amazing? I hope you guys will take on this adventure, you will not regret it at all.",

            "content": "\"When science and magic cross paths, this epic will begin\"\r\n(Uhm... maybe not.)\r\nI had such great expectation for this anime... Magic versus technology, science versus religion. It had everything to be great, but somehow after the 5th episode I felt like it lost its \"particularity\". If you're looking for a show to pass time, give it a shot. But don't be fooled like I was.\r\nWhy it had everything to be a sucess: In the futuristic world, the entire knowledge of mankind is concentrated in a city. Academy City. A place where young espers develop their abilities and there's no place for things like superstition or fairytales. In this context you're introduced to a girl who claims she has in her mind more then 10.000 grimores with the most powerfull magic spells in the world. She says that magic exist and that there's a rivality between the magic and the scientific side which may lead to a war. \\n\r\nAfter this, I was expecting the plot to be something like Shana, ZnT or Nanoha's... stuff like that. Where the main character (who holds the name of the series) have a great power and the story moves around it. It was huge (and unpleasant) surprise for me when I found out that Index would became a suportive character and the plot would be a slice-of-life about some guy called Touma Kamijou. From this on, this serie fell in the cliche of \"main male character helps a lot of different girls for no especific reason just because he's 'nice'\".\\n\r\nReally? \\n\r\nFortunatelly, you have really good arcs in the story that saves this show from getting a lower score. Accelerator's and the sisters' arc were really interesting and made me continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was supposed to be a action/adventure, but since the plot is very poor, sometimes, you have characters that only appears in one or two episodes, are beaten up by Touma, and vanish again. You can't observe character development neither get to know them better. Which is realy bad because without it, you have plain characters with no personality. During the show you have specific 'arcs' for key characters, which allows the viewer to understand better the story, but after it, they change the subject and moves to another problem. \\n\r\nNow tell me, is it possible to solve a life tretening issue within one or two days? Of course not.\\n\\n\r\nSound... nothing to complain about. Had a decent OST and I enjoyed the OP/ED. PSI-Missing is really addictive... still can't get it out of my head.\\n\r\nSome of the OSTs they used in the battles were great, it matched realy well.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show has a highlight it's the art. They created nice visuals mixing old style architecture with futuristic stuff. The scenario also differs in different \"districts\" of AcademyCity depending on the places importance or economical power just like a real city. It was interesting to watch. All the characters were well drawn and I particulary loved the singular \"acessories\" the ones from the magic side had. Each one had something related to their ability and it was funny to try guess what it was. The best one was Styl Magnus, [he's soooo stylish 'hahaha']\\n\\n\r\nThis story had a great potential, too bad it was not fully explored.\\n\r\n It became really boring to watch sometimes. If you noticed, before every battle you have in this anime, Touma gives a speach about life, ethics or self-help. After all the chick-chat, the ending for every fight is completely predictable and repetitive. \\n\r\nc'mon, what about the 103.000 dangerous grimores? Does anyone still remember they exist?\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10 | Characters - 7/10 | Sound - 9/10 | Art - 10/10 | Overall + Enjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\n[Thx for reading, appreciate your feedback.

            "content": "Toaru majutsu no index or A certain magical index are one of those incredibly interesting anime shows, that the main theme is about Roman Catholics and the Index librorum prohibitorum.\r\nBare in mind that this review is slightly biased, since Index is my type of anime; it has an interesting story line, comedy, light and bit of fan service and of course has a tsundere! *cough* Misaka Mikoto. Aswell as it was mainly focused on the plot.\r\nStory 9\r\nThe anime in set in a city called academy city, where one-eighth of the population are students. Its 30 years ahead than any other city in the world andis a highly developed city. These students study to become espers, but only a small amount of them are at least level one espers. Aswell as some can try so hard to bend a spoon that their brain fries up. Only 7 students in the city are level 5; this shows how hard it is to become a level 5. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a misfortune level zero esper,kamijou Touma is a average high school student that has a power that can obliterate any other power called the 'imagine breaker'.\\n\r\nAfter being strucked from lots of misfortune at the last day of school Kamijou wakes up to more misfortune. Due to a power cut that a level 5 esper caused all his food goes rotten. After more misfortune occurs that in one point he sees a nun lying on top of his balcony, while airing his futon!  'Onakasuita' she repeats meaning 'im hungry'. After all that she claimes that she has all the 103,000 grimoires in her memory and that sorcerers are after her for it, aswell as she has to be returned to the Catholic Church immediately. Index was her name. She also claimed to have a power called the 'walking church' that was part of her golden embroidered nun suit. He didn't believe her 0.0000% until he used his imagine breaker on it. Her suit bursted to shreds causing her to become naked...\\n\r\nBeing sorry, from then and on its up to Kamijou to protect her from these evils sorcerers.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful and well animated in my opinion. The establishing shots of academy city were outstanding. The sunny scenery made me feel calm and relaxed. Even though the art is like any other anime, the established art especially in episode 1 was truly stunning. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were unique and one of kind. Watching them strangely makes you think its a Sci-fi ish anime show and not magic. The soundtrack was spot on even though I believe the insert songs could have been slightly better. Overall the soundtrack was magical and scientific. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nEach character was significant in the anime and has a spot light in the openings aswell as is unique. The main protagonist kamijou Touma is a chracter that has nothing but misfortune but can be awesome.\\n\r\nIndex is a English nun that loves food and its always happy. \\n\r\nMisaka Mikoto is a average tsundere that tortures kamijou for eradicating her power using his imagine breaker. There are others but I don't have time to write them aswell as it may contain spoilers. \\n\r\nIn my opinion character development is strong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7\\n\r\nThe anime was very hard to understand so reading the light novel is much more efficient, because it makes you understand the story line much more; its much more clearer. The anime had way to much arcs including the sister's arc and index that ruined it in my opinion and made it awkward to watch. In other words the story line was rushed alot and was too fast pace.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\r\nIts my type of anime. Good magic anime. Fun to watch and its worth watching but not as good as railgun. Definitely recommend it and the manga and LN of it. Yet again its the main storyline of the franchise. The main theme also is 'when magic and science collide! '\\n\\n\r\nDo you think that the imagine breaker obliterated kamijous luck? Is luck even a power? I wonder. ..\\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\r\nGood story line\\n\r\nBrilliant character development\\n\r\nOutstanding soundtrack and openings\\n\r\nEach character is important\\n\r\nFocused mainly on plot\\n\r\nVery ambiguous\\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\nToo much arcs in one season\\n\r\nPoor narrative \\n\r\nHard to understand main storyline\\n\r\nFew annoying anime clich\u00e9s (tsundere)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI rushed this review so I be editing it tomorrow so there might be some mistakes.\\n\r\nArigatou for reading\\n",

Over half the characters can be classified as barely teen lolis who all fall under the spell of the main characters signature line \"I don't need a reason to punch the enemy every 4 episodes, other than I should.\" Her eyes widen, mouth agape. And now every time I see you I'll say baka, blush, and smash cut awayto a cartoon bonk sound. \\n\\n\r\nNo story plot point makes sense. No characters motives make sense. One 15 year old character is ordained by a super space computer and a spooky undisclosed unnamed secret government to battle and kill 20,000 clones individually inside a single city to \"Level up\". He's already killed 10,000 clones and needs to kill 10,000 more. The character is only ever shown killing 1 clone a day. Assuming he kills one clone a day, it would take him over 27 years to kill the other 10,000. Assuming he started killing clones since the day he was birthed, he would have had to kill 1.8 clones a day to reach his current kill count. This is asinine and I need go no further. This kid is MMORPG grinding clone EXP to \"Level Up\"? That's really the story you're going to go with? After he gets punched by the protagonist, he loves and becomes a clone caretaker btw. You know, because he only murdered 10,000 of them in cold blood. The clones who all share consciousness also have no problem with this. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is fine, you don't notice it. It plays the standard ominous tones to tell you when the character wont succeed or someone is evil, and it plays happy tones when the character will succeed or the character is not evil. The art is fine for the era. The only enjoyment that can be derived from this is the authors laughable attempt at writing anything worth while, as it's painfully obvious they lack any semblance of the basic art of storytelling.",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index, a good, sometimes enjoyable series to watch. It has quite a few story arcs in it, with each arc concentrating on a particular character but mostly it's different scenarios for the protagonist, Toma. \r\nBefore I start, I'd like to adjust the rating of this anime according to what I saw. I'd rate it an average PG-13 anime. There's not much of violence or profanity in it to rate it a R-17.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nThe whole anime is about espers and sorcerers in Academy City, a city of espers/students. I can't really say it's got one storyline since the series is divided into arcseach having it's own story. So, you can say it's kinda like Naruto or One Piece when it comes to different stories/arcs. If I were to give a major storyline I would say it's about the life of an esper and a sorcerer and some of their esper and sorcerer friends who fight bad guys together or separately, whatever the case may be.\\n\r\nSci fi isn't as sci fi as you'd think. They just put esper powers in sci fi since the Academy City deems those powers scientific and capable of improvement using science. As for the magic part, there are the magicians/sorcerers. Sometimes the arcs would be based on sci fi and sometimes they will be based on magic. That's how the series is.\\n\r\nAlmost every arc ends with a fight. Yeah, that's pretty much what the anime is. It's not bad, it's pretty good. While watching some episodes, I didn't realize how soon they ended. They were pretty damn neat. And the story doesn't get you bored, it's all good.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nDecent artwork. Nice animation. Just what you'd expect from a 2009 anime. The graphics and animation give the feeling of a good old anime. Nothing too distinct, it's just good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nI think I liked a few songs in the series but not so much that I'd download their full versions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nFirstly, let's talk about the protagonist, Toma. Failure of a student, unique ability, good looking and your typical good guy. Will stand in front of evil if it's to protect someone. Will give good dialogues when the situation is down. \"Never give up\" spirit. Funny and a bit of an accidental pervert. You pretty much get the idea what he's like. Since he is the focus of the whole anime, you really get to know him well. There aren't any holes in his story or past. All the info needed to know is given.\\n\r\nSecond comes Index. A nun/magician who lives/freeloads with Toma. Her meeting with Toma is an accident and she is also one of the big reasons Toma gets into those magic troubles. Her story is explained quite well in the first arc. So, she concentrates more on the magic side of the anime.\\n\r\nThen there are friends, enemies and some other guys who help progress the series. Misaka Mikoto holds importance as the sci fi side of the anime. The characters are divided into magic and sci fi and they hold more importance depending on which type of story arc the anime is in i.e. magic or sci fi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nThe anime is enjoyable at times and sometimes it's just passable. The sci fi side was my favorite and I found myself eager to watch those arcs when they started. As for the magic side of the anime, it was sometimes good when my favorite characters showed up but otherwise it wasn't that good. But you do get some eye candy but very rarely which is a bit of a let down given the awesome characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime is good for a long series since it's got a sequel. A nice story and good action. Some romance possibility is there too but that's mostly up to the fan's imagination. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, Misaka X Toma FTW!!!\\n",

            "content": "from a personal point of view, i think this anime is a bit overrated. \r\nstory - 7/10: the plot is consist of different short stories even though the it is not all separated like the monogatari series. every now and then, the main character can change one episode or two depends on the length of the story. also the ending of the anime isn't some really awesome fight scene where the MC go crazy and unlock some overpowered skills and defeat the demon lord, but instead it only looks like another normal episode ended with a longer credit scene. however, each story themselves are totallyfine, the problem was created by some mysterious force and the MC went and save the day. almost all the short stories are created with this plot line, and the director tried too hard trying to make the MC look cool but he still is just some street brat whos only power is punching people.\\n\\n\r\nart - 8/10: the art is a pretty good part of the anime, no one is overly exaggerated(maybe just the teacher) with some immense beauty or really unrealistic features. the art was clean through the entire anime, which was quite enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter - 6/10: well, i just think that the characters are just a little too cliche. the main guy is just like 'i'm gonna save everyone i see!!' and the main female is like 'MC is my dada' or something like that. the typical types of characters that have been created thousands of times, over-justice, life filled with female, and whats even better, they are all attracted to him in some degree.\\n\\n\r\noverall, this is an alright anime. probably its just not my taste, with the halfhearted action and halfhearted slice of life. but i know some people who might enjoy this, so if you like anime such as Tokyo raven or anything similar, this might be the one you are looking for.\\n",

            "content": "First thing I have to tell you is to go watch A Certain Scientific Railgun season 1 first. It's a lot better written, animated, and it has one of the most iconic openings. You'll understand more of the RailDex series enough that you won't turn away in utter confusion when you watch Index. \r\nThat being said, Index season 2 is also much better, so if you can hold through 24 episodes of generic shounen plot holes, then you're good to go. \r\nQuick edit: The author of the LN did a lot of personal research into psychology and various magic systems around the world. This seriesis based upon what's knowns as Chaos Magick, the idea that your perceptions of reality mixed with your subconscious can reshape reality itself around you. It's a fascinating topic and It's really cool to see how it's used as a hard magic system. \\n\\n\r\nHaving watched this anime 3 times through, and read some of the Light Novels it's based off, I can confidently say that Index season one is nothing more than extended exposition and character introduction. It sets up the world, and hints at the true plot that has yet to appear, but it drags you through the mud to do it. It's tough to get through, and isn't immediately rewarding, but it sets you up for the next season, and pairs with the Railgun seasons as well. \\n\\n\r\nGiven that the story is based off of a mediocre beginning of a Light Novel series, I'm giving the studio a little slack, they didn't have a lot to work off of for this season. As far as sticking closely to the source material, that might be a weakness here. The arcs are too short and jump too much, and often you're left wondering what just happened. On top of this, one of the most important aspects I think of this story is it's timeline. Getting a sense of the timeframe in which all these events happen is a key atmosphere to this plot, and it's almost completely left out of the anime, save a few date mentions if you're really paying attention. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are also really bland in this season; you get virtually no character development, and the most interesting and intriguing characters are on screen for 5 minutes at most, or they're villains who you never see again. That's another hold-over from the LN, but I feel like the studio could have improved on them here. Another reason to watch Railgun first, you get the characters and interest, so you're excited to see them in Index and that keeps you going. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly well-done, though some powers' visuals don't make intuitive sense. The sound banks on repeated iconic/trademark sounds, rather than for stunning impressive sounds.  I would call them both generic. \\n\\n\r\nIf this were a standalone anime, I would probably rate it at a 2, but it's part of a much larger world, and as such, this anime is fairly integral to understanding future events and characters. As I said before, I highly recommend watching Railgun first; it offers a much more interesting introduction to this world and it's story. Thank you for reading! \\n\\n",

            "content": "I felt this series shouted to the world that if its overrated, why not give them, viewers, the bestest sound effects, action, world building there ever existed. 'Cause it is overdone. The saving of girls, when even the hero just met them on the street. Word is, if you met this hero, all of this person's problem will be solved, but unfortunately, only to females. It's like the hero is allergic at saving people with similar gender. The creators are quite aware of this, I think, since them character's dialogue includes the stating of this fact like \"the hero will save her\", or \"are youa stupid hero, why are sacrificing yourself for someone you only met a minute ago?\". \\n\\n\r\nthe constable-like group that enforces law of those that has power is portrayed as efficient with their satellite and 24/7 watch, but I rarely see them when things go crashing and people trying to kill each other. There it is. There are many similar anomalies like this in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut as it may seem there are many plot holes, and overrated story lines, and complicated and long dialogues, why does the anime has 2 season, each composed of 24 episodes? Quite mysterious don't you think? I could only theorize about it and that is it gives a lot. A lot of music, a lot of action, nude scenes, ladies, damsels in distress. It was like a shotgun type, hoping to hit viewers with little aim needed. And there were no shame whatsoever. They would flaunt this fault via their character's dialogues, short of posting it on their cover. I have to note with the highest importance that the dialogues is the most unreal of all. They are long, embarrassing, lots of figure of speeches, and sometimes added unnecessarily.\\n\\n\r\n== Story ==\\n\\n\r\nthere are arcs and in it, continues by episode. Uniqueness in this series is out of the question. The hero has a hero-scene fetish so he would save them. He is attending a summer class and during this period, encounters this sister of a church, hanging in his balcony, in need of food. This then triggers the start of the adventure of his life. Also, I forgot to mention since this is suppose to be his thing, he gets this misfortunes like tripping, accidentally punched or fall. A thing no hero shouldn't really possess with opponent that can move mountains, metals like magneto and send it to you as fast as a bullet, against his only power, to null those powers via touching them with his right hand. I really have no idea how he gets through with each death defying fights. I guess he talks them opponent's ears off and distracts them when they are about to defeat him and starts monologuing. \\n\\n\r\n== Art ==\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a so-so. I could grade this as 80% good. The actions and motions were top-notch, since they need to compensate. The sister uses only one dress, another anomaly, so she's easily recognize. The characters attires where sometimes stupid like wearing this shirt like blankets. They are recognizable enough, in fact, better than average anime in this regard.\\n\\n\r\n== Sound ==\\n\\n\r\nIf the dialogues sucks, they make up for the music and effects. They would add super cool music, with crickets and birds chirping, when fights scenes or events of big importance happen. The sound and art were good.\\n\\n\r\n== Character ==\\n\\n\r\nThe hero is a es-per(?) student and I don't really know what happens to them if they graduate so it is a mystery. He is registered in this city composed of a big school of the world where the es-pers gather to learn. He is weak to girls in need of help. I notice he doesn't make advances to girls but opportunity always finds its way to him. He is thoughtful and caring. He lacks of emotions in terms of love and doesn't pursue to further his relationship to any of the girls he meet, another anomaly, I mean, what would you do? So I guess he's dull? Yes it seems he is.\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment ==\\n\\n\r\nI may say that the stories of the arcs where not so good but it was not the case at the start. It felt like it was going to lead at somewhere, then it got sidetracked. Okay, I should clarify this from the start that I'm all for story/settings that's already been done, since sometimes it somehow transforms to be interesting, but this was an exception. The dialogues were my problem along with the a fore mentioned. But to hell, I decided to continue and finish this to season 2 since little resolution was done on the first arc which got me hooked in the first place. It's like we are forced to see 2nd season.\\n",

            "content": "This review is going to be a bit weird, because Index is a personal favorite of mine but from a technical standpoint I can't really give it a 10.\r\nThe story itself is nothing unusual or spectacular, ordinary boy gets caught into amazing and dangerous secrets of the world, but I find the \"ordinary boy\" part to be quite arguable, as the hero, Kamijou Touma, was born with a special ability called \"Imagine Breaker\" that can cancel any form of supernatural or magical phenomenon and lives in a sci-fi city full of students that go through ESP development curriculum to gain supernatural abilities of various types.\r\nManydescribe the plot as science vs magic and later on that does come true, but for the beginning of the series, it's mostly about Touma and his allies fighting enemies from both sides, each with their own personal agenda.\\n\\n\r\nToaru is full of cliche characters, but they're well applied and I personally think that matters way more than being innovative, but if cliches turn you off, take this as a warning. Many characters really felt like they could be actual people (ignoring the ridiculous get-ups they use of course) and some of them go through some pretty good developments, the most notable ones being former villain Accelerator and Touma himself.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the selling point about Toaru is its mood, the feeling it gives that this is an actual world, and despite having a focus, there are other stories going on in other places with other people, and having side characters that actually can be sympathized with and aren't treated as mere tools, although it has some that aren't treated this well too, for the most part I enjoy most of the characters and actually want to see them pull through.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is still the center though, so how does Touma fares? Well, if you have something against idealistic heroes you might not really care for him, as he's a paragon of idealism, but he's constantly accompanied by people with more realistic points of view than his own. If you do however like this type, you'll probably enjoy the speeches he gives to his enemies, to refute their claims even if he himself thinks they have valid points. I personally liked very much how he doesn't simply beat the antagonists up and call it a day, he has to put his 2 cents on the matter first.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes and concepts behind the ESP powers and Magic of this world were also really fun in my opinion, but some fights did feel a little awkward and the animation is just average sometimes, overall they're still very good and most of the confrontations had me fully interested, especially the ones that were more tactical fights than fist to fist.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Toaru has its flaws but none too important to really ruin all the good points it has, and if you find yourself liking the show for reasons similar to mine, I would really suggest you check out the novels, especially for the part where it shows the thought process of the characters a lot more than the anime.",

It's a catchphrase belonging to a certain spiky-haired boy who resides in a world conceived by the light novel writer, Kazuma Kamachi. Index is that world, and if you want to know more about it, then I say get ready because we're in for a ride through the depths of hell and heaven. With a lot of punching too, bear in mind. This is the anime adaptation after all.\r\nThink about the two great systems that are ingrained deeply within our connection to the universe. Religion and science. The duality,the coexistence, and the friction. It's definitely a story idea of many potentials and this show has utilized it with supernaturalism in mind. We have Touma, a high schooler who possesses a mysterious right hand that can neutralize every supernatural powers. Being a misfortunate guy, he's taken in on a journey split between the magic and the science side. But here's where the main issue arises. The solitary nature of each arc means that there is no core holding everything together. It creates this weary repetition and detaches any sought-out continuation into a bigger story. Exposition is also quite problematic, mostly to do with tediousness, as explanations of religious and scientific concepts can get long-winded. Thankfully, the characters manage to retain interest with the conflicts and entertainments they give to us. Relying on the calm before the storm formula, the slice-of-life scenes have a lot of great humor in the form of witty dialogues, except for maybe the biting gags and some fan services that are sprinkled throughout. During the more serious moments, the magicians and espers complement well in each respective arc and have integrated themselves into some good discussions of ideals, morals, and history. Sure, a lot of them do feel bland with only a couple getting focused developments, but their dichotomies have at least applied to the two great systems of mankind.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if not for the audiovisual, this world where religion and science coexist as supernatural powers wouldn't have come to life. Academy City is the place where most of the story resides in. As it's a fairly architectural and diverse city, the characters are taken to a lot of different settings that are meticulously designed. Like a metallic tint, the washes of blue, red, and purple fit both the magical aspect of religion and the near-futurism of science. The animation is quite solid on an overall basis although there at times where some minor details are lost. With Touma being a guy that could only rely on his right hand, his way of brute fighting stands out among all the supernatural powers that glow and shimmer with devastating effects. Seeing the punches knock down his opponent can be a satisfying thing in itself. Anyway, something the visual has done to mitigate the boredom caused by numerous expositions is to preoccupy the characters with other actions, usually comical in nature, so they're not like dead presenters. The mix of fast-paced electronic beats and lighthearted soundtracks also help to bring even more enjoyment to this show. While the serious tracks shake things up as conflicts escalate, the cheerier ones supplement the slices-of-life pretty nicely, especially when comedic sound effects are played. Both the opening songs sung by Mami Kawada are really cool to listen to as well.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, despite the issues that came with it, the first season treats its adaptation of the Index light novels quite competently. Weariness from how the story is structured and the bland surface of the characters does clash against enjoyment, but overall, the world of religion and science provides a good starting point for more expansion.",

            "content": "Toaru Majutsu no Index is an action anime blending together the worlds of fantasy and science fiction, and is set in Academy City, a city full of espers. \r\nThe story revolves around Kamijyo Touma, a high schooler who suffers from misfortune due to his right arm, which can dispel any kind of magic or supernatural anomaly. The story is split into different chapters, each of which involve Touma beating the crap out of someone with his Imagine Breaker. Don't let Index's name in the title fool you, the story only revolves around her in the first chapter, while she becomes somewhat of a background characterin the other ones. The stories by themselves are exceptionally well-done and enjoyable, but when they're tied together, the overall story is somewhat lacking. It appeared that a certain person in a certain tube was behind everything and had a big evil plan, but it felt like the anime got cut off before it went into specifics. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is decent, but nothing special. It is exactly what you would expect from J.C. Staff. There are times when the animation exceeds expectations, like in the Innocentius fight, but there are also times when the quality drops, like Kuroko in the 2nd opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings are very fresh since they break away from the anime pop norms by using edgy techno with distorted animation. They are very fast-paced and get you excited for the episode, and fit very well with the theme of the anime. If nothing else, the openings just scream \"This anime is going to be badass.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have little time to develop, since it seems that each character shows up as a main character/villain for one chapter, then make minor character appearances in the other chapters. Also, Touma preaches a lot to pretty much every bad guy he meets, but it didn't bother me much since those types of main characters are extremely common. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is enjoyable at times, but there are certain moments where it will get a little boring. The ending is by far the least enjoyable, due to things being left unexplained and a rushed attempt at a wrap up.",

            "content": "The topic of Science vs Magic/Religion shouldn't be unfamiliar. Toaru Majutsu no Index is an anime which deals with this topic.\r\nAcademy City is the metropolis of future technology, inhabited mostly by students and scholars. Many of them are psychics (or espers) who were scientifically manipulated to have such abilities. It seemed as if the legendary Level 5 espers are the strongest people in the city..... until our protagonist Kamijo Touma appears.\r\nTouma is a peaceful, normal and, most of all, unlucky sort of guy. He is what many would call a loser, especially with a Level 0 (aka none) ability. However, this Lev 0 is dueto his other power: the Imagine Breaker. This ability allows every magical and psychic phenomenon (spells, curse, psychic abilities etc) he touches with his right hand to be annulled... just like that. Like most people in Academy City, Touma didn't believe in magic... until Index came. Index is a priestess who stores the 103000 illegal magic texts inside her brain (due to manipulation by the church). As Touma lets Index to stay with him, he will also face enemies and allies and other strange stuffs from a world which will fascinate all of us.\\n\\n\r\nTMnI is THE best anime series EVER!!!! LOL OMG AAAAAHHHH x 9999999999\\n\\n\r\nThe story is AMAZING! The idea of magic + psychic + science will open a very large and flexible scale of possibilities (possibilities which popular series like One Piece has). I CANNOT WAIT for the 2nd season and the spin-off series was pretty good as well. Art, sound is pretty good (as expected from JC staff) and characters..... omg.........*0*\\n\\n\r\nApart from the main characters I mentioned above, there is one other character to be mentioned since this character is powerful, important and most importantly, pretty. Misaka Mikoto appears in TMnI and the lead of spin-off Toaru Kagaku no Railgun. She is a Level 5 electromaster and the 3rd most powerful individual in the city. She first appears as a sort of an argue girl to Touma but later on she starts to like Touma a little. She is just so cute and likable.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, anyone who likes magic, fantasy, action and all those stuff SHOULD watch THIS series here. Bless you Toaru Majutsu!",

            "content": "Your enjoyment of Toaru Majutsu no Index will probably have to do a lot with how much animes having plot means to you.\r\nToaru Majutsu no Index starts off with an interesting concept, young girl has tons of magical tomes in her that could give massive power, but then after the first story arc, it throws that away and stomps on it and index is for the most part absent from the rest of the series in any meaningful way. That is the problem, the first story arc starts the series off pretty well and actually has plot and character progression, as well as a plottwist, but after that index disappears along with any sort of plot or character progression.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There is ZERO overall plot. this is basically a random daily life anime where you could watch the various story arcs in any sort of order (other than the first one). Hell, you could watch the episodes at random and not lose to much. The environment and the situations the characters are in is static after the first story arc and there is no sort of well developed menace or anything to compel the characters to do anything other than live their lives like normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe other story related problem is that things are SLOW. I'm sure everyone knows the stereotypes of fighting animes where the characters take 3 episodes to kick someone, that is right, index is like that to a degree. It absolutely feels like it was stretched out quite a bit to hit 24 episodes and would have been a better fit for 16-18 instead. Some episodes even consist almost entirely of someone making a long and overblown rant at someone.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is good. Seen worse, seen better, but it is good. The various powers look good and i like the character design rather well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Touma is for the most part your typical generic main character, even to the point of risking his life to save a potential love interest for no other reason. There was an event that occurred at the end of the first story arc that could have allowed him to become a very interesting character, but out of sheer madness such a significant event does not change this character AT ALL. A lot of the supporting characters are pretty interesting at first glance, especially index.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters comes when you watch a few of the episodes and notice that there is zero character progression. Even with what happened to Touma, he is exactly the same and has exactly the same relationships with the other characters throughout the series, nothing changes and he is totally and completely static. The rest of the characters are even worse, Touma has a habit of rescuing people and then BOOM they're gone from the series for a while and serve no great importance. Why spend 6 episodes to show him rescuing someone when they aren't going to be in the series at all? Other than new faces appearing every so often, you could watch the episodes in any order an not be surprised at how they act, what powers they have or what kind of relationships they have with those around them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I am a huge fan of series in general having overall plots with plot twists and progression, but i still enjoyed this series. I was disappointed that it didn't fully utilize the first story arc since after that things went way down hill, but i still continued watching it which says something. If you don't mind everything being static except the random situations the characters are thrust in to, it will probably be quite enjoyable. Even if you hate how static everything is, you still might enjoy it if you can get over how slow the show is sometimes.",

To put it simple, Espers dont know magicians really exists while magicians dont know espers exists. And its quite interesting to see one of the kind meets another kind and gets in role.\r\nI can't wait to see the next episode because it's story is really going through well. The characters are really well made such as their personalities, appearances, etc. The anime does not really have random events coming to story. Theevents that occur in the story are somehow related to one of the main characters from the past. \\n\\n\r\nAnother of this anime's uniqueness is Touma's (Esper as well as the main character) lost memories. As you can see in the beginning, his memories are lost; however, he manages to keep it a secret to everyone around him. The ability to keep the secret quite makes a difference from other animes where characters tend to forget someone and people notice that.\\n\\n\r\nI think anime's uniqueness really makes the series good so far. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Baka. Baka. Baka. I found myself endlessly repeating that mantra while watching this series. Everything about it is idiotic. The titular character, Index, is a microcephalic non-entity who is supposed to have only 103,000 neurons in her head, roughly the same number as a fruit-fly. Like that insect, her behavior repertoire consists of buzzing around looking for food, and not much else. The main character, Kamijou Touma, is slightly more complicated: he is able to, at random, express such emotions as fear, anger, and\u2026actually, I think that is about it. Most of the time he looks like a sleepwalker.\r\n\tThe plot for each episode felt likeit was generated by dice rolls, with the main character running into other people at random, and reacting to each meeting in some random fashion and then doing something else at random. The only time the randomness broke down was when there was some action that the main character urgently needed to take: in which case, he most assuredly wouldn't take it, because baka.\\n\r\n\tWe are all used to the physical relationships in anime being somewhat elastic, but in this series they were non-existent. Picture our hero facing off against a villain in a room that is ten feet on a side. There is maybe six feet between them. The hero charges his opponent. Thirty seconds and several long dialog exchanges later he has closed the distance to only twenty feet. If he keeps running at full speed for another minute, he might be able to close within fifty feet: all while his opponent is standing still. Baka, baka, baka.\\n\r\n\tAs far as redeeming features go, there isn't much. Mikoto Misaka, the \u201cShocker,\u201d might have had the potential to be an interesting character, but was never really developed. Her clones were kind-of fun, especially Mini-Misaka. The two episodes in which she appeared while the main characters were absent were the best of the season. There was a bit of fanservice scattered here and there, but the characters were so wooden that it was largely a waste.\\n\r\n\tI hope that this will forever remain the worst anime series that I've ever actually watched all the way through.",

It was made by the creators of \"ToraDora!\" and has possibly one of the best English dubs I've seen from Funimation.\r\nI don't really understand all of the criticism this show gets. \r\nMany argue that the story is deceptive in the fact that everything goes downhill after the first story arc. In defense, it is a Light Novel adaptation, so it's got a lot of information and description to thrash out. I personally consider the first book (first 6 episodes) to be a story in itself, with the rest of the television series to be acouple of extensions for fun.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure what it is about this anime in particular, but a lot of really great things click together to my preferences. You've got an entire world of science vs. magic and a distinctly-unique world comparable to that of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. In the midst of the confusion, I love the fact that the main character is some dimwit below-average guy without any special powers at his utility. Throughout the show, he uses his brain and good morals to counter both witchcraft and confusing situations. The best part is: every battle involves him using his right fist alone, knocking out every villain in his path.\\n\\n\r\nGender Equality punch go!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series can get you lost in all of it's details if you aren't one for paying attention to details. However, if you find yourself appreciating the characters, I guarantee you won't get lost. I personally really enjoyed it and I honor it's bravery in an industry filled with harems and power-up scenes. I'm anticipating the release of a third season!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10",

            "content": "Story - 7\r\nThe plot is set in Academy city in which studies the effects of scientifically advanced supernatural students with psychic or esper powers. One of those students is Touma who is a lvl 0 psychic or esper, but even though his lvl is zero he has his right arm which has the power to negate all supernatural powers like magic and other esper powers. And then one day he meets a girl named Index who has 103 000 magical books sealed inside her brains and people from magical society wants to gain the important knowledge she has in her memory. Touma being a typicalprotagonist does everything to protect her with his right arm. And this was the best part of this anime as for the story. It was interesting and exciting and I didn't have a clue what would happen. But after this beginning arc ends comes few more  mini arcs which you could change places with each other, because the story has no continuity after the beginning arc. It's really no surprise that the story took a small, but noticeable nose dive and only got 7 in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nCrisp and clear, nice colouring, great character designs and no noticeable animation flaws. Off course it could be a bit better, but you know if somebody would call art in this anime bad I would doubt his vision or his sanity.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nFirst opening was great, but the second one was annoying. To be honest the second opening wasn't bad, but personally it really annoyed me because it kinda sounded like radio which had static between the channels. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\r\nTouma and Index had cliche personality's and that's a bad thing, because they are the main characters. But thank god support characters make up for this cliche and did a pretty good job. Only problem none of them don't get enough air time, except Accelerator who gets 2 episodes dedicated to him. As for the character development it is only really noticeable in Misaka and Accelerator and all other characters had a small development in the beginning arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nTruth be said I expected more from this anime then it gave. I'm a fan of scientific stuff so you could see were the expectations came from. For me this seemed like a magic based anime more than science based anime, because when I heard all the jargon in this anime it seemed that they were doing magic, because the jargon that was used in this anime was never really explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nGreat art, not so great music, interesting storyline which was screwed up by poor story continuity. As for the characters there really need to be more character development.\\n\r\nSo I would say that this anime in somewhere between entertaining and watchable and there is a good chance that you will like it, so give it shot.",

            "content": "Note: This is a review of the series in its entirety.\r\nOverview:\r\nEvery anime fan has a 'dark horse'- in other words, a series that they end up loving a lot in spite of it not being that popular. For me, that series is \"A Certain Magical Index\". While it certainly isn't unpopular, it is very controversial as there are a lot of people who don't like very much for whatever reason. However, I'm not one of those people. I think it's an excellent series with a unique and highly intriguing science vs. magic theme, complimented by great action and fantastic characters.\r\nStory & World (8.5/10):\r\n\"A Certain MagicalIndex\" is generally set in the fictional Academy City, which is pretty much what it sounds like- a city packed with elementary schools, middle schools, high schools and colleges, and where about 80% of the population are students. It is also 20 years more advanced than anywhere else in the world, to the point that there are many people who have supernatural psychic powers developed by science. However, there is more to this world than meets the eye, as Touma Kamijou, a very unlucky but kind-hearted student, discovers when he finds a mysterious girl passed out on his balcony. She introduces herself as Index, a nun from the Church of England, which is home to sorcerers. While Touma is initially skeptical, he soon discovers that magic is indeed real and that there are people after the 103,000 grimoires Index carries with her, or rather the knowledge of them she carries due to her photographic memory. However, that's only one small part of the plot. And there's a lot of plot.\\n\\n\r\n\"A Certain Magical Index\" has two seasons which equate to a total of 48 episodes which spread over 10 major arcs (as well a movie which tells a self-contained story). Most of them involve conflicts with the Magic Side but there are a couple which focus on the Science Side as well. The whole thing gets pretty convoluted. For a while, you will likely be confused as to what the point of all the various conflicts are as they seem to have no connection. However, things do start to make sense in the final arc of the second season, where seemingly random events suddenly come together. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say I definitely preferred the second season to the first, as I found it to be a lot more exciting and interesting. While none of the arcs are unwatchable, some are definitely better than others, with the final major arc of the second season being my favourite. Things ultimately end on a hell of a cliffhanger, though, which will leave people wanting a third season.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (9/10):\\n\r\nVisually, \"Index\" looks fantastic. The characters are all very well-drawn and the effects of the various spells and psychic abilities are great too. Notably, this perhaps the only anime I've seen that uses panty shots for something other than fanservice (no, you didn't read that wrong). It doesn't look flawless- the fanservice can reach ecchi territory at times and there are a few rough edges- but overall the series looks really nice and is an effort J.C Staff definitely deserves credit for.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\\n\r\n\"Index\"'s soundtrack is pretty damn good, consisting mainly of electric tracks that really fit the tone of the show. I liked all of the openings except for the second, though the ending themes leave something to be desired. The dubbed voice acting is really good too, with Micah Solusod leading the cast in what is arguably his best role by far. It also features a fantastic performance from Monica Rial as Index, with her making full use of her extensive voice range. Besides them, the cast also includes Alexis Tipton, Austin Tindle, Jad Saxton and Brittney Karbowski. The latter has always been a hit-and-miss actor for me, but thankfully this is easily one of her best performances. The dialogue is also great, though most of the best lines come from Touma.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9.5/10):\\n\r\nWe're introduced to Touma in a very clever way in the first scene, which has him running for his life from a group of thugs. Then, through a flashback, we learn that he got into that mess when he tried to help out a girl he didn't even know. These scenes subtly but brilliantly highlight his two most important character traits- his abysmal luck and his impulsive inclination to help others. Hell, he says word-for-word in one episode that he doesn't see why he needs a reason to help somebody. It is possible to make him mad though, and whenever a villain attempts to justify their crimes with a tragic past, he ALWAYS manages to prove they're nothing but hypocrites before punching them into next week. His sole weapon is the Imagine Breaker, a mysterious power in his right hand that, ironically, is the source of his bad luck, as it negates any supernatural phenomenon it comes in contact with, including God's blessing. However, Touma is able to turn this curse into an invaluable weapon, as the ability to negate the supernatural is extremely useful in a world where magicians and espers are pretty much the norm. That's not to say he's invincible though- he's far from it. There are ways to work around his negation and he loses a fight here and there. Essentially, he's the type of hero that all others should aspire to be and, if a bit annoying at times, a truly fantastic protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Index, who I would definitely say is my favourite character. As I mentioned before, she has the knowledge of 103,000 grimoires stored in her head, so she's basically a walking library. However, this isn't brought up all that often, and there are quite a few arcs in which she's just on the sidelines, which is rather strange for a title character. However, the arcs in which she does have a big part are also the ones I enjoyed most. She doesn't make that big an impact in the first season, but in the second her significance skyrockets, when her vast knowledge starts to really come in handy and she's seen taking on multiple enemies by herself. Besides that, she's funny, cute, warm-hearted and doesn't fall into any common character archetype (the closest I can think of is a mild case of tsundere). All of this combines into a very unique, lovable character who, unfortunately, has been cruelly overlooked by the masses, and a rare case where I wished a character was used more.\\n\\n\r\nMikoto Misaka is the next of the main characters. She's one of only seven Level 5 espers in Academy City, the highest achievable rank, and her ability is to fire out a massive blast of electricity similar to a railgun, hence her nickname. She even has her own spin-off series which I will review in the next few months. She's very popular, but I personally found her to be pretty annoying. She's more of a generic tsundere than Index and her ability isn't even that unique (railguns are quite common in Japanese media, as are people with electrical powers). I do love her, just not as much as Index or Touma. The fourth and final main character is Accelerator, the most powerful esper in Academy City who's introduced as a villain but becomes an anti-hero later on (it's common knowledge). He's definitely a lot darker than the other three and, unlike them, he does NOT hesitate to kill those who get in his way. His ability is to control vectors- basically, anything that comes in contact with him bounces right off, among other things. By the time he's turned to the good side, though, this has been severely restricted, just so he doesn't end up unstoppable.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main characters, there's a pretty huge supporting cast. It would take forever to go through all of them, so I'll say that the majority are well-fleshed out and are given at least one chance to shine. Sure, there are a few characters the show could have done without, such as the always present-yet-never relevant Aisa Himegami, but overall the characters are really well-written, extremely diverse and the main reason I love this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\n\"Index\" is a highly entertaining ride from start to finish. There's great action in almost every episode and during the parts without fighting, there's plenty of great comedy to keep you entertained, especially from Index. The series is one you will definitely want to see to the end if you can get past the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"A Certain Magical Index\" is amazing. There seems to be a lot of people who didn't like it that much, but I love it and consider it to be very underrated. With its amazing characters, great world, crisp art, kickass music and awesome action, this is a series I think everyone should at least check out. I hope to see more of Touma, Index and Academy City in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8.5+9+9+9.5+9=45/50=9/10",

It does a fantastic job of trying to set up the world it takes place in, but then seems to fall off track and becomes distracted. I'm someone that tends to enjoy a lot of what I stick with, and therefore this seemed to be a fairly enjoyable ride. The characters themselves were somewhat flat, but you could see there was an attempt to give them color and personalities. It just seemed totry to put in too many arcs into too little. Each arc is somewhat of a Family Guy episode. Something new happens, but it doesn't seem to affect anything in the storyline after it, besides the introductions of new characters.  Overall, it's something I enjoyed when I had time to kill and think others will enjoy too, but at the end of it, you'll just ask \"That's it?\"",

            "content": "Toaru no Majutsu no Index is a series I find difficult to pinpoint exactly why I like as much as I do. From a technical, objective analysis of the anime, it's nothing special. But deep down, in the details, there is something quite unique and refreshing that I find very enjoyable.\r\nThe first thing of note is the flow of the anime, or rather, the seeming lack thereof. You are first thrown into this very compelling, if not epic, storyline that sets the show up with a ton of potential. You have 2 major organizations in the series: the science side, Academy City (Home of theespers) and the Magic side, Religion (Home of the Mages). The protagonist of the series, Kamijou Touma, is a student in Academy city who poses the ability to nullify any supernatural power his right hand comes in contact with. Touma ends up meeting a unique young girl named Index, who claims to have the contents of 103,000 powerful grimoires memorized, and power-hungry mages want dibs on this knowledge. Alright, cool. After 6 episodes of some pretty compelling story and set-up, suddenly the preceding events cease to hold much importance. Index, the promising plot-generator, becomes a little more than comedic relief and the story set up until now is barely, in round-about ways, touched upon. As the series continues, each event seems rather disconnected from each other. What gives?\\n\\n\r\nThe above observation is what I believe causes people to lose interest in the series. But, a bit a research sheds some light onto why the story is told this way, and realizing this information made the series much more enjoyable for me. You see, unlike many Animes, Majutsu no Index is based off a (lengthy) series of light novels instead of a manga. The difference between the 2 is while each chapter of a manga is a continuation of the last, each volume in a light novel is intended to be read as a separate story: plots that have an introduction, conflict, and then a conclusion. Each essential \"arc\"  of Majutsu no Index is an animated version of each volume of the light novel series. So why did this series get animated?\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about this series is that is actually does have a compelling, detailed, continuous plot; but not until much later. The first few novels act as prologues for this plot, and slowly but surely start the start building the needed details. Unfortunately for the viewers, this means the whole first season of Index is nothing more but a large and convoluted prologue to something much bigger. Bummer. However, it is important to note that I found the series to be much more enjoyable when you expect to see a bunch of mini plots instead of 1 continuous story. It's very much akin to Higuarshi no Naku Koro ni, and to a degree, Cowboy Bebop, Gintama, and detective Conan's perspective on storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so how good are these \"arcs\"? I'd give a general 7/10 overall throughout the series. They are enjoyable, but they don't hold the depth one might want to see from an anime. The series tends to follow a formula for the first 6-10 novels or so: Some character relevant to the immediate plot is introduced, some conflict surrounds this character, Touma gets thrown into the conflict, Touma confronts the antagonist, antagonists explain their reasons, Touma preaches morals to them and then proceeds to punching out the conflict with his magical right fist. Meh.\\n\\n\r\nWhile formulaic (mostly), this is also part of the charm of the series. You see, in Majutsu no Index, there is no \"ultimate\" evil the protagonist is trying to defeat. The are good and bad aspects of both sides. We are introduced to the bad aspect of the Religious side quite early on, but a bit further the dark side of Academy city is hinted at as well. Throughout the first season, the viewers are left in a position where they really can't decide if the \"boss\" of Academy city is good or evil. Everything is washed with a shade of grey. This is a good part of storytelling, and receives a plus in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThe real strength of Majutsu no Index, I feel, is the character interaction. The characters are not profoundly unique in any respect, but they are detailed enough that entertaining dialogue can be exchanged at a decent rate. You see, in this series, between the main conflicts are little snippets of a slice-of-life anime, and Index does these exchanges well. While it's always fun to see Touma overcome a tough opponent, it is very easy to get lost in the pace of the slice-of-life conversations, which are sprinkled with comedy and character-development throughout. Setting the main-character's power to backfire on his everyday life by blessing him with abnormal bad luck is a sure way to have some interesting situations, but entertaining nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story makes some amazing progress, such as connecting seemingly disconnected events together, introducing some really interesting characters and events, and transitioning the story to follow 3 protagonists and their different perspectives instead of a normal 1, it unfortunately happens after the events of this season, and thus cannot be considered in this evaluation. As a stand alone anime, The first season of Index cannot show off the series' whole potential, and is hurt because of it.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nOverall - 37/50 = 0.74 = 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "I'm going to come right out and say it: I struggled with A Certain Magical Index. It didn't start that way. In fact, I loved it for a good bit. But then, I began to to realize that I was having certain issues with the general trajectory of the story-line. It was somewhat strange for me, because generally, I like Magical Index's genre. The story with the main character who has \"special powers\" and can't help but attract new recruits for his harem wherever he goes. It reminded me a bit of Strike the Blood, which I enjoyed a great deal more. Maybe you couldsay that Strike the Blood improved upon the formula of Magical Index, which came a good 7 years before it, or maybe I'm just biased because I watched Strike the Blood first. Either way, I was disappointed with Magical Index, especially in the latter third or so and I'll explain why, but first I'll go over what I liked.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the premise of Magical Index for one. The idea of magic versus science is a really strong premise and, at first, I thought that it was executed really well. The first arc with Index was a great blend of magic and science, with Touma working in both worlds really well. However, they kind of lost me a few arcs later as I began to see the same premise essentially re-skinned and re-used. That's about the time I began to wonder if Magical Index was just really formulaic. The second thing I liked was Touma's ability. I didn't love Touma himself too much, I was more indifferent than anything about him, but what made him stand out to me was his power. Touma's right hand possesses Imagine Breaker which can destroy any kind of supernatural power. It's kind of a unique take on the \"powerful MC\" trope that dominates most, if not all, supernatural shows and allows for more unique conflicts, even if they usually just end up as \"Touma punches something with his right hand as hard as he can\". Finally, I loved Mikoto Misaka. This may be something of a personal preference, but I thought that she was the best character in the entire show. It wasn't that far through that I realized that she was the only reason I was watching in the first place. In a show about supernatural abilities and unnatural situations, Mikoto felt like the most human character in the show. She was strong, but she also had weaknesses. She was confident, but also had insecurities. Maybe all of this praise is just my best girl bias, but she definitely kept me watching. With all that said, I'll probably watch A Certain Scientific Railgun just for her.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, what didn't I like? Pretty much every other character, outside of a few like Accelerator, Kanzaki, Himegami, and Kuroko. I disliked the magic arcs a lot, they felt really boring and convoluted compared to the much more interesting and grounded scientific arcs. I think the big thing about the magic portions of the show was that they felt unrestrained. At least in the show, there are no rules to the magic, like how the hell does it even work? Is it just whatever you can think up, is it grimoire based? Who knows? Like I mentioned above, I really dislike the direction of the story. I could basically feel the insane escalation coming. I mean, I could already tell that it was just going to get crazier and crazier, but the fact that it was getting ridiculous in the first season was kinda concerning. Kind of a side point, I spoiled myself a little bit and found out that Touma's harem just keeps growing to ridiculous proportions and he just strings them all along kind of made me a little upset. I would be the first person to admit that harems can be fantastic, but there's a point where the constant adding of girls should just stop and use the girls that are there. The greatest sin in Magical Index is who else but Index herself. Oh God, she made me want to pull the trigger to the gun that I put to my skull every time she was on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the above paragraph made it seem like I despised Magical Index with every fiber of my body, I really did enjoy it for the majority of the run-time. Something just stopped working toward the end, causing my enjoyment to really suffer. It's something that I really can't put my finger on. By all means, I should love Magical Index, seeing as it has everything I could ever want from an anime. There's just something there that really makes me not want to finish. At this point, I have no idea if I'll finish or not. I probably will at some point, but it won't be for a while. I'll probably watch Scientific Railgun for more of best girl sooner.",

            "content": "When I first heard of this anime back in 2008, I had never even heard of the To Aru franchise. However, based on the fact that it was being animated by JC Staff (and back then I had just finished watching another JC Staff production, Shakugan no Shana), I figured that giving To Aru Majutsu no Index a shot couldn\u2019t hurt. Based on how the preview videos gave Index a more supernatural-type setting to it, I was actually pretty excited for this show. Objectively speaking, this show has a mix of some great moments and an overall well thought out plot, mixed in with somemediocre characters and other minor annoyances.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Index a unique series is it\u2019s setting. To Aru Majutsu no Index\u2019s imaginative ideas where there are science-based espers naturally born with powers, alongside magicians which have inhabited the world for centuries, are executed extremely well. Everything regarding both magic and science, with regards to specific rules, ceremonies, and limitations that reign over each, was thought through with a lot of detail and specificity. All the detail with regards to both magic and science really helps make the setting, filled with superpowers and all, much more believable and realistic. I should note that the \u201cscience\u201d in this show is definitely unrealistic, but nothing that a little suspension of disbelief can\u2019t solve.\\n\\n\r\nThe author for the original source material, a light novel series by the same name, obviously thought everything through, or at least didn\u2019t try to half-ass it, with regards to both the magicians and espers. I mean, when they start referencing things such as Schrodinger\u2019s cat, or a system governing the rules of magic, it\u2019s quite obvious that the original author at least attempted to do some research and incorporate it in his work, and his hard work all really shows in the actual series. He pretty much made his own fictional world with it\u2019s own rules, similar to how the authors Kinoko Nasu or Yashichiro Takahashi did the same with their respective series.\\n\\n\r\nThis unique setting is really the foundation for all the scenarios and character development in this show. The intermingling of magic and science really produces some unexpectedly tense and serious situations and character backstories, ranging from the Misaka sister\u2019s existence to the Angel Fall incident, and even the church politics with regards to Index\u2019s 103,000 magical grimoires inside her head. This show really knows how to produce a really intense atmosphere, with the climaxes to a good chunk of the arcs in this show both exhilarating and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are a few arcs that I personally thought were weak, and pretty pointless. Mainly, the Deep Blood and Imaginary Numbers arcs I felt were a little on the weak side. The main conflicts felt a little forced, and sometimes I found the characters acting\u2026well\u2026 out of character. Besides my minor gripes with the plot though, the story was actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with this series is definitely the characters to this show. There are some characters that I found absolutely charming, and really really fun to watch, such as Misaka Mikoto and Index. However, that doesn\u2019t really solve the issue where a good portion of the main cast was underdeveloped. Because of the large amount of characters in this series, a bunch of them had little to no screentime for much development. Another big issue here would be our main protagonist, Kamijou Touma. His over the top idealistic actions were, at some points, borderline absurd, and had me shaking my head.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, there is a curious little fault to this show as a result of it being a light novel adaptation. Because a light novel is text-based, it\u2019s fine if the novel goes into a lot of dialogue heavy detail about the situations unfolding. Doing the same in an anime adaptation, however, is definitely less plausible. Because JC staff left much of the dialogue in tact, the result was that this show was at many times had too much exposition and detail that defused some of the tension built up in a previous scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that comes to mind is Touma\u2019s extremely long, dialogue heavy scenes, which often times could have been condensed much more. If JC staff focused a bit less on the exposition and more on the actual story, I think this show could have been even better.\\n\\n\r\nThis show definitely has some great animation and action scenes, with JC Staff\u2019s experience with animating shows like Zero no Tsukaima and Shakugan no Shana really showing. Rather than the action being composed of random people brawling it out, in this series the battles get quite tactical and really forces our main characters to plan and actually do things more carefully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, To Aru Majutsu no Index is a well done anime with some great visuals, intense action scenes, a intriguing setting and plot, as well as some charming characters. There is room for improvement, especially with a select few characters of this series and parts of the plot, but those could be ignored pretty easily. For those that would prefer a more light-hearted, slice of life type anime, they should go watch the counterpart to this show To Aru Kagaku no Railgun.\\n\\n\r\nProduction Quality: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory/Setting: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.3/10 (rounded down to a 8 on MAL)\\n\\n\r\ncomments, feedback,and most importantly criticisms, are always welcome. :)",

Science vs. Religion (Some may refer it to magic).\r\nTo Aru Majutsu Idex is a smart anime, however, complex in it's own way. It shows that in the near future, science may able to create something out of nothing...  Such as create Electricity, or accelerating particles to reverse it (Kinda tough to explain, but watch and you'll understand...)  These \"supernatural powers\" is called \"Esper\".  On the other hand, magic is also a powerful aspect in the world, especially in England (Hooray the Brits...)\r\nAnyway, the animeshows how much similar both science and religion is (for the power of magic and Esper), but those ignorant fools can not able to set their differences aside.  And thus, the war of science and Magic began... much later in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThen here comes our main character...  Touma, a guy with a supernatural power, who are unable to be explain by science nor magic.  He owns, what the magician calls the \"Imagine Breaker\".  Funny thing is his power is able to nullify both power produced by Science and Magic.  \\n\\n\r\nThat's the funny and the serious part is the church sister from England \"fall from the sky\" and arrive at Touma's home.

            "content": "This anime is my 6th favorite anime of all time and it is very unlikely that it will be pushed out of its spot anytime soon. The main character, who is literally being followed by misfortune, handles his everyday life with an accepting attitude. Now while this may not sound impressive, imagine if your whole life everything that could go wrong did (aside from tripping and cracking your head open or something of course) would you be able to just keep happy knowing that everyone around you is much better off than you are simply because your are unlucky?\r\nThis anime has some of the bestanime magic I've seen, second only to the magic used in Rental Magica, as well as having the best \"powers\" in any anime ever which is more developed in the spin off A Certain Scientific Railgun. \\n\r\nThis show has so much going on that you never know what to expect, and I don't mean this in a bad way, like you are going to be overwhelmed. What I mean is this anime isn't afraid to take chances and do things you wouldn't have otherwise expected. The world itself is also a bit unique mixing both the technological and the mystical to great effect. \\n\r\nAs for the main heroine, while at times I do feel like she's a bit bland, or rather more a bit stereotypical, but more often than not she's quite an interesting character to watch. As the story progresses relatively early on, the story takes a plot twist that I was honestly not expecting. I'm not going to spoil anything of course, but the anime does a great job of breaking your expectations and putting on spectacular fight scenes that are rivaled by few.\\n\r\nIts a great anime in my book one that I'd recommend any day, and I'm proud to have it as one of my top ten.",

            "content": "The original one punch man\u2026 Touma\u2026 maybe two or three punches.\r\nThis review will be about the series as a whole, including Railgun, but the rating I officially give will only be for this show.\r\nI do not think the title of this show fits with this series.  If I were to name this show myself, it would be called A Certain Link, Imagine Breaker.  My reasoning behind this is that Touma the main character isn\u2019t really part of the magical world.  In this show he is seen as a link between science and magic.  A Certain Scientific Railgun title would be fineas it is and a new series with the rightful title of A Certain Magical Index should have Index as the main character with the setting taking place at the different churches before she met Touma.\\n\\n\r\nThe Watch Order I Recommend: Index, Railgun, Index II, Index Movie, Railgun S\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (6/10 for Index specifically)\\n\r\nThe Index series at first glance seems like a mess since the first season has so many arcs and the timelines are all mixed up in other seasons but it gets better with certain seasons, which have longer and more developed arcs appearing.  I believe the reason for this was to introduce all the important characters in the first season of Index, then handle plot progression in the other seasons.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Railgun series was definitely superior to Index in terms of story. A lot of the progression was very smooth and well-paced with only 2-3 arcs per season while Index had up to 6 arcs which made events feel very isolated from each other.  The Railgun arcs were more interesting in general as well.  But it doesn\u2019t have the serious or intense tone that Index has until Railgun S which I think had the darkest arc in this series.\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is one of the good points of this show that kept me watching.  The world of science had many well-created principles there are based on real concepts like quantum theory which is really cool.  There was so much attention to detail and lore that was put into this universe but sometimes there was just an overflow of factions and organizations that you can lose track of what\u2019s going on, a problem in the Index series.  Relations between some organizations aren\u2019t as clear as I want it to be in the anime which can cause a lot of confusion for first time watchers since so many characters are moving in and out of these factions.  The foundation of this world is amazing but the execution, not as good.  Some of these organizations do questionable things as well, which make you wonder how they came to be in the first place, especially the Kihara family, (a group of crazy scientists).  So many of their actions don\u2019t make sense like telling the protagonists all about their evil plans or going lenient on the main/supporting characters when they could have easily killed them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are interactions between magic and science that I really like in this story, especially in Index season 2.  It showed large tensions between the world of science and magic, with their varying views on how the world should be. \\n\\n\r\nIf this series does come out with even more, I hope that Index gets a series of her own like Accelerator did.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 (6/10 for Index specifically)\\n\r\nNothing much to say.  The art style looks like the usual anime art style but the quality of animation does get better as you progress to the newer seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (7/10 for Index specifically)\\n\r\nIndex has good music for its scenes while Railgun has really good openings and endings by Fripside. The voice actors did a good job especially the one who voiced Accelerator in Japanese.   His laugh was weird, funny and psychopathic at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 (6/10 for Index specifically)\\n\r\nTouma is a the usual self-insert character that just wants to protect everyone. But along with that it seems like Touma has an insane amount of plot armor being invincible at times against these magic and esper users.  He gets punched so hard that he goes flying through the air so many times that I don\u2019t even know how he gets right back up.  And after each fight he ends up in the hospital but he continues his daily routine afterwards as if nothing happened.  He does seldom show his weak points, against people without any abilities like when he messing with a group of mobs who were bothering Misaka.  His character was also much better in Railgun S where his fight choreography with Accelerator looked more plausible and he used crutches post-fight.  He\u2019s still full of plot armor though, just a little less in Railgun.\\n\\n\r\nMisaka and her group of friends have well thought out personalities in the Railgun series.  They all have many personal problems that they overcome making this spin-off series more down to earth compared to Index.  The supporting characters there are way more flushed out compared to those in Index with more screen time going towards people other than the main character.  Misaka does looks like a typical tsundere in Index though which is a downside.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 (7/10 for Index specifically)\\n\r\nEven with its many fault, I still really enjoyed this series mostly because of Misaka, Accelerator and Academy City.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (7/10 for Index specifically)\\n\r\nI would recommend this series but it might not be for everyone.  You might see the main character as too clich\u00e9 or unoriginal but if you can get past that, it is worth a watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Allow me to preface by stating that I have not yet seen the rest of the toaru series. I plan on watching Railgun and the rest of the series but have yet to do so. I will also avoid major spoilers within the review. I will start with a summary and then break it down a tiny bit further, so if all you need is a short review, just read the first following paragraph. \r\nOverall : 8\r\nThis show to me is sort of like a guilty pleasure, similar to sword art online in that aspect. I realize that the show is not the best, infact it's quite awful in comparison to some other shows I've seen. Now despite this, I still enjoyed it thoroughly. Starting the show, I had the issue of choosing subbed or dubbed. The dub was very mediocre and the sub was just hard to understand because of some of the word choices. I was lazy and chose the less popular of the two: dubbed. Once I solved that issue, I realized that I didn't quite like very many of the characters. Index, Misaka, and a few other supporting roles all bugged me early on and I stayed for the plot concept: science vs. magic. Although not carried through the best, the show was good enough for me to stick around to the point where I liked it. Misaka soon became my favorite character, the action picked up, I got past the dub's average quality, and I just sat down and enjoyed the adventure the show took me on. I would only suggest the show to people willing to take a risk and give the show a little while to kick in. There are definitely safer shows to take on, but if the risk pays off, you may find yourself really enjoying this show, despite the obvious flaws. The likable characters( not all of them ), the show's concept, and the action carried the show for me so if that sounds up your alley, give it a go. \\n\\n\r\nonto the detailed broken down review.\\n\\n\r\nStory [8] : The concept of the show is brilliant, in my opinion. Science faces religion, which is represented by magic within the show.  I only give the story an 8 because of how intriguing I find this concept. The execution of the concept however, did not meet my expectations. The main character, Touma, has the ability to cancel out any magical or esper(scientific) ability. He acts as a bridge between the two different worlds. With this ability however, I thought the show would pursue a more comedic and parody-like approach. The writers however chose the darker and more serious approach. That path was alright but clearly had its flaws. I feel like sometimes the writers even forgot about Touma's ability and made the fights unnecessarily difficult. I get that some people want to see action, but I can't see the action if I'm too busy facepalming at how the fights go against a main premise of the show. I don't want to carry too far into the main plotline, even though there barely is one ( lot of \"filler\"ish episodes that just barely tie back to main theme) , so that's my 2 cents. \\n\\n\r\nArt [8] : I didn't find the animation to be outstanding but I can forgive it given the year of production. I liked the fights and that animation of those, especially with accelerator. Not too much to say there. \\n\\n\r\nSound [5] : So I watched the dub and what I'm mostly going to talk about is the voice acting. First off, I actually hated Index's voice. I didn't mind most the rest but that doesn't mean I liked it. I like Misaka's voice against popular opinion. I also didn't like the OP's and end songs too much but that's very minor considering that I usually skip them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [7] : I liked the idea of Touma's character but I feel like the writers tried to make him OP, and only succeeded at all the wrong times. I don't think that at the super serious points in the show that the MC should just magically win the fight, but hey that's just me. I personally hated index, I'm not too sure what else to say there. Misaka best waifu. Started out a little annoying but now easily best girl in show. The extras were all pretty good at doing their role in the show but I felt as if they got lost because a new supporting role character was introduced every 10 minutes within the show. There was too much to try to follow there and I felt like some of them just distracted away from any main plot that was there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9] : Misaka best waifu. I really did end up enjoying the show despite the flaws. I liked some of the characters enough to where I could ignore the one's I didn't. I also liked seeing the religious details put into the magic casting as well as the comedic relief points of the show. I've recently been watching a lot of romance where everyone was overdramatic so this show was a breath of fresh air. Yes, the characters were dramatic, but for good reason. I really can't justify why I liked the show as much as I did... I just did. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Hope this helped you choose whether or not to watch. Feel free to message me with any further questions about the show as well.",

            "content": "To Aru Majutsu no Index is an anime that I never really expected to come across. It never was my \u201ccup of tea\u201d kind of genre, with a mixture of science fiction with a bit of religious elements. I picked up on though, because of this conflict. The constantly reoccurring quarrel in reality between science and religion is explained in an over exaggerating expanded television series. I liked the idea of this reoccurring motif, and on many occasions, I was surprised with a sudden allusion to the conflict and really enjoyed that. \r\nTbh, the ratings are just OKAY for this anime, and I completely understandthat. There are so many flaws in many significant elements in the story that just\u2026 ruin it for me. I\u2019ll explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m about 50% sure of my current rating for this anime. This anime remained \u201cratingless\u201d on my list for a while since I finished it. I\u2019ll start with the story, and hopefully I\u2019ll come to a surer conclusion. The story is supposed to revolve around a boy named Tohma who lives in Academy City, a city based off of science and the main powers gained in that city are those based off of science themselves, the people who develop these powers being known as \u201cespers.\u201d Tohma is about the lowest ranking esper there could possibly be, but there is one plus side. He has a certain power in his right hand known as \u201cImagine Breaker;\u201d In other words, he can cancel any type of esper or magic type vector that may be shot at him. One day, he finds a little girl in a white gown hanging on his balcony who claims to be named \u201cIndex\u201d and is basically a walking library containing vast amounts of knowledge. What\u2019s more, she resides from the magic side of reality. That\u2019s how the hidden conflict erupts. Ever since this girl starts living with him, all of these incidents start occurring. The first arc, in my opinion, was the BEST in the series. I loved the characters that turned up and everything made sense in that first arc. The first arc was a matter of trusting both magic and scientific ability, and the conflict left me at the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, after the last episode of that arc, which I believe was around episode 4-5, everything started slowly drifting away from me. There were many newly added elements and characters that I couldn\u2019t understand. There was one point in the anime that I thought I skipped an episode, because there were so many things that I just couldn\u2019t get. It took me longer to finish this anime because I just got so bored of it on many occasions. Also, even though the anime is supposed to revolve around Tohma and Index, Index is BARELY a part of the main plot. She can\u2019t use magic so she usually just watches on the side. Even when she IS in an episode, it\u2019s just for about a half a second. I found that as a major issue and hole in the plot, even more prominent than the other millions of holes that I found.  I never even found out the objective of the main antagonist. At least, I THINK he\u2019s the main antagonist\u2026 I mean, he only shows in two episodes\u2026 That\u2019s an issue. And then, half way through the anime, they introduce\u2026 angels? I didn\u2019t get that, either. Maybe I\u2019m just not good at understanding these kinds of things, but the story was definitely overall confusing with too many plot elements and rough transitions b/w Religion and Science.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI thought that the art for the fight scenes was genius. Whether it was magic or Esper ability, all of the powers were perfectly designed and made as fun to watch as possible. The setting of Academy City was also one of my favorites. The design of the characters, though, didn\u2019t meet my expectations. I mean, I\u2019m sorry for having such high expectations, but for an anime with beautiful art style in everything else, you\u2019d think the art would be really cool for the characters. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s BAD, I\u2019m just saying it wasn\u2019t as exciting as expected. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite music element of the anime was the first opening. It had a nice, techno, mysterious tone to it and I believe it fit the anime really well, while being really catchy. The OSTs were pretty cool, too. The second opening and the endings were kind of boring though; also not living up to my expectations. Not bad, overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weaker aspects of the anime; there was definitely a problem in the character design. I mean, there were characters that I liked, such as the main protagonist, Tohma, and the Index\u2019s two friends from the English Church. Index, I believe, had the behavior of a supporting character. She played no significant roles in the story except at the beginning, where Tohma just saved her. She would\u2019ve been a good comic relief if the author didn\u2019t try so hard to make her important, which failed miserably.  Plus, even though she\u2019s a possible love interest, she\u2019s, like, 8 years old, while Tohma\u2019s in high school. I found that a weakening element in the characters. And speaking of love interests, there seem to be way too many. In fact, there seem to be too many characters to start out with. It really ruins t for me because I have to remember all of their names and some of them are just way too insignificant to be a good element to add to the story. And don\u2019t get me started on all of the MISAKA\u2019s\u2026 Oh, Dear God. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, let me see, aside from the first arc, the rest of the anime only confused and bored me on many occasions. I mean, there were other good parts of the plot, but there were just so many holes in such a good idea for a story, that it ruined an opportunity for fame. The subliminal messaging was hard to catch, but I got it eventually b/w all of the pretty actions scenes. Seriously, the anime\u2019s action episodes were my favorites, but they weren\u2019t enough to make up for the clusterfuck plot. Sorry. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

            "content": "Before i start this review; Names will be changed (character names) in this review. The main character will be named Leo.\r\nOn one fateful day, Leo meets a nurse named Amy, who is a 10? (12?,14?) year old nun who Leo decides to protect because he is awesome like that. However, the relevance of Amy to the plot in the episodes quickly degenerate after her major story arc, which is really disappointing. Amy still sticks around with Leo because Amy is under the impression that Leo is loaded (he isn't really, the show tells us enough times). Other notable characters are \r\nMike (a less-than-friendly mage whotags along with Leo in a few episodes) \\n\r\nVictor (he is named Victor because he pretty much wins every fight he gets into. His story branches off from Leo's in a later episode)\\n\r\nNicola (notable because she continues to interact with Leo throughout the series and she also gets her own story/show)\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you do not like the character Leo I strongly suggest that you drop/stay away from this show because he is literally everywhere in this show. I think he doesn't appear at all only in one of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are there to (poorly) explain the plot and how science/magic works in the universe depicted. Or they are just crazy ass villains. The villains are not given much motives or characterization and basically disappear after their time is done\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the plot, the conflict between science and magic is never really explained enough in this show. It would be best to assume that the two sides are natural rivals like Tom and Jerry (the cartoon) when you are watching this series. Also there was something about the Catholic Church in this anime and how Amy is connected to them. Conflict between only the Catholic Church and the city of science known as Academy City seems like a possibility as well. However, the story in this show is split into mini arcs, with Leo appearing to be neutral sided as he goes around saving victims of science and magic.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series was not the greatest that you will see but it cannot be faulted. Character designs looked pretty boss and backgrounds were cool as well.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the music will not be the best thing that you will ever hear but the two opening themes and ending theme were pretty damn catchy. Voice acting suited the characters well but you might find Amy's voice to be a bit high pitched and annoying (maybe).\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems with the confusing plot, I enjoyed this show. I guess it was because the show didn't try to do too much, there were some comedic moments but there weren't too many to distract from the seriousness that this show generally exerts to the audience. The world that this anime was set in and the mysterious nature of the conflict between science and magic also interested me and kept me watching through until the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this show to anyone who doesn't really mind a confusing plot or poorly characterized villains. This show likely has enough to keep you interested until the end.",

            "content": "A Review of Toaru Majutsu no Index (A Certain Magical Index):\r\nOkay so I'm just gonna come right out of the gate and preface this by saying this show is one of the best I have seen to date. In fact, I'd go as far to say I haven't seen a show this enticing, this interesting since Durarara!! or even Code Geass. The weird thing is that I can't tell you why I loved this show so much. Yes, I'm going to explain below why this show is so good, but honestly, I felt it just struck a really good cord with me. And that's reallyamazing, especially given the fact that this is only the first season we're talking about.\\n\\n\r\nImagine living in a world where the concept of ESPers and Magic actually exists. Yeah, big whoop, it's not like anime hasn't gone there before. I bet you're even assuming that the main protagonist is an OP bad*** that handles every situation with an easy MacGuffin or a Deus Ex Machina sort of event.\\n\r\nYou would be oh so wrong.\\n\r\nTouma is the exact opposite. He's literally, on a scale of 1-5 with ESPer abilities, a 0. He only lives in Academy City because he possesses the SLIGHTEST amount of psychic ability. He is also doomed to be the victim of ridiculously bad luck. So what makes Touma special as a protagonist, I hear you ask? Simply the one power he has: Imagine Breaker. With his right hand, he is able to cancel out any magic or psychic power. ANY AT ALL. And this actually leads to some interesting points of conflict and battle scenes that don't go as one would normally think.\\n\\n\r\nAcademy City is filled with a hodgepodge of interesting characters. These include your typical tsundere's, token lolis, etc. However, The fact that these tropes are prevalent in many of these characters doesn't bother me. The reason is because they're all so damn memorable. Sure, some characters get way more screen time than other by a long shot, but even characters that are in 2 or 3 episodes have a very significant impact on the show overall. The one downside I will say is that, while this show has amazing male characters in the forms of Touma, Stiyl, and, god bless him, Accelerator, the show is female-dominated. Now, before I get the feminist comments, what I mean to say is simply that the harem is indeed existent, though not to the extent of many other shows (cough SAO). Even so, I enjoyed the female characters to great lengths, every single one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is really good. It's not Fate/Zero. It's not K-Project. It's not even the Irregular. But the show still shows good quality in its animation and the fight scenes, especially those involving magic and psychic powers (so basically all of them) are amazing to watch. Sound design is also quite good, however, I didn't really pick up on certain tracks, which is something I often look out for. There were no \"Blumenkranz\"es or \"Glassy Sky\"s, but nothing stood out as bad, so that's a plus. I will, however, make note of the great opening themes. They just feel so unique and fitting to the show and it's quite nice to hear something so fresh.\\n\\n\r\nWith each new arc, A Certain Magical Index, in just the first season alone, is a compelling watch. The villains are fresh, the storylines vary, even going so far as to have a previous villain be the central character for several episodes, and it all feels tied together very well while still having different arcs. I loved watching this show and I already plan on starting the second season right after this review. But for now, the positives and negatives.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Best characters in a show I've watched in a while\\n\r\n+Great opening themes\\n\r\n+Quality animation and decent sound\\n\r\n+Unique take on a common concept\\n\r\n+Each episode begins with a recap, which I found helpful for whenever I would go for a few days without watching an episode\\n\r\n+The dub. Holy **** the dub is outstanding\\n\r\n+Varying plots and arcs, while still feeling connected as one show\\n\r\n+Accelerator and Stiyl. 'Nuff said\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-The title is kinda misleading, as the character Index usually (though not always) takes a side-role\\n\r\n-The ever-growing-harem aspect (though it is handled better than other shows)\\n\\n\r\nGoddang, this show quickly became one of my favorites. I still can't convey how good of a show it was to me through writing, so just go watch it. You will laugh. You will get emotional. You will enjoy almost every second of this show. At least the first season. Idk, maybe the second season tanked (doubtful)\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why I give A Certain Magical Index a 10/10",

Toaru Majutsu No Index was a very average show for me, with a few memorable characters. Actually, to express the way I feel about this show, I even think a few bullet points would suffice.\r\nTime should be an absolute judge. What will I remember from this show, a year from now? Well, after asking myself, I'd say:\r\n+The opening themes. Nice songs, nicely done.\r\n+A bunch of cute girls. Some very cute, at that. In fact, Biri Biri turned out to bea blessing for this show.\\n\r\n+Some antagonists. Ever dreamt about being someone who should never lose, to anyone (unless your script writer strangely decides so)? Live out your fantasies with TMNI! There's two for you to choose. A guy that changes the vectors of anything he touches, and a guy who can turn his thoughts into reality! Oh yeah.\\n\r\n+Some things that made me laugh. Angel Fall. The sisters' speech. Index biting onto..that guy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I will not remember:\\n\r\n-The ending themes.\\n\r\n-That guy. The protagonist. The definition of boring. His face is boring, his punch line is boring, his personality is boring. His abilities? He punches people. Yeah. He wins against people that borderline godhood, who should slaughter him in a second, by throwing a punch at them. And don't think he's on Ippo's, or some other boxer's level. He ends the fights with a single punch, because he can. Even when, he can't. Oh wait, I forgot. He has the ability to negate any kind of power his right hand touches. Yeah, I have a very original idea for a protagonist too. He has the ability to defeat bad guys.\\n\r\n-Any sort of dramatic climax reached with the ending. Err, if it was there, I just missed it. The \"final\" arc, could easily exchange places with some of the previous arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about it. I didn't really have a bad time watching this show. It didn't leave me with anything to think about, either. Nothing too elaborate, story-wise. A light hearted, average show, with likeable characters. Would I watch the second season, given that there's a spin-off if I wanted to get more of Misaka? Only if someone I know insisted I should.",

            "content": "A Certain Magical Index \u2013 Dubbed\r\nStory 2/10\r\nStory? What story? There are plenty of ideas in this series waiting to be executed but never are throughout the entire run of this series. This show is basically about a guy who goes around risking his life for complete strangers, all of which happen to be female moeblobs, for no explicit reason. It\u2019s basically a harem series that pretends to be something else and, in the process, accomplishes nothing. Everything - from the action, lore and overall setting of the anime - is basically meaningless. All of it is secondary to Touma, the MC, showing how much ofa selfless hero he is and how he cares about random girls he meets by risking his life to save them. The girls he saves add themselves to his harem along the way. Unlike a traditional harem series, you won\u2019t find any romance, romantic build-ups, misunderstandings, rivalries or anything typical of a harem series here. All-in-all this show has proven to be a drag that went nowhere and then expects you to follow it further into any sequels. I initially wanted to drop this show after the 2nd episode because it demonstrated, based on the bland characters and lack of focus on an overarching plot, that it would be a long drag to nowhere. However, being that there is considerable hype surrounding this series, I decided to drudge through to the end in hopes of being proven wrong, but alas, that was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nArt is alright. Animations in fight scenes are ok. It\u2019s a shame though, that the action scenes themselves didn\u2019t make good use of the animation since the fight scenes are rather boring because the MC is basically a 1-trick pony that goes around punching enemies with his right hand (since his right hand negates all magic and stuff). You have all these cool abilities that would make for a good fight but the MC\u2019s power just negates it all and makes it meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5\\n\r\nI really think they could\u2019ve done better in the sound department. There were some instances where build-up music would\u2019ve fit in, but there was none implemented. A lot of arrangements felt random and unrelated to the tone of events going on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1\\n\r\nThe characters are all trash and have no depth to them since everything revolves around the MC and the MC sucks.  \\n\r\nTouma is so ridiculous as a character. He\u2019s supposed to play the part of an unlikely hero but it\u2019s so obviously forced and fake.  In execution, he\u2019s an irrational, pompous harem lead who randomly encounters girls and risks his life to save them despite not even understanding the circumstances surrounding them and knowing next to nothing about them other than the few minutes of conversation that they may have had once they initially met. He\u2019s so ridiculous that at one point in the series he more or less says, and I paraphrase, \u201cI risk my life for complete strangers (who all happen to be female moeblobs) for no reason.\u201d So yeah, he has no reasoning behind his actions, it just is and you have to accept it or you\u2019re wrong. In fact, that\u2019s how most arguments are settled in this series, whoever is the strongest gets to decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and Touma happens to be the strongest so screw everyone else\u2019s reasons (not that any in-depth reasons are given for anything to begin with.) As if he weren\u2019t ridiculous enough, early on in the series Touma gets amnesia while trying to \u2018save\u2019 a girl. The ridiculous part about it is that the amnesia lasts throughout the run of the series and, for no explicit reason, rather than being honest and letting people know that he has amnesia and doesn\u2019t remember them, he decides to pretend that he remembers people. Brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nIndex is a useless moeblob who only uses her powers a handful of times throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nMisaka is supposedly an incredibly powerful character but we never get to see anything to back that up. \\n\\n\r\nAll the antagonists have no depth and no purpose other than to make Touma look good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2\\n\r\nIt was hard not zoning out through parts of this series since everything about it is so meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3\\n\r\nThis show would\u2019ve been better suited as a Harem/Comedy, with more focus on those aspects instead of trying, and failing, to be a \u2018cool\u2019 Action/Magic show.\\n",

            "content": "I have been writing more reviews on anime I think are underappreciated and I think No Index takes the cake in that category. Lots to say so let's jump right in.\r\nThe main genre of this anime are Romance, action, and...magic? Comedy? There's so much going on but let's just say it's comedy for convenience. These will be assessed at the end, now for the other junk.\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nOkay so to be honest this was the first anime I watched that was not English dubbed, like the first ever. I watched it back when I first started watching anime in my senior year of HS (like 4years ago),and it is the reason I still watch today.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is still my favorite anime of all time. This is in no small part due to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is in good old-fashioned arc-mode so the main plot changes a lot, but one thing that remains constant is Touma's struggle with his lost memories. I am sure that the anime gets criticized a lot for how he handles this but I will touch on that later. Anyway, the memory-los part of the story I believe is handled better than most memory-loss anime and it plays in pretty nicely with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the first season is more of a \"meet the characters\" season, but I personally thought all of the arcs were really cool and I thoroughly enjoy watching them again...and again......and again.\\n\\n\r\nSorry I do not go more into detail but it is honestly hard for me to put how great the story is into words. But the Sisters arc is an incredible example of how this type of anime should go. One of the best arcs right there, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nI don't really pay attention to the art as most of it looks the same to me, 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nSo normally I review Sound and Art the same way, I say I don't care about them then I move on with my life. But No Index is one of the few anime where the music in it makes it just that much better. The intros are all amazing and the fight music is absolutely perfect, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10000000000/10, but 10/10 for the sake of being realistic)\\n\r\nTouma, to this day, is one of my favorite protagonists. Something about the combination of his voice (great job by the voice actor btw, absolutely perfect job), the way he acts, jut everything is amazing. This is also where I am coming back to the memory loss stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead:\\n\\n\r\nSo Touma loses his memories in like the second episode of the show (actually might be 4th?, idk, been awhile), but he refuses to tell anyone. I am sure he receives a lot of shit for this, but honestly I think it is great. It always sucks in an anime when a great moment happens and a character goes \"just one question, do I know you?\" Touma is smarter than that. His doctor tells him his memories are most likely gone, then all of a sudden this adorable little munchkin (Index) comes into his room to say hi and is so happy to see him okay. So instead of breaking her fucking heart, he lies and acts like he knows her. And soon enough he gets to know her again (remember he only knew her for like 4 days before the accident anyway). It is honestly a very brave and very awesome thing for a protagonist to do and he handles it so well throughout the series even though he is struggling with it internally the whole time.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto my favorite female protagonist of all time. No, not Index, although she is cute and a great character (same for Himeragi). I am of course talking about Misaka Mikoto. Honestly I have tried to get 4 of my friends to watch this anime, 1 stopped watching just because she lost interest in anime for awhile, one stuck through it to the end and loved it, and two stopped watching....mostly because of Mikoto.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly she takes some time to grow on you, but Mikoto is honestly one of the best tsunderes there is. She is not one of those \"i didn't do it for you...baka!\" types, but she is the \"I know why I am always helping you, thinking of you, etc. but it is too embarrassing because I always fuck up when I try to interact with you\" types. And do not act like you do not know exactly the type of anime girl I am talking about. She crushes on him so hard and it's adorable! I have honestly watched the festival arc like 10 times just to see her get all red-faced when he is forced to tackle her because he thinks he's protecting her. There is a reason she got a spin-off people. She's amazing (and the second season of her anime, Kagaku no railgun, is amazing too). \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are good too, 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nMy anime list on this web site is not up=to-date, but I used to have a rankings list of the 300+ anime I have watched (not a ton I know, but I'm a college student so back off!) and No Index has never moved from the #1 spot of that list. I just love every arc so much, it almost brings a tear to my eye.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\r\nSo normally this is where I break down the anime by genre, give my score and composition for each, but I am gonna make it really simple this time:\\n\\n\r\nRomance:\\n\r\nFucking amazing. Mikoto best girl.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\r\nComposition:  doesn't fucking matter.\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nGod that fight scene with Accelerator, fucking awesome. Love the fights in this so goddamn much.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery other genre:\\n\r\nThis anime proves that anime is a form of art.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. Please watch the entire first season, I guarantee you will be pining for the second and hoping for a third.",

            "content": "He is the poor misunderstood high-school student, just trying to do the right thing. She is the hyper-active child nun who likes to chew on people.\r\nToaru Majutsu no Index didn't really spark anything within me. While I did enjoy the concepts they were presenting me, they were way to short lived and disconnected to be properly enjoyed, which really hindered its potential. While I can't speak for other people, I think this anime lacked a proper double checking before being pushed out to us. I say this because It suffers from a number of inexcusable issues that really killed my experience. All of which, Iwill go into now...\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\r\nToaru Majutsu no Index takes place in a world where science and religion both have a fantasy element to them. Scientists have \"Espers\" and the faithful have spells and relics. The only real difference between these two is that the spells and relics have historical background while the Espers are just... there. Typically, the two are pitted against each other, because for some reason we think they are destined rivals, and now we get to follow along.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with dear old Touma, who, for reasons that are never discussed, disputed or considered, has the ability to nullify the powers of both sides. The way they initially portray this could fool you into thinking that Touma is some sort of super-buff vigilante who just lays low. Nah. Instead he's an incompetent delinquent who spends more time getting into compromising situations than actually paying attention to his ability.\\n\\n\r\nYou will also find that the story is split into two sides, the science side, and the religious side. Now, these two sides never mix because each arc is either about one or the other because of reasons that I would guess are related to the anime's desire to hold out on us. The only thing that stays the same is the location and Touma which really damages the animes ability to have a cohesive plot.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about cohesive plots shall we? There is NONE. The first few episodes are all about Index but after she gets someones fist down her throat she just gets tossed aside into a supporting/ comedic relief role... despite having her name in he f*cking title. Every story after that is around 5 episodes long and rushes through everything like its our last day on earth. This results in numerous stories, all with no relation, being thrown at you for no real reason and with no evidence of overarching development. I think the issue is that Toaru Majutsu no Index just wanted to be longer than it was. Its  arcs and style of story telling resemble that of a fighting anime, with 20-30 episode arcs being crammed into 5 or 6 with no character development or pause for breath.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\r\nI very rarely give these two a higher rating than story, that said, It doesn't even deserve to be on par with it. The art and sound can be lackluster in some places and leave a lot to be desired. The intros are oddly matrixey despite having a generally supernatural feel to them. If you ever end up watching this anime, you won't do it for either of these two, trust me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nSomething I can get behind is the characters in this anime. The cast is usually quite female heavy, especially around Touma, which provides many opportunities for your typical Japanese love spats and awkward 'perv moments', which set a decent comedic tone that is regularly reinforced with more of the same. The characters themselves are somewhat colorful, as I mentioned, Index has a likable personality along with a tendency to chew on Touma. However there are some, how do I say... Cliche characters, especially on the religious side of the anime although I think that can be somewhat overlooked thanks to their consistent personalities (at least whenever they get the chance to express them). \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nI think I would have enjoyed this more if it was more spread out. It may just be my opinion but I honestly think that longer format would have done this show a world of good in comparison to its short and rushed approach. That said, I won't deny that it made me laugh in places, although some jokes do stop being funny after a while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nI think if you are into the whole religious war thing then give it a shot. Likewise, if you are into casual, directionless anime then give it a shot as well. Me on the hand, I'll sit through season 2, and if thats any better I will move on to A Certain Scientific Railgun... We will have to see though...",

            "content": "This is an anime to watch when you aren't really sure what to do with yourself. You have time to waste, and nothing better to waste it on. Although Index is in the title, she barely has anything to do with the story, this continues throughout the series. I am not sure what the point of having her is at all. Touma is the whitest knight in all the land, and it gets old. It has gotten so old as to be eye-rollingly expected now that I have moved onto the third series. Why am I watching this if I hate it so much? Idon't hate it, I just don't really like it a lot. There is very little about it that is able to hold my attention, which means it is great to put on as background noise or when I am painting my nails. As the series progresses, it becomes almost entirely fan service and the plot is more and more jumpy and confusing. It is almost impossible to become immersed in the story. The art is decent. The sound is fine, nothing amazing. My husband has gotten tired of hearing the noise it makes when Touma uses imagine breaker, \"they must have gotten a good deal on that sample\". On the note of the famous right hand, it is nonsensical. If his right hand can negate his luck simply by virtue of being attached to him... you know what else is attached to his right hand? The rest of his fucking body. He should be able to tap something with his toe and use imagine breaker. As I write this I am debating lowering my rating to 5.. and I am questioning why I have continued to watch this for as long as I have. Ah yes, because there is nothing else to watch right now, and I have watched enough that I am at that place where I feel like I might as well finish it. Foolish.",

He uses this mysterious power to help save his friends, nevertheless getting hospitalized in the process almost every time. Even then he's not afraid to do it again.\r\nKamijou Touma's bravery has ended up making him one of the most popular Harem Kings in anime. With an astonishing number of about slightly fewer than 10,000 members. He does not realize it but, he just considers himself unlucky due to the skirmishes he endsup in with most of them.\\n\\n\r\nTouma's heroism also gave him a unique title. He is a problem with one of the most dangerous people in Academy City. Being a foreseeable threat in the future he is constantly bombarded with dangerous enemies everywhere he goes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime has become one of my favorites and highly suggested.

            "content": "Overall, this is a waste of what could have been an amazing story. If you read the other reviews you will quickly see the pattern that though the premise and idea are great, the execution was off. Most of the cast is static and half the story is terrible. It tries to do two genres (magic and science), but fails to blend them and only does the science side any good. It does have some highlights, though.\r\nI would watch it, at least the beginning and most of the science arcs as these are the best parts with the most development.\r\nThe sisters arc introduces the twobest characters in the series (they are even ranked this way on Animelist), Misaka and Accelerator. If you watch the Railgun S spin-off, you'll see this arc even more in depth. This is the best arc with the greatest and most original plot and fight scenes. It is the diamond in a series full of coal.\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is your normal idiot that rarely understands the situation he is in and tries to be a bad-ass, but fails fairly often.\\n\r\nThe art is phenomenal, I even really enjoyed some of the architecture in the city (something that I normally do not notice in anime). Great music.\\n\r\nSo overall, I suggest watching the science arcs and ignoring the magic ones, just as the anime does.",

            "content": "About this anime- This anime takes place in an supernatural world, where people with supernatural powers exist. These people are called Espers. Pretty simple, right? Since most citizens are students, Espers are put in levels to classify their power's extent, like the level you get in an online game by gaining EXP. Now, you can read the full synopsis from the actual anime description. \r\n( Does not contain spoilers) \r\nStory- The main problem with this anime is the moment overwhelm as a person starts this series. \" this anime is too long\" \" this seems very boring\" \" this gets very complicated\" are somecomments I've heard from people that started this series. Yes, this anime series does contain dreary plot elements and parts that may keep you away from this series, additionally the amount of prosper needed to be fulfilled covered up most of the series's flat plot events. \\n\\n\r\nArt- A positive point from this anime is the art style. For an anime that aired in 2008, it really does a good job by showing us an overall well-thought out character design. On a personal note: some characters confuse the audience by giving us an inaccurate age by appearance. Like seriously, take a look at this: http://otakumeme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tumblr_m9a1bk5fIR1reecllo1_1280.jpg \\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound track is simply great. It amplifies each situation and gives it a special meaning. However, these sound tracks aren't always present at times. Basically, it can be interpreted as limited. P.S: the second opening is one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Main protagonist: dense, your typical high school main protagonist. \\n\r\n               Heroin #1: a Loli that acts like a foodie, tsun level: 100\\n\r\n               Heroin #2:  An ultra middle school tsundere, tsun level: 999\\n\r\n               Heroin #3: an emotionless kuudere? tsun level: 0\\n\r\n               Heroin #4: a forty year-old teacher that tries to act mature but acts like an ten year old, tsun level: 88, This probably gives you a clear idea of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime was good for me mainly because of the shipping between each characters but i guess it wasn't bad for a while, it isn't bad to watch in your spare time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime might have an intimidating start of plot details at first but it gets easier to understand over time. The characters aren't fit to be given the title \"unique\" but i guess they aren't underdeveloped or irritating. If you have the time to enjoy this anime, watch it at your pace. Enjoy the sights and be sure to ship each character with one another ;). \\n\\n",

There will be spoilers although nothing major just the fact that technically a review is a spoiler :P.\r\nI'll go through the categories adding in also what I liked and disliked (note that I'm bias in favour of this anime because I like it.)\r\nStory: This anime is praised for a brilliant concept, science vs magic with esp powers as the norm within the city of 80% students. You will hear that this concept is delivered poorly, I can't say thatbecause I think that the reason i love the concept is because this show delivers it so well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm not Picasso but it's nice \\n\\n\r\nSound: The tracks make the fights seem epic however I think that beyond that the music is just good enough the rest of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: These guys make the show, I understand that if you wanted to you could attribute them to roles like 'typical hero' and 'tsundere'  ect, However that doesn't change that by the end of watching the anime you will have a favourite and people you like and people you don't care for and they will be unique to you. Season 1 is about the characters secretly and most of the time they are very real in terms of what they do and who they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Enjoyment stems from the arc payoffs and social interactions. \\n\\n\r\nMy notes: I love this anime, I recommend it highly. The first arc only seems complicated don't worry. The world that gets painted from this anime as a whole is awesome and there will be times where it makes you feel on top of the world. Also if you're wondering whether or not this series gets better or worse as you progress it gets a lot better, season 2 is ranked 200 places higher for a reason but they are both very good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Character driven fantasy story with a comprehensive world setting. There are also cute girls.",

What if one livein a world where magic and science co-existed ? How would they react to each other ? What can we anticipate ? And so Touma is tossed in between the crossfire between the two powers ( and they get really cataclysmic in the series ) as he discovers an unlikely person on his doorstep one day. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I found the pacing of the story pretty slow and painful. They can spend up to half an episode explaining how magicians and churches are linked together in a network coming after Index who happens to be a walking library of ancient grimoires, and yet her importance becomes near zero in certain arcs of the story (especially when 'BiriBiri' is around, woot ). 'Convoluted' is perhaps the perfect word to describe how they lay out the story to the viewers. Not insanely difficult to comprehend, but just confusing at times. Nevertheless, even villains need a break from being the warmongers they are, right ? So let us just leave it at that and let Touma entertain us.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation, as well as the sound is commendable. BGMs are very well-suited during its fighting scenes, especially when in the instances where Touma faces Misaka Mikoto ( nicknamed 'biribi' ). The voices also suit the characters marvelously. Though, the only thing I find not to my liking is some of the obvious auto-tuning in the series OP and ED themes. tsk tsk. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are memorable, though there seems to be a trend for main characters to uphold morality and be a paragon throughout the whole story, putting others before himself (Touma). Despite being the champion of misfortune, Touma is quirky and redeemable as a main character, not to mention his unique special ability too. Index on the other hand.. err.. is what I would call 'a pain in the ass', especially to those who have watched/ read the series. No joke, but we have to compromise for greater good and a major stakeholder in this tale, right, Touma ? Good.\\n\r\n And of course, Misaka Mikoto deserves special as the compulsory tough-as-nails tsundere that's essential in anime nowadays ! Attractive and unique to me? yes, but to each his / her own, I must say. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the production values (including character design ) are what warrants this series a good rating. The story is a rough ride into a world of science and magic, but still quite enjoyable if you manage to last through it all.\\n\\n\r\npeace\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, after watching \"Toaru Majutsu no Index\" (TMNI) aka \"A certain magical Index\" a while ago I tried to reflect on what I thought of the show - and pretty much came out blank. Now when I had some time to think about it, some things came clear - I did not enjoy TMNI very much. It had it\u00b4s moments, stronger parts and some pretty interesting characters. So what was the problem then? I will get down to that now. First I should mention that I often judges a series when I have seen all of it, but I\u00b4m still not shore if I\u00b4m gonnawatch TMNI second season, so I base the score of this first part alone.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe problem I had with the story was a few things. The first was that the story many times felt episodic and loss of track. And the episodicness didn\u00b4t feel as smooth as it could have been to me. We gets some glimpses of something potentially bigger (plot wise), but it got to little time and fell out of focus. That in it\u00b4s self was a shame, because those parts seemed pretty intriguing and interesting - I would have liked to see more of those. The second thing was some things felt rushed, overlooked or under explored. They managed to build up some tension and what came out in the end was many times pretty beige. The story isn\u00b4t totally bad, It has some interesting components, as the tech users system and it powers, and the governmental experiments. These parts I actually enjoyed quite a bit. The magic use and the magic world didn\u00b4t get so much detailed screen time so much of it\u00b4s functions are still unknown to me. We do have some nice and cool action scenes, that highlighted the story for me. I probably should give TMNI II a chance so it has a chance to redeem it self.. maybe a dark rainy week. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is actually pretty great. For a 2008/2009 production from J.C Staff, it\u00b4s very good. Nice character designs, detailed city panels, and nice light- and color settings. Movements and power/fighting techniques are showcased very well. Weapon, tech and magic attacks are well displayed. Wouldn\u00b4t go so far and call the art and character designs \"original\" or unique, but we get some new types of faces and body languages.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nMostly the reason for a 6, is that I after a short amount of time already have forgotten about the soundtrack, OP and ED. But I do remember some dark piano influenced music and a big part hardcore house. It worked with the scenes, and often catches the atmosphere as well. I personally didn\u00b4t dig it, but that\u00b4s just my opinion. The two OP\u00b4s, if I remember right, are pretty decent but did not really get to me. They do showcases some meetings of characters and future fights, so if you don\u00b4t was be spoiled at all - you may wan\u00b4t to skip those.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nOk, it\u00b4s with the characters my real problem lays with TMNI, the story isn\u00b4t that bad as it may sound it is, according to me. The problem is that I almost detest the shows main characters, Index herself and Touma. Don\u00b4t get me wrong, TMNI do contain some pretty interesting and cool characters, but they get way to little screen time. But Index and Touma.. Index is pretty much a very immature young teenager, who\u00b4s often so lost she always end up in major danger and gonna be saved. Index has some tremendous powers hidden inside her, and then she uses them her whole persona changes and she becomes a total badass. To bad that not happens to often in the show, I liked that version of Index much more then the version we get stuck with most of the shows. She\u00b4s stupid, annoying and waaay over rated. How did she end up with having so many people loving her to death? Can\u00b4t get my head around that. Touma isn\u00b4t much better. He feels.. really undeep. Can\u00b4t describe it in any another way. He\u00b4s has no real motivation for acting or doing like he does, it\u00b4s more like \"I don\u00b4t know why, but I won\u00b4t to save you\"  kind of thing. And often with out having a clue of have to do it. I have more reasons to not like Tomas character, but it would spoil a lot, so I will not get into them. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters I did enjoy quite a bit on the other hand. Accelerator, Misaka, Misaka Misaka (last order), and Toumas teacher Koumoe I did like a lot. But as I mention before, they not get nearly as much screen time as they deserve. Accelerator is starting out as as villain with pretty psycho traits, and I still ended up like him many timed more then any of the MC\u00b4s. The two episodes that fleshed him out was by far the best in TMNI. Kanzaki is still much a mystery, but what have seen she is totally badass. Everything from her attitude, character desgins and sword magic are right down awesome. But I haven\u00b4t seen her much in this first season. And Misaka Misaka (last order) are also a really likable character. From the they she talk\u00b4s to the way she analyzes things. For these character and the hope that is more time for them in TMNI II, it may be worth to check TMNI II out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nMost of the time I felt my thoughts move away from the screen when watching it. It wasn\u00b4t so bad that I didn\u00b4t wan\u00b4t to finish it, but I didn\u00b4t fell eager either. So for my some parts was enjoyable and a bigger part.. njaaa..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn\u00b4t feel for most of the character and wanted to strangle Index in ever other episode. But some parts was pretty good and showed potential to something better. The art and animation was nice for the eyes and when some characters did get their screen time, it was good. Overall so didn\u00b4t TMNI blow me away in any way, everthing from the school setting, all girls falls in love with Touma, and everybody wan\u00b4t to save Index so much. So for me it was mediocre as a stand alone first season of \"A certain magical Index\". \\n",

            "content": "I loved this series, with its insane characters and the insane powers. With the battle between Mages and Physics kept at bay, with a time of peace, the threat is once again is looming in the horizon. Toma, one of my favorite characters ever, is a unique character. He is attracts all the trouble the world can POSSIBLY throw at someone. The only problem that I saw, was that Toma became too adapted to this life style of fighting giants, and magic spells, and fighting amongst his fellow physics. They seemed to be trying to me make him into this all mighty image of abad ass. Also, the ending of this season(or at least i hope season) was SUPER unsatisfying. Cliffhangers are fine, but leaving it in the middle of an arc is a big no. It like having a cliff with a thin canvas, The area looks safe to run along, but the ground collapses beneath....",
