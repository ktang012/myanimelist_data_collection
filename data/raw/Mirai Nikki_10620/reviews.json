            "content": "Notice: this review will contain a few spoilers. I'll mark them but if you haven't watched this yet, proceed with caution. Sorry about that.\r\nSurvival games have always been one of my favorite kinds of stories. I just love them. So naturally, when I heard about Mirai Nikki's premise, I was greatly looking forward to it. Unfortunately, after an excellent first episode, this series began to get worse and worse; by the end of it all, it had become nothing but a huge disappointment.\r\nLet's begin with the positive aspects of this show. The art and animation in Mirai Nikki are, for the most part, rather good,but nothing very impressive. As for character designs, it's pretty hit-and-miss. Some characters look OK, while others are so ridiculous it makes the anime seem/feel less serious than it should be, which is NOT a good thing for a thriller/mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. Most of the tracks are somewhat memorable and fit their scenes well. The OPs and EDs are also very nice, with the first OP being particularly awesome. I never skipped them. Voice acting-wise, everyone does a solid, consistent job, except for Yuno's seiyuu. I'm sorry, but her voice was annoying and hearing that infamous \"Yukki!\" every god damn minute was painful.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the bad stuff. While the premise is amazing, the story & script are very poorly written. Thing is, Mirai Nikki is a shounen trying (and failing) to be a seinen; thus, it lacks the maturity and depth needed to handle the kind of story it offers. Many questions are left unanswered, some of the writing choices are just plain stupid, half of the characters have a very low IQ and, for a mystery, there aren't that many twists, and those the anime DOES have are often predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole concept of using Future Diaries to outsmart opponents in deadly, tense battles is BARELY explored, plus the battles themselves seldom involve complexity. When you've got tools as powerful as those, you'd think there'd be gambits just piling up on each other, but no. Many battles are over within a minute and are so basic it's insulting. Speaking of insulting, this show has a nasty tendency to have its world just forget about some of the big events related to the diary holders. Normally the media would be all over a series of bombings, massacres, etc... but here? Nah, it's just Tuesday again. It's astonishing how everyone can easily get away from anything.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this anime is its bad habit of throwing in bits of humor in the middle of serious moments. It really kills the atmosphere and it's not funny. Even in the more lighthearted scenes it's not funny. Since we're talking about the atmosphere, have I mentioned that some details in crucial moments are overlooked, which obliterates the immersion? Empty hospitals, incompetent cops, silent bystanders...it's the little things that can make or break the mood. A shame, really, because the anime IS able to create a good, creepy atmosphere at times (ex.: the end of episode 3).\\n\\n\r\nRemember what I said about there being a lot of predictable twists? I kinda lied. The biggest twist in the whole story, which unfolds in the last few episodes, took me by surprise. Did it make sense? Well, yes, at least until the anime began to blatantly make shit up on the spot. Did it answer a few questions? For sure. Did it raise even more questions - most of which remain unanswered - and present to us an INCREDIBLY STUPID twist later? OH YES.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the worst part of it all. The characters. If you're already angry at me, stop reading because I will not be gentle.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters we have the male protagonist, Yukiteru (or just Yuki). This guy. Let me tell you something about this guy: he might just be one of the worst written characters I have ever seen. No hyperbole there. Not because he's a wimp 95% of the time - I can understand why. No-one normal would stay frosty after being dragged into a survival game full of maniacs. So why is he so bad then? It's because he's absurdly inconsistent. Most selective memory of all time, gullible when not paranoid (never with the correct timing), ability to forgive that defies common sense and, later on, he can't even settle on a personality (which seems to run in the family). Worst part is, his personality shift happens suddenly; he gets almost no development for 18 or so episodes then BAM! complete 180. If you're going to change a character's attitude, make sure it isn't baffling and that it sticks.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have our female protagonist, Yuno, the main source of yandere-ness, fanservice and body bags. THE poster girl of Mirai Nikki, to the point where she may be more popular than the show itself - just look at how many favorites she has here at MAL. The creator knew of this, so s/he made her the most complex character in the whole cast and genuinely fun to watch. Unfortunately, that complexity only really shows up in the last few episodes, so until then she's pretty much a one note character - crush, kill, Yukki!. Moreover, the yandere trait eventually wears off, meaning she can get kinda annoying afterwards, even with all the carnage she provides. If it cannot wear off for you, then Mirai Nikki will be considerably more entertaining. Either way, Yuno was a hit-or-miss character for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast - Yuki's friends and the other diary holders - is where it gets ugly. Out of the former group, the ONLY truly memorable character (and, might I add, one of the few characters in this anime that I liked) is the intelligent Akise. His personality and abilities are a perfect match for this kind of story, which is a shame because he didn't get enough screen time. The other three, despite getting some things accomplished, end up being inept at almost everything, to the point that Akise pretty much has to carry the team.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other diary holders...just where do I begin? For starters, they're pretty much all insane or very dangerous individuals, except for maybe 2 of them; that alone raises a pretty important question: \"why did Deus even consider letting one of those crazy bastards be his successor?\". Another problem is that some may as well have \"fodder\" written on their foreheads: most don't even last for three episodes, plus they're lucky if they get a mediocre, unpolished back story full of cheap shocks to make you feel bad for them. \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS PRESENT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHS* What kills me is that some of the diary holders are such piles of stupid writing it's absurd. I mean, one of them is a 5-year-old kid who's just as messed up as the others, somehow has access to stuff like toxic gas and who can formulate rather elaborate plans. Another is the mama bear of an orphanage composed of people who are willing to erase anyone for her - dressed as ninjas, no less. Yet another is a blind Power Rangers fanatic who dresses up as an eyeball (and who can somehow bring dolls to life. Never explained!) to fight crime. Remember, this anime takes itself seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the eleventh diary holder, the Hitler wannabe who gave Deus the idea for the diaries. Since the anime never even tries to further explore such an important character, allow me to ask some questions: how did he (or any of the diary holders) meet Deus? Why did Deus even listen to this obviously crazy man? Why future diaries, and not some kind of superpower? By the way, why is Deus decaying? What is MurMur's origin? Why did EVERY ONE of the diary holders only gun for Yuki? The questions pile up fast once the characters are taken into consideration. \\n\\n\r\nWas there not a single diary holder that I liked? The answer is yes. That would be Minene, the ninth, the series' resident internationally wanted terrorist (at the tender age of 18. Seriously). She was pretty awesome and likable for most of her screen time, which made watching her turn into a textbook tsundere even more painful. And let's not talk about her ABSOLUTELY STUPID role in the final marathon of twists. *SPOILERS END HERE*\\n\\n\r\nWhat about enjoyment? Believe me in this one: if you pay attention to the writing, Mirai Nikki will be painful. The mountain of questions, the absurd decisions that some of the characters make, etc...you just won't get a lot of breaks after the first few episodes. So what if you employ the good ol' \"turn off your brain\" strategy? It probably won't be all that enjoyable either. As I've said before, this is a shounen trying to be a seinen. You can just FEEL it try. And fail. I don't know about the rest of you, but that really kills the experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mirai Nikki is a huge disappointment. Its messy story and weak characters are simply not fit for the genre it belongs to. Even if the art was OK, even if the soundtrack was great, even if the anime has its moments and holds the potential to be enjoyable should one ignore the writing issues, it simply does not live up to the hype. I'm probably gonna get lynched by its fanbase; however, I don't really care. I'm done. I needed to get this out of my system, and there it is.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review.",

            "content": "This is the first anime review I've ever written, so hopefully everything will turn out ok. Any feed back would be appreciated as long as its constructive ;) \r\nThis review won't contain any spoilers. \r\nWhat would you do if you had something that told you the future? If you already had all the answers for an upcoming test, or knew how to avoid bully's on the way home from school? What about if it told you were going to die? \r\nMirai Nikki is a brilliant mix of a Psychological Thriller, Action, and Romance. Yuki is a boy who gains the ability to read the futurethrough his personal diary, which is awesome until he finds out that there are 11 other people who also have their own diary's and are his opponents in a competition to become a god. But thats not all bad, he happens to have someone to protect him. Enter Gasai Yuno, a cute girl who goes to Yuki's school. She also has a future diary, and it turns out she has a bit of a crush on Yuki.... and is an insane psychopathic stalker, or Yandere if you will. The story follows these two as they try to survive in the killing game they've been placed in. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i think the anime is a 10/10, but for this review i gave it a 9 because of a few small problems in the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory  9 - The story of Mirai Nikki is at its core a Romance, though its so much more than that as well. It explores how ones actions and willpower can change the future and how good people can do go insane or do terrible things because of traumatic experiences. The pacing is fairly fast, but not forced, even when there's no intense action going on, you find yourself on the edge of your seat knowing that an enemy could pop up at any time. I experienced all sort of emotions throughout the anime, fear, happiness, excitement, sadness.The shock value was insane. My reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that some of the things that happen in the anime are soo over the top ridiculous and unbelievable that i just couldn't reasonably give it a perfect score and that some of the things that happen in the last few episodes get a bit out of hand, you'll see what i mean when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10 - Don't know what all there is to say about the Art. It's not the best ive ever seen, but there's no problems with it. The action scenes are fast paced and well animated and the characters all look fine. I see no reason to dock an anime points unless the animation is so miserable that it has negative effects my viewing experience, and one of my favorite animes is Berserk, which is terribly animated. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10 - The Opening and ending themes are fantastic, and go along perfectly with the anime. The first opening theme is my favorite song of all of them and does a perfect job of maintaining the feel of the anime. The music generally goes very well with the scenes that its played over, especially when Yuno does something awesome. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10 - I would rate this higher if possible. The characters is where Mirai Nikki truly shines. Yuki is a kind of a wimp who has to rely on others to protect him, and ive seen plenty of people complain about this, but in all honesty i think that makes the anime so much better. He's a 14 year old boy thrown into a battle royal with people trying to kill him, I would probly be a bit of a wimp if that happened to me too.  He's forced to seek aid from and rely on others in order to survive. And he isnt without redeeming moments either.  All the side characters are well developed and have their pasts and motives explained in the story and a few of them are just plain awesome. All that being said, the part of this anime that got me hooked, and the reason its become one of my favorites of all time, is the female lead Gasai Yuno. She's incredibly cute, and incredibly psychopathic, and the perfect yandere. Shes also one of the most unique characters I've ever seen in an anime. Most of the psychological thrills stem from trying to figure out what the heck shes going to do next. At one moment your scared of her, another you can't help but smile at how cute something she does is, then you notice the knife in her hand and your scared of her again. Sometimes you want her to do something insane and at others your shocked about something insane shes doing. She's the selling point on the entire anime for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 - I couldn't stop watching Mirai Nikki, i watched it over the span of 2 days. And spent the entire day at work the second day anticipating what would happen in the anime after i got home. I have yet to watch an anime that kept me on the edge of my seat to such an extent as Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 - Mirai Nikki is a great and unique story, the characters are excellent especially Yuno, who is one of the most unique characters ive ever seen in an anime. Mirai Nikki is certainly worth giving a shot.",

            "content": "I'm going to tell you all a story. Once, there was a man. A man who loved trains. This man loved trains so much that every year or so he would put different things on the train and send it off for other people to see and enjoy. Sometimes he would put fruit on the train, othertimes he would put toys. All to see the end result that his precious train would deliver.\r\nOne day, said man decided to put as many fucked up things that he could find on this train. He put razors, cyanide, bombs, and even decided to mix in some sweet thingswith all of this, like boxes of sugar and a pink dress fit for a loli. He piled the train up, barely being able to fit in all of this stuff onto it, and set it off - awaiting for the end result.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, with the train being overloaded with a bunch of different shit on it, it was only natural that the man's train would crash. And crash it did. However, the man did not care. For he would see it that this trainwreck made all the way to its destination, no matter how much shit he had to pull out of his ass to make it work. And so, with everything in the train clashing into one another as the man pulled his own strings to make the train continue going (no matter how much logic it defied in the end) he eventually got the train to reach the end.\\n\\n\r\nSome people looked at the mess of the train and thought, \"Wow! Look at all of this stuff! There's knives in this train? Stuffed animals? Explosives? Books? How marvelous! What a wonderful thing this train has brought everyone!\" while others looked at the end result and knew right away what a terrible mess all of this stuff was. Rest of the town was too busy watching K-On! to care.\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the story? When you take as much random crap as you can and load it all into one train, it will crash. And if it crashes you should end it. Oh, and people like trainwrecks.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't already voted this unhelpful for the seemingly irrelevant story, I'm here to tell you that this tale was my description of \"Mirai Nikki's\" story - a trainwreck. I won't give you a rundown on what the story is about. You have the synopsis and Google for that, so I'll just get straight to the point. The story doesn't really have any idea where it's going or how it should be directed. They made sure to throw in as many psychotic characters, themes, events and mix it in to be able to attract as many viewers as possible. Seriously, you'll find everything from rape to child abandonment to feeding children grass - all to make the story and characters look like they have depth and the viewer to feel \"cool\" for watching such miscellaneous shit. The transition between events in the story doesn't flow and all seems very random at best. It's as if these events happen just because the plot demands it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story had some strong points - while the fighting scenes didn't always make the most sense or had little to no build-up, they were very entertaining to watch and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in seeing how it played out. However, the poor writing and lack of common sense in most of the story is what makes it so terrible. The plot loses all of it's purpose by the end of the show as well, which just makes everything worse. It's a good story to be mindlessly entertained, but for those of us who were paying attention you can tell just how often things failed to make sense. It was all driven off of shock value and crazy, psychological things. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of crazy, psychological things, let's talk about the characters, or as I like to call them, \"plot devices.\" Each of the character exists only for convenience of the plot and nothing more, and same goes for their past. Every diary holder, save for First & Eight, has something that makes them insane or crazy in some way or another so that way they can serve purpose to the plot. If these characters weren't all deranged or had these insane backstories than they would be of no threat. So why did a bunch of characters with messed up lives get chosen to be diary holders, and then someone like Yuki (I won't focus on the Eighth) who lives a completely normal life gets chosen as well? It doesn't add up.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, Yuki is just a normal guy thrown into a pit of madness. Many hate him, some pity him. Me? I pity the guy. You can't help but look at it realistically - he's a normal kid thrown into this survival game where everyone has some type of mental issue and is out to kill him. This doesn't make his crying and patheticness any less annoying, but it's justifiable. At the same time you can't help but wonder why Yuki was chosen to be a diary holder in the first place considering how out of place he is. Then we have Yuno, the main reason why everyone watches the show. Yandere. That's pretty much her whole personality. (save for her own fucked up past that tries to give her depth and reasoning.) Yuno is like a robot, per say - only programmed when desired to scream \"Yukii!\", act innocent, then kill people. And apparently that sells. She's a selfish, unreasonable character who's popularity is earned from her constant blushing and murdering. While she was indeed suffering from major emotional trauma, none of that justified the actions that she had towards Yuki and the people he cared about. Despite her \"love\" for Yuki, she still constantly hurt him and the friends that he loved - doing what she can to turn him against them instead of letting him be happy with both him AND his friends. She's simply an annoying character with no actual depth or personality.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other diary holders, they're mostly forgettable and run a cycle of \"appear for a few episodes, fight Yuki/Yuno (mostly Yuno), win, reveal traumatic past, fight Yuno, lose\" and repeat. In short, most of the diary holders were just forgettable and used only for the sake of being killed and adding excitement to the show. Side characters like Yuki's friends (namely Akise) are on-screen more and provide more to the story then even most of the diary holders. That doesn't change the fact that everyone is pretty flat. No real development is given the the majority of our cast. The development that does occur for a few of our characters is written or presented pretty poorly with very little reasons to back it up. I won't say too much as to not spoil the series, though. As I said before, these characters are nothing more then plot devices - created to make the story more \"interesting\" and to shock the viewer into thinking they're looking at an emotionally deep character.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is nothing to be fawned over and is mediocre at best. Character designs aren't terrible but they aren't something that I'd call memorable either. The bloodbath scenes are the ones that look the most realistic and it's obvious that the animators took their most time in animating these. The animation is pretty fluid throughout the fighting scenes, but it's an overall forgettable performance save for the blood and gore that they flesh out so well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was again, not very memorable, but you can at least say that it stood out. Emotional music fit those so-called \"sad scenes\" pretty well (despite the lack of real feeling in the scenes themselves) and was well-played out. The battle music and of course, suspenseful tracks were also well-fitting and it's easy to say that those tracks were what helped keep you on your toes as to when something may be getting ready to happen. The seiyuu's did a pretty good job considering their roles, but based on a personal experience I can't say that hearing Yuno screaming \"Yuki!\" every episode and listening to Yuki cry every episode didn't get annoying or ear-aching. But overall no real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy \"Mirai Nikki?\" I don't know, do I enjoy not knowing where the hell a story's going? Do I enjoy watching pink-haired girls who only exist for \"love\" do a bunch of random, messed up stuff to everyone every other episode? Do I enjoy trainwrecks? No, I can tell you right now that I don't. The thing that made this show bearable, however, was Minene and Akise, who were probably the two most interesting characters in this show for me. Minene got more screentime then most of the diary holders and was actually tolerable, while Akise held that intelligent personality that always spices up a show for me. Otherwise no, this show held little to no enjoyment for me. Even though I'm a sucker for thrillers if there's nothing to hold it up, not even a simple plot that can be explained in a few words, then I won't enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Mirai Nikki\" left a bitter taste in my mouth. The lack of any reasonable directing - or even reason at all - along with a mix of unlikeable, forgettable plot devices, or as we all call them characters made this show nearly intolerable for me. It took as many different, fucked up things as possible in order to appeal to the general audience, threw in some blood and a horny yandere and viola! A masterpiece! Or so says the people who only look on the outside of the trainwreck. For those of us who are examining this train and everything that actually happened for the end result to be.. this, then you'll be able to see just how terrible \"Mirai Nikki\" actually was.",

            "content": "I basically had went to the trouble of signing up an account for myanimelist.com just to write this positive review for Mirai Nikki after watching episode 5.\r\nLike the synopsis said this is a psychological thriller, with murders, gore, sins and some demented killers.\r\nHowever unlike most thrillers the story is extremely good, the characters are all very unique, each with deep, well developed personalities that are slowly revealed to the viewer as they watch more and more episodes of the series. Its a mechanic that makes shows very addictive to watch,  just like how you want to spend more time with your date as theyreveal more and more nuggets about their interesting personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10 - Story is amazing, the first 5 to 10 minutes of the first episode was pretty typical, and it was deceiving (in a good way) because the story quickly ramped up and starts to deliver. Every time I watch an episode it delivers something new and unexpected, like a plot twist, or a revelation about the certain existing characters. And every time these plot twists had me wide eyed in pleasant surprise, thinking \"Wow this is so cool!\" or something like \"OMG, holy S*&t! I didn't expect this!\"\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 - Art is decent i guess, the action sequences are well done, but pale in comparison to this season's \"Guilty Crown\" for action. Overall art is 8 as I compared it with last season's artistic masterpiece \"Hanasaku Iroha\" , which the art was so good for a weekly anime series that I believed it set a new benchmark for artistic quality in weekly anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 - The music (OP and ED) are decent, they wisely avoided sound during some of the intense, dark & scary moments where they let the suspense and fear build up in the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10 - Characters are fantastic, awesome for an anime (or manga). Each and every starring character had unique personalities that are uncommon to the typical person. I am only at episode 5 of the anime and I have never seen such a demented and crazy cast. Only the main character Yukiteru-Kun seems the most normal, but even he has his fears and complexes that makes him withdrawn. The best thing about the characters is that the story only reveals small nuggets of their personality and motive every now and then as you keep watching the series. This means that the uniqueness and most likely, the demented craziness of each character drives the storyline further and further as each character's motives are revealed.\\n\r\nBest thing is that most of the time you don't expect the revelations made about these characters, giving you a \"wow\" moment and surprises you with a plot twist. \\n\r\nAn yea, many reviewers give props to \"Yuno\" the other main character of \"Mirai Nikki\". And I agree, a pretty girl who has a hidden killer personality, stalks the lousiest loser in school like the most diligent killers in slasher movies, and hacks and slashes everyone else with a handaxe. How cool is she! She stays a mystery and keeps viewers wanting to see more and more of her real motives, personality and her backstory.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 - I would give this a 9.5 if they allowed it in the ratings system. After watching 1 episode of \"Mirai Nikki\" at a random anime livestream channel it drove me to find and watch all the other existing episodes and wait fervently for the release of the latest ones. Only thing is that I probably can't have a good appetite while eating and watching this anime, due to the gore :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 - Again I would give Overall a 9.5 rating if allowed, \"Mirai Nikki\" has a great plot. A psychological thriller with gore is not your typical anime. Most of the time anime makers would turn away from such bloody twisted story for the fear of censorship and lack of young viewers. However \"Mirai Nikki\" is a great watch for anyone above 16. Everybody can enjoy the suspense of a good thriller and be hooked to the various character developments and plot twists. I would easily rate this anime as my choice for anime of the year 2011. Basically if you are even reading this review, find a way to watch the show by any means possible, yes it is that good, enjoy \"Mirai Nikki\" :)",

            "content": "This anime is one that has a lot of good surrounding it by word of mouth, and every once in a while you hear someone say it was meh or not worth watching. When I originally watched this, I had only seen the opening and I thought it was amazing and one of the best openings I've ever seen, as I still hold to this idea today. Upon watching the first few episodes, I was intrigued, but not impressed. When I finally finished it, I felt like I had wasted a tremendous amount of time and immediately wrote it off with a one out often and rushed a poorly written and bad review of it here, which no longer exists. Then, after many months, I began to think: \"What if it actually wasn't as bad as I initially thought?\" and so I began the perilous quest of rewatching my most hated anime at this current time, and after finishing it, I wrote this review.\\n\\n\r\nThis review takes a bit to get going to my main points, but if you're seriously considering watching this anime, I HIGHLY suggest you finish my review, and then read some other reviews that may/may not be more positive than mine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI will start with the art, as this is obviously the first thing you notice. For a 2011 anime, it's definitely up to par and has no really glaring problems, and is actually rather well done. That being said, I have seen much better anime, even in the same year. It also has some CGI, but it's nothing amazing, but it was done tastefully enough that it doesn't seem really awkward or make a bad contrast with the rest of the art. However, a large problem I have with this is if you are watching an uncensored version (AKA Not the TV version) like I had the misfortune of doing, then you will see some anime boobies. This may or may not bother you, but it bothered me as it was unnecessary fan service and it was more creepy and distracting than anything. Why am I mentioning this in the TV version? As a warning to those that there is a difference. The TV version also censors some very odd things, at least to a North American viewer such as myself, like severed limbs. Japan may have some different laws or preferences to us in NA, but it looks really dumb and childish when something like this happens, and it really takes you out of a suspenseful scenario.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAs I have already stated, the opening is great, and I watch it almost every time. Same goes for the second opening and both endings. I highly enjoy all of these, and they are worth sticking around  for instead of just jumping into the episode or to the next. The background music fits the tone for almost every scene and Tatsuya Kato did a good job in producing it. However, unlike some other music directors, like Hiroyuki Sawano, none of his tracks are very memorable, and so makes the music in the actual anime lacking to an extent, as there was nothing unique or fresh about his style. This is only a real problem for those of us who like anime OST's and will search them up after watching a scene where the song is what really made it for you.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nNow this is where my review starts getting negative. If you're a big fan of the show and you don't like constructive criticism, turn away now. The story is about a young boy named Yukiteru Amano who is a very lonely and boring middle school child, who is just going through the motions of life trying not to disturb anyone and only observing the daily events that unfold around him. He himself never takes a large role in anything in his life. The only thing he has to go home to is his imaginary friends, Dues ex Machina, the \"god\" of space and time, and his servant, Mur Mur (Japanese pronunciation Mura Mura, which I much prefer and shall be writing it as such from here on out), who does nothing and a lot of it. One day, Yukiteru wakes up and finds that his diary entries, had already been written for him. Immediately writing it off, he starts his daily routine. Suddenly, the events in his dairy begin to unfold as they were written. Taking advantage of this, he starts utilizing his \"future diary\". However, he is soon approached by a pink haired classmate named Yuno Gasai, who somehow knows what Mura Mura looks like, even though she's just a part of Yukiteru's imagination. Yukiteru is appalled by this, and runs off, only to be continually cut off by Yuno, who then explains to him that there are eleven other diary owners that are all trying to kill each other to become \"god\", as the current one, Deus ex Machina, is dying and needs a suitable replacement in one of these diary holders. Yuno also makes it a point to confess her love for Yukiteru, by showing him her future diary, which tells her everything there is to know about Yukiteru, perfect for a stalker, as she has been doing for the past year. Now, thrust into this game of life and death, Yukiteru, with much help from Yuno, must outwit and outfight his enemies that are the other diary holders.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that's the intro. Cue lots of filler and boring episodes where nothing happens, episodes that are really reminiscent of generic \"villain of the week\" shounen anime, and so many plot holes you could sink a ship with them. Upon rewatching this, there were many episodes I skipped because either A: Nothing happens in them, or B: They're just so boring to watch you can't help but skip them. I have so many problems with scenes or ways characters handle things that I could write a spoiled version of this review and it would be twice as long, but I won't. I will just warn you that this anime assumes you're stupid sometimes and creates hype with no build up and no pay off. But let's be honest here. If you have a friend that told you to watch this, but you're not so sure and want to read a review first, there's a reason they wanted you to watch this show...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nNow, for the absolute lowest point of this anime, it's characters. If you're a hardcore fan and decided to still read this review despite my warning, here's where you will be raging. My biggest problem with many shows are weak protagonists. Whether they are just too generic, too perfect, or in this case, too pathetic. Yukiteru, is not a good character. Most anime is marketed towards high schoolers and young adults, hence why most anime is in the Slice of High School Life Rom/Com genre. The reason for this is because if you can have a connection with the characters, you are way more likely to enjoy the show and keep watching. Therefore, when you're mains are all middle schoolers, you can't relate to them as much, or in my case, at all. In a survival game where you have to kill people, I understand why a middle schooler would be hesitant.\\n\\n\r\nSake Esuno, the original content creator's solution to this? Yuno Gasai, whose brain doesn't work normally and easily is the first thing that will pop into an otaku's head when they hear the term, \"Yandere\". Yuno murders everyone and anyone who gets in between her and Yukiteru, unless Yukiteru has explicitly told her not to, but occasionally not even then, if she really hates them. While this isn't always a bad thing, listening to a middle school kid cry and scream is not pleasant, even if it's warranted. More on Yuno, she eventually loses all purpose and then begins doing crazy things just to be crazy so that you'll point at the screen, laugh and say, \"Oh that Yuno, always being so nuts!\". This is another part of the \"hype because hype\" driving factor behind some scenarios that ultimately make them blow up in the episodes own face. As for the supporting cast, they are either really well done and don't get enough screen time, or get some but are very obnoxious and you'd just wish they'd go away. Because of this, none of them are worth even mentioning, even though I quite like some of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI give this anime a three out of ten because I believe it had a ton of potential, but it was only squandered in favor of poor plot devices, lame twists, and boring fillers. An example of this is this anime is way too long. It has 26 episodes, but it could have easily been finished in 20/22, as the last four/five episodes all drag on very long with extraneous scenes. It may have only seemed like this as I have viewed the show before so I know what was going to happen, but I still feel it could have been shortened. Couple this with some episodes that literally have nothing to do with the plot, and you have a lot of wasted screen time, but more importantly, your time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a \"spoilerless\" note about the ending, on the topic of tediously long scenes, I have no idea why there is an OVA other than to make viewers scream at their screen until they find out about the OVA, as the Manga ending is literally two pages away from the animes. Keep in mind, a manga page would contain anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute and a half of anime screen time.Sorry, don't mind me. I had to have another tangent, as this anime has given me much to gripe about.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict is that this is not worth the watch. However, if, you still decide you wish to view this anime, please watch the subbed version, as the dub for this anime, while not bad, is just wrong, to put bluntly. While the dub voice actors do not do a \"bad\" job per se, I find it vastly inferior to the subbed version, as Tomosa Murata did such a fantastic job as Yuno, even though the character is poor.\\n\\n\r\nAs for alternate anime with survival game themes or feels, I redirect you to instead watch Deadman Wonderland. Bear in mind, Deadman also has a whiny protagonist and a mysterious girl that saves him from everything, and that I don't hold this anime in high regards. I would be cautious with watching it, and even though I enjoyed it, I don't think it's all that special or great, but still a better watch than Mirai Nikki, and you'll spend only half the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that I did like with a survival game feel, I highly HIGHLY recommend Fate/Zero, the prequel to the Fate/Stay Night series. And if the name \"Gen Urobuchi\" means anything to you, and you haven't seen Fate/Zero yet, I really suggest you fix that. And the dub is amazing, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nPlease rate my review as you see fit, and if you have any questions or clarification, please post to my wall, and I will respond when I see it, thanks!",

            "content": "You know, having a future diary for myself would have been ideal for my viewing of this anime, so that I would be warned of how nonsensical and down right retarded the anime gets, which is a shame because I happen to have been enjoying the bloody fun so far...\r\nSTORY: Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is, for lack of a better way to describe it, fucking nuts. A psychogist would be laughing at this mental breakdown of a plot, but I got to be fair, I do enjoy this anime to a certain degree, but it's the crazy sharp turns it loves to take is whatnearly throws me off into complete confusion, not the \"I don't understand\" kind of confusion (Though is still includes that from time to time), but the \"Why and how is this happening\" kind.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, let's avoid the deep end for now. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is based on a manga of the same name originally created by Esuno Sakae about a battle to the death style of competition between 12 eccentric characters, from a terrorist, to a leader of a cult, to a lovey dovey couple, to even a orphen caretaker for the chance for one of them to take the place of a god, who is literally Deus Ex Machina, before he himself dies. Each will battles each other by using future diaries commonly being in the forms of cellphones, which each one varies on what type of future it fore tells.\\n\r\n It's sounds like the love child of series such as Eden of the East and the Fate/ series, though doesn't even get close to them in the intellect or character development department. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Yukiteru Amano, holder of the future diary that works as you'd think every other diary holder's would work, is an outstanding leading... total pussy. He is your typical spineless wimp, borderline disgusting even (A kid who would stay behind the sidelines and let the guard dog handle everything as he runs away shamelessly, the hero ladies and gentlemen). From having no friends, to even recording what he does daily in his phone (Pre-future diary), he is the definition of an unlikable main lead, one would or should never root for him, under-dog traits or not, his actions are hardly redeemable, he's easily fooled countless times, and develops at the pace of paint drying on the wall... A wall that is told to pretend his character development... Seriously, he remains the same way until he is told to \"act\" like a badass and and forgets about being a total wimp until later on, but he's my best friend compare to the lead female character.\\n\r\nYuno Gasai is what makes this anime surpremely entertaining and utterly batshit insane, this is an arkham asylum of lead character (I honestly believe she'd give the Joker a run for his money), but damn she is just fun to watch, wondering what she will do in the next episode is a one hundred post forum topic in of itself, for good and bad. She is also, for reminder's sake, totally insane and major threat to the cast by her self and a catalyst for the series' plot and character development breakdown. She is hopelssly obsessed with Yukiteru, calling herself his future bride, so she's your classic case of stalker too, but to disturbing lengths. She even goes to far so to kidnap Yukiteru, keeping him tied up, all the while prancing around in her underwear. She is a character that indiscriminately kills anything in her way, she's fun to watch but damn, how can anyone like this character? Especially Yukiteru, which he never can't get his hands washed of her.\\n\r\n I know that she's commonly categorized as a \"Yandere\" type character, but that's not a good reason to fawn over a character like her, she's not a character type, she's a damn psychopath with an endless thrist for blood in sheep's clothing.\\n\\n\r\nBut this where I jump right into the twenty feet deep portion of the swimming pool called the \"plot\" where seemingly anything goes, anything no matter how much sense it doesn't make. The future diaries do seem to be too convenient (Which is understandable since each character gets that advantage for themselves), but one of them practibly, or just flat out ruins the anime completely, as everyone seems to be pulling a future diary for their selves at random, and more over a lot of the diaries range from creative to just gimmicky, where the later is more common (Diaries predicting the actions of other couples and one that literally breeds more diaries is just absurd). Even the majority of the cast come down to one trick performances (Or well they only get one try before they're dead and forgotten forever), just a enemy of the week type of formula rules the most of them (And a lot of side characters that don't contribute to anything, like the stout Mur Mur, what is her purpose anyway? Sigh... You will laugh when you find out).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is indeed addictive, from bloody murders and crazy fallouts from the lead characters, but it's stupidity is overwhelming and just wants to make you tilt your head at the story developments and the absurd character display (Yup, trusting the stalker that just doesn't know how to stop killing everything is the best choice of action Yukiteru, while you're at it, go ahead and hide right behind her back-? You're there already? Then disregard this then and watch your back, like you care pfffth).\\n\r\nBut seriously, the main problem with Mirai Nikki is the inclusion of a character being Deus Ex Machina, it's rare that a story can do this effectively and even rarer for a story to not be confusing nonsensical gibberish, which by the way, Mirai Nikki ends up becoming. The anime is still capable of displaying solid moments with the main couple from time to time, but you'll be far from invested with it as the anime marches forward as it makes up shit as it goes along all the way towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: While it's not among the best, it's not terrible either. While the blood bathes in general get the most of the budget for the animation crew, it's overall pretty average, even character designs are pretty regular too outside the quirky ones and the 3d animated god.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Outside of the craziness, the theme music is extremely addictive, with the first opening theme song, Kuusou Mesorogiwi by Yousei Teikoku, being the best. While the performances from the voice actors give off a love and hate vibe, especially where Yukiteru is concerned, his performance only reinforces the pathetic wimp that he is, from whining and freaking out the time... But that's good casting in hindsight (I'm trying to state a positive as a negative, I think this anime is making me crazy...).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Great theme music.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mixed:\\n\r\n+/- Bloody good fun with crazy as all hell characters / When the plot goes off the rails, it's not a pretty trainwreck.\\n\r\n+/- Creative ways for character to combat each other / Most of which is one time gimmicks.\\n\r\n+/- Yuno Gasai / The unlikable wimp of a main lead, Yukiteru and Yuno Gasai.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Character development isn't acting like something you're not, which the main proceeds to do so.\\n\r\n- Towards the end, the story begins to literally make up shit as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not okay for people to go \"That just her character type heehee,\" when that character in question is unlikably insane, and it doesn't help when the show is almost a competition to see who's the craziest. An over the top psychotic free for all death match is one thing, but when you start to consider a line getting crossed, that line has already been beaten, stabbed, mutilated and and sculpted into something completely unrecognizable before your consideration begins to come across your mind, that's when it's time to get the fuck out.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki - you won't stop shaking your head.\r\nMirai Nikki is a poorly executed show filled with contradictions, illogical character behavior, forced plot advancements, haphazard personality changes, inappropriate scene changes, moronic plot twists, lunatics and most of all: imbeciles.\r\nThe plot is quite simple. The God of Time and Space (Deus Ex Machina) is looking for a successor. Thus, he invites Yukiteru (our male protagonist of this story), Yuno (our female protagonist and Yukiteru's ally/classmate/stalker/girlfriend) and ten others to a battle royal in which the last survivor becomes the new God of Time and Space. While everyone's identity is concealed from each other, Deus Ex Machinadeclares Yukiteru his favorite to win this death match. Subsequently the other participants decide to focus their attention on Yukiteru. Strangely they are kind enough to stand in line, waiting for their turn to make their appearance. Coincidentally the majority of the contestants are wacky, deranged individuals.\\n\\n\r\nAll contestants are given a \"Future Diary\" (in most cases integrated into their cell phones) which tells about future events as the holder would perceive it, as long as the future doesn't change due to any interfering actions of a diary holder. That means: First, the diaries can be used to change the future, which also automatically rewrites the entries of all Future Diaries. Second, the diaries don't necessarily tell the truth.\\n\r\nExample: A person holds a coin in his right fist, while his left is empty. Your diary tells you the coin is in his left. You respond accordingly. Without revealing the coin he assures you that your answer is correct, and your diary had predicted your perceived future correctly, even though it was a lie.\\n\r\nWhat kind of information those predictions contain is unique to each holder and seems to depend on his job and interests. Best example would be Yuno's diary: As she is quite obsessed with Yukiteru, her diary contains information about his future actions in ten-minute intervals.\\n\r\nDisadvantage of those diaries is, that damaging them results in the owner's death.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the setting of Mirai Nikki had any means to create clever, sinister characters and stories, it turned out to be a badly executed, mindless slaughter show. That is primarily because of the vast number of inept characters and the implausible changes in their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe average IQ of the cast seems to be crawling around the ten point mark. The plot advances often by exploiting the sheer stupidity of the cast, forcing them to behave in such unrealistic manners that it insults the intelligence of the viewers and ruins even the slightest bit of credibility of the characters as they simply don't act like humans.\\n\r\nExample: Your friend 'A' is sitting unconscious on a chair, located in a very suspicious-looking room which looks like an obvious trap. Your friend 'B' wants to go into the room to check on 'A', but before going inside, he tells you to stay back and hold the door open. You shout enthusiastically \"Leave it to me!\". Satisfied with your response he goes into the room.\\n\r\nSo, what do you do as a brainy character of this show? Damn right: Ten seconds later you waltz into the room, the door closes behind you, locking you all inside, and you make a face which literally screams \"Oh snap! I totally didn't see that coming!\".\\n\r\n(While the manga handles this scene slightly differently, it isn't errorless either.)\\n\r\nThe worst thing is, that such irrational behavior is being used all the time for almost every character as if there were no intelligent alternative.\\n\\n\r\nAdding to the characters' idiocy comes their fluctuating personality changes.\\n\r\nYukiteru is an antisocial, gullible, pathetic, insecure, unmotivated, spineless, gutless and brainless teenage boy and Yuno is a crazy, insane maniac with a psychopathic obsession with Yukiteru.\\n\r\nWhile the original personality of most of the characters can be accepted by itself, the real problem lies in their unpredictable and unreasonable personality changes - especially those of Yukiteru - making them do the most ridiculous and unbelievable things.\\n\r\nTurning a coward into a leader-like figure, letting him kill several dozen people with a callous countenance and then, just moments later, turning him back into his coward self, making him sob \"I never wanted to kill anyone!\", is just one example of many baffling personality changes.\\n\\n\r\nAs Mirai Nikki is a show about a tournament in which the winner becomes nothing less than the new God of Time and Space, you would expect that some events had an influence on their surrounding world or that they would carry some other sort of significance. But many events are just swept under the mat, as the characters act like they've never happened in the first place. That is not only due to a poorly written script, but also thanks to absurd and erratic scene changes. The combination of both makes it feel like the viewers are supposed to forget these events, as it seems much more important to see the characters visiting a bridal fair or grabbing boobs in a hot spring.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ending was already predetermined, the rest of the show felt like a messy series of introductions and killing offs of characters. Although some individuals were given a background story, none of them played a significant role or showed any ambition to win this death match. In the end they served no real purpose and were quickly forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise there is nothing extraordinary to mention. It's pretty much mediocre. The animation shines best when showing one of Yuno's many facets of her going crazy.\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit the cast quite well, the soundtrack is nice to listen to and serves the show as a decent musical accompaniment.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up: The combination of lacking intelligence of the cast, the fluctuating, random changes in their behavior, the nonsensical, erratic scene changes and the stolid, rushed plot advancements makes Mirai Nikki an utter disaster.\\n\r\nWhile I never take fictional work too seriously, Mirai Nikki's overkill of stupidities made it difficult even for me to enjoy myself.\\n\r\nOtherwise, I can only recommend this show to people with a predilection for trashy shows as they will most likely have their fun with it.\\n",

            "content": "Oct. 9, 2011:\r\nMirai Nikki's anime adaptation begins.\r\n--DEAD END--\r\nA mess. That's probably the easiest way to describe Mirai Nikki. From beginning to end, it was simply a total mess. The story begins as an apparently simple battle royale between a bunch of varyingly crazy people who can predict the future. By the end it's a dimension-hopping cluster of ridiculous plot twists and some veeeeeeery half-assed writing.\r\nI wouldn't want to spoil this... unique series for anyone, but I'm just going to say that it involves stuff like one character killing and impersonating herself, a gay guy pooped out by GOD who sends texts while getting his headchopped off (yes, while), and a crazy bitch with a bomb fetish who can fly and has babies that can also fly. Around the final arc it has completely ceased being about the survival game and has degenerated into Dragon Ball Z-style energy beam fighting. Yes, really.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, really, most of it comes out of nowhere. Whole plotlines are dropped and brought up very suddenly with alarming frequency. Character arcs are usually resolved in an extremely hasty manner with some form of contrived ass-pull excuse. This is just a very poorly plotted story, not that I've read the manga it's based on. Maybe that fared better? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is beta as fuck, too. I sympathised more with the 'villains' (using that term verrrrrry loosely) of the \"Yukki's daddy issues\" arc, as they had a genuinely sad, yet heartwarming backstory. Yukki is just a pussy and Yuno is a crazy bitch who makes no sense half of the time. Best character is Minene, though. She's cool. But her hair in episode 2... honey, no. That look is so not you.\\n\\n\r\nThe nicest thing I can say about Mirai Ball Z is that the opening songs are both fantastic. Particularly Dead END by the lovely Faylan, which I loved before I even started the series. The lyrics don't make any sense at all (The girl with the sharp thorn in her flesh, I met you at your story...?) but it sure is catchy. The first OP with its dramatic choir and counting up in German (EIN ZWEI DREI) was also very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun, though. This is the kind of series you make fun of with friends. It was all just so ridiculous and stupid that I couldn't help but kind of like it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a solid \"so bad it's good\" series, Mirai Nikki will prolly satisfy your desires.\\n\\n\r\n--HAPPY END--",

            "content": "DEAD END. You are facing your inevitable demise. But you possess a Future Diary, allowing you to evade death. However, other holders will be after your life to win Deus Ex Machina's twisted game and to become the next god. But don't worry. Gasai Yuno will protect you...\r\nMirai Nikki is an extremely excellent anime that does a fantastic job of incorporating the \"Battle Royale\" atmosphere and creating the perfect yandere. The storyline was complex and well-structured, almost flawless. It does well as a psychological thriller, weaving intense situations and suspenseful moments into an intricate pattern.\r\nStory (10):\r\nIt is interesting how the director and character designer ofShuffle! were able to string Esuno Sakae's manga into an exceptional storyline. The story itself may sound a bit odd at first (diaries that predict one's future events), but its compelling components such as the prize, becoming a god to replace Deus Ex Machina, the absolute god of time, definitely justify the method of portraying the story in an uncommon manner. With diary holders trying to kill each other in greed for power, the content of Mirai Nikki is dark; much blood and gore is spilled in the survival game. To a person who enjoys \"kill or be killed\" style plots or psychological thrillers, such as myself, Mirai Nikki would be very appealing because of the intense survival game and dramatic focus on the character's mental state rather than the physical world.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork (8):\\n\\n\r\nNothing much needs to be said about the artwork. Although the artwork and animation was good, without anything to complain about, it was not as extravagant as Guilty Crown and not as creative as Bakemonogatari. The animation is violent with much blood and gore spilled; it generally carries a Gothic ambiance of which is fitting for the dark story of Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening was fantastic, perfectly fitting the Mirai Nikki atmosphere. There is nothing wrong with the second opening, but I did not think it resonated as well with the anime as the first opening had done. But overall, the OST was great without many complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of Mirai Nikki is simply perfect. Gasai Yuno is the perfect yandere without a doubt, holding up an innocent middle-school girl exterior. Amano Yukiteru is portrayed as a weak-willed and timid boy, with a voice actress that accurately represents his personality. Yuno is developed into a psychopathic stalker who becomes obsessed with Yukiteru, stopping at nothing to preserve their \"relationship.\" Yukiteru relies on her protection to stay alive in Deus Ex Machina's game. Yuno is a yandere; Yukiteru is a coward. There is absolutely no flaw in the characters' structure and development in Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\\n\r\nWith people constantly murdering, the little comic relief is enough to release the viewer from the intense buildup, such as the after-credits shorts with Mur-Mur. Generally, the action scenes are exciting but bloody. To some, it may even be nauseating. However, it is definitely enjoyable to one who enjoys these kinds of battles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes survival games, psychological thrillers, or yandere girls as it is a great anime. But if you want to watch cute shoujo romances, this is definitely one of the farthest things from it.",

            "content": "\u201cThe best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.\u201d - Abraham Lincoln\r\n\u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d\r\nWhen you're little, have you ever thought about the future? Have you ever wanted to know what it would be like five, ten, or twenty years from now before you grow up? It is probably a thought most of us came upon in our lives. However our protagonist Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano is a loner who instead of thinking about the future instead spends his time daily writing a diary on his phone. Talk about a strange habit for akid without friends. But, surprise will hit him faster than a bullet train when he learns about the future in stored for him.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki (also known as The Future Diary based off the manga of the same name), is a story of survival game where the ultimate prize is to become God and given the gift to change the world forever. Being a survival game, it is not complete without its contestants. These contestants known as the Future Diary owners are given diaries in their own form whether it's a cell phone, a sketch book, or a scroll which tell them different things about what will happen in the future. The contestants themselves are also worthy noting that have a wide range of stark personalities ranging from a terrorist, to the devoted collective couple, a child prodigy, and a man who seeks justice in his own unique twisted ways.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there are the side characters. Yes, I'm talking about those classmates that later enters on into the story. Despite their relatively normal selves, we can see that the survival game later becomes realistic and changes their view on the world. I can't blame them though, I mean who can act and be themselves when you realize that you can see into the future?\\n\\n\r\nIn today's anime series, there are many type of characters. Tsundere, yandere, mysterious, princely, you name it. Then, there is our yandere (hero or anti-hero? you decide) Yuno Gasai. She is described as the typical Yamato Nadeshiko by those who sees her outer self...a girl of perfection who is popular with students, good at academics, and generally an ideal woman. Behind that outer shell however is a girl with insecurities with disturbing stalker-like tendencies for our protaognist, Yuki. Her obssession of Yuki can be labeled as yandere as she is willing to hurt or kill others. In fact, she won't hesitate to sacrifice other people because to her, the only important thing is that she and Yuki survive the game. Her goal of wanting to make that \u201chappy end\u201d (hehe, turn that imagination bulb on) with Yuki is one of the main drives she wishes to achieve in this story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course with survival game genres, there are consequences such as life and death. In the end, there is only one winner and it's every man for himself. Luckily for our protagonist, his stalker is madly in love with him so that means an alliance. So do the math here: two heads are better than one right? Well, that would be the case but Yuki's insecurities tells him in his mind that killing is wrong and things like this can be ended peacefully. However, in survival games like this, there is no peace. There is no true alliances. There is no true God (yet), no angel, no heaven. There is only blood, betrayals, and power. And in the end, there is only one winner if by miracle that you don't reach your own Dead End first.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found this series quite interesting is that it sticks to the game from the very beginning. Yes, there are those sidelines and mini-fillers (even ones that weren't in the manga) but it sticks with the pace overall. The memories and flashbacks we see of various characters is realistic and the tragedy and mood of what they been through makes them who they are. And of course, there are those fan-service scenes that keeps our eyes glued to the screen involving our yandere Yuno and some other characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs a survival horror, blood and gore is present. What did you expect? This isn't one of those happy love-dovey series involving teenage romance and love triangles. If you want that, go watch Amagami SS or something. Honestly though, I thought that some of the violence is necessary for this series to engineer the reality of the game. In other words, the survival game for the throne of God is real. The contestants are dead serious on winning. And, the consequences for losing are disastrous.\\n\\n\r\nThe show being labeled as a psychological on MAL also shows its colors once the episodes progresses especially later on in the series. Like I mentioned before, there is drama, there is blood spilled, and backs being stabbed metaphorically. The moments are tense and for those who have watched Final Destination or any other related series of related theme would understand this with the thriller-like endings that keeps the viewers at our seats. In other words, it keeps the viewers from predicting what's next and what or when things happen. I mean, it's not like you have a real Future Diary to predict the events of the anime as you watch them. Now, that would be something you don't see every day. \\n\\n\r\nAnother noteworthy mention of Mirai Nikki in my book would be the soundtrack of this series. I'll be honest here. It is epic. The OST mixes in with the various scenes well ranging from psychological, comedic, emotional, and action. Additionally, the OP songs performed by Yousei Teikoku and Faylan portrays the metaphor of the series. If we look carefully and listen to the lyrics, we can see the realism of a survival game and picture it in our minds as the song plays. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I found the art of the series to be just average. It's not that unique or something that made me go \u201cwow, I haven't seen something this beautiful before!\u201d I've already had that feeling after watching many Makoto Shinaki films. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this series is enjoyable. It's not just because I'm a sucker for thriller and psychological genre despite some of the fan-service and cliches. Thankfully, Mirai Nikki didn't push that too far even if it did in a few cases. Despite my initial hatred for that excuse of a protagonist by the name of Yuki, I did find his later character development and values to be worth noting. Then, there's the yandere Yuno in the series added in like a little bonus of cherry to a delicious cake. And of course, don't leave the terrorist Uryu out as her character development of the series is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects that makes you want to learn about her more and more. (perhaps even fall in love and marry with her like one of the other characters) The soundtrack is powerful and conveys every moment of the series from emotional, comedy, or thriller. It will keep you at the edge of your seat as you predict what will happen next using your own imaginative diary that's called a brain. Perhaps the only problem I had was with the ending of the anime adaptation. I won't spoil it for you but it's not something I originally hoped to see. With a package of 26 episodes, expect psychological plot twists, character development, and thriller that will make you want more and more. Looking to watch something with your best friend on a weekend after finishing your job or homework? Then, you might of just hit a jackpot because our yandere Yuno will surely give you something to remember by.\\n\\n\r\nMay 19         12:55 pm\\n\\n\r\nStark700 finishes writing his Mirai Nikki review. \\n\r\nHope you like what you see and I wish you a Happy End.",

            "content": "Yandere.\r\nYandere.\r\nWhat in the mighty fuck is a yandere?\r\nWell, good sir / madam / whoever the fuck you are, a yandere is a common term in otaku fandom, a yandere is a person (usually female) romantically obsessed with someone to the point of using violent means to get them in their arms. Often seen with a sharp weapon and a psychotic grin. Now maybe the most known character to be this type is Kotonoha in School Days since while she\u2019s calm and gentle, she can also be unstable and quite messed up in the head, as the final episode sequence proved that (although that was theonly good part about that anime) but enough about that considering this anime I\u2019m about to review also has an yandere character that either has its fans as of recently and it also goes to show you that we need to stray from crazy psychotic girls like Yuno Gasai, Yu no? *rimshot and then gunshot*\\n\\n\\n\r\nHigh school 2nd year, Amano Yukiteru, is a boy who has problem making friends. He thinks of himself as a bystander and will always write down everything he sees in a cell phone diary. Yuki initially has no desire to win the game, but after Deus informs the other contestants that Yuki, as the \u201c1st\u201d Diary owner, is his favorite to win the game, he is forced to team up with the 2nd Diary owner\u2014his obsessive stalker, Yuno Gasai\u2014in order to survive the constant attempts on his life by the other diary users, who see him as the biggest threat. Tormented by solitude, Yukiteru began to imagine things like a friend called Deus Ex Machina who is apparently the Lord of Time & Space. Seeing Yukiteru\u2019s miserable state, Deus gives him a new ability. His diary will now record events that will happen in the near future. Yukiteru is then forced to participate in a game which the winner will become Deus\u2019 successor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, the plot is precise to mostly the concept of Battle Royale where you better make sure you got the tools and skills to survive whatever gets thrown at you but with the addition of knowing your future beforehand via a future diary but the thing about them is that they\u2019re not exactly 100% reliable as some of them do manage to do the opposite of what the diary predicted and you also know the whole \u2018anything can happen if you do the opposite of what the diary said and still might live or not. It\u2019s your choice and all that bunk.\u2019 But as the premise sounds entertaining for a while and it did executed it for a while, it went off the rails and ended up being a trainwreck and it\u2019s not a pretty sight as it\u2019s more of people doing some heinous ridiculous shit that really seems uncalled for. I\u2019ve compared this show to Deadman Wonderland much like I\u2019ve compared This Ugly yet Beautiful World to Mahoromatic and like how I said Mahoromatic is superior to TuyBW, Deadman Wonderland beats out Future Diary by a margin and while Deadman wasn\u2019t exactly a masterpiece, it didn\u2019t felt like it was trying too hard to be mature or a seinen as you will (Although Deadman should\u2019ve been longer than Future). Yeah, there\u2019s blood, gore, gunshots, knives, and tits and ass but it isn\u2019t really trying to tell a mature story; it\u2019s what people said in some professional or amateur reviews, it\u2019s more like a shonen series disguised as a seinen series and we can see through its ruse and not to mention, the tone is inconsistent when it comes to humor, especially at the end of every episode where Murmur (Murmur? Really?), the apprentice to Deus Ex Machina encounters with most of the characters in the show in a comical fashion. I don\u2019t mind it as most characters but it felt very jarring after watching an episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the worst part of the series as I really hated the two main leads, Yuki and Yuno, but more of Yuki than Yuno. Why\u2019s that, you asked? Yeah, Yuno is a crazy pink-haired psycho bitch with the basic traits of being lovingly devoted to Yuki and killing everyone who gets in her way but Yuki\u2026\u2026.the guy has some fault in this. This isn\u2019t a trait where the main protagonist isn\u2019t at fault since all the shit that happened, all the stuff that happened to his friends, his family (oh, the hell with his father!! I hate that guy even more!!) Even to some of the competitors, which 3 of them are exactly more interesting than the main two such as The 9th (or Minene Ury\u016b), who actually has more of a compelling background story although she has the textbook tsundere bitch thing going for her and The 7th (or Marco and Ai) and both of them are a better couple than Yuki and Yuno. They\u2019re psychotic and crazy killers but they\u2019re more entertaining and I actually gave a shit about them more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is alright. I really don\u2019t know much about the company, asread, as they do have their own anime productions such as Corpse Party OVAs, Minami-ke, Shuffle among other series they only did some parts of and the look of the show does give out its crazy psychotic vibe and sometimes it get too purple. Yeah, like how K uses blue way too much, Future Diary uses the color purple so much that you think someone splashed Grape Kool-Aid into your eyes and yes, gory shit is happening around these parts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, I think the first opening theme of the show, \u201cK\u016bs\u014d Mesorogiwi\u201d (\u7a7a\u60f3\u30e1\u30bd\u30ed\u30ae\u30f0) by Yousei Teikoku, is the most positive I can get with the show so far because the song will always be stuck in my head and it does got the destructive and terrifying tone that the show desperately tries to be. The other opening song was good but nothing that really grasp into my mind later on. For ending songs, while I equally like both of them, I\u2019m sliding towards the 2nd ending theme, which is also sung by the 1st opening artist, Yousei Teikoku. Also, can you imagine someone using this song for their own personal life? As for the FUNimation dub, it\u2019s not a bad dub but it just felt wrong and not wrong in the sense of watching the original language is better but I think it\u2019s just the casting choices. Brina Palencia may not have been the right choice for Yuno, but I feel like no one else would\u2019ve done it better than her. She\u2019s acceptable in the role but not really a highlight for her. Josh Grelle is a good voice actor, but him voicing Yuki sounds a bit odd than usual. Rest of the cast does strike more as \u2018meh\u2019 choices and I did confuse some voices like how I thought Jamie Marchi voiced Yuki\u2019s mom but it was actually Colleen Clinkenbeard and how I mistake Monica Rial for Murmur when it was Leah Clark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Yeah, I hated Future Diary. That\u2019s it. Some people said it was terrible but fun and while that may have a little bit of fun, it doesn\u2019t convince me that it wasn\u2019t entertaining. I hate the main characters and wish some of the supporting characters were treated better than they were in the show and the story is sloppily executed despite me being somewhat interested in it. It is one of those shows you should see once and if you like it, well, good for you but otherwise, avoid this clunker. It is not worth it.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is disappointing. My review will contain a few little \"spoilers\", though they have little relevance to anything and spoil nothing. This review is kind of a mess and all over the place, much like this series!\r\n- - - S T O R Y - - - \r\nOkay, so the story starts off really dark with some creepy kid who avoids making friends. He keeps a daily journal of the things he observes. He likes to spend his spare time sitting alone in his room with a blanket wrapped around himself, where he gets into \"the zone\" and hangs out with his imaginary friends,who are evil gods that have no regard for human life. At this point in the story, it's got you thinking this is pretty twisted and you're wondering what's gonna happen next. \\n\\n\r\nThe basic plot is simple, but effective - kill the other guys before they kill you; the winner becomes the god of space and time. Not knowing the identities of the other people turns it into a sort of psychological game, which makes it more interesting. Now, this was good when the enemies actually desired to become a god, but later in the story, there are characters who don't really care about that. So, you think they'd just stay out of things and keep their identities hidden? Nope! They attack the main characters head on for no apparent reason. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, about halfway through the series, it starts to get pretty senseless. Eighth's diary is based on the power of a computer server. Why? They didn't really explain this, so it makes no sense to have an ability like that. I can speculate and say it's because Eighth didn't actually have a diary and that the blog site she hosted allowed other people to write on \"HER\" blog, but c'mon. That's as stupid as saying that the cell phone diaries belong to the phone manufacturers. This part of the story also just really overcomplicates things without making it interesting. It just becomes less interesting as it is nonsensical. \\n\\n\r\nYukiteru eventually has a little revelation, causing him to change from a wimp into James Bond. Um... I guess it was cool to have a main character who acted more like a main character, but this was far too sudden and out of character. Akise reveals a \"shocking truth\" about Yuno, which is supposed to be like some ultimate plot twist... except they didn't give us enough clues to make it worth anything when they revealed it. The plot twist only makes sense after you've seen the entire thing, so it um... kinda fails as a plot twist. \\n\\n\r\nThere ends up being some big final battle between two characters that we really didn't get to know or care about. It's a battle with lots of beams and explosions, which uh... seems really out of place. It's like this anime was trying to be too much at once. The last episode doesn't really conclude things, so prepare yourself for some disappointment. \\n\\n\r\n- - - A R T - - - \\n\r\nThe art was okay, but it seemed a little cheaply animated at times. It seems up to standards, but sometimes it just stuck out to me how the animators looked like they got lazy. \\n\r\nSomehow, it feels like Yuno was in her underwear too often for no reason. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S O U N D - - - \\n\r\nNothing in particular really stood out. Same high pitched female voices you hear in any other anime. \\n\\n\r\n- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \\n\r\nOh boy, here we go. \\n\r\nYukiteru - He starts of being some creepy kid like I mentioned earlier. This was interesting. He's kinda wussy, like any average 12 year old boy would be, but he's not unlikeable. It took him a while to realize how he felt about Yuno, but it was good to see the progress - it made it believable. His character does a sudden 180 later in the story. This kinda ruins his character since there was no real development leading up to that and no real development afterwards; he was just suddenly a completely different person. This was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nYuno - She's a \"stalker\", which um... is a weird concept in itself. When you think of a stalker, you think of a 50 year old pedophile or something. In Japan, for some reason, I guess they consider kids and teenagers \"stalkers\" if they watch the person they have a crush on. Anyway, Yuno is supposed to be some psychopath who can only be tamed by Yukiteru's love. Can he help her calm down and give up her lunatic ways? Find out next episode!\\n\r\nIt was fine that way. We could see their relationship develop. Then at the peak of Yukiteru's love and trust in Yuno, the writers thought they'd give us a plot twist? It was one of the stupidest plot twists I've ever seen. It ruined Yuno's credibility as a character and was just... why? What was the point? It made no sense at all for that to happen. They had what they wanted, so why the fuck would things downgrade to the point that their relationship might as well have never existed? They should've stuck to building her up into a respectable character instead of um... ruining the entire series. This was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEighth - What the fuck is she? Seriously. Her existence simply does not make sense. She is a chibi middle aged woman who is also gigantic. She is clearly not human, but nobody cares. \\n\\n\r\nEighth's Lucky Star apprentice girl - She was part of the Sacred Eye cult, then she became a member of Eighth's orphanage. In world 3, she is simply with Eighth, though. What a plot hole. \\n\\n\r\nAkise - He's pretty much the only cool character. However, he is gay and kisses Yukiteru for no reason. Was that supposed to be a plot twist? I don't even know anymore...\\n\\n\r\nNinth - She's kinda stupid. She introduces herself in some kinda Victorian dress and big poofy pigtails, yet she's supposed to be some terrorist who specializes in explosives. She's loud and pretends to act a little crazy. She falls in love with the person she thought she killed, she becomes friends with the person who destroys her eye, and she plays a big plot hole role later in the story. This was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n- - - E N J O Y M E N T - - - \\n\r\nThe plot was really enjoyable at first... y'know, before they butchered it. There was some mild fanservice, which we easily could've lived without. It was a strange kind of fanservice, though. Yuno's swimsuit falling off and floating gently down the stream? A pretty typical occurrence that happens to every anime girl at least once in her life, right? Instead of making her panic and bounce all over, instead of making her use this to seduce Yukiteru, instead of drawing her looking like she's ready to be raped... they honestly made it a pretty modest event. Yukiteru also accidentally pulls a girl's pants down, exposing her underwear, but they didn't draw the girl to look sexy or anything. She was simply a girl with her underwear exposed. These scenes were 100% unnecessary and added nothing, of course, but I was glad that they didn't try to make it look like hentai. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also 2 rape scenes and 1 sex scene, but they leave it entirely up to your imagination instead of making it really graphic. Again, I'm glad they didn't try to make it look like hentai. People can watch porn on their own time; it has no place in telling a story, and I can respect that this anime didn't ruin itself with that. However, I have to say that using rape in a story is pretty tasteless, lazy, and overdone. Getting to know the backstories of these characters, becoming a little emotionally invested in them, then they just have something like that happen to them... it's just a disgusting thought. I can understand if they wanted to make the characters tragic or like we could know more about them by seeing their hardships, but rape is just kinda crossing the line. It's not interesting and it's too harsh for simple entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nI think the two most interesting things in the anime are the relationship Yuno and Yukiteru develop (before the retarded plot twist kicks in) and the betrayals. This anime has a lot of thrilling betrayals in the first half. The ones in the later half are kinda boring since you don't get setup to believe in the trust the characters share.\\n\\n\r\n- - - O V E R A L L - - - \\n\r\nThis had a lot of potential to be good. It's really disappointing they ruined it with all those inconsistent and random ideas. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really, as it is just a big let down. If I knew ahead of time that the story was gonna go downhill so badly, I don't think I would've watched it.",

            "content": "--Sorry for my English, I'm from a non-English speaking country--\r\nOk, right now this show is incredibly overrated, at first I was enjoying it, there is some gore, action, and even some fanservice, but that's about it, because the story is a total mess, it makes no f**king sense at all! There is this God Deus and he is giving cell phones (or future diaries) to some people so they kill each other in a game and the one last standing will become the new God, that's the premise and I know it doesn't sound so bad (it kinda reminds me of Death Note) but thingsonly keep interesting the few first episodes, the rest is just brainless fighting, oh and the characters, OMG, Yukiteru has to be one of the less likeable characters I've seen in my entire life, he's a coward and he's also f**king retarded, for example:\\n\r\n( SPOILER )\\n\r\nThere's  Yukiteru's loving mother and there's Yukiteru's selfish terrible father, his mother (who has showed love and affection the entire series) is killed by his father, yes his own father kills his mother, and if that's not enough he also tried to kill Yukiterou in exchange of having his debts paid. Ok, here's the problem, Yuki makes more fuss and shed more tears for his father than he did for his mother, it makes no sense, he even was aware of his father's intentions to kill him, and he knew he was the one who killed his mother, but this is Mirai Nikki, the nonsensical anime, so he even forgives him and then he becomes, totally out of the blue, a perfect assassin (he was a coward without combat skills), and all credibility goes downhill from there... \\n\r\n( END OF SPOILER )\\n\r\nYuno is not as bad a character as Yukiteru is, but she's a very shallow character, she's there just for the sake of gore, I think the writers tried to make her a complex character, but they failed, she's also pretty annoying. In some episodes I was like \" I swear, if I hear 'Yuuuukiiii' one more time...\" LOL\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are even more poorly developed... there's a detective boy who looks exactly like Kaworu Nagisa from Neon Genesis Evangelion, he's supposed to be the mysterious white haired character, and the three friends of Yukiteru, they serve some purpose but there's no deep in their personalities, the same goes for the villains, there's many of them and they look more interesting than the \"good boys\" but they get killed so fast we don't get to really know them at the end, the only exception are the cop and the one-eyed terrorist psycho girl, these two are probably the more likeable characters on the show. Oh and I almost forgot, there's this woman with a HUGE head, she looks so out of place, but no one seems to care \"Hi woman with the huge face\", I know this is anime, it's not supposed to be realistic, but c'mon, she's the only person with such a huge head yet everyone seems oblivious to it (and she's the only character with a huge head). \\n\r\nAs I said the story is a mess, a fan fiction could do better, it's full of ridiculous dialogue and laughable plot twists.\\n\r\nSound is average, opening and ending themes are pretty good, the OST it's just ok.\\n\r\nThe art it's not bad, I like the character's designs (especially the character design of the girls), they look a bit generic, but they look great. The animation remains consistently good (just don't expect the quality of Death Note or Code Geass), but it's downgraded in some episodes. If you are expecting a suspenseful psychological thriller, then you may end up very disappointed, Mirai Nikki it's not the next Death Note or Monster, it's all mindless action and nonsense... there's some mystery to the story, but I would rather recommend you to watch Another, it's infinitely more interesting and  mysterious than Mirai Nikki.\\n\r\nI'm gonna give some credit to Mirai Nikki, the show is a bit addictive, each episode leaves you wanting more, but that's just because they come up with some stupid plot twist that seems interesting at first, but at the end nothing makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\\n\r\nBring me all the \"Not Helpful\" you want, but I know deep inside of you, you know I'm right ;)\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki (or Future Diary as it is known in English) is one of the most popular anime to come out in recent years along with Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan and much like those shows, it has divided the anime community into two camps, those who love it unconditionally and those who hate it with a burning passion, which results in a slew of insults complete with poor spelling and grammar being thrown around forums and comment sections. Now that I\u2019ve got this little bit of superfluous information out of the way, you probably want to know what I think about theshow. Well, that is the purpose of this review (obviously).\\n\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to start off by saying that it is quite silly. Don\u2019t get me wrong and start attacking my page, because \u201csilly\u201d doesn\u2019t always equate to \u201cbad\u201d (case in point Gurren Lagann is one of my favourite anime of all time). But keep in mind that I didn\u2019t say that the particular brand of silly is awesome. The premise is actually bloody interesting. It revolves around several people in a battle royale where the winner becomes the god of time and space and they are all equipped with supernatural cellphones that can tell the future (also known as \u201cfuture diaries\u201d, hence the show\u2019s title) which they use to their advantage. A large perk of a premise like this is that it is perfect for setting up plot twists and for creating tension. Boy does the show use this to its advantage. Alliances are forged and broken by betrayal, good guys turn out to be bad guys and major characters are killed off. This makes the show unpredictable which we can all agree is a good thing.  It also places a lot of focus on the side characters as well as the main characters as they off each other and help each other out so it feels more authentic than a lot of other survival game stories where the side characters are all placed in line for our protagonist to fight.\\n\\n\r\n I am now going to address what I said earlier about the show being silly. It is over the top. And trust me, that is an understatement. Homicidal five year olds, zombies, the god of space and time (Deus Ex Machina) and the list goes on. Don\u2019t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with being over the top to a certain extent (I love the Sin City graphic novels for crying out loud!) but there are times when the show tries way too hard and certain things just don\u2019t fit to the point where you get the impression that the show doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. The show wants you to believe it is a dark psychological action/thriller. There are times when the over the top nature works in its favour, for example I thought the addition of zombies and a crazy religious cult added to the cool factor of the show as well as setting up entertaining action scenes (because honestly who doesn\u2019t want to see a cute pink haired yandere fight zombies with a goddamn axe) but there were times when I felt like the show was saying \u201cOooh, we\u2019re super dark and edgy because we have a five year old psychopath\u201d and this gave me the feeling that they were trying too hard and made it seem quite stupid. And when you\u2019ve added a character with an army of robot dogs, it stops being simply stupid and becomes fucking childish. Stuff like this prevents you from taking it seriously when the show obviously wants you to.  That being said, the show was rather entertaining. Like I said earlier, it is quite unpredictable and has a certain cool factor. However the things I mentioned did hinder my enjoyment, which is quite a sad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the weakest part of the show and were what held it back the most. First off there\u2019s fourteen year old Yukiteiru Amano, or Yukki as he is often referred to. He\u2019s our protagonist. Yukki is dragged into the game by his friend Deus Ex (the god of space and time and the guy who started this competition) who Yukki had thought was his imaginary friend up until that point. Yeah, this fourteen year old boy has a fucking imaginary friend. Yeah that\u2019s right, he\u2019s a fucking loser! To further emphasize this point, before being dragged into this little game his only hobbies were recording mundane shit on his phone and unenthusiastically throwing darts (a feat which comes to his advantage later). But what\u2019s he like? Well calm down and I\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s a pussy. He cowers, cries and whimpers throughout the majority of the series making the viewer want to jam a screwdriver though his skull. \u201cBut dude, you have Shinji Ikari in your favourites, you\u2019re contradicting yourself you biased prick!\u201d is what some of you might be thinking right now. Well, Shinji is realistic and that\u2019s the reason I like him. Yukki pushes this angst and wimpiness to the point where it\u2019s not credible and exaggerated wimpiness is not something an average viewer would find appealing. I love Kamina from Gurren Lagann for his exaggerated manliness but that is an appealing characteristic in a protagonist. I guess the writer thought to himself \u201cI\u2019ll be different and put a scared kid in the role of the protagonist instead of the generic righteous leader type we\u2019re so used to in these types of stories\u201d. This would have been a really good idea if he was given more complexity than just \u201cbeing a pussy\u201d and if he were given a reason for being a pussy. A good example is the aforementioned Shinji Ikari. He\u2019s an interesting and well thought out character that has layers (insert Shrek joke here).  He also has good reason for being the way he is. His father treats him like shit and his mother died under dreadful circumstances when he was very young and to top that all off he\u2019s forced into a situation that he knows fuck all about by his father. Yukki on the other hand grew up with a really chilled mom and an initially awesome dad (SPOILER: becomes a cunt later in the series) and his situation is nowhere near as bad as Shinji\u2019s. And besides, Yukki makes Shinji look like Kenshiro on steroids.  One Youtube anime reviewer referred to him as Noodledick Vaginasaurus and I can see why. He is without a doubt one of the worst protagonists I have ever seen. Towards the end of the series they try to make him seem like a badass but this drastic change feels really sudden and he doesn\u2019t stay that way for very long so his character becomes very inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nThe next character that I\u2019m going to talk about is the character everyone thinks of when this series is brought up. Yes, the one and only Gasai Yuno. She\u2019s become one of the most popular and iconic anime characters in recent years as well as the waifu of many lonely weeaboos. She is a psychopath who falls in love with good old Noodledick to the point where she is dangerously obsessed. She is also a contender in the survival game and is on Yukki\u2019s side and she protects his useless ass from the other contestants. She flips between being a cute na\u00efve teenage girl to being an all out psycho at the drop of the hat and these changes are unexpected and the transition is great. This genuinely creeps out the viewer and the fact that it can happen so suddenly adds to the sense of unpredictability that I mentioned earlier. She\u2019s a fun character to watch too. Her insanity paired with her cuteness gives her a certain bizarre charm.  However, as fun as she is, she is definitely not flawless.  She\u2019s ultimately just an archetype (that archetype being yandere) and this is a bit disheartening as it tells you that the writers were being lazy and just decided to use a simple, set archetype instead of adding more to said archetype. Another issue I had which was very much subjective was that she called out the protagonist\u2019s name constantly throughout in a high pitched tone of voice. This was cute and pretty creepy the first couple of times but it got to a point where I felt like shoving screwdrivers in my fucking ears.  She\u2019s a really enjoyable yet problematic character who is frankly a tad overrated.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of this show\u2019s cast. Unfortunately they\u2019re the show\u2019s worst flaw in my humble opinion. A lot of them are copied and pasted from other, better shows (we\u2019ve got Kaworu and Revy here), are given less screen time than they deserve, feel like they don\u2019t belong in this sort of show, have REALLY overblown backstories and for the most part they don\u2019t behave in a believable way (dude, one doesn\u2019t become someone\u2019s close friend in three minutes). \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s delve into the show\u2019s art. It\u2019s not spectacular but it\u2019s definitely not bad. I particularly liked the depth and detail they gave the eyes of the characters and the scenes in Deus Ex\u2019s world which had a really dreamlike quality due to all the purple used. The overall designs of the characters are standard fare and there is nothing about them that really stands out as being really good or really bad, with the exception of Deus who has the misfortune of being done in shitty CG. \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said about the show\u2019s soundtrack. It does its job sufficiently enough but when I think back there were no tracks that really stood out. The same can\u2019t be said about the show\u2019s OP tracks though. The show\u2019s first opening is without a shred of doubt one of the greatest of all time. The contrasting red and whites and the song\u2019s fast pace and grand scale are enough to send chills down one\u2019s spine. The second opening is memorable for a different reason though.  It\u2019s in FUCKING ENGRISH and it is therefore goddamn hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Mirai Nikki isn\u2019t the deep mature thriller its fanbase make it out to be but it certainly isn\u2019t the harbinger of anime\u2019s decay like many critics would have you believe. Granted it can get REALLY fucking stupid but it can also be a ton of fun at times too. Whether I\u2019d recommend this show or not doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019ll probably watch it regardless due to its immense popularity. Since I\u2019m more or less impartial to the show it\u2019s not something I\u2019d recommend but at the same time it\u2019s not something I\u2019d tell people to stay away from. So that about wraps up my review. Sayonara suckers. \\n\\n\r\nFeedback would be much appreciated.",

            "content": "Have you ever watched an anime that simply left you speechless, unsure of what the hell have you just watched, but in the most obnoxious way possible? We all probably did, shows that cause this type of reaction tend to be considered the worst ones. Well, let me introduce you to Mirai Nikki.\r\nMirai Nikki is the worst anime I have ever watched.\r\nNo, I'm not kidding, nor am I being hyperbolic. This unholy abomination of a series left such a negative impact on me when I originally watched it back in 2012, that I actually started to hate anime in general and lost interest in themedium for a couple of years because of the fact that Mirai Nikki was the most popular anime back then. It baffled me how anyone could like such an atrociously-written crap without an ounce of irony, and if this is what people were accepting as \"good\" anime, then this medium is fucking doomed.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, as the years went by, people started to notice Mirai Nikki's bullshit and this show's reputation nowadays is considerably worse than it used to be, which is exactly the kind of thing that happens with terrible shows that were once loved merely out of hype while not having substance to back it up. The hype dies away, people will watch it again, some new viewers will also give it a shot, and the awfulness of the content will come and hit you so hard you'll wish you were Chris Brown's wife. Maybe if Mirai Nikki was your first anime, or at least your first \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"serious\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" (there's still not enough quotation marks there, believe me) anime, you'll probably feel nostalgic about it, and thus, unable to judge it as the shitshow it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of being specific about why I hate Mirai Nikki so much, be warned that >>>I'M GOING TO SPOIL THE HELL OUT OF THIS SHOW FOR THIS REVIEW<<< because I don't think I can express how bad it is without spoiling it. If you're somehow masochistic and want to waste your time with Mirai Nikki without being spoiled, then I advise you to not read any further, I also advise you to go watch something else that's more worthy of your time, or maybe go see a psychiatrist. For everyone else... You may also want to do something else that's more worthy of your time than reading some autistic weeb rambling about how much he despises a shitty japanese cartoon that's 7 years old at this point, but if you really want to keep reading, then be my guest.\\n\\n\r\nSome people usually talk about how good Mirai Nikki's premise is, even others who also think this show is horse shit, tend to admit that it had a good premise. Well, I don't think it had a good premise at all, honestly Mirai Nikki seemed stupid to me ever since the very first episode, and I'm going to explain why. The premise is that there's this guy called Amano Yukiteru, he's your average socially awkward loner teen and has the habit of writing down everything that happens around him in his cellphone, while talking to his imaginary friends, Deus Ex Machina, and his partner, Murmur. Turns out Deus Ex Machina and Murmur are not really Yukiteru's imaginary friends, instead Deus is actually the God of Time and Space, he turned Yukiteru's cellphone into a Future Diary, a device capable of predicting the future up to ninety days, and dragged Yukiteru into a deadly survival game. In this game, Yukiteru and eleven other participants posessing their own Future Diaries with their own specific effects must kill each other until one remains, and the sole survivor takes Deus' place as God of Time and Space. Why? Because Deus is actually dying and must get a successor before that happens.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, if this premise being stupid wasn't self-explanatory enough for you, then I'll tell you why it's stupid. First of all: Why the hell is Deus dying? The show never ever explains what exactly is killing him, hell, I thought gods were supposed to be immortal, but I guess Deus just got some kind of God AIDS and now he's about to pass away. And second: If Deus is the God of Time and Space, then why doesn't he just use his powers over time and space to look into the future and just make whoever won the game there into his successor already? Isn't he in a hurry to get this damn successor before he dies? Does he just want to see a bunch of people killing each other before dying? Either way, it's fucking dumb as hell, there's no reason to even come up with this game when you know exactly who is going to win in the end. Even if you make the argument that he's giving the participants the chance to change this future that he already knows is coming ahead, this is pointless because the winner of the game by the end of the series is exactly who Deus knew was going to be all along. Really, what is the point of everything that happens in this series?\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, that's not even the worst part, the story somehow actually manages to get dumber after that masterpiece of a premise.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the other eleven participants of the game is Yukiteru's classmate, a girl called Gasai Yuno, who has been obsessively stalking the guy and vows to protect him at all costs, her Future Diary is even made specifically to help her protect Yukiteru. Together, they vow to defeat the other Future Diary owners and bring this game to an end, and as you may have guessed it: Most of the diary owners are generic anime bad guys, ranging from a terrorist, to a girl who commands a creepy religious cult, to a serial killer, to a psychopathic loli who somehow has access to dangerous weaponry and so on. Why would Deus choose a bunch of deranged people to this game? I dunno, it's almost like this is an anime and Yukiteru is supposed to be the protagonist who fights against a bunch of villains or something. There's a cop in the game, though, apparenly Deus' motivation to choose him would be to balance things out because the other Future Diary owners were horrible people, because surely one cop can stand up to almost a dozen dangerous criminals.\\n\\n\r\nPredictably, most of the other participants target Yukiteru because he's Deus' personal favorite pick for winner of the game (in other words, he's the protagonist of the show) and they all end up being defeated. Good thing they all conveniently attack him one at a time despite having a common goal in mind, otherwise I would start believing the characters in this show are actually smart or something. But even if they did attack Yukiteru and Yuno together, I'm sure the writers would find a way to make them fail, because Yukiteru has a plot armor that's somehow thicker than Sakae Esuno's skull. The bad guys have to be really dumb in such unbelievably contrived ways in order to lose their battles against Yukiteru and Yuno that it's really hard to take this shit seriously. Take Minene, the terrorist who's the ninth diary user, for example, she sneaks into Yukiteru and Yuno's school and somehow manages to set up bombs all over the place without being seen or suspected by anyone, which is fucking ridiculous, but I'll buy it. What I won't buy, though, is that she conveniently blows up one part of the school at a time, and it's always giving Yukiteru and Yuno just enough time to get away before they get blown up. She then blabbers about how this was all a plan to lure Yukiteru out, and she actually threatens to blow the whole school up. Well... Why doesn't she blow the whole school up? Isn't her objective to kill Yukiteru? By just blowing everything up from the get-go, she would have killed both Yukiteru and Yuno, two birds with one stone. But we all know why she didn't just do that, because then this garbage would have lasted for a mere two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other battles against diary users aren't much better than this, it always comes to them having Yukiteru and Yuno backed into a corner, with all the opportunities in the world to kill them, but failing because they're plagued by the powers of bad writing. The Future Diaries themselves are barely even worth talking about here, seriously, they're almost completely forgotten by the characters during these fights, and only do actualy predict the future when it's convenient to the plot, which makes them more of a cheap gimmick than anything else. Action scenes in spite of that aren't even that good, so just turning my brain off and enjoying the action was an impossibility, they're serviceable enough, save for some really stupid moments such as the fight against the twelfth diary user who acts like a tokustatsu hero, he hypnotizes some followers of the sixth diary user and they also wear wacky tokusatsu costumes to fight alongside him. His strategy is to confuse Yukiteru and Yuno because the costumes look similar, so they have trouble telling this guy apart from the others... Except they shouldn't have so much trouble because the costumes have different colors in their helmets, so even if he did blend in together with the others, he still has a specific color in his costume's helmet, but Yukiteru and Yuno are fucking idiots and take forever to get this guy for some reason. God, this is so dumb...\\n\\n\r\nEven worse than the fights is Mirai Nikki's pathetic attempt at character development. The diary users for the most part are generic anime archetypes with some edgy backstory thrown in there so the unfortunate viewer can maybe sympathize with them, and I mean, they do try really hard to get you to sympathize with these characters, if their stupid backstories didn't get you feeling sorry for them, the fact that most of them die right after those backstories are revealed definitely will! Or maybe you're an actual thinking person, and you realize these backstories don't matter in the end. Look at Tsubaki, the sixth diary user and leader of the previously mentioned generic evil cult that does whatever, she's a backstabbing bitch who wants to win the game because she hates the world and wants to destroy it. But hey, look at her background, she was randomly gang-raped by all the other males in her cult right after losing her parents, how ~sad~ and ~tragic~ a character this one is! The rape really drives the point home, it was completely necessary and had everything to do with the plot, man! What about Minene? The terrorist who blew a school up and possibly killed thousands of students in the process? Minene lost her parents and spent her childhood alone in some eastern country where religious extremists caused violent conflicts to happen, which eventually led to her hating religion... And eventually becoming a terrorist who fights against religion because God is evil and yadda yadda, yet doesn't think twice before blowing up schools and murdering thousands of students to achieve her goals. But wait, you're gonna love what comes next, trust me! Minene ends up being romantically engaged with a cop called Nishijima... A damn cop is in love with a terrorist who recently killed a lot of innocent people! Minene then \"softens up\" starts acting like a cookie-cutter tsundere in their \"cute\" romantic moments together, and it's like she never did anything wrong to begin with! She never shows any regret for killing all those people she killed back then, and may I remind you that Nishijima works for the Police! What the hell IS this shit? Am I supposed to just accept this as some kind of cute anime romance? What, does Nishijima see the real human bean behind this poor terrorist who's responsible for the grief of many families who sent their kids to school? Fuck you, Mirai Nikki. Fuck! You! It's already bad enough that you're implying rape victims become psychopaths, but now you're trying to pass murderous terrorists off as misunderstood humans who deserve love? What the fuck, man?\\n\\n\r\nNot even our main characters are exactly well-written either, Yukiteru is wildly inconsistent through the story and can go from a helpless loser to a badass whenever the plot needs him to do so, his relationship with Yuno is as deep and engaging as the romance in the Twilight saga is. He slowly starts to realize that Yuno may have a few screws loose and keeps oscilating between trusting her and not trusting her, yet this motherfucker keeps trusting Yuno even after she tries to kill his friends and even turns against him later! He has no real reason to trust Yuno aside from the fact that she protects him, but at this point it's pretty obvious that she has obscure reasons for doing so. Yuno is a yandere who loves Yukiteru, and that's basically all the characterization she gets, all of her dialogue and actions are about Yukiteru, and she also has a dark past, of course she does. Yuno was abused by her parents and became depressed, she was a loner in the classroom until one day she talked to Yukiteru and sorta made him promise he'll marry her in the future, he thought it was a joke and just accepted the proposal in an obviously half-hearted way. Do you think that's dumb? Yeah, me too. Oh, and also Yuno has what seems to be some dead bodies inside her house, which makes Nishijima get on her tail and start to question her about these rumors, Yuno reacts in the most \"obviously I did something wrong\" way possible, but Nishijima for some reason doesn't follow her or anything. I swear this dude is the worst cop of all time.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of this, time to crank up this diarrhea dile, because we're going to dive into the final act of Mirai Nikki, where things get even more hopelessly stupid than they already are! Yukiteru's father, who previously abandoned his son in a collapsing tower to save his own ass, by the way, was deceived into killing Yukiteru's mother by John Bacchus, the mayor of the city and the eleventh diary user. This makes Yukiteru go after him, the two to share an \"emotional\" reconciliation moment, only for them to get ambushed by Bacchus' goons who kill Yukiteru's father. Turns out this whole game was actually Bacchus' plan and he is the one who designed the Future Diaries, Bacchus somehow convinced Deus to go with this game and his motives for wanting to become the new God of Time and Space is that he's basically a Hitler wannabe. Why would Deus go with this plan to begin with? Is it even worth giving a fuck about the plot at this point?\\n\\n\r\nNow Yukiteru wants to win the game because he believes that will give him the power to revive his family... Yes, he thinks the God of Time and Space has life-restoring powers... This is our protagonist, ladies and gentlemen! This is hilariously retarded enough as it is, but Yukiteru could have literally just asked Deus if he could revive his family if he became the new god, there was nothing stopping him from doing so in the scene where Murmur implied the revival thing to him! \"Why doesn't Yuno tell Yukiteru that he's going full retard?\" you may ask, it's actually because she's also deceiving Yukiteru into believing that! Woah, what a shocking turn of events! Yukiteru just believes her, of fucking course he does, even though she lied to him multiple times at this point, caused the death of his friends and almost even killed him. But yeah, there's a really nonsensical plot twist regarding Yuno, and I'll spill it out right now.\\n\\n\r\nWalmart Kaworu eventually finds out that the Yuno that's been around the whole time is actually another Yuno from a different timeline where she indirectly killed Yukiteru and won the survival game. Seeing that she can't bring Yukiteru back to life, she then traveled back in time, killed her own parents in this timeline, as well as killed herself from this timeline and took her identity as Yuno. She's basically doing an infinite time loop where she spends time with Yukiteru, kills him at the end of the game and returns to the beginning to start it all over again.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, how is Yuno even still around? She went back in time and killed her version of this time, which means she was killed before entering the game and shouldn't be participating on it as a result. Alright, let's assume she's immune to time travel bullshit because she's technically God of Time and Space, then... How the hell can two Gods of Time and Space exist in the same universe? How is Yuno's meddling with time affecting Deus? Couldn't Deus see that Yuno comes from another timeline or that she's actually another god? If Deus died in the previous timeline, how can Yuno just travel back in time and have him be alive? Why doesn't Deus just do that to himself so he can just exist forever instead of bothering with all this stupid shit? What does Deus dying even mean? He dies but can be brought back to life later? His existence gets erased out? Who the hell knows? It's not like the writers are going to explain shit!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Yuno and Yukiteru are the only survivors left in the game, turns out Murmur has been secretly manipulating the game all along in order to have Yuno win, which is something Deus apparently never suspected, even though he's the fucking God of Time and Space and can see into the future! Murmur and Yuno travel back in time and end up creating a third timeline, but this time Yukiteru interferes with Minene's help. Yeah, Minene was kept alive by Deus. They end up saving the Yuno from that timeline and her parents before Yuno and Murmur could get to them, which ends up making this the happy timeline where not only Yuno, but everyone else apparently have peaceful lives now. How exactly does Yuno being saved affects everyone else's lives? What does Yuno's life have to do with Yukiteru's parents not divorcing? I don't know, I don't care either.\\n\\n\r\nThe Yuno we've seen this whole time kills herself and Yukiteru then becomes the new God of Time and Space. What does he do? Nothing, he becomes depressed over Yuno's death and doesn't do anything... Even though he's the fucking God of Time and Space and he can just travel back in time, meet Yuno in a new timeline, maybe save her and her parents like he did in the third timeline, I don't know. I guess that would mean Deus would also come back and there would be another death game, because this show's use of time travel is just great. Ten thousand years later, Yukiteru decides to create a new timeline while Murmur plans to create another survival game. Yeah, it's basically a failed attempt at a Gainax Ending.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else can I even say about Mirai Nikki? The visuals and animation aren't anything to write home about, in fact it looks weird sometimes and the CGI is terrible, but at least it looks okay for the most part. Music is also just there, I don't remember anything when it comes to the soundtrack, but the openings are pretty good, so at least there's that. The direction is also pretty sloppy sometimes, although it may be the fault of the source material, but aside from the characters dying pretty much in the same episode that reveals their background, this show has the tendency to immediately brush their deaths off by showing the main characters doing some random comical stuff right afterwards, which diminishes the impact of those deaths even more, and those awkward transitions are present in most of the story. Even if it was the source material's fault for having those same transitions, the anime should have improved on that instead of being such a literal adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Mirai Nikki is a trainwreck in every sense of the word. A poorly-written and poorly-directed mess that pretends it's smarter than it actually is, tries to mask its terrible plot and characters with shock value caused by gore, edgy characters and other themes it handles terribly, and can only be enjoyed people who literally turn their brains off, as many suggest. I would like to say there's some positives to talk about in the story, but I can't see them, the premise is stupid, the story has enough plot holes to cover the moon, the characters are not only unlikeable, but also poorly-written, and the ending is a forced attempt at tragedy. Some people still like Mirai Nikki, even though they admit it's not a good anime, because apparently it's \"so bad it's good\" so they watch it for laughs, but I seriously can't even give Mirai Nikki this much credit because I was outright pissed off when I watched it, I just couldn't believe how retarded all of this was getting, and the final act was the point where I just gave up and wanted to finish this anime just for the sake of finishing it. I would watch other bad popular anime like Sword Art Online, Guilty Crown, Akame ga Kill or even School Days over Mirai Nikki any day of the week, at least most of those shows had something going for them, they actually made me create expectations before going to shit. Mirai Nikki, on the other hand, is a show I went in with extremely low expectations, and it didn't even meet those low expectations to begin with.",

The game spins around these devices that lead participants close to their objective.\r\nI found it frustrating, in a good way, that when an episode ended it made me want to watch more.. so I couldn't take a break.So I continued watching being constantly impressed by the things people can do when their lives are at stake or when they want tobecome god(for more ambitious ones). It was really tiresome to see Yukiteru being \"stabbed in the back\" over and over again only to find him always alone. Still this points out a horrible truth about this world, the fact that you can't see someone for who he really is.\\n\r\nAlso, the series is full of interesting motives and philosophical concepts that makes it worthwhile watching.\\n\r\nArtwork consists of a perfect balance since its not too flashy and characters as well as background are designed well, making it ideal for those who want to follow the story as me.\\n",

            "content": "1. Introduction/Synopsis: \r\nSuppose you are an everyday, normal high school student with no outstanding attributes or friends. You're not particularly good at sports or at academics, though you are pretty good at throwing darts. You spend most of your time keeping a diary of random things that happen around you and talking with an imaginary friend you invented called \"Deus Ex Machina\", the God of Space and time and his adorable little side-kick \"Murmur\". \r\nThen suddenly, one day out of nowhere, Deus gives you a diary and mentions something about a game. Entries pop up in your diary you haven't written yourself and it foretellsfuture events spanning the next 90 days. All of it comes true. \\n\\n\r\nYour whole world turns upside down as you find out that your life is in danger and you have been placed in a game where there are 11 others like you with a diary that can be used to predict and even rewrite the future. You are forced to kill or die in an elimination battle to determine who will next ascend the Throne to Godhood after Deus. In the process, you gain an unnerving, relentless stalker girl who at first seems cute, but is completely insane. \\n\\n\r\nYou are thrown into battles with opponents several levels out of your league from child prodigy to cult leader, with no one to protect you except the stalker. And more and more is revealed along the way to unnerve you as plot thickens and conspiracies unfold to make you shake in both fear and excitement. \\n\\n\r\nCongratulations, you now know what it's like to be Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano, the main character of Mirai Nikki. \\n\\n\r\n1. Story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTwo things stand out most when watching Mirai Nikki - its thrilling plot and its vast array of characters with their own unique back-stories and layers of depth. What makes the plot amazing is the characters, and what makes the characters amazing is the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself employs the \"layer\" method, which peels away depths of the story and the background of the two main characters - Yuki and his stalker girlfriend Yuno as we progress through battles with each and every other unique diary user. And this method is extremely effective as we switch between finding out more about the two main characters Yuki and Yuno, battles and back-stories with the other ten diary users, Deus and Murmur, and even non-diary users that become relevant to the central story. \\n\\n\r\nThe mood of the story is very, very dark - it is both psychological thriller and partly horror. Not supernatural horror like ghosts and zombies, but the horror comes in the form of Gasai Yuno. And the best part about the story is ---spoiler--- that you cannot bring back those you have killed using either cheap plot devices or Deus Ex Machina (which is ironic, because that's the name of the God of Space and time). That in itself gets a lot of points. \\n\\n\r\nWith the dark mood and the layer method that slowly peels away at dark secrets and locked away pasts that we are scared, but excited to see, the story becomes very captivating and really draws you in. To be frank, I was pretty much addicted to the show throughout. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending, My GOD the ending. If there is anything so perfect and amazing to the plot is how the series ends, when the final layer is peeled and we find out terrible things about Gasai Yuno, who is not whom she seems to be. I won't go beyond that so that I won't spoil anything, but trust me when I say you will want to watch it to the end to find out the unravel entire back-story of hers. \\n\\n\r\nIf I do have one gripe about the story, it's that it seems the original creator wanted Yuki and Yuno to touch base and have a standoff with every single character. That is not realistic, in my opinion, and I feel it would have been better done and more realistic if more of the other diary users could fight with each other rather than have them all face the two main characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a survival battle, after all and in reality, other characters will try to face other characters in the meantime. \\n\\n\r\n2. Art 9/10: \\n\\n\r\nThe style of art is quite well done. I really enjoyed the dark style that comes with the setting and horror element complimented with some light-hearted, humorous events that span the series from school life to Gasai Yuno's awkwardness and hilarious stalker things she does. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the best part was the style in the opening theme with the use of darkness and light. And Gasai Yuno's insanity was portrayed really, really well. \\n\\n\r\nExcellently done. I am not a big fan of horror itself, so I couldn't find it in me to give the style of art a full score. If I particularly enjoyed horror, I would have given it a perfect 10/10! \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound 8/10: \\n\\n\r\nMusic - the music was wonderfully done, complimenting the horror and the action scenes very well. The opening theme and the ending theme was superb in my opinion and I would personally love to hear more by people who created the music!\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting - Ugh... while I do enjoy some, if not most of the voice actors (especially Gasai Yuno, whoever voiced her is a genius), I could not quite find it in myself to give the voice a full score because of Yukiteru Yuki and his constant whining. He's not the character with the strongest of heart and he isn't the most annoying character in the history of anime, but that still does not mean I don't want to tear my hair out if I have to hear him whine one more time. Anyway, my rant on Yukiteru will continue in the Character section. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects - very well done, especially the gun shots, the explosions, and the clash of sword on sword. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, aside from a few minor complaints on voice acting, I rather enjoyed the sounds! \\n\\n\r\n4. Characters 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nWe're going to break this down into 4 major categories: Yuno and Yuki, Deus and Murmur, the other diary users, and the non-diary users. Warning - there WILL be LIGHT SPOILERS ahead. I will always try to keep it to a minimum, but with Mirai Nikki, it is almost unavoidable. \\n\\n\r\n(1.a) Yukiteru \"Amano\" Yuki 6/10 - Starting out, he showed promise. He was a normal high school student, perhaps slightly selfish and a loner, but he seemed like the kind of guy who had potential to make exciting things happen. And then, he... doesn't follow through. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't mind that he is a weak character. I don't need a character to be strong in order to like him or her. Gasai Yuno more than makes up for him (see 1.b Gasai Yuno). What I cannot stand is an overly idealistic character that whines all the time and tries to save everyone even though he neither possesses the skill nor strength to do so. He cannot accept reality and is extremely emotionally weak. To me, he is the true damsel in distress in the series who is constantly whining with Gasai Yuno being the knight in shining armor turned monster. If I have to hear him whine and say \"I want to save everybody\" one more time, I will either tear my hair out or the person's next to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut towards the end, he does turn out quite interesting in his own way, especially when he is later corrupted by Gasai Yuno and he does things that cannot be taken back, breaking gears just to find out that he cannot reverse it. And that's why I did not give him a failing score. We're going into heavy spoiler zone here, so I'll just leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nSo to those who want to drop the series just because of this guy, I say - grind on. There is hope for him in the end, yet! :D\\n\\n\r\n(1.b) Gasai Yuno 12/10. Yes. 12. Not 10 out of 10. 12 out of 10. That's how amazing of a character she is. I rarely grade a character above a full score, but for her, I had to make an exception.\\n\\n\r\nShe is Yuki's psychopathic Knight in shining armor turned Monster. She is the epitome of Yandere and characters. She did so many unspeakable things and hides them so well that it took Yuki and even Akise (the genius detective and the strongest non-diary user) a long time to find out. She stalks Yuki and tricks him so many times into loving her, then betraying his trust, but in the end, he still falls for her. Plus I love girls going after guys :D. \\n\\n\r\nShe also gets bonus points for being a strong female character, as I am quite fond of anime who have males and females balanced with equal status. I am a strong advocate of equal rights and opportunity after all. She takes out some of the strongest diary users like they are nothing as if she were rigged (and towards the end, you find out it makes perfect sense). She has one of the most horrible and darkest secrets that you WANT to find out about as well as a past that explains it all. She is mentally unbalanced and completely insane. And she seems to be in conspiracy with either Murmur or Deus. \\n\\n\r\nShe drives the plot forward towards the future and even back into the past with the backstories. Every time something is revealed about her or she does something unspeakable, you never fail to cover your mouth and gasp. She is full of surprises and never ceases to amaze you. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is any reason to watch Mirai Nikki, it is her. Trust me, just like you want to watch Great Teacher Onizuka just for Eichiro Onizuka, you will want to watch Mirai Nikki just for this girl. \\n\\n\r\nAgain 12/10. Masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n(2) Other diary users 10/10 - There are 12 in total, so excluding Yuki and Yuno, there are still 10 others. I enjoyed every single last one of them from child prodigy to cult leaders. I'm not going to go into depth on all of them as my review is already longer than I had anticipated. So I'm going to talk about the few that I particularly enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nNamely - Uryuu Minene XD! *Goes into fanboy mode* She hands down my 2nd favorite character next to Gasai Yuno. She is unpredictable as she is an international terrorist (yes, terrorist, and no I don't think she's part of the Al-Qaeda) and she uses BOMBS, takes HOSTAGES, and is not afraid to use any method no matter how unorthodox it is to survive. Plus she loses an eye early on and has to wear an eyepatch. I wanted to date at least one girl who wears an eyepatch after that XD. \\n\\n\r\nAfter her would be Reisuke Houjou, the 4 year old child prodigy who has the knowledge of an elite university student and he is so cute that you cannot help but neglect thinking of him as someone dangerous. And then wake up and find yourself in a setting similar to the games that John Kramer from \"Saw\" has planned. The child sets you to be trapped in a twisted \"game\" where he makes the rules and you have to play by those rules. He has fun along the way, not killing you immediately but instead toying with you along the way to get maximum enjoyment to the point where even the invincible Gasai Yuno is almost killed by him. This is the first time we meet a character who is as twisted and insane as Yuno herself. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the other 8 are nearly just as good! They each have their own backstory from twisted to tragic. Each of them are geniuses in their own rights and have their own unique ways of fighting from commanding humans/beasts to setting traps and even dueling you in straightforward combat. \\n\\n\r\nNot all of the diary-users and their back-stories are strong, but they are strong enough overall to make me give them an overall 10/10. They are a wonderful cast and very few of them will leave you bored (*cough* though I can't stand that masked superhero*cough* He annoys me almost as much as Yuki).\\n\\n\r\n(3). Deus and Murmur 9/10 - I can't say much without spoiling much, but let's just say they make quite an interesting pair. they are exactly the polar opposites of each other. He is huge, she is tiny. He is cold and calculated, she is cute and bubbly. He is sane and thinks with reason, she... doesn't. XD\\n\\n\r\nAnd they play each other for fools, as they each have their own way of trying to figure out the intentions of the other. \\n\\n\r\n(4) Non-diary users 8/10 - Most of them are a bit meh for me. Nishijima (a police officer who is in love with Uryuu Minene) and Kosaka (who used to bully Yuki and then turned his friend) are slightly enjoyable in their own way, but also very annoying. So is the girl Hinata Hino who ---spoiler--- commands the army of hounds for her grandfather who turns out to be the true diary user. \\n\\n\r\nSo why give it such a high 8 out of 10? One word - ARU AKISE XD! *Goes into fanboy mode*\\n\\n\r\nHe is my 3rd favorite character and hands down my favorite male character in the series. First, he is a genius detective and is extremely hilarious. ---spoiler---He fools you into thinking he is a diary user and even I suspected and groaned when I thought he was, but was shocked to find that he is not. ---spoiler--- He merely has genius deductive skills to the point that you think he could predict the future. \\n\\n\r\nHe is amongst the first to figure out the truth behind Yuno and Murmur (no, I won't tell you what it is in the review, so either you watch it for yourself or google it, though I highly recommend you watch it for yourself). He is the strongest of the non-diary user with both wits and brawn and nearly matches Yuno in hand-to-hand combat. If Yuno is the most unpredictable character, then Akise is the best character at deduction and prediction. \\n\\n\r\nPLUS ---SPOILER--- He shares a kiss scene with Yuki at some point, which will probably appease all the Yaoi fans out there. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the characters make the plot work, and trust me when I say you do want to watch the series for the character, which I feel is the one element Mirai Nikki did best. \\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinally, enjoyment? It sends me on an emotional coaster and a huge mindfuck through the entire series. It is one of the pinnacles of psychological thrillers alongside the big names of Death Note, Code Geass, and Monster, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIs never failed to keep me captivated, even if I felt it started slow at first. It escalated really fast and ALL the characters get their own time and backstories. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Conclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my all-time favorite series. It is one of the reasons I am glad to have joined MAL, with special thanks to AviJii who introduced this to me in the first place. :D\\n\\n\r\nIt made me laugh, it made me gasp, it made me cry, it kept me captivated through. This is one of those series that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch an anime that will blown your mind away. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended to anyone who wants a good story with SOLID characters, including an insane stalker with an unstable mind XD. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Excellent\\n\\n\\n\r\nRemember, this review is personal and based on my personal experience of it, and it will be unfair to expect everyone to agree. \\n\\n\r\nSo I ask you, the readers of my review: What about you? What did you think? Feel free to agree or disagree and point out what you thought you liked or disliked about Mirai Nikki! :D",

            "content": "Just your average-everyday anime-viewer here, with another review!\r\nAs any accustomed anime-viewer on the internet and surfing about in the vast corners of the ever expanding sea of information (or in my case, the shallow waters of 9GAG), then you have probably already heard of what could really be considered as the birthplace to \"The Original Overly Attached Girlfriend\", or at least by the anime community. I am of course referring to Yuno. Booting up the first episode and having quite a few expectations as to what I am about to witness, not only were they confirmed but actually exceeded these expectiations quite exceptionally. But (yes,there's a butt), as this show is highly claimed to be one of the better horror, gore and phsycological anime out there, which I totally agree on, there are a few flaws that just needs to be adressed. And now, I can already feel that DEAD END coming for the button \"Not Helpful\" by mobs of people who are sharpening their pitchforks and lightening the bonfires. In this case, the Mirai Nikki fanbase...\\n\\n\r\nBefore reading on, this review is spoiler-free, so don't worry should you want to watch this show after reading the review. I take it that you've read the synopsis yourself and maybe even watched the show. This review also comes with a TL;DR section as well as a few additional details, right at the bottom before the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story: 9/10\\n\r\nWith a premise of a Deathgame (one that we should be quite used to after this, Deadman Wonderland and many others, including The Hunger Games), this one actually has the most interesting twist to the game, or at least in my humble opinion (IMHO). In the beginning of the show, everything we need to know is covered, nothing more and nothing less, leaving what will actually happen in the game itself very vague and up for the imagination to come up with how they will execute the plot (and players). This is crucial, as this leaves an exciting and often curious mind-set into each and every episodes, which however lasts only in the first few episodes. They show us these few episodes and the set-up quite remarkably fast and informative. Then, the show divides itself up in different parts where Yuuki and co. has to kill (or something else) the player of the episode. Or rather, episodes. Here lies one of the problems I metioned in the beginning. While the player-arcs are interesting, thrilling and a treat to watch, other arcs feel emptier. Not by means of action and excitement but BECAUSE of the player-arcs, they seem insignificant even though they are not. Towards the end, everything connects and starts to conclude the series when you suddenly remember that one thing from the second or third episode and realise that there's three more episodes left. I'm not saying that the ending was bad, but if it was something I want to adress to the ending, it was that urge and need to stand out, and therefore, it felt rushed and incomplete. Mirai Nikki, you already stand out in terms of storytelling, execution and characters. C'mon, you're better than that. But, it still leaves with a hail-mary and a strong, solid exit (as long as you see the OVA: Mirai Nikki Redial).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 8/10\\n\r\nOne thing I immediately think of when referring to the art of Mirai Nikki is its great crispness of details and actual emotions & distress (and on multiple occasions, Yuno's absolute horrifying expressions she can make) that they manage to display to us. Blood and action is basically the name of the game here and it is where Mirai Nikki truly shines, with progression through aggression. Action-scenes are a feast for the eyes and every action counts, every DEAD END significant and every death remarkable. It blends extremely well with the tone of the show and even parts that aren't that common in anime makes great usage here. And by that, I mean how they use 3D models. Sure, 3D-models shouldn't really be used unless with absolute necessity but they managed to pull it of here. And after all this praising and telling how good it was, I gotta tell ya, it doesn't stand out. For a thriller, the colours are warmer than most other thrillers out there, but can get to those levels when the plot requires it to be so or under heavy rain (...). But still, it passes with flying colours and there shouldn't be any complaints here, but neither should there be excessive amounts of praise. Have to balance out...\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'll start off the same way an episode of a usual anime starts, with the OP. Having two OPs, the first one being \"K\u016bs\u014d Mythology\" performed by Y\u014dsei Teikoku is one that not only reflects the anime brutally perfect within the one-and-a-half-minute it is on air, but also sticks on your mind during the episode and after it as well. And as they usually do, they replace it halfways. Compared to the first, \"Dead End\" by Faylan has nothing on OP1. Inside the episode, the music amplifies the scenes complimentary with great effect, but only the heavy action scenes and the rare \"feels-scenes\". Here lies another problem, as great as they are, none are rememberable and are used a few more times than I wanted. Still, I find Mirai Nikki having great pieces of music that fit well with the show but not outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 9/10\\n\r\nWe've got the coward, Yuuki. We've got the mad one, Yuno. And we've got a heck of other characters where we do not know who to care enough of shit about. Don't get me wrong, the cop and the girl who can escape from anything are interesting characters and have an interesting backstory to boot. But what about the other characters? Is a two-minute explanation of a players motives good enough? Here, they can variey, as all characters are unique and have unique motivations along with unique diaries. Then there are the side-characters, who the series try their very, very best to make us give an actual fuck about and even made one of them important! All I'm saying is that there are many great characters, add on a few characters where we kinda give a fuck about and a handful of which we give absolutely no fuck about. The problem lies within the amount and significance ratio between them and spread butter evenly on a 24-sliced loaf and some characters will have more fucks deserved and a few lesser than they need. And you only have so much fucks to give...\\n\r\nBut, all the significant characters are interesting, have actual human thoughts and reasons (excluding Yuno or others when thinking about it...) and their reactions and emotions feels real (excluding Yuno at certain times...).\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt was a fun ride, and with that 26-episode mark, a rewatch was all worth it. I give 10/10 here and I have nothing more to say other than that I really enjoyed this show despite its flaws that comes along with it.\\n\\n\r\nHow it was Overall: 8.8/10\\n\r\nBy no means is this the best show ever, trust me. But it is a fantastic show that has the stamp of a \"Must Watch\" on it and it is a perfect addition to my (and hopefully yours) ever expanding library of anime. Having one of the craziest lunatics in anime-history, Yuno will kill you if you don't watch this anime and enjoy it to a certain extent. If not Yuno, then the Mirai Nikki fanbase. This show has hype, and most of it is well deserved :)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n+ Original Deathgame\\n\r\n+/- Great pacing at certain parts, downright wrong in others\\n\r\n+ Every action and death has impact\\n\r\n+/- Twisted but strong ending (remember to watch the OVA)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Great detail and overall animation\\n\r\n+ Action-scenes are the best\\n\r\n+/- Doesn't have that kind of dark-tone that thrillers usually have, but it's good enough\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Awesome OP1\\n\r\n- Replaced halfway by a comparably worse OP2\\n\r\n+ Great overall background music that amplifies the show well\\n\r\n+/- No rememberable pieces\\n\r\n+/- Set on repeat\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n+ Great main-characters\\n\r\n+ Interesting and diverse player-characters\\n\r\n+/- A tap too many characters\\n\r\n+/- The side characters overall\\n\r\n+ Most characters have real human emotions and reasons\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n+ Worth it\\n\r\n+ Must see\\n\r\n+ That urge to watch another episode is strong on this one\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Details:\\n\r\n* Romance: Well, not your average kind of romance...\\n\r\n* Gore & Blood: Excessive amounts, but used sparingly\\n\r\n* Comedic Add-ons: Rare and often not noticable\\n\r\n* Feel-warning?: You could say that towards the ending\\n\r\n* Fan-service?: In small amounts, nothing that'll bother you enough to ruin the show\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you've managed to get this far without immediately gotten a DEAD END on your phone or just headed straight for the \"Not Helpful\" button after having read the intro to this review, I would like to thank you for your time spent on reading this review by basically the most pathetic, average, no-life of an anime-viewer that I am...just like Yuuki :)\\n\\n\r\nSo, smack that \"Helpful\" button for me (or Yuno, whatever you prefer) and leave a comment so I can make better reviews that might fit your taste better :)\\n\\n\r\n- Just your average-everyday anime-viewer\\n\r\n//VoidX",

            "content": "Sakae Esuno\u2019s Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a fine combination of suspense, blood, and violent action. It is a psychological thriller that revolves around two middle schoolers, Yuki (the male protagonist) and Yuno (the female protagonist), participating in a deadly battle royale with 10 strangers. It\u2019s personally one of my favorite gory anime, but it lacks the opportunity to become a more frightening series. Mirai Nikki\u2019s reputation as a gruesome anime is mostly thanks to the memorable Yandere character, Gasai Yuno. Commonly known as Yuki's psychotic stalker in the series, Yuno describes herself as \u201ca half moon\u201d that has \u201ca bright half and a darkhalf.\u201d The anime involves reverse gender roles with the girl protecting the guy under any circumstances, delivering bloody violence at every corner. However, the few downsides of the anime, including plot twists and some wacky characters, can cause one to produce mixed feelings about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7)\\n\r\nThe rules of the game are pretty straightforward: kill everyone until you\u2019re the last one standing. Thankfully, there are no sudden changes in the rules or mercy shown between characters to interrupt the flow. The participants\u2019 sudden actions constantly changes the future of other participants, creating new objectives between characters. However, it causes a slight downfall when Yuki is immediately made the center of attention among the other 11 diary holders, when Deus Ex Machina declares Yuki as his favorite to win the game. Despite the shocking events that leads to the conclusion of the game, that particular part of the story already makes the story seem clich\u00e9d. The reward for the winner is becoming Dues Ex Machina\u2019s successor as the next God of Time and Space. It sounds boring, but it is understandable considering the powers that come with being a god. Characters have either good (reviving a lost friend or family member) or evil (time traveling to cause destruction to an individual\u2019s life) intentions. The characters\u2019 motives bring some excitement to the story, but it could\u2019ve been a more captivating story.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not original as it is another battle royale anime, but there are some unique aspects to the story. One is the different forms of their diaries. Although the majority of the diaries are cell phones, other diaries are suitable for certain characters\u2019 situations. Each diary also has special features specifically for that particular diary holder, giving that person an advantage over other diary holders. The show provides backgrounds on each participant of the game, instead of only focusing on the two main leads, to help the viewer determine whether or not certain characters are likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some light humor within the series, particularly with the quotes. E.g. Yuki yells \u201cCrazy stalker alert!\u201d or similar quotes in his head in reference to Yuno in an episode or two. Additionally, the characters' actions may seem illogical (e.g. a diary holder mysteriously hopping on a motorcycle to escape from death), but it\u2019s important to be mindful that the anime is meant to be supernatural. The winner becomes the God of Time and Space after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fast-paced and doesn\u2019t beat around the bush with fillers. The violence in the anime goes from light-heavy-light (introduction of the game to its conclusion). Deaths are not sudden, allowing the viewer to understand the characters\u2019 motives by providing backstories. Romance is one-sided in the beginning as a cowardly Yuki only teams up with the tough Yuno to protect himself. However, love slowly becomes mutual as they survive several obstacles together. \\n\\n\r\nMultiple plot twists and plot holes cause questions like \u201cWait. What just happened?\u201d There are tons of them present within the series. It requires patience as some parts are not fully explained until the last few episodes. The ending throws in a major plot twist by taking the viewer through parallel universes, so it could appear confusing. It ends with a cliffhanger, but its 30-minute sequel Mirai Nikki Redial completes the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7)\\n\r\nThere are both notable and forgettable characters in Mirai Nikki, and the characters\u2019 personalities range from wacky to badass. Character development is excellent, even though it takes a while to become present in some characters. Within the 12 diary owners, you have a terrorist, a 4-year-old mastermind, and a fatal married couple. Although there are a few unattractive villains, the majority of them are unforgettable and capable of becoming one\u2019s favorite character from the show or anime in general. Uniquely, all 12 diary holders, including Yuki and Yuno, are named after Roman gods and goddesses. Yuki is named after Jupiter, the god of the sky, weather, and lightning. \\n\\n\r\nYuki appears in the show as a whiny and gullible male lead, who doesn\u2019t seem to understand or accept the dangers of the game. His character develops into someone more self-confident and manly as one tragic event leads to another, contributing to the show\u2019s terror. Yuno is the Yandere female lead of the show who truly highlights the gore and violence that makes Mirai Nikki an excellent psychological thriller. Although she is shown as strictly a creepy obsessive stalker in the beginning, her character becomes more reasonable near the end as her past is completely exposed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\r\nAnimation was mostly good and fit the horrific and bloody atmosphere, especially Yuno\u2019s killing sprees. Character designs are both good and bad. All characters are distinguishable, even though some designs are non-menacing. Some of the villains had ridiculous designs that would probably scare the crap out of you if he/she stands at your bedside, but it may appear more comical through the screen, unless you\u2019re watching it in 3D. E.g. The Twelfth diary holder wears a large, round one-eyed mask, while acting like a Marvel superhero. Also, Deus Ex Machina and Murmur looks more like child-friendly mythical creatures instead of horrifying. Although there are bloody and disturbing scenes that are intended to make Mirai Nikki horrifying, the character designs take away a portion of the horror.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2019 emotions and personalities were detailed, giving off the fearful atmosphere. E.g. Yuno\u2019s appearance was timely with immediate switches from her innocence to psychotic features. Yuki\u2019s eyes displaced fear within the series to fulfill his earliest role as a major coward. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\r\nThe Japanese voices expresses the anime\u2019s terrifying atmosphere more so than the English voices. Japanese VA Tomosa Murata has the perfect voice to bring out Yuno\u2019s psychological features. She gives Yuno an innocent voice to embrace her split personality. In contrast, English VA Brina Palencia makes Yuno sound like a tomboy, and there's no innocence in her voice. Yuki\u2019s character is voiced by a female seiyuu named Misuzu Togashi. A female voice is more reasonable considering his pathetic and cowardly attitude within the series. The OP, ED, and background music suit Mirai Nikki\u2019s creepy theme, making it one of the anime\u2019s strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nI\u2019m a sucker for anime listed under the horror and psychological thriller genre, and Mirai Nikki is quite a thrill. The action and murders are entertaining, but I wished for the story to be more menacing that it already was. The character development enabled me to tolerate certain characters after a while and find some of them likeably remarkable. I grew confused with the plot twists, but the story began to unravel near the end. This is one anime I wouldn\u2019t mind re-watching multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\r\nMirai Nikki has an interesting story full of gore and violence that overcomes the plot twists. The viewer is introduced to a vast amount of potential likeable characters. A small number of characters may look and act too comical, making the anime seem less serious. On the bright side, the combination of the suspense, character development, and sound contribute to Mirai Nikki\u2019s psychological theme. If you're a fan of gore and survival anime, I recommend giving Mirai Nikki a try.",

            "content": "It's been quite a while since I've seen a series as laughably bad as Future Diary. Focused on a survival game with our weak-willed male lead Yukiteru and a yandere gal named Yuno obsessively in love with him, this series is a huge mess with plot and character developments, proper logic, mood consistency and relishing in its graphic and depraved content way too much.\r\nThe biggest issue that stems with Future Diary is that it seems to get too fixated in advancing its plot head-on without any regard for proper depth, buildup and consistency. There are a number of unexplored elements to the series like howYukiteru became acquainted with Deus and why many of the folks Deus chose for the survival game are a bunch of psychopaths, criminals and loons. Logic is tossed out the window with how certain plot setups occur and characters making decisions that don't make much sense like one character able to rig a ridiculous number of bombs throughout a school without anyone even noticing and Yukiteru continuing to trust Yuno despite knowing full well how much of a nutcase she is. A number of the players in the survival game don't get much depth beyond being crazed loons and criminals, and those who do get some sort of depth only get them in a scope of a couple episodes where their mentality for the violent and depraved acts they commit don't make any sense and seemed sloppily pasted together. The series lacks a consistent mood as it tries mixing around deadly serious storytelling and comedy at a number of points with the interactions between Yuno and Yukiteru, which felt awkward and ill-timed in execution. The final episodes of the series seemed sloppy in their execution with convenient developments and plot twists that either get convoluted or are poorly explored. And lastly, it tends to relish too greatly at many points in its graphic and depraved content with a good number of violent and gory scenes, a good amount of nudity and sexual content, torture, rape, child abuse, terrorism and a diverse number of ways to murder folks. It's like whoever made this series wanted to make it a seinen title, yet winded up with the immaturity and cheesiness you would find with a cookie-cutter shounen title in the way it is set up and structured.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to Future Diary are on the plain side with character designs sporting the typical mainstream look and scenery shots being decent with what they deliver. The CG animation for this (used mostly with vehicles or rendering the world of Deus ex Machina) is a bit sloppy as it looks awkwardly rendered and clearly sticks out from the typical animation of the series. The animation is nothing to write home about either with flat choreography during fight scenes and a decent number of animation shortcuts used throughout the title's run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Future Diary is one of the biggest messes in quality that I've seen in a while from a title getting plenty of hype from anime fans. With no regard for proper depth, consistency and buildup in the treatment of its plot and characters, as well as relishing in its objectionable content and themes, Future Diary is a lovely train wreck of a title that may get either disgust or unintentional laughs from fans with its content and sloppy execution.",

            "content": "Notice: this review will contain a few spoilers. I'll mark them but if you haven't watched this yet, proceed with caution. Sorry about that.\r\nSurvival games have always been one of my favorite kinds of stories. I just love them. So naturally, when I heard about Mirai Nikki's premise, I was greatly looking forward to it. Unfortunately, after an excellent first episode, this series began to get worse and worse; by the end of it all, it had become nothing but a huge disappointment.\r\nLet's begin with the positive aspects of this show. The art and animation in Mirai Nikki are, for the most part, rather good,but nothing very impressive. As for character designs, it's pretty hit-and-miss. Some characters look OK, while others are so ridiculous it makes the anime seem/feel less serious than it should be, which is NOT a good thing for a thriller/mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great. Most of the tracks are somewhat memorable and fit their scenes well. The OPs and EDs are also very nice, with the first OP being particularly awesome. I never skipped them. Voice acting-wise, everyone does a solid, consistent job, except for Yuno's seiyuu. I'm sorry, but her voice was annoying and hearing that infamous \"Yukki!\" every god damn minute was painful.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the bad stuff. While the premise is amazing, the story & script are very poorly written. Thing is, Mirai Nikki is a shounen trying (and failing) to be a seinen; thus, it lacks the maturity and depth needed to handle the kind of story it offers. Many questions are left unanswered, some of the writing choices are just plain stupid, half of the characters have a very low IQ and, for a mystery, there aren't that many twists, and those the anime DOES have are often predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole concept of using Future Diaries to outsmart opponents in deadly, tense battles is BARELY explored, plus the battles themselves seldom involve complexity. When you've got tools as powerful as those, you'd think there'd be gambits just piling up on each other, but no. Many battles are over within a minute and are so basic it's insulting. Speaking of insulting, this show has a nasty tendency to have its world just forget about some of the big events related to the diary holders. Normally the media would be all over a series of bombings, massacres, etc... but here? Nah, it's just Tuesday again. It's astonishing how everyone can easily get away from anything.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this anime is its bad habit of throwing in bits of humor in the middle of serious moments. It really kills the atmosphere and it's not funny. Even in the more lighthearted scenes it's not funny. Since we're talking about the atmosphere, have I mentioned that some details in crucial moments are overlooked, which obliterates the immersion? Empty hospitals, incompetent cops, silent bystanders...it's the little things that can make or break the mood. A shame, really, because the anime IS able to create a good, creepy atmosphere at times (ex.: the end of episode 3).\\n\\n\r\nRemember what I said about there being a lot of predictable twists? I kinda lied. The biggest twist in the whole story, which unfolds in the last few episodes, took me by surprise. Did it make sense? Well, yes, at least until the anime began to blatantly make shit up on the spot. Did it answer a few questions? For sure. Did it raise even more questions - most of which remain unanswered - and present to us an INCREDIBLY STUPID twist later? OH YES.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the worst part of it all. The characters. If you're already angry at me, stop reading because I will not be gentle.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters we have the male protagonist, Yukiteru (or just Yuki). This guy. Let me tell you something about this guy: he might just be one of the worst written characters I have ever seen. No hyperbole there. Not because he's a wimp 95% of the time - I can understand why. No-one normal would stay frosty after being dragged into a survival game full of maniacs. So why is he so bad then? It's because he's absurdly inconsistent. Most selective memory of all time, gullible when not paranoid (never with the correct timing), ability to forgive that defies common sense and, later on, he can't even settle on a personality (which seems to run in the family). Worst part is, his personality shift happens suddenly; he gets almost no development for 18 or so episodes then BAM! complete 180. If you're going to change a character's attitude, make sure it isn't baffling and that it sticks.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have our female protagonist, Yuno, the main source of yandere-ness, fanservice and body bags. THE poster girl of Mirai Nikki, to the point where she may be more popular than the show itself - just look at how many favorites she has here at MAL. The creator knew of this, so s/he made her the most complex character in the whole cast and genuinely fun to watch. Unfortunately, that complexity only really shows up in the last few episodes, so until then she's pretty much a one note character - crush, kill, Yukki!. Moreover, the yandere trait eventually wears off, meaning she can get kinda annoying afterwards, even with all the carnage she provides. If it cannot wear off for you, then Mirai Nikki will be considerably more entertaining. Either way, Yuno was a hit-or-miss character for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast - Yuki's friends and the other diary holders - is where it gets ugly. Out of the former group, the ONLY truly memorable character (and, might I add, one of the few characters in this anime that I liked) is the intelligent Akise. His personality and abilities are a perfect match for this kind of story, which is a shame because he didn't get enough screen time. The other three, despite getting some things accomplished, end up being inept at almost everything, to the point that Akise pretty much has to carry the team.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other diary holders...just where do I begin? For starters, they're pretty much all insane or very dangerous individuals, except for maybe 2 of them; that alone raises a pretty important question: \"why did Deus even consider letting one of those crazy bastards be his successor?\". Another problem is that some may as well have \"fodder\" written on their foreheads: most don't even last for three episodes, plus they're lucky if they get a mediocre, unpolished back story full of cheap shocks to make you feel bad for them. \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS PRESENT IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHS* What kills me is that some of the diary holders are such piles of stupid writing it's absurd. I mean, one of them is a 5-year-old kid who's just as messed up as the others, somehow has access to stuff like toxic gas and who can formulate rather elaborate plans. Another is the mama bear of an orphanage composed of people who are willing to erase anyone for her - dressed as ninjas, no less. Yet another is a blind Power Rangers fanatic who dresses up as an eyeball (and who can somehow bring dolls to life. Never explained!) to fight crime. Remember, this anime takes itself seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the eleventh diary holder, the Hitler wannabe who gave Deus the idea for the diaries. Since the anime never even tries to further explore such an important character, allow me to ask some questions: how did he (or any of the diary holders) meet Deus? Why did Deus even listen to this obviously crazy man? Why future diaries, and not some kind of superpower? By the way, why is Deus decaying? What is MurMur's origin? Why did EVERY ONE of the diary holders only gun for Yuki? The questions pile up fast once the characters are taken into consideration. \\n\\n\r\nWas there not a single diary holder that I liked? The answer is yes. That would be Minene, the ninth, the series' resident internationally wanted terrorist (at the tender age of 18. Seriously). She was pretty awesome and likable for most of her screen time, which made watching her turn into a textbook tsundere even more painful. And let's not talk about her ABSOLUTELY STUPID role in the final marathon of twists. *SPOILERS END HERE*\\n\\n\r\nWhat about enjoyment? Believe me in this one: if you pay attention to the writing, Mirai Nikki will be painful. The mountain of questions, the absurd decisions that some of the characters make, etc...you just won't get a lot of breaks after the first few episodes. So what if you employ the good ol' \"turn off your brain\" strategy? It probably won't be all that enjoyable either. As I've said before, this is a shounen trying to be a seinen. You can just FEEL it try. And fail. I don't know about the rest of you, but that really kills the experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mirai Nikki is a huge disappointment. Its messy story and weak characters are simply not fit for the genre it belongs to. Even if the art was OK, even if the soundtrack was great, even if the anime has its moments and holds the potential to be enjoyable should one ignore the writing issues, it simply does not live up to the hype. I'm probably gonna get lynched by its fanbase; however, I don't really care. I'm done. I needed to get this out of my system, and there it is.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review.",

            "content": "This is the first anime review I've ever written, so hopefully everything will turn out ok. Any feed back would be appreciated as long as its constructive ;) \r\nThis review won't contain any spoilers. \r\nWhat would you do if you had something that told you the future? If you already had all the answers for an upcoming test, or knew how to avoid bully's on the way home from school? What about if it told you were going to die? \r\nMirai Nikki is a brilliant mix of a Psychological Thriller, Action, and Romance. Yuki is a boy who gains the ability to read the futurethrough his personal diary, which is awesome until he finds out that there are 11 other people who also have their own diary's and are his opponents in a competition to become a god. But thats not all bad, he happens to have someone to protect him. Enter Gasai Yuno, a cute girl who goes to Yuki's school. She also has a future diary, and it turns out she has a bit of a crush on Yuki.... and is an insane psychopathic stalker, or Yandere if you will. The story follows these two as they try to survive in the killing game they've been placed in. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i think the anime is a 10/10, but for this review i gave it a 9 because of a few small problems in the story. \\n\\n\r\nStory  9 - The story of Mirai Nikki is at its core a Romance, though its so much more than that as well. It explores how ones actions and willpower can change the future and how good people can do go insane or do terrible things because of traumatic experiences. The pacing is fairly fast, but not forced, even when there's no intense action going on, you find yourself on the edge of your seat knowing that an enemy could pop up at any time. I experienced all sort of emotions throughout the anime, fear, happiness, excitement, sadness.The shock value was insane. My reason for a 9 instead of a 10 was that some of the things that happen in the anime are soo over the top ridiculous and unbelievable that i just couldn't reasonably give it a perfect score and that some of the things that happen in the last few episodes get a bit out of hand, you'll see what i mean when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10 - Don't know what all there is to say about the Art. It's not the best ive ever seen, but there's no problems with it. The action scenes are fast paced and well animated and the characters all look fine. I see no reason to dock an anime points unless the animation is so miserable that it has negative effects my viewing experience, and one of my favorite animes is Berserk, which is terribly animated. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10 - The Opening and ending themes are fantastic, and go along perfectly with the anime. The first opening theme is my favorite song of all of them and does a perfect job of maintaining the feel of the anime. The music generally goes very well with the scenes that its played over, especially when Yuno does something awesome. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10 - I would rate this higher if possible. The characters is where Mirai Nikki truly shines. Yuki is a kind of a wimp who has to rely on others to protect him, and ive seen plenty of people complain about this, but in all honesty i think that makes the anime so much better. He's a 14 year old boy thrown into a battle royal with people trying to kill him, I would probly be a bit of a wimp if that happened to me too.  He's forced to seek aid from and rely on others in order to survive. And he isnt without redeeming moments either.  All the side characters are well developed and have their pasts and motives explained in the story and a few of them are just plain awesome. All that being said, the part of this anime that got me hooked, and the reason its become one of my favorites of all time, is the female lead Gasai Yuno. She's incredibly cute, and incredibly psychopathic, and the perfect yandere. Shes also one of the most unique characters I've ever seen in an anime. Most of the psychological thrills stem from trying to figure out what the heck shes going to do next. At one moment your scared of her, another you can't help but smile at how cute something she does is, then you notice the knife in her hand and your scared of her again. Sometimes you want her to do something insane and at others your shocked about something insane shes doing. She's the selling point on the entire anime for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 - I couldn't stop watching Mirai Nikki, i watched it over the span of 2 days. And spent the entire day at work the second day anticipating what would happen in the anime after i got home. I have yet to watch an anime that kept me on the edge of my seat to such an extent as Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 - Mirai Nikki is a great and unique story, the characters are excellent especially Yuno, who is one of the most unique characters ive ever seen in an anime. Mirai Nikki is certainly worth giving a shot.",

            "content": "I'm going to tell you all a story. Once, there was a man. A man who loved trains. This man loved trains so much that every year or so he would put different things on the train and send it off for other people to see and enjoy. Sometimes he would put fruit on the train, othertimes he would put toys. All to see the end result that his precious train would deliver.\r\nOne day, said man decided to put as many fucked up things that he could find on this train. He put razors, cyanide, bombs, and even decided to mix in some sweet thingswith all of this, like boxes of sugar and a pink dress fit for a loli. He piled the train up, barely being able to fit in all of this stuff onto it, and set it off - awaiting for the end result.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, with the train being overloaded with a bunch of different shit on it, it was only natural that the man's train would crash. And crash it did. However, the man did not care. For he would see it that this trainwreck made all the way to its destination, no matter how much shit he had to pull out of his ass to make it work. And so, with everything in the train clashing into one another as the man pulled his own strings to make the train continue going (no matter how much logic it defied in the end) he eventually got the train to reach the end.\\n\\n\r\nSome people looked at the mess of the train and thought, \"Wow! Look at all of this stuff! There's knives in this train? Stuffed animals? Explosives? Books? How marvelous! What a wonderful thing this train has brought everyone!\" while others looked at the end result and knew right away what a terrible mess all of this stuff was. Rest of the town was too busy watching K-On! to care.\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the story? When you take as much random crap as you can and load it all into one train, it will crash. And if it crashes you should end it. Oh, and people like trainwrecks.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't already voted this unhelpful for the seemingly irrelevant story, I'm here to tell you that this tale was my description of \"Mirai Nikki's\" story - a trainwreck. I won't give you a rundown on what the story is about. You have the synopsis and Google for that, so I'll just get straight to the point. The story doesn't really have any idea where it's going or how it should be directed. They made sure to throw in as many psychotic characters, themes, events and mix it in to be able to attract as many viewers as possible. Seriously, you'll find everything from rape to child abandonment to feeding children grass - all to make the story and characters look like they have depth and the viewer to feel \"cool\" for watching such miscellaneous shit. The transition between events in the story doesn't flow and all seems very random at best. It's as if these events happen just because the plot demands it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story had some strong points - while the fighting scenes didn't always make the most sense or had little to no build-up, they were very entertaining to watch and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in seeing how it played out. However, the poor writing and lack of common sense in most of the story is what makes it so terrible. The plot loses all of it's purpose by the end of the show as well, which just makes everything worse. It's a good story to be mindlessly entertained, but for those of us who were paying attention you can tell just how often things failed to make sense. It was all driven off of shock value and crazy, psychological things. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of crazy, psychological things, let's talk about the characters, or as I like to call them, \"plot devices.\" Each of the character exists only for convenience of the plot and nothing more, and same goes for their past. Every diary holder, save for First & Eight, has something that makes them insane or crazy in some way or another so that way they can serve purpose to the plot. If these characters weren't all deranged or had these insane backstories than they would be of no threat. So why did a bunch of characters with messed up lives get chosen to be diary holders, and then someone like Yuki (I won't focus on the Eighth) who lives a completely normal life gets chosen as well? It doesn't add up.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, Yuki is just a normal guy thrown into a pit of madness. Many hate him, some pity him. Me? I pity the guy. You can't help but look at it realistically - he's a normal kid thrown into this survival game where everyone has some type of mental issue and is out to kill him. This doesn't make his crying and patheticness any less annoying, but it's justifiable. At the same time you can't help but wonder why Yuki was chosen to be a diary holder in the first place considering how out of place he is. Then we have Yuno, the main reason why everyone watches the show. Yandere. That's pretty much her whole personality. (save for her own fucked up past that tries to give her depth and reasoning.) Yuno is like a robot, per say - only programmed when desired to scream \"Yukii!\", act innocent, then kill people. And apparently that sells. She's a selfish, unreasonable character who's popularity is earned from her constant blushing and murdering. While she was indeed suffering from major emotional trauma, none of that justified the actions that she had towards Yuki and the people he cared about. Despite her \"love\" for Yuki, she still constantly hurt him and the friends that he loved - doing what she can to turn him against them instead of letting him be happy with both him AND his friends. She's simply an annoying character with no actual depth or personality.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other diary holders, they're mostly forgettable and run a cycle of \"appear for a few episodes, fight Yuki/Yuno (mostly Yuno), win, reveal traumatic past, fight Yuno, lose\" and repeat. In short, most of the diary holders were just forgettable and used only for the sake of being killed and adding excitement to the show. Side characters like Yuki's friends (namely Akise) are on-screen more and provide more to the story then even most of the diary holders. That doesn't change the fact that everyone is pretty flat. No real development is given the the majority of our cast. The development that does occur for a few of our characters is written or presented pretty poorly with very little reasons to back it up. I won't say too much as to not spoil the series, though. As I said before, these characters are nothing more then plot devices - created to make the story more \"interesting\" and to shock the viewer into thinking they're looking at an emotionally deep character.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is nothing to be fawned over and is mediocre at best. Character designs aren't terrible but they aren't something that I'd call memorable either. The bloodbath scenes are the ones that look the most realistic and it's obvious that the animators took their most time in animating these. The animation is pretty fluid throughout the fighting scenes, but it's an overall forgettable performance save for the blood and gore that they flesh out so well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was again, not very memorable, but you can at least say that it stood out. Emotional music fit those so-called \"sad scenes\" pretty well (despite the lack of real feeling in the scenes themselves) and was well-played out. The battle music and of course, suspenseful tracks were also well-fitting and it's easy to say that those tracks were what helped keep you on your toes as to when something may be getting ready to happen. The seiyuu's did a pretty good job considering their roles, but based on a personal experience I can't say that hearing Yuno screaming \"Yuki!\" every episode and listening to Yuki cry every episode didn't get annoying or ear-aching. But overall no real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy \"Mirai Nikki?\" I don't know, do I enjoy not knowing where the hell a story's going? Do I enjoy watching pink-haired girls who only exist for \"love\" do a bunch of random, messed up stuff to everyone every other episode? Do I enjoy trainwrecks? No, I can tell you right now that I don't. The thing that made this show bearable, however, was Minene and Akise, who were probably the two most interesting characters in this show for me. Minene got more screentime then most of the diary holders and was actually tolerable, while Akise held that intelligent personality that always spices up a show for me. Otherwise no, this show held little to no enjoyment for me. Even though I'm a sucker for thrillers if there's nothing to hold it up, not even a simple plot that can be explained in a few words, then I won't enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Mirai Nikki\" left a bitter taste in my mouth. The lack of any reasonable directing - or even reason at all - along with a mix of unlikeable, forgettable plot devices, or as we all call them characters made this show nearly intolerable for me. It took as many different, fucked up things as possible in order to appeal to the general audience, threw in some blood and a horny yandere and viola! A masterpiece! Or so says the people who only look on the outside of the trainwreck. For those of us who are examining this train and everything that actually happened for the end result to be.. this, then you'll be able to see just how terrible \"Mirai Nikki\" actually was.",

            "content": "I basically had went to the trouble of signing up an account for myanimelist.com just to write this positive review for Mirai Nikki after watching episode 5.\r\nLike the synopsis said this is a psychological thriller, with murders, gore, sins and some demented killers.\r\nHowever unlike most thrillers the story is extremely good, the characters are all very unique, each with deep, well developed personalities that are slowly revealed to the viewer as they watch more and more episodes of the series. Its a mechanic that makes shows very addictive to watch,  just like how you want to spend more time with your date as theyreveal more and more nuggets about their interesting personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10 - Story is amazing, the first 5 to 10 minutes of the first episode was pretty typical, and it was deceiving (in a good way) because the story quickly ramped up and starts to deliver. Every time I watch an episode it delivers something new and unexpected, like a plot twist, or a revelation about the certain existing characters. And every time these plot twists had me wide eyed in pleasant surprise, thinking \"Wow this is so cool!\" or something like \"OMG, holy S*&t! I didn't expect this!\"\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 - Art is decent i guess, the action sequences are well done, but pale in comparison to this season's \"Guilty Crown\" for action. Overall art is 8 as I compared it with last season's artistic masterpiece \"Hanasaku Iroha\" , which the art was so good for a weekly anime series that I believed it set a new benchmark for artistic quality in weekly anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 - The music (OP and ED) are decent, they wisely avoided sound during some of the intense, dark & scary moments where they let the suspense and fear build up in the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10 - Characters are fantastic, awesome for an anime (or manga). Each and every starring character had unique personalities that are uncommon to the typical person. I am only at episode 5 of the anime and I have never seen such a demented and crazy cast. Only the main character Yukiteru-Kun seems the most normal, but even he has his fears and complexes that makes him withdrawn. The best thing about the characters is that the story only reveals small nuggets of their personality and motive every now and then as you keep watching the series. This means that the uniqueness and most likely, the demented craziness of each character drives the storyline further and further as each character's motives are revealed.\\n\r\nBest thing is that most of the time you don't expect the revelations made about these characters, giving you a \"wow\" moment and surprises you with a plot twist. \\n\r\nAn yea, many reviewers give props to \"Yuno\" the other main character of \"Mirai Nikki\". And I agree, a pretty girl who has a hidden killer personality, stalks the lousiest loser in school like the most diligent killers in slasher movies, and hacks and slashes everyone else with a handaxe. How cool is she! She stays a mystery and keeps viewers wanting to see more and more of her real motives, personality and her backstory.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 - I would give this a 9.5 if they allowed it in the ratings system. After watching 1 episode of \"Mirai Nikki\" at a random anime livestream channel it drove me to find and watch all the other existing episodes and wait fervently for the release of the latest ones. Only thing is that I probably can't have a good appetite while eating and watching this anime, due to the gore :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9 - Again I would give Overall a 9.5 rating if allowed, \"Mirai Nikki\" has a great plot. A psychological thriller with gore is not your typical anime. Most of the time anime makers would turn away from such bloody twisted story for the fear of censorship and lack of young viewers. However \"Mirai Nikki\" is a great watch for anyone above 16. Everybody can enjoy the suspense of a good thriller and be hooked to the various character developments and plot twists. I would easily rate this anime as my choice for anime of the year 2011. Basically if you are even reading this review, find a way to watch the show by any means possible, yes it is that good, enjoy \"Mirai Nikki\" :)",

            "content": "This anime is one that has a lot of good surrounding it by word of mouth, and every once in a while you hear someone say it was meh or not worth watching. When I originally watched this, I had only seen the opening and I thought it was amazing and one of the best openings I've ever seen, as I still hold to this idea today. Upon watching the first few episodes, I was intrigued, but not impressed. When I finally finished it, I felt like I had wasted a tremendous amount of time and immediately wrote it off with a one out often and rushed a poorly written and bad review of it here, which no longer exists. Then, after many months, I began to think: \"What if it actually wasn't as bad as I initially thought?\" and so I began the perilous quest of rewatching my most hated anime at this current time, and after finishing it, I wrote this review.\\n\\n\r\nThis review takes a bit to get going to my main points, but if you're seriously considering watching this anime, I HIGHLY suggest you finish my review, and then read some other reviews that may/may not be more positive than mine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI will start with the art, as this is obviously the first thing you notice. For a 2011 anime, it's definitely up to par and has no really glaring problems, and is actually rather well done. That being said, I have seen much better anime, even in the same year. It also has some CGI, but it's nothing amazing, but it was done tastefully enough that it doesn't seem really awkward or make a bad contrast with the rest of the art. However, a large problem I have with this is if you are watching an uncensored version (AKA Not the TV version) like I had the misfortune of doing, then you will see some anime boobies. This may or may not bother you, but it bothered me as it was unnecessary fan service and it was more creepy and distracting than anything. Why am I mentioning this in the TV version? As a warning to those that there is a difference. The TV version also censors some very odd things, at least to a North American viewer such as myself, like severed limbs. Japan may have some different laws or preferences to us in NA, but it looks really dumb and childish when something like this happens, and it really takes you out of a suspenseful scenario.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAs I have already stated, the opening is great, and I watch it almost every time. Same goes for the second opening and both endings. I highly enjoy all of these, and they are worth sticking around  for instead of just jumping into the episode or to the next. The background music fits the tone for almost every scene and Tatsuya Kato did a good job in producing it. However, unlike some other music directors, like Hiroyuki Sawano, none of his tracks are very memorable, and so makes the music in the actual anime lacking to an extent, as there was nothing unique or fresh about his style. This is only a real problem for those of us who like anime OST's and will search them up after watching a scene where the song is what really made it for you.\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10\\n\r\nNow this is where my review starts getting negative. If you're a big fan of the show and you don't like constructive criticism, turn away now. The story is about a young boy named Yukiteru Amano who is a very lonely and boring middle school child, who is just going through the motions of life trying not to disturb anyone and only observing the daily events that unfold around him. He himself never takes a large role in anything in his life. The only thing he has to go home to is his imaginary friends, Dues ex Machina, the \"god\" of space and time, and his servant, Mur Mur (Japanese pronunciation Mura Mura, which I much prefer and shall be writing it as such from here on out), who does nothing and a lot of it. One day, Yukiteru wakes up and finds that his diary entries, had already been written for him. Immediately writing it off, he starts his daily routine. Suddenly, the events in his dairy begin to unfold as they were written. Taking advantage of this, he starts utilizing his \"future diary\". However, he is soon approached by a pink haired classmate named Yuno Gasai, who somehow knows what Mura Mura looks like, even though she's just a part of Yukiteru's imagination. Yukiteru is appalled by this, and runs off, only to be continually cut off by Yuno, who then explains to him that there are eleven other diary owners that are all trying to kill each other to become \"god\", as the current one, Deus ex Machina, is dying and needs a suitable replacement in one of these diary holders. Yuno also makes it a point to confess her love for Yukiteru, by showing him her future diary, which tells her everything there is to know about Yukiteru, perfect for a stalker, as she has been doing for the past year. Now, thrust into this game of life and death, Yukiteru, with much help from Yuno, must outwit and outfight his enemies that are the other diary holders.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that's the intro. Cue lots of filler and boring episodes where nothing happens, episodes that are really reminiscent of generic \"villain of the week\" shounen anime, and so many plot holes you could sink a ship with them. Upon rewatching this, there were many episodes I skipped because either A: Nothing happens in them, or B: They're just so boring to watch you can't help but skip them. I have so many problems with scenes or ways characters handle things that I could write a spoiled version of this review and it would be twice as long, but I won't. I will just warn you that this anime assumes you're stupid sometimes and creates hype with no build up and no pay off. But let's be honest here. If you have a friend that told you to watch this, but you're not so sure and want to read a review first, there's a reason they wanted you to watch this show...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nNow, for the absolute lowest point of this anime, it's characters. If you're a hardcore fan and decided to still read this review despite my warning, here's where you will be raging. My biggest problem with many shows are weak protagonists. Whether they are just too generic, too perfect, or in this case, too pathetic. Yukiteru, is not a good character. Most anime is marketed towards high schoolers and young adults, hence why most anime is in the Slice of High School Life Rom/Com genre. The reason for this is because if you can have a connection with the characters, you are way more likely to enjoy the show and keep watching. Therefore, when you're mains are all middle schoolers, you can't relate to them as much, or in my case, at all. In a survival game where you have to kill people, I understand why a middle schooler would be hesitant.\\n\\n\r\nSake Esuno, the original content creator's solution to this? Yuno Gasai, whose brain doesn't work normally and easily is the first thing that will pop into an otaku's head when they hear the term, \"Yandere\". Yuno murders everyone and anyone who gets in between her and Yukiteru, unless Yukiteru has explicitly told her not to, but occasionally not even then, if she really hates them. While this isn't always a bad thing, listening to a middle school kid cry and scream is not pleasant, even if it's warranted. More on Yuno, she eventually loses all purpose and then begins doing crazy things just to be crazy so that you'll point at the screen, laugh and say, \"Oh that Yuno, always being so nuts!\". This is another part of the \"hype because hype\" driving factor behind some scenarios that ultimately make them blow up in the episodes own face. As for the supporting cast, they are either really well done and don't get enough screen time, or get some but are very obnoxious and you'd just wish they'd go away. Because of this, none of them are worth even mentioning, even though I quite like some of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI give this anime a three out of ten because I believe it had a ton of potential, but it was only squandered in favor of poor plot devices, lame twists, and boring fillers. An example of this is this anime is way too long. It has 26 episodes, but it could have easily been finished in 20/22, as the last four/five episodes all drag on very long with extraneous scenes. It may have only seemed like this as I have viewed the show before so I know what was going to happen, but I still feel it could have been shortened. Couple this with some episodes that literally have nothing to do with the plot, and you have a lot of wasted screen time, but more importantly, your time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a \"spoilerless\" note about the ending, on the topic of tediously long scenes, I have no idea why there is an OVA other than to make viewers scream at their screen until they find out about the OVA, as the Manga ending is literally two pages away from the animes. Keep in mind, a manga page would contain anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute and a half of anime screen time.Sorry, don't mind me. I had to have another tangent, as this anime has given me much to gripe about.\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict is that this is not worth the watch. However, if, you still decide you wish to view this anime, please watch the subbed version, as the dub for this anime, while not bad, is just wrong, to put bluntly. While the dub voice actors do not do a \"bad\" job per se, I find it vastly inferior to the subbed version, as Tomosa Murata did such a fantastic job as Yuno, even though the character is poor.\\n\\n\r\nAs for alternate anime with survival game themes or feels, I redirect you to instead watch Deadman Wonderland. Bear in mind, Deadman also has a whiny protagonist and a mysterious girl that saves him from everything, and that I don't hold this anime in high regards. I would be cautious with watching it, and even though I enjoyed it, I don't think it's all that special or great, but still a better watch than Mirai Nikki, and you'll spend only half the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that I did like with a survival game feel, I highly HIGHLY recommend Fate/Zero, the prequel to the Fate/Stay Night series. And if the name \"Gen Urobuchi\" means anything to you, and you haven't seen Fate/Zero yet, I really suggest you fix that. And the dub is amazing, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nPlease rate my review as you see fit, and if you have any questions or clarification, please post to my wall, and I will respond when I see it, thanks!",

            "content": "You know, having a future diary for myself would have been ideal for my viewing of this anime, so that I would be warned of how nonsensical and down right retarded the anime gets, which is a shame because I happen to have been enjoying the bloody fun so far...\r\nSTORY: Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is, for lack of a better way to describe it, fucking nuts. A psychogist would be laughing at this mental breakdown of a plot, but I got to be fair, I do enjoy this anime to a certain degree, but it's the crazy sharp turns it loves to take is whatnearly throws me off into complete confusion, not the \"I don't understand\" kind of confusion (Though is still includes that from time to time), but the \"Why and how is this happening\" kind.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, let's avoid the deep end for now. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is based on a manga of the same name originally created by Esuno Sakae about a battle to the death style of competition between 12 eccentric characters, from a terrorist, to a leader of a cult, to a lovey dovey couple, to even a orphen caretaker for the chance for one of them to take the place of a god, who is literally Deus Ex Machina, before he himself dies. Each will battles each other by using future diaries commonly being in the forms of cellphones, which each one varies on what type of future it fore tells.\\n\r\n It's sounds like the love child of series such as Eden of the East and the Fate/ series, though doesn't even get close to them in the intellect or character development department. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Yukiteru Amano, holder of the future diary that works as you'd think every other diary holder's would work, is an outstanding leading... total pussy. He is your typical spineless wimp, borderline disgusting even (A kid who would stay behind the sidelines and let the guard dog handle everything as he runs away shamelessly, the hero ladies and gentlemen). From having no friends, to even recording what he does daily in his phone (Pre-future diary), he is the definition of an unlikable main lead, one would or should never root for him, under-dog traits or not, his actions are hardly redeemable, he's easily fooled countless times, and develops at the pace of paint drying on the wall... A wall that is told to pretend his character development... Seriously, he remains the same way until he is told to \"act\" like a badass and and forgets about being a total wimp until later on, but he's my best friend compare to the lead female character.\\n\r\nYuno Gasai is what makes this anime surpremely entertaining and utterly batshit insane, this is an arkham asylum of lead character (I honestly believe she'd give the Joker a run for his money), but damn she is just fun to watch, wondering what she will do in the next episode is a one hundred post forum topic in of itself, for good and bad. She is also, for reminder's sake, totally insane and major threat to the cast by her self and a catalyst for the series' plot and character development breakdown. She is hopelssly obsessed with Yukiteru, calling herself his future bride, so she's your classic case of stalker too, but to disturbing lengths. She even goes to far so to kidnap Yukiteru, keeping him tied up, all the while prancing around in her underwear. She is a character that indiscriminately kills anything in her way, she's fun to watch but damn, how can anyone like this character? Especially Yukiteru, which he never can't get his hands washed of her.\\n\r\n I know that she's commonly categorized as a \"Yandere\" type character, but that's not a good reason to fawn over a character like her, she's not a character type, she's a damn psychopath with an endless thrist for blood in sheep's clothing.\\n\\n\r\nBut this where I jump right into the twenty feet deep portion of the swimming pool called the \"plot\" where seemingly anything goes, anything no matter how much sense it doesn't make. The future diaries do seem to be too convenient (Which is understandable since each character gets that advantage for themselves), but one of them practibly, or just flat out ruins the anime completely, as everyone seems to be pulling a future diary for their selves at random, and more over a lot of the diaries range from creative to just gimmicky, where the later is more common (Diaries predicting the actions of other couples and one that literally breeds more diaries is just absurd). Even the majority of the cast come down to one trick performances (Or well they only get one try before they're dead and forgotten forever), just a enemy of the week type of formula rules the most of them (And a lot of side characters that don't contribute to anything, like the stout Mur Mur, what is her purpose anyway? Sigh... You will laugh when you find out).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is indeed addictive, from bloody murders and crazy fallouts from the lead characters, but it's stupidity is overwhelming and just wants to make you tilt your head at the story developments and the absurd character display (Yup, trusting the stalker that just doesn't know how to stop killing everything is the best choice of action Yukiteru, while you're at it, go ahead and hide right behind her back-? You're there already? Then disregard this then and watch your back, like you care pfffth).\\n\r\nBut seriously, the main problem with Mirai Nikki is the inclusion of a character being Deus Ex Machina, it's rare that a story can do this effectively and even rarer for a story to not be confusing nonsensical gibberish, which by the way, Mirai Nikki ends up becoming. The anime is still capable of displaying solid moments with the main couple from time to time, but you'll be far from invested with it as the anime marches forward as it makes up shit as it goes along all the way towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: While it's not among the best, it's not terrible either. While the blood bathes in general get the most of the budget for the animation crew, it's overall pretty average, even character designs are pretty regular too outside the quirky ones and the 3d animated god.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Outside of the craziness, the theme music is extremely addictive, with the first opening theme song, Kuusou Mesorogiwi by Yousei Teikoku, being the best. While the performances from the voice actors give off a love and hate vibe, especially where Yukiteru is concerned, his performance only reinforces the pathetic wimp that he is, from whining and freaking out the time... But that's good casting in hindsight (I'm trying to state a positive as a negative, I think this anime is making me crazy...).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Great theme music.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mixed:\\n\r\n+/- Bloody good fun with crazy as all hell characters / When the plot goes off the rails, it's not a pretty trainwreck.\\n\r\n+/- Creative ways for character to combat each other / Most of which is one time gimmicks.\\n\r\n+/- Yuno Gasai / The unlikable wimp of a main lead, Yukiteru and Yuno Gasai.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Character development isn't acting like something you're not, which the main proceeds to do so.\\n\r\n- Towards the end, the story begins to literally make up shit as it goes along.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not okay for people to go \"That just her character type heehee,\" when that character in question is unlikably insane, and it doesn't help when the show is almost a competition to see who's the craziest. An over the top psychotic free for all death match is one thing, but when you start to consider a line getting crossed, that line has already been beaten, stabbed, mutilated and and sculpted into something completely unrecognizable before your consideration begins to come across your mind, that's when it's time to get the fuck out.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki - you won't stop shaking your head.\r\nMirai Nikki is a poorly executed show filled with contradictions, illogical character behavior, forced plot advancements, haphazard personality changes, inappropriate scene changes, moronic plot twists, lunatics and most of all: imbeciles.\r\nThe plot is quite simple. The God of Time and Space (Deus Ex Machina) is looking for a successor. Thus, he invites Yukiteru (our male protagonist of this story), Yuno (our female protagonist and Yukiteru's ally/classmate/stalker/girlfriend) and ten others to a battle royal in which the last survivor becomes the new God of Time and Space. While everyone's identity is concealed from each other, Deus Ex Machinadeclares Yukiteru his favorite to win this death match. Subsequently the other participants decide to focus their attention on Yukiteru. Strangely they are kind enough to stand in line, waiting for their turn to make their appearance. Coincidentally the majority of the contestants are wacky, deranged individuals.\\n\\n\r\nAll contestants are given a \"Future Diary\" (in most cases integrated into their cell phones) which tells about future events as the holder would perceive it, as long as the future doesn't change due to any interfering actions of a diary holder. That means: First, the diaries can be used to change the future, which also automatically rewrites the entries of all Future Diaries. Second, the diaries don't necessarily tell the truth.\\n\r\nExample: A person holds a coin in his right fist, while his left is empty. Your diary tells you the coin is in his left. You respond accordingly. Without revealing the coin he assures you that your answer is correct, and your diary had predicted your perceived future correctly, even though it was a lie.\\n\r\nWhat kind of information those predictions contain is unique to each holder and seems to depend on his job and interests. Best example would be Yuno's diary: As she is quite obsessed with Yukiteru, her diary contains information about his future actions in ten-minute intervals.\\n\r\nDisadvantage of those diaries is, that damaging them results in the owner's death.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the setting of Mirai Nikki had any means to create clever, sinister characters and stories, it turned out to be a badly executed, mindless slaughter show. That is primarily because of the vast number of inept characters and the implausible changes in their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe average IQ of the cast seems to be crawling around the ten point mark. The plot advances often by exploiting the sheer stupidity of the cast, forcing them to behave in such unrealistic manners that it insults the intelligence of the viewers and ruins even the slightest bit of credibility of the characters as they simply don't act like humans.\\n\r\nExample: Your friend 'A' is sitting unconscious on a chair, located in a very suspicious-looking room which looks like an obvious trap. Your friend 'B' wants to go into the room to check on 'A', but before going inside, he tells you to stay back and hold the door open. You shout enthusiastically \"Leave it to me!\". Satisfied with your response he goes into the room.\\n\r\nSo, what do you do as a brainy character of this show? Damn right: Ten seconds later you waltz into the room, the door closes behind you, locking you all inside, and you make a face which literally screams \"Oh snap! I totally didn't see that coming!\".\\n\r\n(While the manga handles this scene slightly differently, it isn't errorless either.)\\n\r\nThe worst thing is, that such irrational behavior is being used all the time for almost every character as if there were no intelligent alternative.\\n\\n\r\nAdding to the characters' idiocy comes their fluctuating personality changes.\\n\r\nYukiteru is an antisocial, gullible, pathetic, insecure, unmotivated, spineless, gutless and brainless teenage boy and Yuno is a crazy, insane maniac with a psychopathic obsession with Yukiteru.\\n\r\nWhile the original personality of most of the characters can be accepted by itself, the real problem lies in their unpredictable and unreasonable personality changes - especially those of Yukiteru - making them do the most ridiculous and unbelievable things.\\n\r\nTurning a coward into a leader-like figure, letting him kill several dozen people with a callous countenance and then, just moments later, turning him back into his coward self, making him sob \"I never wanted to kill anyone!\", is just one example of many baffling personality changes.\\n\\n\r\nAs Mirai Nikki is a show about a tournament in which the winner becomes nothing less than the new God of Time and Space, you would expect that some events had an influence on their surrounding world or that they would carry some other sort of significance. But many events are just swept under the mat, as the characters act like they've never happened in the first place. That is not only due to a poorly written script, but also thanks to absurd and erratic scene changes. The combination of both makes it feel like the viewers are supposed to forget these events, as it seems much more important to see the characters visiting a bridal fair or grabbing boobs in a hot spring.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the ending was already predetermined, the rest of the show felt like a messy series of introductions and killing offs of characters. Although some individuals were given a background story, none of them played a significant role or showed any ambition to win this death match. In the end they served no real purpose and were quickly forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise there is nothing extraordinary to mention. It's pretty much mediocre. The animation shines best when showing one of Yuno's many facets of her going crazy.\\n\r\nThe voice actors fit the cast quite well, the soundtrack is nice to listen to and serves the show as a decent musical accompaniment.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up: The combination of lacking intelligence of the cast, the fluctuating, random changes in their behavior, the nonsensical, erratic scene changes and the stolid, rushed plot advancements makes Mirai Nikki an utter disaster.\\n\r\nWhile I never take fictional work too seriously, Mirai Nikki's overkill of stupidities made it difficult even for me to enjoy myself.\\n\r\nOtherwise, I can only recommend this show to people with a predilection for trashy shows as they will most likely have their fun with it.\\n",

            "content": "Oct. 9, 2011:\r\nMirai Nikki's anime adaptation begins.\r\n--DEAD END--\r\nA mess. That's probably the easiest way to describe Mirai Nikki. From beginning to end, it was simply a total mess. The story begins as an apparently simple battle royale between a bunch of varyingly crazy people who can predict the future. By the end it's a dimension-hopping cluster of ridiculous plot twists and some veeeeeeery half-assed writing.\r\nI wouldn't want to spoil this... unique series for anyone, but I'm just going to say that it involves stuff like one character killing and impersonating herself, a gay guy pooped out by GOD who sends texts while getting his headchopped off (yes, while), and a crazy bitch with a bomb fetish who can fly and has babies that can also fly. Around the final arc it has completely ceased being about the survival game and has degenerated into Dragon Ball Z-style energy beam fighting. Yes, really.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, really, most of it comes out of nowhere. Whole plotlines are dropped and brought up very suddenly with alarming frequency. Character arcs are usually resolved in an extremely hasty manner with some form of contrived ass-pull excuse. This is just a very poorly plotted story, not that I've read the manga it's based on. Maybe that fared better? Probably not.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is beta as fuck, too. I sympathised more with the 'villains' (using that term verrrrrry loosely) of the \"Yukki's daddy issues\" arc, as they had a genuinely sad, yet heartwarming backstory. Yukki is just a pussy and Yuno is a crazy bitch who makes no sense half of the time. Best character is Minene, though. She's cool. But her hair in episode 2... honey, no. That look is so not you.\\n\\n\r\nThe nicest thing I can say about Mirai Ball Z is that the opening songs are both fantastic. Particularly Dead END by the lovely Faylan, which I loved before I even started the series. The lyrics don't make any sense at all (The girl with the sharp thorn in her flesh, I met you at your story...?) but it sure is catchy. The first OP with its dramatic choir and counting up in German (EIN ZWEI DREI) was also very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun, though. This is the kind of series you make fun of with friends. It was all just so ridiculous and stupid that I couldn't help but kind of like it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a solid \"so bad it's good\" series, Mirai Nikki will prolly satisfy your desires.\\n\\n\r\n--HAPPY END--",

            "content": "DEAD END. You are facing your inevitable demise. But you possess a Future Diary, allowing you to evade death. However, other holders will be after your life to win Deus Ex Machina's twisted game and to become the next god. But don't worry. Gasai Yuno will protect you...\r\nMirai Nikki is an extremely excellent anime that does a fantastic job of incorporating the \"Battle Royale\" atmosphere and creating the perfect yandere. The storyline was complex and well-structured, almost flawless. It does well as a psychological thriller, weaving intense situations and suspenseful moments into an intricate pattern.\r\nStory (10):\r\nIt is interesting how the director and character designer ofShuffle! were able to string Esuno Sakae's manga into an exceptional storyline. The story itself may sound a bit odd at first (diaries that predict one's future events), but its compelling components such as the prize, becoming a god to replace Deus Ex Machina, the absolute god of time, definitely justify the method of portraying the story in an uncommon manner. With diary holders trying to kill each other in greed for power, the content of Mirai Nikki is dark; much blood and gore is spilled in the survival game. To a person who enjoys \"kill or be killed\" style plots or psychological thrillers, such as myself, Mirai Nikki would be very appealing because of the intense survival game and dramatic focus on the character's mental state rather than the physical world.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork (8):\\n\\n\r\nNothing much needs to be said about the artwork. Although the artwork and animation was good, without anything to complain about, it was not as extravagant as Guilty Crown and not as creative as Bakemonogatari. The animation is violent with much blood and gore spilled; it generally carries a Gothic ambiance of which is fitting for the dark story of Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening was fantastic, perfectly fitting the Mirai Nikki atmosphere. There is nothing wrong with the second opening, but I did not think it resonated as well with the anime as the first opening had done. But overall, the OST was great without many complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10):\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of Mirai Nikki is simply perfect. Gasai Yuno is the perfect yandere without a doubt, holding up an innocent middle-school girl exterior. Amano Yukiteru is portrayed as a weak-willed and timid boy, with a voice actress that accurately represents his personality. Yuno is developed into a psychopathic stalker who becomes obsessed with Yukiteru, stopping at nothing to preserve their \"relationship.\" Yukiteru relies on her protection to stay alive in Deus Ex Machina's game. Yuno is a yandere; Yukiteru is a coward. There is absolutely no flaw in the characters' structure and development in Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\\n\r\nWith people constantly murdering, the little comic relief is enough to release the viewer from the intense buildup, such as the after-credits shorts with Mur-Mur. Generally, the action scenes are exciting but bloody. To some, it may even be nauseating. However, it is definitely enjoyable to one who enjoys these kinds of battles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9):\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes survival games, psychological thrillers, or yandere girls as it is a great anime. But if you want to watch cute shoujo romances, this is definitely one of the farthest things from it.",

            "content": "\u201cThe best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.\u201d - Abraham Lincoln\r\n\u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d\r\nWhen you're little, have you ever thought about the future? Have you ever wanted to know what it would be like five, ten, or twenty years from now before you grow up? It is probably a thought most of us came upon in our lives. However our protagonist Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano is a loner who instead of thinking about the future instead spends his time daily writing a diary on his phone. Talk about a strange habit for akid without friends. But, surprise will hit him faster than a bullet train when he learns about the future in stored for him.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki (also known as The Future Diary based off the manga of the same name), is a story of survival game where the ultimate prize is to become God and given the gift to change the world forever. Being a survival game, it is not complete without its contestants. These contestants known as the Future Diary owners are given diaries in their own form whether it's a cell phone, a sketch book, or a scroll which tell them different things about what will happen in the future. The contestants themselves are also worthy noting that have a wide range of stark personalities ranging from a terrorist, to the devoted collective couple, a child prodigy, and a man who seeks justice in his own unique twisted ways.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there are the side characters. Yes, I'm talking about those classmates that later enters on into the story. Despite their relatively normal selves, we can see that the survival game later becomes realistic and changes their view on the world. I can't blame them though, I mean who can act and be themselves when you realize that you can see into the future?\\n\\n\r\nIn today's anime series, there are many type of characters. Tsundere, yandere, mysterious, princely, you name it. Then, there is our yandere (hero or anti-hero? you decide) Yuno Gasai. She is described as the typical Yamato Nadeshiko by those who sees her outer self...a girl of perfection who is popular with students, good at academics, and generally an ideal woman. Behind that outer shell however is a girl with insecurities with disturbing stalker-like tendencies for our protaognist, Yuki. Her obssession of Yuki can be labeled as yandere as she is willing to hurt or kill others. In fact, she won't hesitate to sacrifice other people because to her, the only important thing is that she and Yuki survive the game. Her goal of wanting to make that \u201chappy end\u201d (hehe, turn that imagination bulb on) with Yuki is one of the main drives she wishes to achieve in this story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course with survival game genres, there are consequences such as life and death. In the end, there is only one winner and it's every man for himself. Luckily for our protagonist, his stalker is madly in love with him so that means an alliance. So do the math here: two heads are better than one right? Well, that would be the case but Yuki's insecurities tells him in his mind that killing is wrong and things like this can be ended peacefully. However, in survival games like this, there is no peace. There is no true alliances. There is no true God (yet), no angel, no heaven. There is only blood, betrayals, and power. And in the end, there is only one winner if by miracle that you don't reach your own Dead End first.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found this series quite interesting is that it sticks to the game from the very beginning. Yes, there are those sidelines and mini-fillers (even ones that weren't in the manga) but it sticks with the pace overall. The memories and flashbacks we see of various characters is realistic and the tragedy and mood of what they been through makes them who they are. And of course, there are those fan-service scenes that keeps our eyes glued to the screen involving our yandere Yuno and some other characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs a survival horror, blood and gore is present. What did you expect? This isn't one of those happy love-dovey series involving teenage romance and love triangles. If you want that, go watch Amagami SS or something. Honestly though, I thought that some of the violence is necessary for this series to engineer the reality of the game. In other words, the survival game for the throne of God is real. The contestants are dead serious on winning. And, the consequences for losing are disastrous.\\n\\n\r\nThe show being labeled as a psychological on MAL also shows its colors once the episodes progresses especially later on in the series. Like I mentioned before, there is drama, there is blood spilled, and backs being stabbed metaphorically. The moments are tense and for those who have watched Final Destination or any other related series of related theme would understand this with the thriller-like endings that keeps the viewers at our seats. In other words, it keeps the viewers from predicting what's next and what or when things happen. I mean, it's not like you have a real Future Diary to predict the events of the anime as you watch them. Now, that would be something you don't see every day. \\n\\n\r\nAnother noteworthy mention of Mirai Nikki in my book would be the soundtrack of this series. I'll be honest here. It is epic. The OST mixes in with the various scenes well ranging from psychological, comedic, emotional, and action. Additionally, the OP songs performed by Yousei Teikoku and Faylan portrays the metaphor of the series. If we look carefully and listen to the lyrics, we can see the realism of a survival game and picture it in our minds as the song plays. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I found the art of the series to be just average. It's not that unique or something that made me go \u201cwow, I haven't seen something this beautiful before!\u201d I've already had that feeling after watching many Makoto Shinaki films. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that this series is enjoyable. It's not just because I'm a sucker for thriller and psychological genre despite some of the fan-service and cliches. Thankfully, Mirai Nikki didn't push that too far even if it did in a few cases. Despite my initial hatred for that excuse of a protagonist by the name of Yuki, I did find his later character development and values to be worth noting. Then, there's the yandere Yuno in the series added in like a little bonus of cherry to a delicious cake. And of course, don't leave the terrorist Uryu out as her character development of the series is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects that makes you want to learn about her more and more. (perhaps even fall in love and marry with her like one of the other characters) The soundtrack is powerful and conveys every moment of the series from emotional, comedy, or thriller. It will keep you at the edge of your seat as you predict what will happen next using your own imaginative diary that's called a brain. Perhaps the only problem I had was with the ending of the anime adaptation. I won't spoil it for you but it's not something I originally hoped to see. With a package of 26 episodes, expect psychological plot twists, character development, and thriller that will make you want more and more. Looking to watch something with your best friend on a weekend after finishing your job or homework? Then, you might of just hit a jackpot because our yandere Yuno will surely give you something to remember by.\\n\\n\r\nMay 19         12:55 pm\\n\\n\r\nStark700 finishes writing his Mirai Nikki review. \\n\r\nHope you like what you see and I wish you a Happy End.",

            "content": "Yandere.\r\nYandere.\r\nWhat in the mighty fuck is a yandere?\r\nWell, good sir / madam / whoever the fuck you are, a yandere is a common term in otaku fandom, a yandere is a person (usually female) romantically obsessed with someone to the point of using violent means to get them in their arms. Often seen with a sharp weapon and a psychotic grin. Now maybe the most known character to be this type is Kotonoha in School Days since while she\u2019s calm and gentle, she can also be unstable and quite messed up in the head, as the final episode sequence proved that (although that was theonly good part about that anime) but enough about that considering this anime I\u2019m about to review also has an yandere character that either has its fans as of recently and it also goes to show you that we need to stray from crazy psychotic girls like Yuno Gasai, Yu no? *rimshot and then gunshot*\\n\\n\\n\r\nHigh school 2nd year, Amano Yukiteru, is a boy who has problem making friends. He thinks of himself as a bystander and will always write down everything he sees in a cell phone diary. Yuki initially has no desire to win the game, but after Deus informs the other contestants that Yuki, as the \u201c1st\u201d Diary owner, is his favorite to win the game, he is forced to team up with the 2nd Diary owner\u2014his obsessive stalker, Yuno Gasai\u2014in order to survive the constant attempts on his life by the other diary users, who see him as the biggest threat. Tormented by solitude, Yukiteru began to imagine things like a friend called Deus Ex Machina who is apparently the Lord of Time & Space. Seeing Yukiteru\u2019s miserable state, Deus gives him a new ability. His diary will now record events that will happen in the near future. Yukiteru is then forced to participate in a game which the winner will become Deus\u2019 successor.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, the plot is precise to mostly the concept of Battle Royale where you better make sure you got the tools and skills to survive whatever gets thrown at you but with the addition of knowing your future beforehand via a future diary but the thing about them is that they\u2019re not exactly 100% reliable as some of them do manage to do the opposite of what the diary predicted and you also know the whole \u2018anything can happen if you do the opposite of what the diary said and still might live or not. It\u2019s your choice and all that bunk.\u2019 But as the premise sounds entertaining for a while and it did executed it for a while, it went off the rails and ended up being a trainwreck and it\u2019s not a pretty sight as it\u2019s more of people doing some heinous ridiculous shit that really seems uncalled for. I\u2019ve compared this show to Deadman Wonderland much like I\u2019ve compared This Ugly yet Beautiful World to Mahoromatic and like how I said Mahoromatic is superior to TuyBW, Deadman Wonderland beats out Future Diary by a margin and while Deadman wasn\u2019t exactly a masterpiece, it didn\u2019t felt like it was trying too hard to be mature or a seinen as you will (Although Deadman should\u2019ve been longer than Future). Yeah, there\u2019s blood, gore, gunshots, knives, and tits and ass but it isn\u2019t really trying to tell a mature story; it\u2019s what people said in some professional or amateur reviews, it\u2019s more like a shonen series disguised as a seinen series and we can see through its ruse and not to mention, the tone is inconsistent when it comes to humor, especially at the end of every episode where Murmur (Murmur? Really?), the apprentice to Deus Ex Machina encounters with most of the characters in the show in a comical fashion. I don\u2019t mind it as most characters but it felt very jarring after watching an episode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the worst part of the series as I really hated the two main leads, Yuki and Yuno, but more of Yuki than Yuno. Why\u2019s that, you asked? Yeah, Yuno is a crazy pink-haired psycho bitch with the basic traits of being lovingly devoted to Yuki and killing everyone who gets in her way but Yuki\u2026\u2026.the guy has some fault in this. This isn\u2019t a trait where the main protagonist isn\u2019t at fault since all the shit that happened, all the stuff that happened to his friends, his family (oh, the hell with his father!! I hate that guy even more!!) Even to some of the competitors, which 3 of them are exactly more interesting than the main two such as The 9th (or Minene Ury\u016b), who actually has more of a compelling background story although she has the textbook tsundere bitch thing going for her and The 7th (or Marco and Ai) and both of them are a better couple than Yuki and Yuno. They\u2019re psychotic and crazy killers but they\u2019re more entertaining and I actually gave a shit about them more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is alright. I really don\u2019t know much about the company, asread, as they do have their own anime productions such as Corpse Party OVAs, Minami-ke, Shuffle among other series they only did some parts of and the look of the show does give out its crazy psychotic vibe and sometimes it get too purple. Yeah, like how K uses blue way too much, Future Diary uses the color purple so much that you think someone splashed Grape Kool-Aid into your eyes and yes, gory shit is happening around these parts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, I think the first opening theme of the show, \u201cK\u016bs\u014d Mesorogiwi\u201d (\u7a7a\u60f3\u30e1\u30bd\u30ed\u30ae\u30f0) by Yousei Teikoku, is the most positive I can get with the show so far because the song will always be stuck in my head and it does got the destructive and terrifying tone that the show desperately tries to be. The other opening song was good but nothing that really grasp into my mind later on. For ending songs, while I equally like both of them, I\u2019m sliding towards the 2nd ending theme, which is also sung by the 1st opening artist, Yousei Teikoku. Also, can you imagine someone using this song for their own personal life? As for the FUNimation dub, it\u2019s not a bad dub but it just felt wrong and not wrong in the sense of watching the original language is better but I think it\u2019s just the casting choices. Brina Palencia may not have been the right choice for Yuno, but I feel like no one else would\u2019ve done it better than her. She\u2019s acceptable in the role but not really a highlight for her. Josh Grelle is a good voice actor, but him voicing Yuki sounds a bit odd than usual. Rest of the cast does strike more as \u2018meh\u2019 choices and I did confuse some voices like how I thought Jamie Marchi voiced Yuki\u2019s mom but it was actually Colleen Clinkenbeard and how I mistake Monica Rial for Murmur when it was Leah Clark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Yeah, I hated Future Diary. That\u2019s it. Some people said it was terrible but fun and while that may have a little bit of fun, it doesn\u2019t convince me that it wasn\u2019t entertaining. I hate the main characters and wish some of the supporting characters were treated better than they were in the show and the story is sloppily executed despite me being somewhat interested in it. It is one of those shows you should see once and if you like it, well, good for you but otherwise, avoid this clunker. It is not worth it.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is disappointing. My review will contain a few little \"spoilers\", though they have little relevance to anything and spoil nothing. This review is kind of a mess and all over the place, much like this series!\r\n- - - S T O R Y - - - \r\nOkay, so the story starts off really dark with some creepy kid who avoids making friends. He keeps a daily journal of the things he observes. He likes to spend his spare time sitting alone in his room with a blanket wrapped around himself, where he gets into \"the zone\" and hangs out with his imaginary friends,who are evil gods that have no regard for human life. At this point in the story, it's got you thinking this is pretty twisted and you're wondering what's gonna happen next. \\n\\n\r\nThe basic plot is simple, but effective - kill the other guys before they kill you; the winner becomes the god of space and time. Not knowing the identities of the other people turns it into a sort of psychological game, which makes it more interesting. Now, this was good when the enemies actually desired to become a god, but later in the story, there are characters who don't really care about that. So, you think they'd just stay out of things and keep their identities hidden? Nope! They attack the main characters head on for no apparent reason. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, about halfway through the series, it starts to get pretty senseless. Eighth's diary is based on the power of a computer server. Why? They didn't really explain this, so it makes no sense to have an ability like that. I can speculate and say it's because Eighth didn't actually have a diary and that the blog site she hosted allowed other people to write on \"HER\" blog, but c'mon. That's as stupid as saying that the cell phone diaries belong to the phone manufacturers. This part of the story also just really overcomplicates things without making it interesting. It just becomes less interesting as it is nonsensical. \\n\\n\r\nYukiteru eventually has a little revelation, causing him to change from a wimp into James Bond. Um... I guess it was cool to have a main character who acted more like a main character, but this was far too sudden and out of character. Akise reveals a \"shocking truth\" about Yuno, which is supposed to be like some ultimate plot twist... except they didn't give us enough clues to make it worth anything when they revealed it. The plot twist only makes sense after you've seen the entire thing, so it um... kinda fails as a plot twist. \\n\\n\r\nThere ends up being some big final battle between two characters that we really didn't get to know or care about. It's a battle with lots of beams and explosions, which uh... seems really out of place. It's like this anime was trying to be too much at once. The last episode doesn't really conclude things, so prepare yourself for some disappointment. \\n\\n\r\n- - - A R T - - - \\n\r\nThe art was okay, but it seemed a little cheaply animated at times. It seems up to standards, but sometimes it just stuck out to me how the animators looked like they got lazy. \\n\r\nSomehow, it feels like Yuno was in her underwear too often for no reason. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S O U N D - - - \\n\r\nNothing in particular really stood out. Same high pitched female voices you hear in any other anime. \\n\\n\r\n- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \\n\r\nOh boy, here we go. \\n\r\nYukiteru - He starts of being some creepy kid like I mentioned earlier. This was interesting. He's kinda wussy, like any average 12 year old boy would be, but he's not unlikeable. It took him a while to realize how he felt about Yuno, but it was good to see the progress - it made it believable. His character does a sudden 180 later in the story. This kinda ruins his character since there was no real development leading up to that and no real development afterwards; he was just suddenly a completely different person. This was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nYuno - She's a \"stalker\", which um... is a weird concept in itself. When you think of a stalker, you think of a 50 year old pedophile or something. In Japan, for some reason, I guess they consider kids and teenagers \"stalkers\" if they watch the person they have a crush on. Anyway, Yuno is supposed to be some psychopath who can only be tamed by Yukiteru's love. Can he help her calm down and give up her lunatic ways? Find out next episode!\\n\r\nIt was fine that way. We could see their relationship develop. Then at the peak of Yukiteru's love and trust in Yuno, the writers thought they'd give us a plot twist? It was one of the stupidest plot twists I've ever seen. It ruined Yuno's credibility as a character and was just... why? What was the point? It made no sense at all for that to happen. They had what they wanted, so why the fuck would things downgrade to the point that their relationship might as well have never existed? They should've stuck to building her up into a respectable character instead of um... ruining the entire series. This was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEighth - What the fuck is she? Seriously. Her existence simply does not make sense. She is a chibi middle aged woman who is also gigantic. She is clearly not human, but nobody cares. \\n\\n\r\nEighth's Lucky Star apprentice girl - She was part of the Sacred Eye cult, then she became a member of Eighth's orphanage. In world 3, she is simply with Eighth, though. What a plot hole. \\n\\n\r\nAkise - He's pretty much the only cool character. However, he is gay and kisses Yukiteru for no reason. Was that supposed to be a plot twist? I don't even know anymore...\\n\\n\r\nNinth - She's kinda stupid. She introduces herself in some kinda Victorian dress and big poofy pigtails, yet she's supposed to be some terrorist who specializes in explosives. She's loud and pretends to act a little crazy. She falls in love with the person she thought she killed, she becomes friends with the person who destroys her eye, and she plays a big plot hole role later in the story. This was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n- - - E N J O Y M E N T - - - \\n\r\nThe plot was really enjoyable at first... y'know, before they butchered it. There was some mild fanservice, which we easily could've lived without. It was a strange kind of fanservice, though. Yuno's swimsuit falling off and floating gently down the stream? A pretty typical occurrence that happens to every anime girl at least once in her life, right? Instead of making her panic and bounce all over, instead of making her use this to seduce Yukiteru, instead of drawing her looking like she's ready to be raped... they honestly made it a pretty modest event. Yukiteru also accidentally pulls a girl's pants down, exposing her underwear, but they didn't draw the girl to look sexy or anything. She was simply a girl with her underwear exposed. These scenes were 100% unnecessary and added nothing, of course, but I was glad that they didn't try to make it look like hentai. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also 2 rape scenes and 1 sex scene, but they leave it entirely up to your imagination instead of making it really graphic. Again, I'm glad they didn't try to make it look like hentai. People can watch porn on their own time; it has no place in telling a story, and I can respect that this anime didn't ruin itself with that. However, I have to say that using rape in a story is pretty tasteless, lazy, and overdone. Getting to know the backstories of these characters, becoming a little emotionally invested in them, then they just have something like that happen to them... it's just a disgusting thought. I can understand if they wanted to make the characters tragic or like we could know more about them by seeing their hardships, but rape is just kinda crossing the line. It's not interesting and it's too harsh for simple entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nI think the two most interesting things in the anime are the relationship Yuno and Yukiteru develop (before the retarded plot twist kicks in) and the betrayals. This anime has a lot of thrilling betrayals in the first half. The ones in the later half are kinda boring since you don't get setup to believe in the trust the characters share.\\n\\n\r\n- - - O V E R A L L - - - \\n\r\nThis had a lot of potential to be good. It's really disappointing they ruined it with all those inconsistent and random ideas. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really, as it is just a big let down. If I knew ahead of time that the story was gonna go downhill so badly, I don't think I would've watched it.",

            "content": "--Sorry for my English, I'm from a non-English speaking country--\r\nOk, right now this show is incredibly overrated, at first I was enjoying it, there is some gore, action, and even some fanservice, but that's about it, because the story is a total mess, it makes no f**king sense at all! There is this God Deus and he is giving cell phones (or future diaries) to some people so they kill each other in a game and the one last standing will become the new God, that's the premise and I know it doesn't sound so bad (it kinda reminds me of Death Note) but thingsonly keep interesting the few first episodes, the rest is just brainless fighting, oh and the characters, OMG, Yukiteru has to be one of the less likeable characters I've seen in my entire life, he's a coward and he's also f**king retarded, for example:\\n\r\n( SPOILER )\\n\r\nThere's  Yukiteru's loving mother and there's Yukiteru's selfish terrible father, his mother (who has showed love and affection the entire series) is killed by his father, yes his own father kills his mother, and if that's not enough he also tried to kill Yukiterou in exchange of having his debts paid. Ok, here's the problem, Yuki makes more fuss and shed more tears for his father than he did for his mother, it makes no sense, he even was aware of his father's intentions to kill him, and he knew he was the one who killed his mother, but this is Mirai Nikki, the nonsensical anime, so he even forgives him and then he becomes, totally out of the blue, a perfect assassin (he was a coward without combat skills), and all credibility goes downhill from there... \\n\r\n( END OF SPOILER )\\n\r\nYuno is not as bad a character as Yukiteru is, but she's a very shallow character, she's there just for the sake of gore, I think the writers tried to make her a complex character, but they failed, she's also pretty annoying. In some episodes I was like \" I swear, if I hear 'Yuuuukiiii' one more time...\" LOL\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are even more poorly developed... there's a detective boy who looks exactly like Kaworu Nagisa from Neon Genesis Evangelion, he's supposed to be the mysterious white haired character, and the three friends of Yukiteru, they serve some purpose but there's no deep in their personalities, the same goes for the villains, there's many of them and they look more interesting than the \"good boys\" but they get killed so fast we don't get to really know them at the end, the only exception are the cop and the one-eyed terrorist psycho girl, these two are probably the more likeable characters on the show. Oh and I almost forgot, there's this woman with a HUGE head, she looks so out of place, but no one seems to care \"Hi woman with the huge face\", I know this is anime, it's not supposed to be realistic, but c'mon, she's the only person with such a huge head yet everyone seems oblivious to it (and she's the only character with a huge head). \\n\r\nAs I said the story is a mess, a fan fiction could do better, it's full of ridiculous dialogue and laughable plot twists.\\n\r\nSound is average, opening and ending themes are pretty good, the OST it's just ok.\\n\r\nThe art it's not bad, I like the character's designs (especially the character design of the girls), they look a bit generic, but they look great. The animation remains consistently good (just don't expect the quality of Death Note or Code Geass), but it's downgraded in some episodes. If you are expecting a suspenseful psychological thriller, then you may end up very disappointed, Mirai Nikki it's not the next Death Note or Monster, it's all mindless action and nonsense... there's some mystery to the story, but I would rather recommend you to watch Another, it's infinitely more interesting and  mysterious than Mirai Nikki.\\n\r\nI'm gonna give some credit to Mirai Nikki, the show is a bit addictive, each episode leaves you wanting more, but that's just because they come up with some stupid plot twist that seems interesting at first, but at the end nothing makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\\n\r\nBring me all the \"Not Helpful\" you want, but I know deep inside of you, you know I'm right ;)\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki (or Future Diary as it is known in English) is one of the most popular anime to come out in recent years along with Sword Art Online and Attack on Titan and much like those shows, it has divided the anime community into two camps, those who love it unconditionally and those who hate it with a burning passion, which results in a slew of insults complete with poor spelling and grammar being thrown around forums and comment sections. Now that I\u2019ve got this little bit of superfluous information out of the way, you probably want to know what I think about theshow. Well, that is the purpose of this review (obviously).\\n\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to start off by saying that it is quite silly. Don\u2019t get me wrong and start attacking my page, because \u201csilly\u201d doesn\u2019t always equate to \u201cbad\u201d (case in point Gurren Lagann is one of my favourite anime of all time). But keep in mind that I didn\u2019t say that the particular brand of silly is awesome. The premise is actually bloody interesting. It revolves around several people in a battle royale where the winner becomes the god of time and space and they are all equipped with supernatural cellphones that can tell the future (also known as \u201cfuture diaries\u201d, hence the show\u2019s title) which they use to their advantage. A large perk of a premise like this is that it is perfect for setting up plot twists and for creating tension. Boy does the show use this to its advantage. Alliances are forged and broken by betrayal, good guys turn out to be bad guys and major characters are killed off. This makes the show unpredictable which we can all agree is a good thing.  It also places a lot of focus on the side characters as well as the main characters as they off each other and help each other out so it feels more authentic than a lot of other survival game stories where the side characters are all placed in line for our protagonist to fight.\\n\\n\r\n I am now going to address what I said earlier about the show being silly. It is over the top. And trust me, that is an understatement. Homicidal five year olds, zombies, the god of space and time (Deus Ex Machina) and the list goes on. Don\u2019t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with being over the top to a certain extent (I love the Sin City graphic novels for crying out loud!) but there are times when the show tries way too hard and certain things just don\u2019t fit to the point where you get the impression that the show doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be. The show wants you to believe it is a dark psychological action/thriller. There are times when the over the top nature works in its favour, for example I thought the addition of zombies and a crazy religious cult added to the cool factor of the show as well as setting up entertaining action scenes (because honestly who doesn\u2019t want to see a cute pink haired yandere fight zombies with a goddamn axe) but there were times when I felt like the show was saying \u201cOooh, we\u2019re super dark and edgy because we have a five year old psychopath\u201d and this gave me the feeling that they were trying too hard and made it seem quite stupid. And when you\u2019ve added a character with an army of robot dogs, it stops being simply stupid and becomes fucking childish. Stuff like this prevents you from taking it seriously when the show obviously wants you to.  That being said, the show was rather entertaining. Like I said earlier, it is quite unpredictable and has a certain cool factor. However the things I mentioned did hinder my enjoyment, which is quite a sad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the weakest part of the show and were what held it back the most. First off there\u2019s fourteen year old Yukiteiru Amano, or Yukki as he is often referred to. He\u2019s our protagonist. Yukki is dragged into the game by his friend Deus Ex (the god of space and time and the guy who started this competition) who Yukki had thought was his imaginary friend up until that point. Yeah, this fourteen year old boy has a fucking imaginary friend. Yeah that\u2019s right, he\u2019s a fucking loser! To further emphasize this point, before being dragged into this little game his only hobbies were recording mundane shit on his phone and unenthusiastically throwing darts (a feat which comes to his advantage later). But what\u2019s he like? Well calm down and I\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s a pussy. He cowers, cries and whimpers throughout the majority of the series making the viewer want to jam a screwdriver though his skull. \u201cBut dude, you have Shinji Ikari in your favourites, you\u2019re contradicting yourself you biased prick!\u201d is what some of you might be thinking right now. Well, Shinji is realistic and that\u2019s the reason I like him. Yukki pushes this angst and wimpiness to the point where it\u2019s not credible and exaggerated wimpiness is not something an average viewer would find appealing. I love Kamina from Gurren Lagann for his exaggerated manliness but that is an appealing characteristic in a protagonist. I guess the writer thought to himself \u201cI\u2019ll be different and put a scared kid in the role of the protagonist instead of the generic righteous leader type we\u2019re so used to in these types of stories\u201d. This would have been a really good idea if he was given more complexity than just \u201cbeing a pussy\u201d and if he were given a reason for being a pussy. A good example is the aforementioned Shinji Ikari. He\u2019s an interesting and well thought out character that has layers (insert Shrek joke here).  He also has good reason for being the way he is. His father treats him like shit and his mother died under dreadful circumstances when he was very young and to top that all off he\u2019s forced into a situation that he knows fuck all about by his father. Yukki on the other hand grew up with a really chilled mom and an initially awesome dad (SPOILER: becomes a cunt later in the series) and his situation is nowhere near as bad as Shinji\u2019s. And besides, Yukki makes Shinji look like Kenshiro on steroids.  One Youtube anime reviewer referred to him as Noodledick Vaginasaurus and I can see why. He is without a doubt one of the worst protagonists I have ever seen. Towards the end of the series they try to make him seem like a badass but this drastic change feels really sudden and he doesn\u2019t stay that way for very long so his character becomes very inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nThe next character that I\u2019m going to talk about is the character everyone thinks of when this series is brought up. Yes, the one and only Gasai Yuno. She\u2019s become one of the most popular and iconic anime characters in recent years as well as the waifu of many lonely weeaboos. She is a psychopath who falls in love with good old Noodledick to the point where she is dangerously obsessed. She is also a contender in the survival game and is on Yukki\u2019s side and she protects his useless ass from the other contestants. She flips between being a cute na\u00efve teenage girl to being an all out psycho at the drop of the hat and these changes are unexpected and the transition is great. This genuinely creeps out the viewer and the fact that it can happen so suddenly adds to the sense of unpredictability that I mentioned earlier. She\u2019s a fun character to watch too. Her insanity paired with her cuteness gives her a certain bizarre charm.  However, as fun as she is, she is definitely not flawless.  She\u2019s ultimately just an archetype (that archetype being yandere) and this is a bit disheartening as it tells you that the writers were being lazy and just decided to use a simple, set archetype instead of adding more to said archetype. Another issue I had which was very much subjective was that she called out the protagonist\u2019s name constantly throughout in a high pitched tone of voice. This was cute and pretty creepy the first couple of times but it got to a point where I felt like shoving screwdrivers in my fucking ears.  She\u2019s a really enjoyable yet problematic character who is frankly a tad overrated.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of this show\u2019s cast. Unfortunately they\u2019re the show\u2019s worst flaw in my humble opinion. A lot of them are copied and pasted from other, better shows (we\u2019ve got Kaworu and Revy here), are given less screen time than they deserve, feel like they don\u2019t belong in this sort of show, have REALLY overblown backstories and for the most part they don\u2019t behave in a believable way (dude, one doesn\u2019t become someone\u2019s close friend in three minutes). \\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s delve into the show\u2019s art. It\u2019s not spectacular but it\u2019s definitely not bad. I particularly liked the depth and detail they gave the eyes of the characters and the scenes in Deus Ex\u2019s world which had a really dreamlike quality due to all the purple used. The overall designs of the characters are standard fare and there is nothing about them that really stands out as being really good or really bad, with the exception of Deus who has the misfortune of being done in shitty CG. \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said about the show\u2019s soundtrack. It does its job sufficiently enough but when I think back there were no tracks that really stood out. The same can\u2019t be said about the show\u2019s OP tracks though. The show\u2019s first opening is without a shred of doubt one of the greatest of all time. The contrasting red and whites and the song\u2019s fast pace and grand scale are enough to send chills down one\u2019s spine. The second opening is memorable for a different reason though.  It\u2019s in FUCKING ENGRISH and it is therefore goddamn hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Mirai Nikki isn\u2019t the deep mature thriller its fanbase make it out to be but it certainly isn\u2019t the harbinger of anime\u2019s decay like many critics would have you believe. Granted it can get REALLY fucking stupid but it can also be a ton of fun at times too. Whether I\u2019d recommend this show or not doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019ll probably watch it regardless due to its immense popularity. Since I\u2019m more or less impartial to the show it\u2019s not something I\u2019d recommend but at the same time it\u2019s not something I\u2019d tell people to stay away from. So that about wraps up my review. Sayonara suckers. \\n\\n\r\nFeedback would be much appreciated.",

            "content": "Have you ever watched an anime that simply left you speechless, unsure of what the hell have you just watched, but in the most obnoxious way possible? We all probably did, shows that cause this type of reaction tend to be considered the worst ones. Well, let me introduce you to Mirai Nikki.\r\nMirai Nikki is the worst anime I have ever watched.\r\nNo, I'm not kidding, nor am I being hyperbolic. This unholy abomination of a series left such a negative impact on me when I originally watched it back in 2012, that I actually started to hate anime in general and lost interest in themedium for a couple of years because of the fact that Mirai Nikki was the most popular anime back then. It baffled me how anyone could like such an atrociously-written crap without an ounce of irony, and if this is what people were accepting as \"good\" anime, then this medium is fucking doomed.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, as the years went by, people started to notice Mirai Nikki's bullshit and this show's reputation nowadays is considerably worse than it used to be, which is exactly the kind of thing that happens with terrible shows that were once loved merely out of hype while not having substance to back it up. The hype dies away, people will watch it again, some new viewers will also give it a shot, and the awfulness of the content will come and hit you so hard you'll wish you were Chris Brown's wife. Maybe if Mirai Nikki was your first anime, or at least your first \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"serious\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" (there's still not enough quotation marks there, believe me) anime, you'll probably feel nostalgic about it, and thus, unable to judge it as the shitshow it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sake of being specific about why I hate Mirai Nikki so much, be warned that >>>I'M GOING TO SPOIL THE HELL OUT OF THIS SHOW FOR THIS REVIEW<<< because I don't think I can express how bad it is without spoiling it. If you're somehow masochistic and want to waste your time with Mirai Nikki without being spoiled, then I advise you to not read any further, I also advise you to go watch something else that's more worthy of your time, or maybe go see a psychiatrist. For everyone else... You may also want to do something else that's more worthy of your time than reading some autistic weeb rambling about how much he despises a shitty japanese cartoon that's 7 years old at this point, but if you really want to keep reading, then be my guest.\\n\\n\r\nSome people usually talk about how good Mirai Nikki's premise is, even others who also think this show is horse shit, tend to admit that it had a good premise. Well, I don't think it had a good premise at all, honestly Mirai Nikki seemed stupid to me ever since the very first episode, and I'm going to explain why. The premise is that there's this guy called Amano Yukiteru, he's your average socially awkward loner teen and has the habit of writing down everything that happens around him in his cellphone, while talking to his imaginary friends, Deus Ex Machina, and his partner, Murmur. Turns out Deus Ex Machina and Murmur are not really Yukiteru's imaginary friends, instead Deus is actually the God of Time and Space, he turned Yukiteru's cellphone into a Future Diary, a device capable of predicting the future up to ninety days, and dragged Yukiteru into a deadly survival game. In this game, Yukiteru and eleven other participants posessing their own Future Diaries with their own specific effects must kill each other until one remains, and the sole survivor takes Deus' place as God of Time and Space. Why? Because Deus is actually dying and must get a successor before that happens.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, if this premise being stupid wasn't self-explanatory enough for you, then I'll tell you why it's stupid. First of all: Why the hell is Deus dying? The show never ever explains what exactly is killing him, hell, I thought gods were supposed to be immortal, but I guess Deus just got some kind of God AIDS and now he's about to pass away. And second: If Deus is the God of Time and Space, then why doesn't he just use his powers over time and space to look into the future and just make whoever won the game there into his successor already? Isn't he in a hurry to get this damn successor before he dies? Does he just want to see a bunch of people killing each other before dying? Either way, it's fucking dumb as hell, there's no reason to even come up with this game when you know exactly who is going to win in the end. Even if you make the argument that he's giving the participants the chance to change this future that he already knows is coming ahead, this is pointless because the winner of the game by the end of the series is exactly who Deus knew was going to be all along. Really, what is the point of everything that happens in this series?\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, that's not even the worst part, the story somehow actually manages to get dumber after that masterpiece of a premise.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the other eleven participants of the game is Yukiteru's classmate, a girl called Gasai Yuno, who has been obsessively stalking the guy and vows to protect him at all costs, her Future Diary is even made specifically to help her protect Yukiteru. Together, they vow to defeat the other Future Diary owners and bring this game to an end, and as you may have guessed it: Most of the diary owners are generic anime bad guys, ranging from a terrorist, to a girl who commands a creepy religious cult, to a serial killer, to a psychopathic loli who somehow has access to dangerous weaponry and so on. Why would Deus choose a bunch of deranged people to this game? I dunno, it's almost like this is an anime and Yukiteru is supposed to be the protagonist who fights against a bunch of villains or something. There's a cop in the game, though, apparenly Deus' motivation to choose him would be to balance things out because the other Future Diary owners were horrible people, because surely one cop can stand up to almost a dozen dangerous criminals.\\n\\n\r\nPredictably, most of the other participants target Yukiteru because he's Deus' personal favorite pick for winner of the game (in other words, he's the protagonist of the show) and they all end up being defeated. Good thing they all conveniently attack him one at a time despite having a common goal in mind, otherwise I would start believing the characters in this show are actually smart or something. But even if they did attack Yukiteru and Yuno together, I'm sure the writers would find a way to make them fail, because Yukiteru has a plot armor that's somehow thicker than Sakae Esuno's skull. The bad guys have to be really dumb in such unbelievably contrived ways in order to lose their battles against Yukiteru and Yuno that it's really hard to take this shit seriously. Take Minene, the terrorist who's the ninth diary user, for example, she sneaks into Yukiteru and Yuno's school and somehow manages to set up bombs all over the place without being seen or suspected by anyone, which is fucking ridiculous, but I'll buy it. What I won't buy, though, is that she conveniently blows up one part of the school at a time, and it's always giving Yukiteru and Yuno just enough time to get away before they get blown up. She then blabbers about how this was all a plan to lure Yukiteru out, and she actually threatens to blow the whole school up. Well... Why doesn't she blow the whole school up? Isn't her objective to kill Yukiteru? By just blowing everything up from the get-go, she would have killed both Yukiteru and Yuno, two birds with one stone. But we all know why she didn't just do that, because then this garbage would have lasted for a mere two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other battles against diary users aren't much better than this, it always comes to them having Yukiteru and Yuno backed into a corner, with all the opportunities in the world to kill them, but failing because they're plagued by the powers of bad writing. The Future Diaries themselves are barely even worth talking about here, seriously, they're almost completely forgotten by the characters during these fights, and only do actualy predict the future when it's convenient to the plot, which makes them more of a cheap gimmick than anything else. Action scenes in spite of that aren't even that good, so just turning my brain off and enjoying the action was an impossibility, they're serviceable enough, save for some really stupid moments such as the fight against the twelfth diary user who acts like a tokustatsu hero, he hypnotizes some followers of the sixth diary user and they also wear wacky tokusatsu costumes to fight alongside him. His strategy is to confuse Yukiteru and Yuno because the costumes look similar, so they have trouble telling this guy apart from the others... Except they shouldn't have so much trouble because the costumes have different colors in their helmets, so even if he did blend in together with the others, he still has a specific color in his costume's helmet, but Yukiteru and Yuno are fucking idiots and take forever to get this guy for some reason. God, this is so dumb...\\n\\n\r\nEven worse than the fights is Mirai Nikki's pathetic attempt at character development. The diary users for the most part are generic anime archetypes with some edgy backstory thrown in there so the unfortunate viewer can maybe sympathize with them, and I mean, they do try really hard to get you to sympathize with these characters, if their stupid backstories didn't get you feeling sorry for them, the fact that most of them die right after those backstories are revealed definitely will! Or maybe you're an actual thinking person, and you realize these backstories don't matter in the end. Look at Tsubaki, the sixth diary user and leader of the previously mentioned generic evil cult that does whatever, she's a backstabbing bitch who wants to win the game because she hates the world and wants to destroy it. But hey, look at her background, she was randomly gang-raped by all the other males in her cult right after losing her parents, how ~sad~ and ~tragic~ a character this one is! The rape really drives the point home, it was completely necessary and had everything to do with the plot, man! What about Minene? The terrorist who blew a school up and possibly killed thousands of students in the process? Minene lost her parents and spent her childhood alone in some eastern country where religious extremists caused violent conflicts to happen, which eventually led to her hating religion... And eventually becoming a terrorist who fights against religion because God is evil and yadda yadda, yet doesn't think twice before blowing up schools and murdering thousands of students to achieve her goals. But wait, you're gonna love what comes next, trust me! Minene ends up being romantically engaged with a cop called Nishijima... A damn cop is in love with a terrorist who recently killed a lot of innocent people! Minene then \"softens up\" starts acting like a cookie-cutter tsundere in their \"cute\" romantic moments together, and it's like she never did anything wrong to begin with! She never shows any regret for killing all those people she killed back then, and may I remind you that Nishijima works for the Police! What the hell IS this shit? Am I supposed to just accept this as some kind of cute anime romance? What, does Nishijima see the real human bean behind this poor terrorist who's responsible for the grief of many families who sent their kids to school? Fuck you, Mirai Nikki. Fuck! You! It's already bad enough that you're implying rape victims become psychopaths, but now you're trying to pass murderous terrorists off as misunderstood humans who deserve love? What the fuck, man?\\n\\n\r\nNot even our main characters are exactly well-written either, Yukiteru is wildly inconsistent through the story and can go from a helpless loser to a badass whenever the plot needs him to do so, his relationship with Yuno is as deep and engaging as the romance in the Twilight saga is. He slowly starts to realize that Yuno may have a few screws loose and keeps oscilating between trusting her and not trusting her, yet this motherfucker keeps trusting Yuno even after she tries to kill his friends and even turns against him later! He has no real reason to trust Yuno aside from the fact that she protects him, but at this point it's pretty obvious that she has obscure reasons for doing so. Yuno is a yandere who loves Yukiteru, and that's basically all the characterization she gets, all of her dialogue and actions are about Yukiteru, and she also has a dark past, of course she does. Yuno was abused by her parents and became depressed, she was a loner in the classroom until one day she talked to Yukiteru and sorta made him promise he'll marry her in the future, he thought it was a joke and just accepted the proposal in an obviously half-hearted way. Do you think that's dumb? Yeah, me too. Oh, and also Yuno has what seems to be some dead bodies inside her house, which makes Nishijima get on her tail and start to question her about these rumors, Yuno reacts in the most \"obviously I did something wrong\" way possible, but Nishijima for some reason doesn't follow her or anything. I swear this dude is the worst cop of all time.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of this, time to crank up this diarrhea dile, because we're going to dive into the final act of Mirai Nikki, where things get even more hopelessly stupid than they already are! Yukiteru's father, who previously abandoned his son in a collapsing tower to save his own ass, by the way, was deceived into killing Yukiteru's mother by John Bacchus, the mayor of the city and the eleventh diary user. This makes Yukiteru go after him, the two to share an \"emotional\" reconciliation moment, only for them to get ambushed by Bacchus' goons who kill Yukiteru's father. Turns out this whole game was actually Bacchus' plan and he is the one who designed the Future Diaries, Bacchus somehow convinced Deus to go with this game and his motives for wanting to become the new God of Time and Space is that he's basically a Hitler wannabe. Why would Deus go with this plan to begin with? Is it even worth giving a fuck about the plot at this point?\\n\\n\r\nNow Yukiteru wants to win the game because he believes that will give him the power to revive his family... Yes, he thinks the God of Time and Space has life-restoring powers... This is our protagonist, ladies and gentlemen! This is hilariously retarded enough as it is, but Yukiteru could have literally just asked Deus if he could revive his family if he became the new god, there was nothing stopping him from doing so in the scene where Murmur implied the revival thing to him! \"Why doesn't Yuno tell Yukiteru that he's going full retard?\" you may ask, it's actually because she's also deceiving Yukiteru into believing that! Woah, what a shocking turn of events! Yukiteru just believes her, of fucking course he does, even though she lied to him multiple times at this point, caused the death of his friends and almost even killed him. But yeah, there's a really nonsensical plot twist regarding Yuno, and I'll spill it out right now.\\n\\n\r\nWalmart Kaworu eventually finds out that the Yuno that's been around the whole time is actually another Yuno from a different timeline where she indirectly killed Yukiteru and won the survival game. Seeing that she can't bring Yukiteru back to life, she then traveled back in time, killed her own parents in this timeline, as well as killed herself from this timeline and took her identity as Yuno. She's basically doing an infinite time loop where she spends time with Yukiteru, kills him at the end of the game and returns to the beginning to start it all over again.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, how is Yuno even still around? She went back in time and killed her version of this time, which means she was killed before entering the game and shouldn't be participating on it as a result. Alright, let's assume she's immune to time travel bullshit because she's technically God of Time and Space, then... How the hell can two Gods of Time and Space exist in the same universe? How is Yuno's meddling with time affecting Deus? Couldn't Deus see that Yuno comes from another timeline or that she's actually another god? If Deus died in the previous timeline, how can Yuno just travel back in time and have him be alive? Why doesn't Deus just do that to himself so he can just exist forever instead of bothering with all this stupid shit? What does Deus dying even mean? He dies but can be brought back to life later? His existence gets erased out? Who the hell knows? It's not like the writers are going to explain shit!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Yuno and Yukiteru are the only survivors left in the game, turns out Murmur has been secretly manipulating the game all along in order to have Yuno win, which is something Deus apparently never suspected, even though he's the fucking God of Time and Space and can see into the future! Murmur and Yuno travel back in time and end up creating a third timeline, but this time Yukiteru interferes with Minene's help. Yeah, Minene was kept alive by Deus. They end up saving the Yuno from that timeline and her parents before Yuno and Murmur could get to them, which ends up making this the happy timeline where not only Yuno, but everyone else apparently have peaceful lives now. How exactly does Yuno being saved affects everyone else's lives? What does Yuno's life have to do with Yukiteru's parents not divorcing? I don't know, I don't care either.\\n\\n\r\nThe Yuno we've seen this whole time kills herself and Yukiteru then becomes the new God of Time and Space. What does he do? Nothing, he becomes depressed over Yuno's death and doesn't do anything... Even though he's the fucking God of Time and Space and he can just travel back in time, meet Yuno in a new timeline, maybe save her and her parents like he did in the third timeline, I don't know. I guess that would mean Deus would also come back and there would be another death game, because this show's use of time travel is just great. Ten thousand years later, Yukiteru decides to create a new timeline while Murmur plans to create another survival game. Yeah, it's basically a failed attempt at a Gainax Ending.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else can I even say about Mirai Nikki? The visuals and animation aren't anything to write home about, in fact it looks weird sometimes and the CGI is terrible, but at least it looks okay for the most part. Music is also just there, I don't remember anything when it comes to the soundtrack, but the openings are pretty good, so at least there's that. The direction is also pretty sloppy sometimes, although it may be the fault of the source material, but aside from the characters dying pretty much in the same episode that reveals their background, this show has the tendency to immediately brush their deaths off by showing the main characters doing some random comical stuff right afterwards, which diminishes the impact of those deaths even more, and those awkward transitions are present in most of the story. Even if it was the source material's fault for having those same transitions, the anime should have improved on that instead of being such a literal adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Mirai Nikki is a trainwreck in every sense of the word. A poorly-written and poorly-directed mess that pretends it's smarter than it actually is, tries to mask its terrible plot and characters with shock value caused by gore, edgy characters and other themes it handles terribly, and can only be enjoyed people who literally turn their brains off, as many suggest. I would like to say there's some positives to talk about in the story, but I can't see them, the premise is stupid, the story has enough plot holes to cover the moon, the characters are not only unlikeable, but also poorly-written, and the ending is a forced attempt at tragedy. Some people still like Mirai Nikki, even though they admit it's not a good anime, because apparently it's \"so bad it's good\" so they watch it for laughs, but I seriously can't even give Mirai Nikki this much credit because I was outright pissed off when I watched it, I just couldn't believe how retarded all of this was getting, and the final act was the point where I just gave up and wanted to finish this anime just for the sake of finishing it. I would watch other bad popular anime like Sword Art Online, Guilty Crown, Akame ga Kill or even School Days over Mirai Nikki any day of the week, at least most of those shows had something going for them, they actually made me create expectations before going to shit. Mirai Nikki, on the other hand, is a show I went in with extremely low expectations, and it didn't even meet those low expectations to begin with.",

It was really tiresome to see Yukiteru being \"stabbed in the back\" over and over again only to find him always alone. Still this points out a horrible truth about this world, the fact that you can't see someone for who he really is.\\n\r\nAlso, the series is full of interesting motives and philosophical concepts that makes it worthwhile watching.\\n\r\nArtwork consists of a perfect balance since its not too flashy and characters as well as background are designed well, making it ideal for those who want to follow the story as me.\\n",

            "content": "1. Introduction/Synopsis: \r\nSuppose you are an everyday, normal high school student with no outstanding attributes or friends. You're not particularly good at sports or at academics, though you are pretty good at throwing darts. You spend most of your time keeping a diary of random things that happen around you and talking with an imaginary friend you invented called \"Deus Ex Machina\", the God of Space and time and his adorable little side-kick \"Murmur\". \r\nThen suddenly, one day out of nowhere, Deus gives you a diary and mentions something about a game. Entries pop up in your diary you haven't written yourself and it foretellsfuture events spanning the next 90 days. All of it comes true. \\n\\n\r\nYour whole world turns upside down as you find out that your life is in danger and you have been placed in a game where there are 11 others like you with a diary that can be used to predict and even rewrite the future. You are forced to kill or die in an elimination battle to determine who will next ascend the Throne to Godhood after Deus. In the process, you gain an unnerving, relentless stalker girl who at first seems cute, but is completely insane. \\n\\n\r\nYou are thrown into battles with opponents several levels out of your league from child prodigy to cult leader, with no one to protect you except the stalker. And more and more is revealed along the way to unnerve you as plot thickens and conspiracies unfold to make you shake in both fear and excitement. \\n\\n\r\nCongratulations, you now know what it's like to be Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano, the main character of Mirai Nikki. \\n\\n\r\n1. Story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTwo things stand out most when watching Mirai Nikki - its thrilling plot and its vast array of characters with their own unique back-stories and layers of depth. What makes the plot amazing is the characters, and what makes the characters amazing is the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself employs the \"layer\" method, which peels away depths of the story and the background of the two main characters - Yuki and his stalker girlfriend Yuno as we progress through battles with each and every other unique diary user. And this method is extremely effective as we switch between finding out more about the two main characters Yuki and Yuno, battles and back-stories with the other ten diary users, Deus and Murmur, and even non-diary users that become relevant to the central story. \\n\\n\r\nThe mood of the story is very, very dark - it is both psychological thriller and partly horror. Not supernatural horror like ghosts and zombies, but the horror comes in the form of Gasai Yuno. And the best part about the story is ---spoiler--- that you cannot bring back those you have killed using either cheap plot devices or Deus Ex Machina (which is ironic, because that's the name of the God of Space and time). That in itself gets a lot of points. \\n\\n\r\nWith the dark mood and the layer method that slowly peels away at dark secrets and locked away pasts that we are scared, but excited to see, the story becomes very captivating and really draws you in. To be frank, I was pretty much addicted to the show throughout. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending, My GOD the ending. If there is anything so perfect and amazing to the plot is how the series ends, when the final layer is peeled and we find out terrible things about Gasai Yuno, who is not whom she seems to be. I won't go beyond that so that I won't spoil anything, but trust me when I say you will want to watch it to the end to find out the unravel entire back-story of hers. \\n\\n\r\nIf I do have one gripe about the story, it's that it seems the original creator wanted Yuki and Yuno to touch base and have a standoff with every single character. That is not realistic, in my opinion, and I feel it would have been better done and more realistic if more of the other diary users could fight with each other rather than have them all face the two main characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a survival battle, after all and in reality, other characters will try to face other characters in the meantime. \\n\\n\r\n2. Art 9/10: \\n\\n\r\nThe style of art is quite well done. I really enjoyed the dark style that comes with the setting and horror element complimented with some light-hearted, humorous events that span the series from school life to Gasai Yuno's awkwardness and hilarious stalker things she does. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the best part was the style in the opening theme with the use of darkness and light. And Gasai Yuno's insanity was portrayed really, really well. \\n\\n\r\nExcellently done. I am not a big fan of horror itself, so I couldn't find it in me to give the style of art a full score. If I particularly enjoyed horror, I would have given it a perfect 10/10! \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound 8/10: \\n\\n\r\nMusic - the music was wonderfully done, complimenting the horror and the action scenes very well. The opening theme and the ending theme was superb in my opinion and I would personally love to hear more by people who created the music!\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting - Ugh... while I do enjoy some, if not most of the voice actors (especially Gasai Yuno, whoever voiced her is a genius), I could not quite find it in myself to give the voice a full score because of Yukiteru Yuki and his constant whining. He's not the character with the strongest of heart and he isn't the most annoying character in the history of anime, but that still does not mean I don't want to tear my hair out if I have to hear him whine one more time. Anyway, my rant on Yukiteru will continue in the Character section. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects - very well done, especially the gun shots, the explosions, and the clash of sword on sword. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, aside from a few minor complaints on voice acting, I rather enjoyed the sounds! \\n\\n\r\n4. Characters 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nWe're going to break this down into 4 major categories: Yuno and Yuki, Deus and Murmur, the other diary users, and the non-diary users. Warning - there WILL be LIGHT SPOILERS ahead. I will always try to keep it to a minimum, but with Mirai Nikki, it is almost unavoidable. \\n\\n\r\n(1.a) Yukiteru \"Amano\" Yuki 6/10 - Starting out, he showed promise. He was a normal high school student, perhaps slightly selfish and a loner, but he seemed like the kind of guy who had potential to make exciting things happen. And then, he... doesn't follow through. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I don't mind that he is a weak character. I don't need a character to be strong in order to like him or her. Gasai Yuno more than makes up for him (see 1.b Gasai Yuno). What I cannot stand is an overly idealistic character that whines all the time and tries to save everyone even though he neither possesses the skill nor strength to do so. He cannot accept reality and is extremely emotionally weak. To me, he is the true damsel in distress in the series who is constantly whining with Gasai Yuno being the knight in shining armor turned monster. If I have to hear him whine and say \"I want to save everybody\" one more time, I will either tear my hair out or the person's next to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut towards the end, he does turn out quite interesting in his own way, especially when he is later corrupted by Gasai Yuno and he does things that cannot be taken back, breaking gears just to find out that he cannot reverse it. And that's why I did not give him a failing score. We're going into heavy spoiler zone here, so I'll just leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nSo to those who want to drop the series just because of this guy, I say - grind on. There is hope for him in the end, yet! :D\\n\\n\r\n(1.b) Gasai Yuno 12/10. Yes. 12. Not 10 out of 10. 12 out of 10. That's how amazing of a character she is. I rarely grade a character above a full score, but for her, I had to make an exception.\\n\\n\r\nShe is Yuki's psychopathic Knight in shining armor turned Monster. She is the epitome of Yandere and characters. She did so many unspeakable things and hides them so well that it took Yuki and even Akise (the genius detective and the strongest non-diary user) a long time to find out. She stalks Yuki and tricks him so many times into loving her, then betraying his trust, but in the end, he still falls for her. Plus I love girls going after guys :D. \\n\\n\r\nShe also gets bonus points for being a strong female character, as I am quite fond of anime who have males and females balanced with equal status. I am a strong advocate of equal rights and opportunity after all. She takes out some of the strongest diary users like they are nothing as if she were rigged (and towards the end, you find out it makes perfect sense). She has one of the most horrible and darkest secrets that you WANT to find out about as well as a past that explains it all. She is mentally unbalanced and completely insane. And she seems to be in conspiracy with either Murmur or Deus. \\n\\n\r\nShe drives the plot forward towards the future and even back into the past with the backstories. Every time something is revealed about her or she does something unspeakable, you never fail to cover your mouth and gasp. She is full of surprises and never ceases to amaze you. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is any reason to watch Mirai Nikki, it is her. Trust me, just like you want to watch Great Teacher Onizuka just for Eichiro Onizuka, you will want to watch Mirai Nikki just for this girl. \\n\\n\r\nAgain 12/10. Masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n(2) Other diary users 10/10 - There are 12 in total, so excluding Yuki and Yuno, there are still 10 others. I enjoyed every single last one of them from child prodigy to cult leaders. I'm not going to go into depth on all of them as my review is already longer than I had anticipated. So I'm going to talk about the few that I particularly enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nNamely - Uryuu Minene XD! *Goes into fanboy mode* She hands down my 2nd favorite character next to Gasai Yuno. She is unpredictable as she is an international terrorist (yes, terrorist, and no I don't think she's part of the Al-Qaeda) and she uses BOMBS, takes HOSTAGES, and is not afraid to use any method no matter how unorthodox it is to survive. Plus she loses an eye early on and has to wear an eyepatch. I wanted to date at least one girl who wears an eyepatch after that XD. \\n\\n\r\nAfter her would be Reisuke Houjou, the 4 year old child prodigy who has the knowledge of an elite university student and he is so cute that you cannot help but neglect thinking of him as someone dangerous. And then wake up and find yourself in a setting similar to the games that John Kramer from \"Saw\" has planned. The child sets you to be trapped in a twisted \"game\" where he makes the rules and you have to play by those rules. He has fun along the way, not killing you immediately but instead toying with you along the way to get maximum enjoyment to the point where even the invincible Gasai Yuno is almost killed by him. This is the first time we meet a character who is as twisted and insane as Yuno herself. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the other 8 are nearly just as good! They each have their own backstory from twisted to tragic. Each of them are geniuses in their own rights and have their own unique ways of fighting from commanding humans/beasts to setting traps and even dueling you in straightforward combat. \\n\\n\r\nNot all of the diary-users and their back-stories are strong, but they are strong enough overall to make me give them an overall 10/10. They are a wonderful cast and very few of them will leave you bored (*cough* though I can't stand that masked superhero*cough* He annoys me almost as much as Yuki).\\n\\n\r\n(3). Deus and Murmur 9/10 - I can't say much without spoiling much, but let's just say they make quite an interesting pair. they are exactly the polar opposites of each other. He is huge, she is tiny. He is cold and calculated, she is cute and bubbly. He is sane and thinks with reason, she... doesn't. XD\\n\\n\r\nAnd they play each other for fools, as they each have their own way of trying to figure out the intentions of the other. \\n\\n\r\n(4) Non-diary users 8/10 - Most of them are a bit meh for me. Nishijima (a police officer who is in love with Uryuu Minene) and Kosaka (who used to bully Yuki and then turned his friend) are slightly enjoyable in their own way, but also very annoying. So is the girl Hinata Hino who ---spoiler--- commands the army of hounds for her grandfather who turns out to be the true diary user. \\n\\n\r\nSo why give it such a high 8 out of 10? One word - ARU AKISE XD! *Goes into fanboy mode*\\n\\n\r\nHe is my 3rd favorite character and hands down my favorite male character in the series. First, he is a genius detective and is extremely hilarious. ---spoiler---He fools you into thinking he is a diary user and even I suspected and groaned when I thought he was, but was shocked to find that he is not. ---spoiler--- He merely has genius deductive skills to the point that you think he could predict the future. \\n\\n\r\nHe is amongst the first to figure out the truth behind Yuno and Murmur (no, I won't tell you what it is in the review, so either you watch it for yourself or google it, though I highly recommend you watch it for yourself). He is the strongest of the non-diary user with both wits and brawn and nearly matches Yuno in hand-to-hand combat. If Yuno is the most unpredictable character, then Akise is the best character at deduction and prediction. \\n\\n\r\nPLUS ---SPOILER--- He shares a kiss scene with Yuki at some point, which will probably appease all the Yaoi fans out there. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the characters make the plot work, and trust me when I say you do want to watch the series for the character, which I feel is the one element Mirai Nikki did best. \\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinally, enjoyment? It sends me on an emotional coaster and a huge mindfuck through the entire series. It is one of the pinnacles of psychological thrillers alongside the big names of Death Note, Code Geass, and Monster, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIs never failed to keep me captivated, even if I felt it started slow at first. It escalated really fast and ALL the characters get their own time and backstories. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Conclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my all-time favorite series. It is one of the reasons I am glad to have joined MAL, with special thanks to AviJii who introduced this to me in the first place. :D\\n\\n\r\nIt made me laugh, it made me gasp, it made me cry, it kept me captivated through. This is one of those series that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to watch an anime that will blown your mind away. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended to anyone who wants a good story with SOLID characters, including an insane stalker with an unstable mind XD. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 Excellent\\n\\n\\n\r\nRemember, this review is personal and based on my personal experience of it, and it will be unfair to expect everyone to agree. \\n\\n\r\nSo I ask you, the readers of my review: What about you? What did you think? Feel free to agree or disagree and point out what you thought you liked or disliked about Mirai Nikki! :D",

            "content": "Just your average-everyday anime-viewer here, with another review!\r\nAs any accustomed anime-viewer on the internet and surfing about in the vast corners of the ever expanding sea of information (or in my case, the shallow waters of 9GAG), then you have probably already heard of what could really be considered as the birthplace to \"The Original Overly Attached Girlfriend\", or at least by the anime community. I am of course referring to Yuno. Booting up the first episode and having quite a few expectations as to what I am about to witness, not only were they confirmed but actually exceeded these expectiations quite exceptionally. But (yes,there's a butt), as this show is highly claimed to be one of the better horror, gore and phsycological anime out there, which I totally agree on, there are a few flaws that just needs to be adressed. And now, I can already feel that DEAD END coming for the button \"Not Helpful\" by mobs of people who are sharpening their pitchforks and lightening the bonfires. In this case, the Mirai Nikki fanbase...\\n\\n\r\nBefore reading on, this review is spoiler-free, so don't worry should you want to watch this show after reading the review. I take it that you've read the synopsis yourself and maybe even watched the show. This review also comes with a TL;DR section as well as a few additional details, right at the bottom before the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story: 9/10\\n\r\nWith a premise of a Deathgame (one that we should be quite used to after this, Deadman Wonderland and many others, including The Hunger Games), this one actually has the most interesting twist to the game, or at least in my humble opinion (IMHO). In the beginning of the show, everything we need to know is covered, nothing more and nothing less, leaving what will actually happen in the game itself very vague and up for the imagination to come up with how they will execute the plot (and players). This is crucial, as this leaves an exciting and often curious mind-set into each and every episodes, which however lasts only in the first few episodes. They show us these few episodes and the set-up quite remarkably fast and informative. Then, the show divides itself up in different parts where Yuuki and co. has to kill (or something else) the player of the episode. Or rather, episodes. Here lies one of the problems I metioned in the beginning. While the player-arcs are interesting, thrilling and a treat to watch, other arcs feel emptier. Not by means of action and excitement but BECAUSE of the player-arcs, they seem insignificant even though they are not. Towards the end, everything connects and starts to conclude the series when you suddenly remember that one thing from the second or third episode and realise that there's three more episodes left. I'm not saying that the ending was bad, but if it was something I want to adress to the ending, it was that urge and need to stand out, and therefore, it felt rushed and incomplete. Mirai Nikki, you already stand out in terms of storytelling, execution and characters. C'mon, you're better than that. But, it still leaves with a hail-mary and a strong, solid exit (as long as you see the OVA: Mirai Nikki Redial).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 8/10\\n\r\nOne thing I immediately think of when referring to the art of Mirai Nikki is its great crispness of details and actual emotions & distress (and on multiple occasions, Yuno's absolute horrifying expressions she can make) that they manage to display to us. Blood and action is basically the name of the game here and it is where Mirai Nikki truly shines, with progression through aggression. Action-scenes are a feast for the eyes and every action counts, every DEAD END significant and every death remarkable. It blends extremely well with the tone of the show and even parts that aren't that common in anime makes great usage here. And by that, I mean how they use 3D models. Sure, 3D-models shouldn't really be used unless with absolute necessity but they managed to pull it of here. And after all this praising and telling how good it was, I gotta tell ya, it doesn't stand out. For a thriller, the colours are warmer than most other thrillers out there, but can get to those levels when the plot requires it to be so or under heavy rain (...). But still, it passes with flying colours and there shouldn't be any complaints here, but neither should there be excessive amounts of praise. Have to balance out...\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'll start off the same way an episode of a usual anime starts, with the OP. Having two OPs, the first one being \"K\u016bs\u014d Mythology\" performed by Y\u014dsei Teikoku is one that not only reflects the anime brutally perfect within the one-and-a-half-minute it is on air, but also sticks on your mind during the episode and after it as well. And as they usually do, they replace it halfways. Compared to the first, \"Dead End\" by Faylan has nothing on OP1. Inside the episode, the music amplifies the scenes complimentary with great effect, but only the heavy action scenes and the rare \"feels-scenes\". Here lies another problem, as great as they are, none are rememberable and are used a few more times than I wanted. Still, I find Mirai Nikki having great pieces of music that fit well with the show but not outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: 9/10\\n\r\nWe've got the coward, Yuuki. We've got the mad one, Yuno. And we've got a heck of other characters where we do not know who to care enough of shit about. Don't get me wrong, the cop and the girl who can escape from anything are interesting characters and have an interesting backstory to boot. But what about the other characters? Is a two-minute explanation of a players motives good enough? Here, they can variey, as all characters are unique and have unique motivations along with unique diaries. Then there are the side-characters, who the series try their very, very best to make us give an actual fuck about and even made one of them important! All I'm saying is that there are many great characters, add on a few characters where we kinda give a fuck about and a handful of which we give absolutely no fuck about. The problem lies within the amount and significance ratio between them and spread butter evenly on a 24-sliced loaf and some characters will have more fucks deserved and a few lesser than they need. And you only have so much fucks to give...\\n\r\nBut, all the significant characters are interesting, have actual human thoughts and reasons (excluding Yuno or others when thinking about it...) and their reactions and emotions feels real (excluding Yuno at certain times...).\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt was a fun ride, and with that 26-episode mark, a rewatch was all worth it. I give 10/10 here and I have nothing more to say other than that I really enjoyed this show despite its flaws that comes along with it.\\n\\n\r\nHow it was Overall: 8.8/10\\n\r\nBy no means is this the best show ever, trust me. But it is a fantastic show that has the stamp of a \"Must Watch\" on it and it is a perfect addition to my (and hopefully yours) ever expanding library of anime. Having one of the craziest lunatics in anime-history, Yuno will kill you if you don't watch this anime and enjoy it to a certain extent. If not Yuno, then the Mirai Nikki fanbase. This show has hype, and most of it is well deserved :)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n+ Original Deathgame\\n\r\n+/- Great pacing at certain parts, downright wrong in others\\n\r\n+ Every action and death has impact\\n\r\n+/- Twisted but strong ending (remember to watch the OVA)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Great detail and overall animation\\n\r\n+ Action-scenes are the best\\n\r\n+/- Doesn't have that kind of dark-tone that thrillers usually have, but it's good enough\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Awesome OP1\\n\r\n- Replaced halfway by a comparably worse OP2\\n\r\n+ Great overall background music that amplifies the show well\\n\r\n+/- No rememberable pieces\\n\r\n+/- Set on repeat\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n+ Great main-characters\\n\r\n+ Interesting and diverse player-characters\\n\r\n+/- A tap too many characters\\n\r\n+/- The side characters overall\\n\r\n+ Most characters have real human emotions and reasons\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n+ Worth it\\n\r\n+ Must see\\n\r\n+ That urge to watch another episode is strong on this one\\n\\n\r\nAdditional Details:\\n\r\n* Romance: Well, not your average kind of romance...\\n\r\n* Gore & Blood: Excessive amounts, but used sparingly\\n\r\n* Comedic Add-ons: Rare and often not noticable\\n\r\n* Feel-warning?: You could say that towards the ending\\n\r\n* Fan-service?: In small amounts, nothing that'll bother you enough to ruin the show\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you've managed to get this far without immediately gotten a DEAD END on your phone or just headed straight for the \"Not Helpful\" button after having read the intro to this review, I would like to thank you for your time spent on reading this review by basically the most pathetic, average, no-life of an anime-viewer that I am...just like Yuuki :)\\n\\n\r\nSo, smack that \"Helpful\" button for me (or Yuno, whatever you prefer) and leave a comment so I can make better reviews that might fit your taste better :)\\n\\n\r\n- Just your average-everyday anime-viewer\\n\r\n//VoidX",

            "content": "Sakae Esuno\u2019s Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a fine combination of suspense, blood, and violent action. It is a psychological thriller that revolves around two middle schoolers, Yuki (the male protagonist) and Yuno (the female protagonist), participating in a deadly battle royale with 10 strangers. It\u2019s personally one of my favorite gory anime, but it lacks the opportunity to become a more frightening series. Mirai Nikki\u2019s reputation as a gruesome anime is mostly thanks to the memorable Yandere character, Gasai Yuno. Commonly known as Yuki's psychotic stalker in the series, Yuno describes herself as \u201ca half moon\u201d that has \u201ca bright half and a darkhalf.\u201d The anime involves reverse gender roles with the girl protecting the guy under any circumstances, delivering bloody violence at every corner. However, the few downsides of the anime, including plot twists and some wacky characters, can cause one to produce mixed feelings about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7)\\n\r\nThe rules of the game are pretty straightforward: kill everyone until you\u2019re the last one standing. Thankfully, there are no sudden changes in the rules or mercy shown between characters to interrupt the flow. The participants\u2019 sudden actions constantly changes the future of other participants, creating new objectives between characters. However, it causes a slight downfall when Yuki is immediately made the center of attention among the other 11 diary holders, when Deus Ex Machina declares Yuki as his favorite to win the game. Despite the shocking events that leads to the conclusion of the game, that particular part of the story already makes the story seem clich\u00e9d. The reward for the winner is becoming Dues Ex Machina\u2019s successor as the next God of Time and Space. It sounds boring, but it is understandable considering the powers that come with being a god. Characters have either good (reviving a lost friend or family member) or evil (time traveling to cause destruction to an individual\u2019s life) intentions. The characters\u2019 motives bring some excitement to the story, but it could\u2019ve been a more captivating story.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not original as it is another battle royale anime, but there are some unique aspects to the story. One is the different forms of their diaries. Although the majority of the diaries are cell phones, other diaries are suitable for certain characters\u2019 situations. Each diary also has special features specifically for that particular diary holder, giving that person an advantage over other diary holders. The show provides backgrounds on each participant of the game, instead of only focusing on the two main leads, to help the viewer determine whether or not certain characters are likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some light humor within the series, particularly with the quotes. E.g. Yuki yells \u201cCrazy stalker alert!\u201d or similar quotes in his head in reference to Yuno in an episode or two. Additionally, the characters' actions may seem illogical (e.g. a diary holder mysteriously hopping on a motorcycle to escape from death), but it\u2019s important to be mindful that the anime is meant to be supernatural. The winner becomes the God of Time and Space after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fast-paced and doesn\u2019t beat around the bush with fillers. The violence in the anime goes from light-heavy-light (introduction of the game to its conclusion). Deaths are not sudden, allowing the viewer to understand the characters\u2019 motives by providing backstories. Romance is one-sided in the beginning as a cowardly Yuki only teams up with the tough Yuno to protect himself. However, love slowly becomes mutual as they survive several obstacles together. \\n\\n\r\nMultiple plot twists and plot holes cause questions like \u201cWait. What just happened?\u201d There are tons of them present within the series. It requires patience as some parts are not fully explained until the last few episodes. The ending throws in a major plot twist by taking the viewer through parallel universes, so it could appear confusing. It ends with a cliffhanger, but its 30-minute sequel Mirai Nikki Redial completes the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7)\\n\r\nThere are both notable and forgettable characters in Mirai Nikki, and the characters\u2019 personalities range from wacky to badass. Character development is excellent, even though it takes a while to become present in some characters. Within the 12 diary owners, you have a terrorist, a 4-year-old mastermind, and a fatal married couple. Although there are a few unattractive villains, the majority of them are unforgettable and capable of becoming one\u2019s favorite character from the show or anime in general. Uniquely, all 12 diary holders, including Yuki and Yuno, are named after Roman gods and goddesses. Yuki is named after Jupiter, the god of the sky, weather, and lightning. \\n\\n\r\nYuki appears in the show as a whiny and gullible male lead, who doesn\u2019t seem to understand or accept the dangers of the game. His character develops into someone more self-confident and manly as one tragic event leads to another, contributing to the show\u2019s terror. Yuno is the Yandere female lead of the show who truly highlights the gore and violence that makes Mirai Nikki an excellent psychological thriller. Although she is shown as strictly a creepy obsessive stalker in the beginning, her character becomes more reasonable near the end as her past is completely exposed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\r\nAnimation was mostly good and fit the horrific and bloody atmosphere, especially Yuno\u2019s killing sprees. Character designs are both good and bad. All characters are distinguishable, even though some designs are non-menacing. Some of the villains had ridiculous designs that would probably scare the crap out of you if he/she stands at your bedside, but it may appear more comical through the screen, unless you\u2019re watching it in 3D. E.g. The Twelfth diary holder wears a large, round one-eyed mask, while acting like a Marvel superhero. Also, Deus Ex Machina and Murmur looks more like child-friendly mythical creatures instead of horrifying. Although there are bloody and disturbing scenes that are intended to make Mirai Nikki horrifying, the character designs take away a portion of the horror.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2019 emotions and personalities were detailed, giving off the fearful atmosphere. E.g. Yuno\u2019s appearance was timely with immediate switches from her innocence to psychotic features. Yuki\u2019s eyes displaced fear within the series to fulfill his earliest role as a major coward. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\r\nThe Japanese voices expresses the anime\u2019s terrifying atmosphere more so than the English voices. Japanese VA Tomosa Murata has the perfect voice to bring out Yuno\u2019s psychological features. She gives Yuno an innocent voice to embrace her split personality. In contrast, English VA Brina Palencia makes Yuno sound like a tomboy, and there's no innocence in her voice. Yuki\u2019s character is voiced by a female seiyuu named Misuzu Togashi. A female voice is more reasonable considering his pathetic and cowardly attitude within the series. The OP, ED, and background music suit Mirai Nikki\u2019s creepy theme, making it one of the anime\u2019s strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nI\u2019m a sucker for anime listed under the horror and psychological thriller genre, and Mirai Nikki is quite a thrill. The action and murders are entertaining, but I wished for the story to be more menacing that it already was. The character development enabled me to tolerate certain characters after a while and find some of them likeably remarkable. I grew confused with the plot twists, but the story began to unravel near the end. This is one anime I wouldn\u2019t mind re-watching multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\r\nMirai Nikki has an interesting story full of gore and violence that overcomes the plot twists. The viewer is introduced to a vast amount of potential likeable characters. A small number of characters may look and act too comical, making the anime seem less serious. On the bright side, the combination of the suspense, character development, and sound contribute to Mirai Nikki\u2019s psychological theme. If you're a fan of gore and survival anime, I recommend giving Mirai Nikki a try.",

            "content": "It's been quite a while since I've seen a series as laughably bad as Future Diary. Focused on a survival game with our weak-willed male lead Yukiteru and a yandere gal named Yuno obsessively in love with him, this series is a huge mess with plot and character developments, proper logic, mood consistency and relishing in its graphic and depraved content way too much.\r\nThe biggest issue that stems with Future Diary is that it seems to get too fixated in advancing its plot head-on without any regard for proper depth, buildup and consistency. There are a number of unexplored elements to the series like howYukiteru became acquainted with Deus and why many of the folks Deus chose for the survival game are a bunch of psychopaths, criminals and loons. Logic is tossed out the window with how certain plot setups occur and characters making decisions that don't make much sense like one character able to rig a ridiculous number of bombs throughout a school without anyone even noticing and Yukiteru continuing to trust Yuno despite knowing full well how much of a nutcase she is. A number of the players in the survival game don't get much depth beyond being crazed loons and criminals, and those who do get some sort of depth only get them in a scope of a couple episodes where their mentality for the violent and depraved acts they commit don't make any sense and seemed sloppily pasted together. The series lacks a consistent mood as it tries mixing around deadly serious storytelling and comedy at a number of points with the interactions between Yuno and Yukiteru, which felt awkward and ill-timed in execution. The final episodes of the series seemed sloppy in their execution with convenient developments and plot twists that either get convoluted or are poorly explored. And lastly, it tends to relish too greatly at many points in its graphic and depraved content with a good number of violent and gory scenes, a good amount of nudity and sexual content, torture, rape, child abuse, terrorism and a diverse number of ways to murder folks. It's like whoever made this series wanted to make it a seinen title, yet winded up with the immaturity and cheesiness you would find with a cookie-cutter shounen title in the way it is set up and structured.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to Future Diary are on the plain side with character designs sporting the typical mainstream look and scenery shots being decent with what they deliver. The CG animation for this (used mostly with vehicles or rendering the world of Deus ex Machina) is a bit sloppy as it looks awkwardly rendered and clearly sticks out from the typical animation of the series. The animation is nothing to write home about either with flat choreography during fight scenes and a decent number of animation shortcuts used throughout the title's run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Future Diary is one of the biggest messes in quality that I've seen in a while from a title getting plenty of hype from anime fans. With no regard for proper depth, consistency and buildup in the treatment of its plot and characters, as well as relishing in its objectionable content and themes, Future Diary is a lovely train wreck of a title that may get either disgust or unintentional laughs from fans with its content and sloppy execution.",

            "content": "This anime series left me speechless... and I don't necessarily mean that in a good way.\r\nThe story was engaging from the beginning.  Don't get me wrong. It was just that the premise was completely and utterly arbitrary. For the most part, especially throughout the first two thirds of the series, you can forgive it as the story keeps hinting that there is a meaning behind it all.  It tries to make out that the premise isn't arbitrary, that its a deep story line which will have an ending that will blow you away.  Well... the ending does blow you away, with asawed off double barrel shotgun.  So yes... it does do that at least. Essentially its a narrative about people who can read the future all trying to kill each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Gasai Yuno.  WHAT THE...?!!\\n\\n\r\nPossibly one of the most bizarre, interesting and (dare I say it) entertaining characters I've seen.  She's what makes you keep watching, to try and find out what the hell is really going on.  I won't say more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, apart from this one character, the plot holes are too deep, too wide and too glaring.  I suppose I can forgive one lapse in logic.  Two begins to bug me.  But in Mirai Nikki the annoying plot holes keep adding up.  \\n\\n\r\nThe term \"plot holes\" doesn't really do justice to what is happening.  They are not so much \"holes\" as they are rice paper sheets plastered over windows in order to keep the sun of reality from shining through.  It does an admirable job, and you admire it for trying its darned best...  but when the dawn comes, there ain't nothin' those thin sheets are going to do when the rays hit.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be watching and then a sudden red flag pops up in my mind warning me that what I am watching is illogical.  I'll push it to the back of my mind. But that annoying feeling just keeps itching away, until you are finally forced to vocalise your annoying niggling feeling either aloud to yourself or to your just as bemused friend sitting next to you... before they voice it first.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'm exaggerating here.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is entertaining.  The fight scenes and some of the scenarios of the participants of the \"survival game\" are quite entertaining.  You'll have to suspend your disbelief for quite a while in order to enjoy this anime.  It is most certainly possible given the music, the action sequences and the animation are all really well done, slick and sharp.  There will be moments when you'll be wanting to question \"why?\" or \"what?\" or \"when?\"...  Just ignore those irritating questions, sit back and enjoy the Gasai Yuno show...\\n\\n\r\nsorry?

            "content": "You know that guy at school that thinks they know more than what they actually do? It\u2019s that person full of overblown confidence, walks around with that air of superiority and tries their best to act above their age. Mirai Nikki is that in anime form. When you search deeper, going beyond just the looks, and actually ask questions of them they fall apart. You realise it\u2019s all one big ruse. I kind of want to pat Mirai Nikki on the head and make it feel better about itself. \u201cThat\u2019s so cute. You tried to be a seinen\u201d I\u2019d say with a tear in myeye. It takes a death game and approaches it with reckless immaturity in its themes and its writing. Any tension that should be there doesn\u2019t exist because of that and not even an interesting conclusion could save it. \\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki (aka Future Diary) tells the story of twelve contestants trying to become the next god of time and space in a death game where each individual can see into the future. It\u2019s a pity that in a show with that as its starting point that logic is sacrificed for the sake of entertainment. Sadly what\u2019s left over is messier than an oil spill. Most characters get such little screen time you couldn\u2019t care less what happened to them. There\u2019s some exciting set pieces but often are more about style over substance. If I had a dollar for every time I said the phrase \u201cBut why didn\u2019t they just [insert alternative here] instead\u201d then I\u2019d be doing quite well for myself. My assessment of Mirai Nikki may be harsh but the show puts itself into a corner quite quickly. It initially treats its premise seriously before topping it up with fanservice and changes in tone that were completely uncalled for.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll start things off with our main character Yukiteru Amano who might be one of the most difficult to understand characters put to screen. Harsh? Judge for yourself. Yuki has this incredible potential to pull courage out of his backside before it melts away in front of his eyes. One minute he\u2019s running the show and the next minute he is a whiny shrimp. His writing is incredibly incoherent. I\u2019m also given little reason to get behind him and cheer him on to victory. The decisions he makes are laughable. In a death game he seems more focused on maintaining friendship and escaping loneliness as opposed to actually winning. \u201cI don\u2019t mind getting killed as long as I can be socially accepted!\u201d What a load of tripe. His social ineptitude feels like something as a means to instigate his story, but not something for him to overcome. His problems aren\u2019t deep or interesting and they have little of a role to play once the game gets underway. Granted it\u2019s a death game and you\u2019re not really in it to overcome your personal problems, but honestly it\u2019s the anime\u2019s fault for pushing this agenda from early on.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea what to make of Gasai Yuno, the pink haired yandere. I guess her unpredictability is most of her appeal, plus at least she has a concrete reason to fight, that being Yuki (Drinking game: Take a shot every time she says his name). Most of the interest I had in Mirai Nikki was \u201cOh I wonder what Yuno\u2019s going to do now?\u201d every time an event took place. She reacts with a purpose and doesn\u2019t flinch in doing so, always lining up well with her deluded character. Because Yuki is such a bland individual I spent most of the show hoping Yuno would just mince everyone. However, Yuno isn\u2019t a remarkable character, just one made to look better being surrounded by a bunch of forgettable individuals. Because her brainwaves basically shout \u201cYuki, Yuki, Yuki\u201d her actions are pretty easy to read. With Yuno you\u2019re really just in it to see how far down she can dig the hole.\\n\\n\r\nHardly any other contestant is worth mentioning. They\u2019re a forgettable group which all come with their predictable \u2018tragic\u2019 backstories. Everyone is too cheesy and villainous to command your appreciation. In a battle royale setup, giving all the characters meaningful motivation is important. Losing a contestant should make me feel sorry for them, not make me shrug my shoulders and count another step backwards from twelve. Remind me again why Deus would make any of these twelve wackos his successor? Does he even value the universe he protected? I should also mention that some character designs are hilarious and again go a long way to making me take the show even less seriously than I already was. Check out this little kid who has somehow developed the tendencies of a serial killer or a matron whose head has swollen to the size of a medicine ball! The difference in the capabilities of each diary is also amusing. Some of them never stood a chance from the very moment the game started while the power of another contestant makes me wonder how they didn\u2019t win within 24 hours at most. There\u2019s a \u2018comedy\u2019 tag missing under the genres section.\\n\\n\r\nThis show shifts its tone more inappropriately than me after too many drinks at karaoke. When a serious mood is being built up, on too many occasions it was brought down instantly by some horrendous piece of comedy, usually with a jovial soundtrack to match. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad if the show wasn\u2019t on other occasions trying to treat its premise seriously and with a vain attempt at being mature. One minute we\u2019re talking about the importance of free will and the next minute we\u2019re talking about breast size with lesbian undertones... Because we just can. Nothing serious that Mirai Nikki has to say ever sticks with you because the cheap stuff that\u2019s there to sell the show to the lowest common denominator taints it. It is never tense. It is never scary. It is childish and painful.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just the see-sawing in the mood that took me out of the experience but also the shocking way the show wastes its story potential, mostly in the way the characters interact. I wanted to get invested into the story, I really did. It\u2019s such an interesting premise. The idea of people fighting to change their destinies when they can see into the future sounds great.  But around half of the dozen contestants are absolutely pointless in the grand scheme of things. The writing of Mirai Nikki could have been a lot more focused if it cut down on the number of participants in the death game. Then we might have been able to see some meaningful interaction between the different parties. Heaven forbid, we might have actually seen the plans of many characters come into conflict! In a death game, where outwitting multiple people at once is essential, I\u2019d expect this as a minimum. You won\u2019t get that here.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is content to make it Yuki and Yuno vs. everyone else, and that is disrespecting the aforementioned potential. Introducing all their opponents earlier and seeing more of the contestants outside of our lead duo fighting against each other would have kicked this show out of second gear. It bamboozles me that everyone throws themselves at Yuki and Yuno at separate occasions, and confuses me even further that they don\u2019t go after each other more often. What on earth makes the \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 so darn important that they\u2019re there centre of everyone\u2019s attention? Don\u2019t approach this show expecting someone\u2019s plan to interfere with everyone else\u2019s, like it should if it treated its premise with decency. The game rarely feels intense because of this.\\n\\n\r\nIf I took a shot every time that a character had a clear cut opportunity to kill someone but didn\u2019t do so then I probably wouldn\u2019t be here to type up this review. I can\u2019t stand it when a show doesn\u2019t follow through with a logical progression in its plot just to stretch it out further for, say, entertainment value or to push some sappy theme. \u201cI could kill you right now but before I do so you must prove to me you have learned [insert theme here]\u201c. Come on. Really? Alliances in Mirai Nikki are also laughable. Very, very rarely do they actually make someone better off as opposed to just killing the other members. Yuki and Yuno find themselves often working through the game with the assistance of other contestants when it really wasn\u2019t necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe strange clusterfuck of an ending to Mirai Nikki actually salvaged it somewhat in my book. While I think it comes out left field it was somewhat foreshadowed, so it\u2019s not cheap. It was the high point for entertainment value in the show by a long shot. I wanted to see how the new situation dealt to the remaining characters would be overcome, because the setting actually felt suffocating for once. I was left satisfied by the conclusion but the journey there, well, I can\u2019t say the same for it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a thriller that\u2019s easy to digest, one that can also throw an interesting surprise in your face, then give it a shot. If you\u2019re able to look past the cast and give most of your attention to some of the action and set pieces then there\u2019s fun to be had. Being more of a story and character-driven viewer it wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to pick up the megaphone and shout into your ear that Mirai Nikki has zero value. Judge for yourself. It\u2019s almost worth it for what waits at the end. Almost.",

            "content": "NO SPOILERS. I promise! :)\r\nMirai Nikki, for most people, will be a hit or miss. It tries to combine a HELL of a lot of genres into one small package's worth of 26 episodes. There's probably a misconception that Mirai Nikki can be classified a \"psychological thriller\" the same way Death Note or Steins;Gate is commonly labeled, however, Mirai Nikki takes on a slightly different tone. At its core, Mirai Nikki was a romance.\r\nStory - 8\r\nIt's difficult to judge Mirai Nikki's story. While it's concept is incredibly unique, it's hard to say that the presentation of it is done well. The plot twists are unexpectedand wild, especially as the story reaches its climax, but gaping plot holes tarnish the experience a bit. You will NOT enjoy Mirai Nikki's story if you are expecting a bulletproof mystery story.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were extremely interesting for me. As the story progresses, however, it becomes apparent that many questions are left unanswered, and the show starts to become dull and dragged on. Mirai Nikki is another example of an anime that was too long for the story it had to tell. However, the show pulls itself together during the final episodes and picks up the pace in time to leave a mixed final impression. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, but not outstanding. It's evident that a lot of work was put into the action scenes to make it, well, action, and characters are drawn well. Overall, the art scheme is simply very fitting for what Mirai Nikki is. It's dark enough to be taken seriously as an action/psychological/thriller, but comedic and lighthearted as well for the aspects that need it. Mood changes within the anime are carried out pretty well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nGreat openings, endings, and BGM. Nothing too memorable, though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is where Mirai Nikki becomes something to love or hate. For one thing, there are so many characters in this anime that it could not possibly hope to develop all of them or properly introduce them. The one thing it never falters from, however, is the focus on the two main characters, Yuki and Yuno. And this is where I believe Mirai Nikki truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nA note on the main protagonist: Yuki is the typical Shinji archetype. He's weak, pathetic, and socially screwed, and although he goes through some incredible character development, he never becomes strong. If you are looking for that kind of Shounen anime, you should turn away now, because this kind of main character gets annoying REALLY fast. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my heart, though, that Yuki becomes an entirely different person at the end of the show. He goes through a beautiful cycle of love, depression, misunderstanding and regret. Although Yuno's character development seems nonexistent at first, she is a truly unique character that is slowly unraveled and developed as well as the story reaches its climax.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was pleased with the feeling that Mirai Nikki gave me. The only aspect of the show that brought it down to an 8 was that the story dragged on too long in the middle and my interest waned. I was pleasantly surprised, however, as the series finished. And although I usually come to dislike most endings, the ending to Mirai Nikki wasn't too bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nWatch it for a unique experience, but it may not be what you're looking for.\\n",

            "content": "This is a great series\r\nStory 9: This is essentially a Battle Royale with a very unique romance story. \r\nBattle Royale angle: We\u2019ve all seen versions of this before, where 8-12 people fight to the death to obtain a grand prize. The strength of Mirai Nikki\u2019s plot is not about the originality of the premise but about the originality (and insanity) of the journey. There is an excellent mix of action, slashing, backstabbing, detective work, plot twists, and craziness. I was impressed by how clever this anime was which is a breath of fresh air. This isn\u2019t a \u201chorror\u201d anime but there are a number oflegitimately creepy moments. \\n\r\nRomance angle: Woven into the storyline is an odd-yet-touching romance between the two main characters which revolves around Yuno\u2019s \u201cYandere\u201d-style pursuit of Yukki (btw this is NOTHING like School Days). I really liked their dynamic as it stayed away from many of the anime-relationship clich\u00e9s: tsundere female slowly warming up to an endlessly patient male lead, the classic high school love triangle, or super shy male flirts with super shy female for 23/24 episodes before finally making a move. No, no, no\u2026not with Yuno/Yukki. Without giving anything away (as this is apparent from episode one), the primary romantic dilemma is really best summed up by this quote: \u201cdo you really love me or are you just insane?\u201d That's for you to decide and the series keeps the audience oscillating back and forth from \u201cpoor, sweet, vulnerable Yuno\u201d to \u201cOk Yuno stop\u2026you\u2019re scaring the shit out of me.\u201d\\n\r\nWhen you put the whole story to together you get an exciting and captivating ride.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9: Best part of the series by far. The romantic aspect of the relationship is hilarious because of how crazy Yuno can be. \\n\r\nI went into Mirai Nikki with no warning or context. My first impression of Yuno when she met Yukii in the elevator was \u201coh sheesh, another one of these cute, cardboard harem girls who inexplicably falls in love with the outcast loner\u201d i.e. Megan Fox in Transformers. Man was I wrong. Yuno is a DEEPLY flawed and psychotic female lead who just so happens to have many redeeming qualities...and an itty bitty crush on Yukii. Yuno could never be a harem girl simply because she would kill all the other competition...yay monogamy. I'll shut up about Yuno and let you judge for yourself but I'd just like to emphasize how substantive her character is. Unlike Ein from Phantom, who was pretty much an emotionally empty blank slate, Yuno knows what she wants... \\n\\n\r\nYukii was harder for me to like (maybe it\u2019s a guy thing). There is no shortage of anime that start with a wimpy, insecure male protagonist but something about Yukii seems particularly pathetic and angsty. Maybe the beanie? Maybe the high-pitched voice? The nonstop CRYING! But\u2026 as he begins to develop as a character he becomes slightly more likeable. *sigh* It\u2019s a long journey. Fortunately, even if Yukkii is a wussy at times, it just creates more space for Yuno\u2019s personality to shine.\\n\\n\r\nSide Characters: I really liked the way the way the other contestants were built up. Every one of them is unique, memorable and deadly in his/her own way. There were certain characters that had me laughing out loud. I also appreciate how the series devoted a number of flashbacks that explored the backgrounds of many of the side characters. If I had one complaint it's that I did find Yukki\u2019s friends and his family to be a little boring. I would have liked them to have been more fleshed out and believable. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9: I really liked the animation. I\u2019m a complete layman when it comes to critiquing anime art but the animation seemed sharp and the color contrast was extremely striking to me. I especially liked the way the character\u2019s eyes were drawn. It\u2019s hard to describe but they would often add an extra iris for effect (creating terror and crazy eyes). It was perfect for me and something I don't remember seeing in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 I liked the first intro song much more than the second. This is purely a matter of personal preference. The only other part that annoyed me was just Yukkii\u2019s high pitched voice. I really wish they could have cast a male lead an octave deeper. Once again this is just me being picky.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: I loved this anime. It\u2019s exactly what I wanted to see, which was a bizarre romance with a lot of dark, twisted action and suspense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Has everything I want in an anime\\n\\n\\n\r\nMisc:\\n\r\nViolence/gore: Lots of blood and collateral damage.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: atypical love story. Yukki/Yuno\u2019s relationship is a big focus of the series.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: *sigh* Lots of undergarments, cleavage and panty shots. I actually wish they toned it down a bit. I found it weird that they are all supposed to be 14 but Yukki has the voice of a 12 year old and Yuno has the body of an 18 year old\u2026Welcome to the confusing world anime\u2026\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki (or The Future Diary in English) was a mixed bag for me. While there are some very good moments, there are some that just make want to pull out my hair in frustration. But there is one thing I know for sure: I felt somewhat underwhelmed. It wasn't horrible; it just wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.\r\n~~~~~~~\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIn the world of Mirai Nikki, the god of time and space, Deus Ex Machina, is coming to the end of his lifespan. In order to find out who will be his successor, he sends something called \"Future Diaries\" (ranging fromcell phones to a coloring book) to twelve different people and places them a life-and-death game, similar to the ones in The Hunger Games and Battle Royale.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Mirai Nikki's story is quite decent. It shows how the actions of people can change the future, because as the saying goes: \"Actions speak louder than words.\" It also shows how events can cause an impact on their reasoning of becoming God (seeing as all the diary holders (or at least half of them) are emotionally broken in some way). However, one of the problems with the story is its inconsistency, plot holes, and predictability. While there were parts that kept me on the edge of my seat, there were also parts that just left me absolutely confused. This confusion was evident during the last few episodes, where I was like: \"What the hell is happening?\" The ending also left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth... (Yes, I DO know that there's the OVA, \"Mirai Nikki Redial\". I just haven't watched it at the time I'm writing this review)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the story did have some hiccups, and was predictable at times, it was still engaging enough to keep me watching.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10:\\n\r\nMirai Nikki has almost the exact same problem that SAO had for me: its characters. While not as frustrating as the ones in SAO, it's still the weakest part of show for me.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, Yukiteru (or Yuki for short). His character is similar to that of Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion (and to an extent, Simon from Gurren Lagann), in which he's pretty much a wuss; but that's not my problem with him, because I would feel the exact same way if I were in his place. My problem with Yuki is his stupidity, as well as the inconsistency of his character. How the hell can he be still in love with Yuno after she locked him up, as well as preventing him from making any friends? I just find it mindboggling. I know he's the key to keeping her sane, but still! Another thing I don't like is how his personality does a complete 180 degree turn during somewhere within the final third of the show. I was like: \"What? This came out of nowhere! Please explain to me what just happened!\" \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there's Yuno, who is pretty much the fan-favorite of the show, as well as being the poster-child of yanderes. I'll be honest: I'm not a fan of Yuno. Maybe it's me, but I'm not the biggest fan of yanderes, as well as very possessive girlfriends. Yes, she does have her moments of batshit crazy awesomeness, but whenever she goes \"Yuki!!!\" several times, I'm just thinking \"Shut up already!!\" I do understand she does get some complexity, but that only really happens throughout the final episodes. And before you Yuno fans scream at me, let me say this: While I don't like Yuno, I DO understand why she's so popular, and why people do like her. I'm just not one of those people.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast didn't fare much better. From Yuki's friends to the other diary-holders, none of them seemed memorable to me. They range from alright to just unbearably irritating. There are two exceptions to this, though. The only side characters (as well as only characters from the show in general) that I actually enjoyed were the Twelfth, Akise and Minene (9th). They were just really interesting to watch. I really wished Twelfth had more screen time, though.\\n\\n\r\nWith the exceptions of who I stated above, the cast of Mirai Nikki didn't leave an impact on me.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile the animation of Mirai Nikki isn't anything spectacular, it was pretty decent. The action scenes probably best animated parts of the show, being fast-paced as well as being VERY entertaining, especially when Yuno is on one of her many killing sprees.\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing special, the animation was good for what it was.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music, for me, is the highlight of the anime. While I can't find a song that stands out, the background music does a very good job fitting every scene in the show. Both of the openings are amazing. They have a good amount of energy and fit the tone of the show perfectly (The first opening has become one of my favorites), and while the endings didn't do that much for me, they were still interesting enough to listen to for a few episodes).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the music is by far my favorite part of Mirai Nikki.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite all of its flaws, Mirai Nikki was definitely entertaining to watch. While there were parts that left me with confusion and/or frustration, there were parts that just wanted me to click \"Next\" to watch the next episode.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.0 out of 10\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is an anime that I have a love-hate relationship with. While the show did have some \"bumps in the road\" character-wise, it did not deter me from finishing the anime. While I don't love the show as much as others do, it was definitely worth the watch. It was definitely entertaining, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\n*Feedback/Constructive criticism would also be nice. Just don't be too nasty about it.*",

            "content": "Disclaimer: \r\n1. This review is probably as crazy as Future Diary the show itself.\r\n2. There are little to no spoilers in this show, and should not ruin your viewing pleasure of Future Diary even if you have not watched the show when going through this review (There will be brief mentioning about some characters that might be minor SPOILER of the story!) .\r\n\"Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art; it is the part the schools cannot recognize.\" ~ James Joyce\r\nFuture Diary is art.\r\nAnd I am not even kidding.\r\nFuture Diary should be clear to any potential viewer that it is yet another one ofthose Battle Royale-style story, in which there will be a bunch of high school kids and throw them into a situation where they have to pit off against one another (alright, I am oversimplification of things in Future Diary, but you get the idea). Such story should not be foreign to most people, seeing the popularity of similar plot in popular western franchise such as the Hunger Games, as well as in Japan, such as the Zero Escape or Fate franchise. Many people was sold on the idea that Future Diary is going to be a thought-provoking psychological thriller that blows their mind, only to have all their expectation thrown out, getting a seemingly incomprehensible mess that was far from what they actually expected. It is very much due to this that many viewers develop a distaste for Future Diary. \\n\\n\r\nMany people have used the term 'trainwreck' to describe the final outcome of this show, but I personally think that that is too demeaning of a term to be used on Future Diary. Simply said, the sheer craziness of Future Diary can't just be contained within a train (or 2 or 10 or 10,000 for that matter). Future Diary may be an incoherent mess, totally illogical, with the story flowing through by any means but with a constant flow. If the thought of the aforementioned turns you off, then Future Diary is definitely not a show for you. And there really isn't much point for you in continuing this review. Of course unless you are interested in knowing why Future Diary is an art, then welcome on-board the train. You still with me? Good, let me convince you why this mess is absolutely wonderful (Allow me to articulate this clearly, this review is not a piece of satire).\\n\\n\r\nLet me first talk about what I deemed as one of the best part of the story: the twist, oh the plot twist, hail them. The \"deus ex machina\" (the plot device, not the character) present in this show is often subjected to multiple criticisms by critics and reviewers alike. Not only do the twists seems absolutely nonsensical and bonkers at times, they only further elevate the amount of questioning in the show. Future Diary is absurd and ludicrous to the core, do not expect good logical flow in the story. This again, is what makes Future Diary so amazing: the roller coaster ride of events after events to an unthinkable extent, logic simply does not exist.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to put it this way: both the original mangaka (Sakae Esuno-sensei) and the staff are an irresponsible bunch. They couldn't care for the logic in this show (if they even care for it in the first place). However, it is also precisely due to this that Future Diary could be successful in the first place. The people working on this show knows what Future Diary lacks (logic) and at the same time is clear of its strength (the absurdity). The ridiculous pacing turns away most of the viewers, but this perhaps really just highlighted the greatness of this show. It just gives you this crazy adrenaline pump to continue watching. It spends little to absolutely no time to explaining the illogical stuffs (For a couple of reasons, such as too many of them, inability to explain, or as I see it, unnecessary in this crazy show) and will just let the next major event before the viewer can even take a breather. This is why, the very essence, the heart, the core, of Future Diary would be these insane and out-of-mind plot points. You expect it to come, it had being foreshadowed all the way from the beginning, you are waiting for it to happen, yet you just could not pinpoint what exactly and when exactly it will occur, and you will get completely overwhelmed by it why it comes (in both a good or bad way). \\n\\n\r\nThe following point will unfortunately incorporate my arguments made for the story relatively closely, and that is the characters in the show. Once again, if you are looking for well fleshed-out characters in this show, sorry but there really isn't any. While most of the characters do get a backstory explaining their course of action (of course, the stories being totally illogical), their presence is merely a fodder for the story to progress, and not as a being that drives a story forward. If there were any characters that I might want to focus on, that would be the main characters Yukiteru (Yuki for the rest of the review) and Yuno. Yuki is the wimpy, ain't-getting-anything-done protagonist that just unfortunately generate lots of hate among the viewers. From his character design of wearing a abnormal hat to his every action in the show, it just screams \"weak\". It is no doubt irritating to see the main protagonist not doing anything. Personally, while I am no fan of him, the hate generated due to him seems quite unreasonable (Oh my, I'm talking about reasons in Future Diary). Come on guys, he's a kid thrown into crazy stuff that he could not even imagine, forcing him into all these crazy stuff just seemed all the more nonsensical (now I'm talking \"sense\", welp!). This is more so ridiculous in the presence of the all-powerful girlfriend, Yuno. Yuno is totally bonkers, crazy, because as if I need to reiterate that. Disturbing staring of the eyes and pink hair in the air every time she swings her axe, she is probably the poster image for a psychopath in anime. However, if there were any character, it was her that keeps the show going. Her absurd antics to win Yuki over and have him accept her, the preposterous acts against the other diary holders, it was almost entertainment at its finest. And for her to keep this momentum going... she is definitely not any great protagonist by any means, but there will be no doubt in her being one of the most memorable one. Now, you combine the wimpy kid and the dominating queen, a weird and illogical combination, but it is this dynamics that drive the show and further heightens the general atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding stuffs such as animation and sound, I really doubt that there is much to talk about. I do want to praise the first opening theme (\"Kuusou Mesorogiwi\" by Yousei Teikoku) for the mysterious-chant at the start of the song to hype the viewer up each time, as well as the crazy amount of foreshadowing in the sequence. The rest of the theme songs and decent though nothing especially great. The voice acting, well, having the voice actors shouting and screaming around doing what they usually don't is always entertaining. Animation, by Studio Asread, is nothing amazing though nothing much to criticise on as well. Fight sequence are generally well-animated well the more \"daily\" scenes have a lower animation quality, which I personally do not mind and has no qualm with.\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely enjoys Future Diary. If I had any reason for such, here is my hypothesis (feel free to skip it): The fruit of wisdom had let mankind gain the ability to question, and thus quench the thirst of knowledge. Future Diary, (un)fortunately, leaves the viewer with an insurmountable number of questions, completely perplexed at what they had seen. But does it matter? I do not think so. While logical thought process is important, humans still could not escape the control of emotion, the illogical side of every human being. Perhaps, really, nothing could top Future Diary in this domain. Anything can happen. The madness and lunacy just snowballs throughout the whole show without a stop. It is a spot-on hit on the illogical side of human, something that targets the hysteria and psychopathic side of mankind. You know that something stupid is going to happen, yet you will (not) advance. You want to see how Future Diary's absurdity can top itself every single episode. It is this pulpiness and the juiciness in Future Diary that just make it more so interesting. This is not something that an institution which favours logical thinking will be pleased with. Future Diary really is something that appeals to the more inhumane side of human, the illogical and overly-emotional aspect. To phrase it in another way, Future Diary is not (supposed to be) a critic's favourite. If you are only going to favour the logical aspect of the show, something that is absolutely missing in Future Diary, then it is anything but hard for one to slap a 4/10 or 3/10 onto this show and criticise every single plot point in this show. However, Future Diary is those show that should be judged by upon anything but the logical flow of thoughts in the show (because it does not exist). If anything, Future Diary appeals to that emotional and illogical side of human. If anyone is going to ask me why didn't I rate Future Diary a 10/10, I would pretty much just answer that there is this little bit of sanity and logical flow left in me that simply could not ignore the flaws in Future Diary (Come on now, what I am trying to say is not that people who criticise this show are emotionless creatures and that everyone that gives this show a 10/10 is a psychopath). I am in the opinion that Future Diary is no doubt one of the more controversial and subjective show that anyone will see in a long time. The way how Future Diary commits to bringing entertainment than to explaining logic makes it stand out from the crowd. The fact that it does not bind itself to the usual structure of what to expect from fiction just makes it all the more so enjoyable. I definitely do hope that more people can appreciate and recognize it. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, with that, I conclude the reasons of why do I think that Future Diary is quite a piece of \"art\", although definitely not one that everyone can appreciate equally.\\n\\n\r\nLet me touch on one more point before rounding this off. Some people have suggest that Future Diary as a satirical masterpiece, a deconstruction of the logic in story, magical girlfriend, deus ex machina etc. (to prevent spoiling) trope. Personally, this is not something that I will concur with, but seems interesting of an idea that I would brought it up, and would actually be a great explanation to everything that happened in this show. However, I still  prefer to keep my opinion of Future Diary as just a crazy batshit show without overthinking it too much, but hey, it's an interesting opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSome of my points may be indeed controversial here, but I do want to talk about my opinions of this show. Not everyone will enjoy this show, definitely, and even when on the same point, could have differing opinions. So, yeah, I kinda got what I wanted to talk about Future Diary here.\\n\\n\r\nWell, looks like I got side-tracked a little, pretty irresponsible...\\n\\n\r\nDamn.\\n\\n\r\nWhat a fine piece of art I am.\\n\\n\r\n====================\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10 \\n\r\n+ Almost entirely supported by crazy twists\\n\r\n+/- So bad that it's so good\\n\r\n- Logic doesn't apply\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\n+ Good animation during fight scenes\\n\r\n+/- Character designs unique but weird\\n\r\n- Meh during the rest of the scenes\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n+ Great 1st OP\\n\r\n+ OST fitting for atmosphere\\n\r\n- Nothing apart from the 1st OP especially memorable\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\n+ Yuno defines \"Yandere\"\\n\r\n+/- Simply exist for \"entertainment\" purposes\\n\r\n- Lack of fleshed out characters\\n\r\n- Most characters doesn't make sense in real life\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nSorry, but for this you have to see the long explanation above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nGood show for me, quite flawed but thoroughly enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "Okay. Let me start off by saying this reminds me of Deadman Wonderland. And that's not a good thing. The art of Mirai Nikki is great, no doubt about that. No doubt about the sound either. But, obviously, since my overall rating is a 4, I'll talk about the stuff that really made me \"wat\" this entire series. Already. \r\nThe story:\r\n4/10. Imagine you thinking about an imaginary world when you're alone. Now, you've thought of a God. A God that rules over time and space. Because he is a God, he can do whatever he wants, so he is now reality! Following? Good. This Godis no kind God, he likes to mess things up. And so he does. He gives twelve people a diary. Not just any diary - a diary in the form of a cellphone, which predicts the feature of the owner up to 90 days in advance. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're bound to trip at 1pm on Monday, and you do, nothing happens. If, however, you know this, and take another route or make a jump where you're supposed to trip, the future changes, and this will reflect upon the future diaries. If your cellphone is broken, your future is gone, so in short: you're dead. The God sends all 12 on a quest, a game if you like, to survive. If you are the last man standing, you are the successor to his throne. Okay, sounds cool, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, no, not really. The main character, Yukiteru, is nothing but a wimp. Just like the main character in Deadman Wonderland. I'll have to look into who produces this show, but this can't be a coincidence. Yukiteru is a loner. His class consists of average people. Everyone wears shorts, jeans, skirts, proper shirts, shoes, has a 'real' hair color. All but one. Yuno. Yuno is a girl who wears a skirt that's seriously too short, and with bright pink hair. Oh, oh, guess who's going to co-star in this anime? Right. The pink-haired girl obviously.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, to go on: Yukiteru reads his diary, sees he is going to die by \"Third\" and reads what is going to do. Example: 12:40 - I notice I'm followed. 12:45 - I'm still being followed. 12:48 - I run into a closed off building. 12:50 - I die. Now, this shitface KNOWS the future is accurate, and what the FUCK does he do? He runs into the goddamn building while he just passed dozens of people walking down the street, where he'd be safe. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, if you like pointless, unreal violence, to the point where it's just too much and it's silly, this anime is for you. If you're not - walk away. Fast.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion:\\n\r\nThis anime should be avoided by those who wish to see that things make sense. I cannot comprehend why this anime would get a 8,24/10 after the first episode. Nothing is wrong with settings in unrealistic universes and what not, but this is just a big no.",

            "content": "Now let me get this out of the way, I'm not the biggest horror anime fan, but this anime is only bit scary first. Let me broaden the animes I watch, which are basically more of the cheerful ones.\r\nLet me go through the storyline first. The story is basically about a kid, Yukiteru, who I guess we could call a \"Loner\" dare I say. All Yukiteru does is type into his cell phone diary about random things he does throughout the day. Broadening more on the loner character, Yukiteru has \"imaginary friends\". One of those friends, Deus Ex, is the god of space and time(if I recall).  Now this is where it gets tricky. this god gives Yukiteru a cellphone that pretty much predicts everything he's going to do, just, random things. To make things even more complicated, his classmate, Gasai Yuno, also has one of these special cell phones, except her's is basically she knows what happens to Yukiteru in the near future. After certain events, both Yuki and Yuno get teleported into the \"imaginary\" dimension and see 9 other silhouettes of people. This is basically where the story gets even more intense. Basically, Deus Ex is on the verge of ceasing to exist and needs someone to take his place. So he gathers these 12 people to play a survival game to decide who will become the next \"god\". These 12 players use their special phones with different powers to play the game and try to beat each other which is of two ways: 1. you kill them or 2. you break their phone.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the art style of this anime. now again, I usually watch the more cheerful animes so I definitely thought the art style was good. The only reason I rated this a 9 was because the art style does not fit the atmosphere of this anime as its literally about people killing each other, and it gets extremely complicated and dark later on. To be honest, I didn't know jack shit about this anime as I came across this anime from watching a different series. At first it does fit the atmosphere, but boy do you quickly throw away that thinking.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding sound, I thought the sound was extremely well done. The OST for this series is probably one of my favorite, even out of movies and non anime shows. To name a few songs, the sad piano music just fits every sad part. I swear I get the feels everytime I hear that song come on. The Epic Battle Theme was another favorite and its just intense. If you're not going to watch this anime, at least listen to the OST, I promise you, you'll like it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (a bit of spoilers) , there are a few notable characters I liked. 12 amused me a lot. I totally thought he was crazy and gonna be scary, but the way he introduced himself to the main characters was just funny. My favorite has to be Akise Aru, I can't really go into him that much if I don't want to spoil it. I'll just say he's an extremely smart person and just has a cool aura around him. 9th was another cool character. Deus Ex is probably the biggest troll character I've come across, you'll understand once you watch. 7th probably gave me the most feels out of any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime a lot. The storyline was extremely well executed, the music fit every scene and overall and extremely good OST. All of the characters except a few were likeable. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone, if you can get across just a bit of blood and one f*cked up part, you'll enjoy this anime, even if you don't watch these type of animes like me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is about Yuno. Regardless of any other plotlines that seem to be in the forefront, it is her circumstances that are in the center of what the series is about. The show focuses on the desperation that led to her destructive need for someone else to satisfy her desire for security, the mindless willingness to kill that resulted from the collapse of her mental stability, and the fragments of sanity that return to her periodically and at the last with the possibility of what she could have been, had she held on to her reason for just a bit longer.\r\nWhile Yuno\u2019s condition leadsto some nerve-wracking and amusing scenarios that are just fun to watch, her feelings, though extreme and fueled by madness, are not unnatural at all. Afraid of being alone and rejected because of her past, she latches onto someone who, in her mind, provides protection from emotional distress, and does all in her power to keep him by her side.\\n\\n\r\nYuki doesn\u2019t have one steady \u201ccharacter arc\u201d throughout the series, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. He starts out weak and wimpy and he is aware of it, and his terror especially makes sense when he is suddenly faced with life and death situations. By the end of the series, he has not become a strong, confident person because of the extraordinary challenges. Throughout the series, there are moments when he finds his strength, but he doesn\u2019t make a radical 180. He still makes foolish decisions like the young, spineless person he was from the start. He wavers between exploiting Yuno\u2019s willingness to protect him, growing to love her for who she is in her moments of sanity, and finding the courage to be strong for her sake. Although he is never a completely independent person, which would be unlikely considering his disposition, his unhealthy dependence on Yuno becomes a more loving, natural one.\\n\\n\r\nAs Mirai Nikki is almost wholly concerned with Yuno\u2019s story, almost every development hinges on what she will do next, and the moments with the greatest amount of buildup and emotional investment are those in which she is the focus. The amount of time and effort they spend developing her character is an asset to the show, but the plot of the series gets neglected as a result and sometimes seems like nothing more than a wobbly framework for her story. The encounters with each contestant of the survival game struggle to carry any weight, as they are usually little more than a confrontation with a person who is crazy or evil just for the sake or it, or else has a melodramatic backstory and flimsy motivations. The course of the encounters sometimes provide circumstances to demonstrate some characteristic of Yuno or progress in her relationship with Yuki in some fashion, but more often than not they fail even to accomplish this and it just seems like poorly executed filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe show feels rather like a thriller with so many close brushes with death, often at the hands of the cloying Yuno, and a halfhearted attempt at a horror series with some graphic, nauseating violence. The former works fairly well when Yuno is involved as her sweet, oblivious creepiness is as well-executed as every other aspect of her character, while the use of gore produces a reckless overindulgence in the barbaric that is more fun than disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nBut for Yuno\u2019s steady underlying plotline, the whole series is out of control for the most part, taking sudden, crazy twists and turns often due to the foolish decisions of the cast. Yuno\u2019s abilities, too, though fueled by rushes of mad adrenaline and probably some prior experience, are mostly absurd. Depending on the mood of the viewer, these elements could seem either fun or messy, and the series does itself something of a disservice in taking itself a little too seriously throughout all these developments. Even so, the lack of moderation feels a bit liberating amidst the measured, aspiring realism in many anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs are not catchy or easy to listen to. They always feel on edge with way too many words and phrases struggling to find room for themselves, especially in the second OP, which is mostly Engrish with little meaning. This OP as a whole is an aimless mess and a stranger to timing. However, this is in contrast to the first OP\u2019s perfectly synced, evocative imagery, and the second ED\u2019s insightful focus on Yuno\u2019s sorrowful mental state.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki\u2019s soundtrack itself often creates a cool, devilish atmosphere with energetic synthesizers. But during many episodes some gorgeous instrumental piece will break through to indicate that amidst Mirai Nikki\u2019s crazy, edgy exterior lurks a more sentimental story that gradually finds its way into the spotlight as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki\u2019s graphics are crystal clear, with bold black outlines and solid, bright colors that prevent the kind of fluffy sheen that usually accompanies modern anime. The series retains an odd sort of artistic consistency with its regular use of overly loud colors, even if they do not blend particularly well with each other. Where the animation mostly struggles is in maintaining proportions as the characters change positions. Sometimes their legs look too small as they sit down or their heads look too big from certain perspectives. However, this awkwardness is rare and usually short-lived.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 facial designs are more proportionate than those of most anime. Although the eyes are still abnormally large, the characters\u2019 faces are longer with larger, bolder noses and mouths to compensate. This makes them slightly less appealing in the customary anime sense and eliminates almost any traces of moe, giving the anime an impression of age it does not have. Yuki\u2019s small, short facial design is the one that comes closest to disrupting this impression, singling him out from the others with the more childlike appearance befitting his vulnerability.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mirai Nikki is a rather messy series but that is part of what makes it so much fun, and amidst all the craziness is a somewhat bittersweet story of an unstable pair who slowly grow to love each other in truth despite their unhealthy mindsets.",

            "content": "Something that I've seen all too often and which disappoints me greatly in all forms of media, whether it be anime or not, is when an anime has an extremely intriguing and unpredictable story but fails to execute it in a manner befitting of how good the actual story is. And sadly enough, Mirai Nikki is one such series which pains me to watch due to how poorly executed its good story is. However, personally, Mirai Nikki was still an absolute blast to watch due to the unpredictable nature of its story and the rather strange but extremely interesting cast of characters.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nMirai Nikki focusesprimarily on Yukiteru Amano or Yuki for short, a cowardly and lonely boy who for some strange reason, keeps a diary of everything that happens around him on his phone. He is involuntarily thrown into a Hunger Games-esque fight to the death by Deus Ex Machina, the God of space and time, in order to determine the successor to his throne. Each of its twelve contestants is given a future diary which aids them in seeing the future. It is then that he meets and teams up with Yuno Gasai, a beautiful grade A student who is actually a psychotic and obsessive bitch... to put it lightly. \\n\\n\r\nSounds rather simple right? Yes. Yes it does. But what makes Mirai Nikki's story so intriguing and addictive is that it isn't just a simple kill-everyone-to-win sort of story. The story actually has depth. Not all the characters have the desire to become a god. Some characters see the benefit of creating alliances instead of killing at first sight. A few of the characters have a sense of morality and help those who they are meant to kill. All these small additions of character to the anime create depth and gives the story substance.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the story also includes many, many, many plot twists, probably too many for a 26 episode anime. While most of make sense to a certain degree ane one of them completely blew my mind (I'm sure it will blow yours too), almost all of them contained some sort of plot hole, some unexplainable plot device, or an inconsistency. I can't even count the number of times I asked a question that I knew would be answered on my own two hands. Eventually, and metaphorically speaking, the anime gets to a point in the story where people start gaining the ability to fly, aliens start attacking the earth, and it turns out your neighbour is Satan. Well, that might as well happen, given that very few things are explained well, if explained at all, in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother extremely disappointing thing to note about Mirai Nikki is the after credit scenes. Initially, it is explained that the afte credit scenes would be used to give backstory, information about some scenes during the episodes, or some details on something you might not have picked up during an episode. I only recall one time where the after credit scenes were useful; in the first or second episode where it helped the viewer piece together a few events which might not have been linked together by the viewer. Otherwise, every single after credit scene is just a sorry excuse to add some humour to every episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery single character in Mirai Nikki is unique and interesting in their own way. The contestants participating in this game to the death range from a blind vigilante to a well known terrorist to a blood thirsty kid. Sadly enough, very few of the characters are explored at all and none of them aside from Yuki, Yuno, and 9th receive any meaningful character development. The character development they do receive is terrible, hardly related to the overall story at all, and could've made way for explanations of the many unexplainable plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nNow I would have given the characters a higher score, probably an 8/10, but the creators of Mirai Nikki are perverted. I'm a guy but the amount of female nudity and fan service they chucked into Mirai Nikki, which is there just for the sake of it being there, is uncomfortable and just disgusting. Not only that but they also ran out of ideas when it came to many of the female characters' backstory. They essentially told themselves that if they wanted their supporting female cast to have troubled pasts, that they should say they got raped, put a scene suggesting as such, and leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Yuki's development as a main character is extremely inconsistent. At times he becomes the world's most confident man and at other times, he is the world's biggest coward. On the other hand, 9th's development is a little better, which really doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things. By the end of the story, she is a completely different person to the one you first meet but the events which caused her to change so much are strange and somewhat unexplainable.\\n\\n\r\nThe one extremely bright spot in the cast of characters is Yuno, though I do understand that many, many people will not like her. Her unpredictable and secretive nature was what really helped make the story so intriguing. When every character was more or less established in their roles, Yuno was that one character who continually had something new pull from under her sleeve. She receives a huge amount of character development, all of which adds fuel to her unpreictable fire and sets up for a plot twist which, as I have previously stated, blew my mind away.\\n\\n\r\nArt & animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is honestly nothing special and I honestly wasn't impressed with most of it. There are, however, a few small details, especially in a few of the future diaries, which did catch my eye quite a few times.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, on the other hand, is a lot more impressive. During the fight scenes, which need to be animated well in anime like these, was fluid and nice to watch. Other animation techniques like the splattering of blood and the eyes of \"death\" (a name I gave to the eyes that Yuki gets when he realises something bad or when Yuno goes into full-psycho mode) are also really well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst opening. Great. Quality listen in my spare time. Second opening. Not so great. There's just something about English lyrics being sung by a Japanese person that I don't like but that's just personal preference. The background music is brilliant, especially combined with the animaiton. It always helped create the atmosphere, whether it be during a fast paced battle or when a psychotic Yuno is stalking you.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting (I watch Mirai Nikki dubbed) is actually somewhat good. Yuno was portrayed perfectly. She always sounded cute but you could also always hear that hint of psycho in her. Yuki was also portrayed well. During the emotional or horrifying moments, Yuki was full of emotion and his voice broke a lot, adding a bit more realism to his character. The supporting characters weren't as good. However, you didn't see most of them enough to really judge if their voice acting was good enough or not and I honestly didn't care if they weren't going to show up that much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the only things which bugged me about this anime were the questions which kept managing to ask but never received answers to and the ridiculous amount of fan service. Otherwise, I was constantly on the edge of my seat, always wanting to see what plot twist would come my way. For most of the anime, I overlooked the plot holes, inconsistencies, and unexplained plot devices, and was able to enjoy what this anime had to offer. If you, unlike me, cannot stand a poorly executed story, then I suggest you turn away from Mirai Nikki. Otherwise, I highly recommend that everyone else watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHope you found this review helped! Any feedback is much appreciated.",

            "content": "Have you ever had a crush on someone? Did you ever have the courage to ask them out, or did you just stand by and watch him/her from afar? Then you start to ask yourself questions: What does this person do on a daily basis? What are their likes/dislikes? Do they like someone else? How far are you actually willing to go to know more about this person?\r\nThese are the themes present in Mirai Nikki. Sometimes, crushes can evolve into love, and sometimes, love can evolve into dangerous affection.-Story & Characters-\\n\r\nYukiteru Amano (Yuki) is a typical young teenager: He goes to school every day, he goes home, does his homework, goes to bed, wakes up, rinse and repeat. Yuki doesn\u2019t really like to mingle with other people and keeps to himself, writing down what goes on in his life in a journal on his cell phone. Yuki\u2019s only friends are a pair of imaginary super-beings: Deus Ex Machina, the god of the universe, and a little girl named Murmur. Yuki\u2019s simple life is suddenly flipped upside-down when Deus gives him a \u201cFuture Diary\u201d, a bizarre power given to his cell phone, which allows him to predict future events. After coming to the realization that Deus and Murmur were, in fact, very real, he learns that he was selected by Deus to participate in a battle-royale against eleven other people who also possess Future Diaries. Deus, the god of the universe, is starting to decay, and if a winner, who will take the place of Deus as the new god, is not chosen by the end of the tournament within 90 days, Deus will die, and the world will end. \\n\\n\r\nThe main heroine, Yuno Gasai, is also a participant in the tournament. However, Yuno has a twisted love for Yuki, and wants to ally with him to take on the other Diary Users together. While it does seem like Yuno\u2019s affection for Yuki is random, her reasons for her twisted behavior are justified after a huge plot twist at the end of the show. While the story of the show isn\u2019t terribly original, the concept of Future Diaries and being able to predict future events takes a very tired battle-royale setting and makes it its own. The show also has a good dose of humor to balance out the overall serious tone of the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the harsh reality is that the story is not perfect, as the show has several plot holes and unanswered questions. For instance, we\u2019re told that Yuki has been in contact with Deus and Murmur, who thought that they were a figment of his imagination. How did he meet them? How long have they been in association with each other? What do they talk about on a daily basis? Just how are these Diary Users selected? \\n\\n\r\nThere are also two very weak (and silly) arcs during the show\u2019s first half, which really hamper the experience. That\u2019s not to say that the first half is bad, because it\u2019s not at all. In fact, those two arcs aside, it\u2019s really quite engaging. However, the saving grace for the show is its amazing second half, which really cranks the story up a few notches, throwing in some unexpected twists and heart-wrenching, powerful moments. Throw in some really great character development to go along with it, and you have a very memorable second half. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what really drive the narrative forward, however. While there are maybe one or two characters that were kind of annoying *cough* Reisuke *cough*, the overall cast is quite likeable. Yuki is a strong lead, and acts as the confused, conflicted, and frightened hero. His reaction to the events around him are perfectly natural, and the fact that he has a crazy stalker that follows him around only makes his reasons all the more justified. Yuno goes to extreme lengths to keep Yuki in her sights, and hates it when he socializes with anyone that isn\u2019t her, and even goes as far as trying to kill his friends. The rest of the cast is likeable as well. However, if you\u2019re familiar with Black Lagoon, there is one character that is a complete rip-off of Revy: Uryuu Minine. Strong, aggressive, and stubborn, she is completely, utterly, 100%, no bones about it, Revy, making it feel like the writers had lost their creativity. \\n\\n\r\nFaults aside, the story is well-told, well-paced, and interesting throughout, and once you reach the show\u2019s second half, you will not be able to keep your eyes off of the screen. \\n\\n\r\n\t                  -Visuals & Sound-\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is relatively new, coming out in 2011. While its visuals aren\u2019t really up to par with some of the other shows that have come out around that time, it\u2019s still relatively attractive. The characters in particular are very well drawn and move with great fluidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s audio, on the other hand, is easily its strongest aspect. The voice acting is absolutely superb, with the sole exception of Yuno, who, while not bad, sounded a lot deeper and didn\u2019t quite fit her character, and it took a long time for it to grow on me. Aside from her, though, the voice acting was top-notch, there was no overacting, and everyone sounded, most importantly, believable. The music is of equal quality, with every song perfectly matching the situation that it accompanies. Even out of context, the individual songs themselves are just incredibly memorable, ranging from soothing acoustic guitar melodies to epic scores, and the soundtrack as a whole just as so much variety and is brimming with creativity. I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack alone, if that\u2019s your thing.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t-Conclusion-\\n\r\nIn the end, Mirai Nikki is a flawed gem. It has plot holes and inconsistencies, yet its tale is still captivating. It\u2019s not visually stunning, but its audio is terrific. Everything Mirai Nikki does wrong is counteracted by something it does right. While it\u2019s not perfect, honestly, if you don\u2019t watch it, I do truly feel that you\u2019re missing out on something special. Would I recommend Mirai Nikki to any anime fan out there?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely. \\n\\n\r\n+Interesting story\\n\r\n+Very likeable cast of characters\\n\r\n+Superb voicework, followed by an outstanding soundtrack\\n\r\n+Amazing second half\\n\r\n+Good sense of humor\\n\r\n-Some plot holes here and there\\n\r\n-Two very weak arcs during the show\u2019s first half\\n\r\n-Not very original\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n\t      8/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is an anime that has a fantastic premise with a lot of potential. The basis for the anime is that the god of the world (Deus ex Machina) is dying and has chosen 12 people as potential successors. They are each given a Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) with its own set of abilities and are told to play a survival game in which the last individual standing will become god. Each diary's ability gives the user a specific edge against their competitors whether it's being able to track down individual just by knowing their name or being able to predict attempts on theirown lives. The catch to this is that the destruction of your own diary will instantly kill you. Now this sets up for a lot of interesting plot moments and a message that centres around the morality of it all that's rather subtle and carefully executed. The biggest problem with the story is it has many glaring plot holes. I can't mention many of them for the sake of spoilers, but the most glaring one in the show is they never explain why Deus ex Machina is dying or why he needs humans to be his successors. The plot holes really bring down a fantastic story to the point I can only say that it's good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is great. Animation is almost always clean and fluid showing marks of an anime that had a great budget going for it. The models are almost always anatomically correct and the backgrounds normally look great too. It doesn't stand out, but does an impeccable job at conveying scenes to a high degree of effectiveness.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is amazing. Every track represents its corresponding scene perfectly. Some tracks don't just compliment, but improve the scenes themselves whether that be through intensity or subtlety (Track 7 on the 5th ost really stands out when mentioning the score). This anime has one of the best osts I've heard and deserves very high amounts of praise for the amount of quality present here.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be blunt here. If you have any reason to watch this show, it should be for the characters. The other aspects of the show are well done, but compared to the amount of depth they give to the back-stories and personalities of these people who were chosen to participate in this game, you could take them all away and still have a solid show. You could choose any character in this show as your favourite and it would be just as valid as picking anyone else. Every single character manages to be interesting in some way even if they're only present for about 10 minutes of the show. This is a rarity not only in anime, but in many mediums such as American cinema or fantasy novels. I can't emphasize enough that these characters are what make this show a good watch as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is actually very enjoyable. It isn't the most enjoyable thing I've ever watched, but it deserves high placement for how it handled itself. It even had me on the edge of my seat in more than a few episodes as I was very interested in what was going to happen next. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime deserves a solid 8/10. If the plot were cleaned up and better executed, it would probably be deserving of a 9 or maybe even a 10. What's preventing me from giving above an 8/10 is that story and plot are the most important things for a show like this to have. With that in mind, I would still recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre. It is a very good show and is worth your time.",

            "content": "People overreact towards Mirai Nikki. Seeing the comments for the reviews here such as \"worst anime\", \"stupid\", \"annoying\", and so forth made me realize how belittled this series really is. With animes that reach Mirai Nikki's calibre in popularity, there's a slew of overly-critical reviews that follow that give unnecessarily bashful criticism that you would only see for popular animes exclusively. And with this said, this anime hasn't been given the justice it deserves and I've finally had enough. Mirai Nikki's one of favorites, and I've been attached to it ever since I completed it. And now I'm here to review one of my favoriteanimes and finally put it in some good light. \\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 \\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, this is one of the more consistent aspects of the anime. Despite the rave over the anime, the story's not all that complex; it's nothing but a simplified version of Hunger Games. You have Yukki, the main character, who unwillingly participates in a battle royale game with a group of other contestants. Each contestant is called a \"diary owner\". The basic idea of the game is to survive and be the last one left standing. This basically invokes the principle \"kill or be killed\". Each diary owner has a device called a \"Future Diary\" which differs in abilities to help the contestant triumph through the game. If the diary is to be destroyed, the contestant dies and furthermore is out the game. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10  \\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the animation. It's pretty standard; but it fits the anime perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 \\n\r\nSame with animation, it's pretty standard. Not much to comment here honestly \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10 \\n\r\nNow this is the part that makes peoples' heads turn. The general consensus I've seen in a number of reviews about Mirai Nikki is that Yukki is a whiny brat. And as much as I want to, I can't disagree. Yukki starts off as a timid, anti-social boy who's always complaining - pretty linear to Shinji from Neon Genesis. And then there's Yuno, the selling point of this anime. She initially has an average-school girl sempai-chasing look and personality, admiring Yukki from afar and trying her best to get close to him. But as the game progresses, you notice her true personality comes out: a yandere. The girl's insane. The depths she goes to protect Yukki throughout the game are unbelievable and sometimes unsettling. And as the anime has aged she's become a classic example of a yandere character. And as for the side characters, they aren't relevant enough for you to care about their personalities as much as Yukki and Yuno. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nI initially took my time watching Mirai Nikki, as I was watching other animes along with it at the time, but as I progressed into the series I became attached to it instantly. I found myself marathoning it at a pretty shocking rate. In terms of the thrill of this anime, I've only encountered a few that have matched it. Despite its faults it's amazingly entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 \\n\r\nAs you can see this show is a hit or miss for most people. The people who watch it are divided into two: ones who like it and one's who don't. And it's a good number of both on each side to say the least. And in saying that, I think it's best to try Mirai Nikki and see with your own eyes how you like it.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nMirai Nikki exploded on to the scene in 2011 and has built up quite the following. However, I have never liked this series and consider it one of the most overrated anime on this entire site! Mirai Nikki is one of those series that commits all the sins that other series get bashed for and somehow avoids any and all criticism. This is especially true on 4chan where Yuno has become something of a mascot and beloved icon. Although I almost admire the stubbornness and blind loyalty of its fanbase, I feel it is my duty to give this series the rich beating it deserves!\r\nStoryand characters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nYuki is a very shy and introverted middle schooler that likes to talk to his imaginary friend, Deus ex Machina. One day he discovers that Deus is real and is in fact the God of this universe. However, God is getting old and needs a successor, so there is to be a Battle Royale to decide the heir. If no one wins than the apocalypse occurs. The bland and frankly awful main character Yuki quickly teams up with everyone's favorite yandare Yuno. Yuno for some reason has an obsessive love for Yuki and is willing to do anything to protect him. Why does she love him so much? No one knows. Yuno and Yuki go farther and farther into immoral territory and wish to win at all costs. Afterall, the winner can become God and simply bring back everyone that was killed. I won't spoil it, but the ending is one of the absolute stupidest endings I have ever seen! We should have seen this coming since the God is named Deus ex Machina, since no other words could describe how bullshit the ending was! What are my problems with the plot and characters? Firstly, Mirai Nikki doesn't simply homage other anime or adapt a subplot from a classic, but rather shamelessly steals from recent popular anime. It tries very hard to capture and emulate the cat and mouse games and high tension of Death Note, but fails because it isn't nearly as well written. This coming from someone who didn't even think Death Note was God tier writing in the first place. We have all seen the Battle Royale plot done a MILLION times before and written much better than the one in Mirai Nikki. We've seen the pink haired yandare girl gorily slaughter her way through dozens of people to get with bland male protagonist when it was Elfen Lied 7 years earlier in 2004. I could list other examples, but I don't want to write all day. The one thing I will give Nikki credit for is that it did do the sending text messages through time plot before Stein's Gate used it. The Mirai Nikki manga came out in 2006. Let's just face it, the characters fucking suck! The only character people like is Yuno, and she is honestly an extremely overrated character. Why? She kills without feeling or remorse and is a complete sociopath, yet we are supposed to like her. Her love for Yuki is completely unfounded and frankly doesn't make any sense. She has no real character depth and besides looking adorable killing people, she doesn't do anything to make anyone with a brain like her. We can't empathize with her, see into her head, or feel what she feels. Let's compare Yuno with her pink haired yandare predecessor Lucy from Elfen Lied. Lucy also has blind love for a fairly bland seeming protagonist, but she has a fucking reason to. He was the only person ever to treat her as a human being and show her kindness, after 10 years of encountering nothing but discrimination, fear, and hatred. Lucy kills plenty of innocent people, but feels deep remorse for these killings and realizes the gravity of her own crimes. Her feelings of guilt, psychological torment, and search for redemption makes the viewer actually able to empathize with her in a way that the viewer never can with Yuno. Keep in mind that  I'm not saying that being a sociopath = bad character. Johan Liebert of Monster is a sociopath, but is an amazing character. His bone chilling nihilism, mastery over manipulation and human emotion, and complete lack of reason for committing the crimes he does make him a terrifying pinnacle of human depravity and evil. Yuno is neither a great villian like Johan or a great anti-hero like Lucy. She is a very shallow yandare archetype that 4chan loves because lets face it, most of the people on /a/ are idiots and should GTFO my /b/! The final reason the plot is lousy is that it tries so hard to have the gore, rape, and darkness of a seinen, but goes for the mindless happy ending of a shonen. In a shonen, actions typically have no consequences and you can always just take a mulligan if you fuck up and did something you regret. Part  of what separates Shonen like Naruto and DBZ from Seinen like Monster and Elfen Lied is that if someone dies in a seinen series, they probably aren't going to be \"wished back\" next week. If a character makes a horrible mistake, that character has to live with it and doesn't simply get a do-over. Mirai Nikki is FAR too dark and depraved for a shonen but lacks the maturity, moral complexity, and intelligence of a good seinen. It enters into Tim Burton's Batman Returns territory where it is too dark for young kids and too stupid for adults.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good, but not absolutely amazing and certainly not great enough to compensate for the shitty writing and characters. It looks good, but not revolutionary for its time period in 2006. The opening song is promising, but the overall OST is lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, maybe I would feel different if I was younger and Mirai Nikki was my first dark and brutal anime. Maybe I would have been able to overlook its flaws like audiences did for early anime like Vampire Hunter D and Ninja Scroll simply because we were shocked and awed by what we were seeing. If you got something out of Mirai Nikki and found a strong moral, an empathetic character, thought provoking philosophy, or a bloody good time than good for you! I'm not going to condemn you and say that you are objectively wrong for liking this series. I will say that I personally hated this series and highly question if people are truly rating this series objectively and honestly. Of course there is no \"right\" and \"wrong\" when judging a subjective work of art, but it is my firm opinion that Mirai Nikki does NOT deserve a substantially higher rating than Elfen Lied and Angel Beats on MAL. It does NOT deserve to be ranked almost as high as Monster. I'm trying really hard to keep this review civil out of consideration for Mirai Nikki's many fans, but the fact it is rated above a 7 actually kind of pisses me off!",

            "content": "There are some shows that somehow manage by on sheer energy alone. Their plotting could be messy, their pacing uneven, their characters inconsistent, etc.; yet they are just so damn entertaining. Mirai Nikki definitely is definitely one of those shows. It is a floundering, unruly mess that often dives into nonsense in its attempt to shock and woo the audience. There is also nary a dull moment in this incoherent storm of blood and violence.\r\nThe concept of the show is really quite cool. It centers around a tournament in which contestants are given diaries that show them the future, or more accurately certain future eventsthat adhere to each diaries specific theme. The winner gains mastery over space and time as the successor of the current god; for the losers all that awaits is death. This all comes as a shock to Yukiteru \"Yuki\" Amano, an asocial middle school student who becomes the first diary holder; he is reluctantly forced into the competition, equipped a diary which gives him a description of his current and future surroundings. He also gets a shock when he finds out a beautiful and seemingly perfect girl in his class, Yuna Gasai, is also a diary holder. On top of that, she turns out to be obsessed with Yuki, and her diary records his every move. As unsettling as this is to Yuki, Yuno might be his only ally and hope to survive the gruesome competition.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki has to be given credit for taking this idea and running with it. The show never drags because the plot is constantly moving, more often than not at a break-neck pace. It wastes no time in bringing story arcs to their climax and moving on to the next one, satisfying everyone's impatient inner adrenaline junkie. There are twists and turns around every corner, many you just won't see coming. The show also does a good job of building tension, and anticipation for the insanity that will ensue. The fact that the show is bat-shit crazy only adds to the excitement of the ever moving plot. The tone can go from tense to comical and back again in a moment. There are a lot of things Mirai Nikki  can be accused of, but being boring is not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem, however, is where Mirai Nikki is running to. The plot is constantly moving, but that doesn't mean its going in a good direction. In fact, the reason you won't see some plot twists coming is because they seemingly pop out of nowhere, or are so improbable you wouldn't even consider them. It seems as if the writer was so intent to throw in as many shocks and thrills in as possible, that he forgot to put together a cohesive plot. There are things that happen which are just mind-bogglingly ridiculous. Some twist will leave you confused on whether to be shocked or amused, despite the tone clearly pointing toward the former, because of how silly they are. Some twists are also so obviously intended to move the plot along that it is a bit insulting to the viewers' intelligence. There are moments which attempt to be to poignant, but fail to because they are blatantly made for plot convenience. Mirai Nikki is entertaining, but its best to view with your brain turned off.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is a colorful bunch. Our protagonist Yuki is one of the more mentally stable in the show, but he is also one of the dullest. He's a typical male anime lead. He's a bit wimpy, has trouble connecting with other people and fighting his own fights, though deep in he is a nice kid. We've seen this character so often, and it is all Yuki can be described as, really. The other competitors in the tournament range from being fairly rational to outlandishly insane. A police captain who is the fourth diary holder stands out as the most rational, and possibly most sympathetic, of the group; while the twelfth diary holder, a blind man who fancies himself a hero and likes super sentai, stands out as one of the craziest.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Yuno, who takes the idea that crazy is cute to a new level. Yuno's infatuation with Yuki engulfs her entire character. She is willing to eliminate any obstacle, and I do mean any at all, that gets between her and Yuki. On one hand, this makes her very entertaining to watch, since she's willing to go to any extreme to be with him, even if it is against his will. Plus, she just looks so cute when she's stalking Yuki, or contemplating murder of someone she sees as a threat. However, she's so crazy it is actually hard to connect to her on a deep level. The story has to resort to giving her an extremely tragic past in order to justify her actions, something it does for a lot of its characters, I might add. Because of this, many of the dramatic moments that surround her, and there are a lot, are forced and a bit insincere. Also, her relationship with Yuki often comes off as unhealthy rather than sweet, which makes attempts to play it off as endearing more than a little unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, Mirai Nikki is a mixed bag. The show usually looks good, but can stray into off model character designs and choppy animation quite a bit too. Some scenes just look abysmal, clearly minimal effort was put into them and quality control is pretty much non-existent. Luckily, this only happens on occasion, and the show for the most part looks decent. Character designs look nice, though are not outside the norm for an anime series. Strangely enough the show looks best when the characters are going crazy. Likewise, backgrounds are solid, though the only really memorable one is Deus' lair. The lighting can be a problem, though, as it can look really unnatural at times. The soundtrack fairs better than the visuals. It's well composed and fits the tone well throughout the show. While it is mostly used to accentuate the looming danger in tense or creepy moments, it also does very well in the shows more emotional moments as well. It can even be uplifting on occasion.\\n\\n\r\nAs entertaining as Mirai Nikki is, it cannot be completely congratulated. Truth be told, the story is a disaster. It is filled with plot holes and contrivances, and lacks genuine depth. Still, I can't say I didn't have fun watching it. There is something endearing about its willingness to go to such insane lengths in order to entertain. It's just a pity that the end result doesn't match its enthusiasm.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki or Future Diary is perhaps one of the best shows I have seen of the year of it's release. I personally think the show is a must see and would highly recommend it to those searching for a really good and exciting psychological thriller. While I do believe the show is great, it does however suffers terribly from a bad bandwagon effect so don't let negative opinions or reviews affect your time watching. \r\nThat aside, I'm going to start with the characters. On my list of things I liked about the show, characters or characterization is number one. I really enjoy watching showswere the characters have bad or traumatizing backgrounds stories because I feel like that really makes most characters grow emotionally and develop. I personally didn't care for the main character Yukiteru Amano because I dislike seeing the common archetype of mentally and psychically weak characters however, boy oh boy did that change. Of course thanks actions and behavior from the unforgettable and lovable character Yuno Gasai are annoying, weak main character was able to develop and grow (just a little) however sufficient enough to make him somewhat likable. In the characters department Future diary has so much going on for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, is perhaps one of the best for Psychological mystery, horror. Your ideal psychological and mystery horror genre is something that should \"A.G.E.G.  \"Always keep Em guessing\" and that is one thing I really enjoyed about future diary. There are lots of shows that try to keep the audience guessing, however most are either really predictable or obvious when it comes to solving mysteries. The Future diary however takes a totally different, and unexpected approach with this. The story really revolves around character growth and will. Mostly the will to get stronger... and well \"Survive.\"\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about the story was the action, of course surviving the game meant killing other players and  I found there were lots of fighting scenes and moments (Especially towards the end)  during the show where I was completely engaged and moved. Lastly, romance. One thing I'll give extra credit to the future diary is for the romance. In spite of all the craziness that is going on, the bonds between most of characters are so strong. I loved seeing the bond between Yuki and Yuno grow during the show.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was amazing, I don't believe that there is a single anime fans music player that doesn't have at least one song from Mirai Nikki downloaded to it. It really ties in well with the story especially, and most noticeably the tender moments, such as love, or something sad. The music was so beautifully well composed, and it is just bliss to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork pretty good, standard 2010's art style, with great use of CGI during most scenes and used on certain characters. There is of course nudity in the show however nothing really stands out too much. Character designs were nicely done, a pretty decent transition from the manga adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I found Mirai Nikki to be a well written (though cliche at times)  and unique story. I would recommend it to those viewers and anime fans who want to see a great murder mystery with a game type theme/setting. Final review edit and score  9/10 for epic story and finish.",

            "content": "Future Diary aka Mirai Nikki is a series about a middle school kid named Yukiteru who\u2019s all observant and distant and disaffected. He, apparently, has some imaginary friends called Deus and Murmur. However, these imaginary friends turn out to not be so imaginary. Deus turns out to be the god of space and time. Not only that, he\u2019s turned Yukiteru\u2019s cellphone into one that can predict the future. Oh:  and there are also 11 other people who have this power, and now you have to kill each other so you can become my replacement as god.\r\nThough I think the series is largely uneven and,by its conclusion, has completely jumped the shark, I do think it touches on some rather interesting ideas; or, rather, the central relationship and the character behavior/personalities offer more to chew on than whatever the central conceit is supposed to do. The relationship between Yukiteru and Yuno (his love interest) arguably drives most of the series\u2019 action, but it also highlights the series\u2019 attitudes towards dependent/abusive relationships. This is the only interesting part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYukiteru\u2019s diary and Yuno\u2019s diary are oddly compatible, so they team up in order to survive the game. However, it\u2019s less of a \u201cteam\u201d and more of a \u201cYuno goes crazy any time Yukiteru is even remotely in danger.\u201d The thrust of the entire relationship is thus: Yukiteru completely relies on Yuno to save his ass, and then feels horrible after she goes way overboard and kills everyone. Not only that, at points, Yukiteru almost begins to feel afraid for his life, that\u2019s how intense Yuno is. Yuno pledges undying devotion and love and bodyguard services, and Yukiteru takes advantage of this, basically using her and lying to her, while benefiting from her protection. This dynamic is deeply screwed up.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, we have the way in which Yukiteru almost seems like an abused spouse character. Because of Yuno\u2019s diary ability, he can\u2019t really escape from her (she knows everything he\u2019s going to do), and it\u2019s because of this that he allows himself to think of her company and her actions as normal. She\u2019s just trying to protect me and win the game (because she likes me). But every time that Yuno goes all ruthless and flies off the handle a little more than the previous time, Yukiteru has to keep making compromises and excuses for her. He\u2019s told repeatedly by other people that she\u2019s dangerous or that she\u2019ll be the death of him. Little by little, her behavior becomes rationalized and coded as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cacceptable\u201d and soon the feeling that this is what he has to deal with to survive becomes inescapable. He\u2019s trapped in the relationship; Yuno keeps him safe, and he can\u2019t get away even if he wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nAlso of interest are any moments where there is opposition between Yukiteru and Yuno. There\u2019s a particularly great episode where Yukiteru tries to make new, \u201cnormal\u201d friends. They invite him out to take a look at a dead body (because that isn\u2019t suspicious) and he cheerfully goes, because the prospect of getting away from what he knows is a toxic attachment to Yuno is mighty appealing. She tags along, but mostly watches from the sides, as Yukiteru laughs with everyone, cracks jokes, and whatnot. But then the narrative of the episode kicks in, and Yukiteru\u2019s friends turn out to be not so friendly. Which is exactly what Yuno thought would happen. The drama of the episode is then about Yukiteru\u2019s struggle to redeem this friendship, and make it real; and Yuno\u2019s constant refusal to make friends with anyone else, throwing doubt on anyone who would get close to him, almost stabbing everyone whenever they do something unexpected. But this opposition never even lasts; Yukiteru\u2019s too weak to ever put up much of a struggle. Even after everyone witnesses how crazy Yuno is, he still ends up making excuses for her. He\u2019s terrified by her behavior, but he can\u2019t quite say that he doesn\u2019t need it. Yuno loves Yukiteru, wishes to protect him and all that; but it\u2019s a love that\u2019s selfish, possessive and obsessive. It\u2019s a love that includes no one else. At points, it doesn\u2019t even include Yukiteru. It\u2019s her love alone.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, ultimately, Future Diary, if nothing else,manages to dramatize this unique dynamic very well. Although it often succumbs to ludicrous plot twists, silly Yandere antics, and literal deus ex machine shenanigans, the series manages to show how crazy and twisted this relationship is. The series\u2019 denouement shows the utter ruination of the main character; he\u2019s destroyed everything he loves for a lie. And still he lives a lie.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is a fine example on an anime starting great but then repeatedly trying as hard as it can to destroy everything that makes it good and bring on whole new levels of suckage.\r\nThe concept is solid. A battle royale of the owner of mysterious future diaries which give people different powers, for the right of being the new \"God\" of this world. During the first 3-4 episodes I was on the edge of my seat but the more episodes I watched the lower my opinion of this show got. \r\nFor starters we have our protagonist Yuki who is your cliche quite, pantsy type.He gets pushed into this conflict between the diary owners but himself lacks the motivation and reason to try to win this competition. What follows is Yuno being a brutal yandere and killing everything on her way.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all let's talk about Yuno and Yuki's relationship. In the start of the series Yuki keeps Yuno with him for two reason: 1 - he needs her to survive and 2 - he actually falls for her a little and starts thinking that they can be togather even with her...unusual personality.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the beggining it is played out in a good manner. Later it gets messed up and pretty hard (as well as the whole anime). Yuki keeps returning to Yuno and gives her numerous chances even if everytime she continues doing some insane stuff. Once she drugged him, tied him to a chair and locked him in the basement and after that he still continues to be with her and falls in love with her. I do not believe that a single sane person would continue to be with a person who drugged you and threw you in the basement...at least there was not rape.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between this two character strat out good and even somewhat touching but later they become so unrealistic and so forced that towrads the end I could not even stand how idiotic was the protagonist to stay with her. And guess what it came back to bite him on his behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe farther the show gets the more idiotic the protagonist becomes and he was not likable to begin with. This degression sadly also effects almost every other character in the show\\n\\n\r\nThe rape, is a second issue I have with this series. There is more than 1 rape scene in the anime and numerous attempted rape scenes, as well as nudity scenes. Yes that's right. Not fanservice but straight up nudity which plays ABSOLUTELY no role most of the time. It's just there to have a naked chick in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast in this anime ranges from really good to walking gimmicks and carbon cutouts. Sadly exept for Yuno and Minene most of the other characters are either not interesting or are killed off after one or two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the final episodes the show becomes a horrible trainwreck with plotholes, characters acting stupid and out of nowhere time and dimension traveling.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other bad things in this show but it requires for me to go more in depth to explore them properly. \\n\\n\r\nThere are good things about the show. The animation and overall austetics are good. The first opening is really nice but none of the other OST stands out. There are good things and moments but very few and far between. Overall the show kicked itself in the balls by trying out some very stupid things and concepts on top of the already poorly written characters.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"July 28th. The day Yuki and I will be together forever.\"\r\n\"Eventually there will be no one left to kill but him. Then where will you be? You gonna protect the man you love from yourself? How's that supposed to work? What will your love be worth at the moment of truth?\" - Minene Uryuu \r\nPreface: \r\nMirai Nikki is another show that needs no introduction. #16 in raw popularity, and one of the most talked about anime alongside Death Note, Code Geass, and Elfen Lied- it's one that's left its mark on the medium, and is certain to be discussed for as long as there peoplearound to watch it. While the popularity is certainly deserving, Mirai Nikki is nowhere near a perfect show, though it does have some interesting characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 8\\n\\n\r\nAsread, a studio I admittedly had never heard of prior to this show (but also responsible for the popular horror series Corpse Party) did a nice job bringing Mirai Nikki to life. While there are some obvious places that corners were cut with super low detail character models and stillframes with no pans, when it springs into action, it looks great. The backgrounds and attention to detail in certain environments are very well illustrated. A rather dark palette was used for a chunk of the show to match the tone, but all in all, it's a very vibrant looking piece of art. \\n\\n\r\nOne point of note is the use of cel-shade in Mirai Nikki. I've seen a lot of other reviewers and watchers mistakenly refer to the art style that Deus and his realm are rendered in as 3D CGI. Cel shade is not 3D CGI. It's what's known as a \"non photorealistic\" rendering. Also referred to as flat-D or 2.5D, Cel shading uses less gradients and shading to give art a comic book feel, rather than a wholly 'realistic' look, as seen in the ufotable produced \"Fate\" series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nI watched both sub and dub, and I have to say, game set and match- English. \\n\r\nPerhaps the sub translation that I watched was just poor (HorribleSubs was responsible), but the subtitled version had little to no emotional pull to it like the English did. It was entirely more heartfelt in English, and the word choice and elucidation from Zach Bolton's script made it a 'smarter' watch in my native tongue than in Japanese. While some moments were decidedly darker in English than Japanese, I never got the feeling that Yuno was any creepier or more insane \"sounding\" in Japanese than English. Given that part of the whole allure of the series is how nuts this main character is, it was a no brainer to watch it in what is familiar- and turned out to be better sounding. Josh Grelle's (Armin, AOT) Yuki was a much more ninnyboy middle schooler sound than Togashi Misuzu's. Brina Palencia (Holo, Spice and Wolf, Touka, Tokyo Ghoul) as Yuno was perhaps not the best casting, but again, Yuno sounded like an irrationally lovestruck middle school girl. She was a touch robotic at times, but overall good. \\n\\n\r\nThe intros and outros are all excellent tunes- upbeat J-rock tunes that were obviously written for the show, but still nice. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nJust as there will always be a debate about Lelouch's fate at the end of Code Geass, there will also be a near constant flame war between the fans and critics of one Yuno Gasai. Though Mirai Nikki was not the first, nor the anime that popularized the \"Yandere\" girl trope, it's definitely the most notable example. Calling Yuno Gasai a crazy bitch is only an infinitesimally small scratch on the congealed blood mountain of the unhinged, deranged, and confusing persona that she is. \\n\r\nWhere some decry her as a shallow, plot-armored convenience, others claim her to be a complex mess of abilities, emotions and mental states only theoretically possible. Like some one-off case discussed in a Crime and Deviance or Abnormal Psychology class, or something.\\n\\n\r\nYuno, to me, exhibits what I see to be a very middle school perspective of the concept of love. Anyone who's been through middle school has seen these types of relationships- the ultra clingy, violent protectiveness and absolute adoration of boyfriend and girlfriend to/on each other. With this in mind, and given the supposed age of the characters involved, this works within the context of the show. A 15 year old's idea of what a healthy relationship is often vastly differs what someone even 18 would think- not to mention 25, 40, and on up. \\n\r\nLove is irrational they say, and everyone knows that hormonally imbalanced and impulsive teenagers are too... unless you're one of them- then you just talk about that \"crazy couple that's all over each other\".\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Yuno? Yuno is all of these things, and more. Sure, Yuno has some crazy skills that no 15 year old girl should possess. Sure, Yuno gets out of a lot of situations that would mean hers or anyone else's ass were she not necessary in the story. But, in a story where there's a character named, literally, Deus Ex Machina, and people have phones that enable them to tell the future, there's already a suspension of disbelief going here. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast steals the show at times though, particularly Minene Uruyu, a fan favorite. Uryuu is probably the most compelling character in the show, and one that gets a lot of characterization where others lack it. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the show, or perhaps as a means of making it more depressing is that everyone in the show has a grimdark past, not always for good reason. Kind of like how in Elfen Lied, with Mayu's abusive past shown just to kick the puppy, Mirai Nikki has several Mayus. First on the list is Tsubaki- who is like Sakura Matou level woobie. Crappy past, crappy present, and unnecessarily dark. Everyone who's a diary wielder, with the exception of 8th and 11th are either horrible people, or have been heinously abused in the past... or both. Basically anyone who has a flashback (and there are a lot of these) is going to have been a kicked puppy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nWhere Mirai Nikki loses some points are the wild plot twists that take place in the last three episodes (not counting the OVA as a 27th episode). If I had not watched all three back to back, or had even so much as gotten up to get a drink during them, I would come back and been wondering what Yuki, Yuno, and the gang were doing in another show that had the exact same art style as Mirai Nikki. Seriously, sharks get jumped, and some real screwballs get thrown out there. What was a fairly consistently paced and twisted ride from episode 1 to 23 suddenly became a wormhole to another dimension where the title of the anime was Mirai Nikki, but what was going on was... not. A little Dragon Ball Z, a little Steins Gate, a little Donnie Darko, a smattering of nonsense, and a whole lot of \"what??\" happen in the last three episodes, but they do lead to a rather satisfying conclusion, particularly with the addition of the Mirai Nikki Redial OVA, which lends a new perspective to the final moments of the series. \\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is strong in that it keeps the viewer on their toes, or edge of their seat. It's not one of those shonen anime where every enemy that's defeated joins the crew and friendship prevails- it treats its characters harshly and with permanent results. While the setup of the death/survival game rings of an ensemble cast type setting, Mirai Nikki takes a slightly different path of arcs, with some overlapping characters. This works well for the show, and kept it from being needlessly convoluted with a lot of characters with disparate motives and threads of plot in every episode. It enabled the show to stay more focused on the conflict at hand and allow the complexity to grow as it went on instead of being all at once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe Future Diary's popularity likely stems from its method of presentation- a very accessible teen drama with a lot of mature content- ultraviolence and nudity, along with an exciting plot with a rather unexpected conclusion. All in all, Mirai Nikki is a very electrifying and enjoyable watch- imagine a mix of the supernatural, a modern day Romeo and Juliet tale, then mixed with Natural Born Killers, were Woody Harrelson less unhinged and more of a sissy. It's a story of irrational love, and at the same time one of despair and how sick humanity can be for the sake of power over others. Definitely a show I'll remember well into the future.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommended?\\n\\n\r\nCertainly. Mirai Nikki is a twisty drama chock full of darkness and violence, but not relentlessly depressing. For those who find the Yandere girl trope interesting, this is a must see. For those who just want an exciting and fun but rough show - this is another good fit. Plenty of blood, guts, and angst to go with the mysterious and supernatural elements- just don't expect it to be grounded in reality. \\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki, a psychological anime that brings up the theme of gore and killing. However, it is not an ordinary one as it also brought up the idea of unconditional love.\r\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this anime. I thought it would be another gantz or battle royalle (the japanese movie). I'm surprised at how the plot is smartly twisted and very emotional. Well, it's predictable that our hero, Amano Yukite will win the game, but the story and how it is told is very captivating. Therefore, this anime deserves a 9.\r\nDetailed Review\r\nCharacters - 10\r\nThis anime has successfully made me love a characterin one episode and hate him/her in the next one, vice versa. Characters are developed, story of them (their background,etc) are being told clearly (exception for some). Well, that's understandable considering on the number of characters this anime had. It is executed brilliantly with some plot twist, flash backs, and many more surprise that this anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nWho would expect that it would end that way? Every episodes ending always left me hanging and it always gave me the urge to watch the next one. One of the disappointment is that some things are not explained. I'm now still wondering how deus chose the player. I'm still wondering how each character got their numbering. I'm still wandering about how Yuno is already a G** however she is not in the se**** wor** (gosh these are some spoilers). Although most of it is magnificent and unexpected, there are still some loop holes and unexplained matters. Overall, it has a good and very creative plot. I love how they kept me hanging even at the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe lighting, colour composition and smoothness will definitely pamper your eye. Characters are occasionally drawn in a different state to show their personality. There are definitely some confidence in the art. Gore and blood are not drawn hesitantly. Beautiful background, however some of the drawing are a bit exaggerated, it turns out to be ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nNot the best, but it is very suiting for the theme of the anime. They are simple, stunning and completely complement the story telling. It brings out suspense, mistery and sometimes emotions.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, mirai nikki deserved the 9 because it has fabulous plot, lovable characters (and detestable ones too) and  colourful drawings. It is twisted, but definitely it is straight.",

            "content": "Story: The first couple Episodes didn't really grab me all that well. I mean the concept is cool and they really did a good job turning it into something a child would want as a super power and it was awesome finding out what all the future diaries did as the story progressed with the different diaries doing different things based on the type of person that held them. The story was excellent towards the middle and end and the OVA episodes filled the void I would usually have at the end of an anime like this, but the beginning is slow and didnt grabme. Hell i dropped it for 5 months and only picked it up again because i was bored and wasn't watching anything else. BUT Holy Fucking shit not even M. Night Shyamalan can come up with twists like this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The only part that grabbed me was the realm of the god of space and time(Deus Ex Machina). With its purple tints and clock gears it was befitting for Deus Ex Machina speaking of which thats the other thing that grabbed me for the most part he was animated with CGI and really stood out from the backgrounds and characters. Other than that nothing stood out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There really isn't much I liked about the music the only thing I LOVED was the first opening the animation and the music to go along with it was 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Lets be honest here no one heard of this anime because of Yuki His copy paste character doesnt leave much for you to get attached too. You came here for Yuno Motherfucking Gasai with her devoted love for her sweet prince, Yuki, she'll do anything from decking people in the face to straight up cutting their heads off. \\n\r\n          But something i enjoy from anything i watch, read, or play, is the lore or backstory of the characters and this anime does an excellent job of going through each of the diary holders backstories. Sometimes they make you feel for them, sometimes you can relate to them, and other times you wish they didn't have to die. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although i dropped it for 5 months  in the end I really enjoyed it.\\n",

            "content": "I started on Mirai Nikki, with some skepticism, after my friend badgered me into watching it. Mirai Nikki was an interesting experience for me. I never liked horror and gore, and yanderes. However, this piece drew me in, at some points making me cringe in disgust, rant about the (warped) logic, yet, it brings out the love in the horror filled world, and that held on to me, letting me last through to the end. The concept of playing with time also intrigued me.\r\nStory: The story follows the protagonist, Yukiteru, as he is tossed around in a world where the future can be predicted, andwhere other people with their own agendas change his future and toys with life. The story doesn't turn out to be anything spectacular, with the manipulation of time being nothing more than a tool for scheming individuals to achieve their own ends. The idea that giving humans power to play with time is brought out interestingly.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thrust of the story follows the schemes of Yukiteru's girlfriend, Gasai Yuno. Yuno is ultra possessive, and clinically insane. Yukiteru, being the typical main character type, cares for everybody, and this creates conflicting interests between Yukiteru and Yuno. Possessive love rarely works out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art matches the story decently, reflecting the mood of the story. It effectively signals developments in the story. Mirai Nikki relies, to a large extent, on text, as that is the medium that the future diaries are in. The English reading of the text in the diaries, as well as other parts of the show is well integrated alongside the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The soundtracks are excellent, and very fitting of the scenes. Deserving of a full 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I personally feel repulsed by mentally incapacitated characters, as seems to be the case for most yanderes, and some protagonists, Yukiteru being one of them. Most dramas however feel the need to bring in characters who make the stupidest decisions, so as to bring the story forward. Guilty crown comes to mind. Sometimes it fits, sometimes it just doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nYukiteru is shown, rightly, to be a worthless sack of shit, incapable of making friends, cowardly, incompetent, indecisive, and desperately wanting to protect everything without risking anything. In other words, a selfish cowardly brat. Halfway through, the loss of his loved ones pushes him into finding some determination to fight on, and hits the other extreme, going mad and ruthless. Even then, he rarely shows brilliant moments. Seems a little typical. Once in a while, he stands up to Yuno, and fights for his ideals. While I don't like him, he fits as the main character for an apocalyptic world, survival battle royale setting.\\n\\n\r\nYuno is a great Yandere. Driven completely by her obsession with Yukiteru, she is ruthless, insane, and is an effective killing machine. Her pains and internal conflicts are brought out well, and her sick love is brought out through the incessant call of \"Yukkii\". Despite that, her vulnerability invites feelings of protectiveness, and Yukiteru being the man he is falls hopelessly into her venus fly trap. Yuno strikes me as one of the best characters ever, but I still don't like her.\\n\\n\r\nOther supporting characters flesh out the story well, everyone possessing their quirks, and motivations. For the most part, the supporting cast isn't introduced abruptly, and killed off just as sudden as they come in. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The pace of this anime is one of the best I've ever experienced. This is one of the key criteria I consider for  enjoyment. I got absorbed into the show so much, so that sometimes, I feel a strong urge to rush through the scenes, while at other times I feel a peace and calm settling in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would recommend this anime even for those who are opposed to the themes and character types as I am. Don't let personal prejudices stop you from appreciating uncomfortable themes. The delivery of the anime more than makes up for it.",

You begin to get a good idea of why this anime was so popular in japan and Spain. \r\nThe art, at first glance, is nothing too awe inducing, however, when the fight scenes come out, And they do, about 5 times every episode, But moving on , The Effects of the blood, is great, it fits myideal art style perfectly, although others may not enjoy it, and I'll respect that. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound.

            "content": "Future Diary starts off with an interesting premise: pick an assortment of people, give them the power to read the future, and tell them the last one alive will be granted the power of god. What would they do? What would you do?\r\nThe characters cover a broad spectrum, giving many interesting viewpoints: a police detective, a terrorist, a shy high school boy, an insane girl, a cult leader, and seven others.  Everyone has a different reaction to their position. Some don\u2019t want to fight, others are determined to win the power of god to make the world a better place, whereas others desire thepower for selfish means. The animation is good enough not to be distracting, though there a few shortcuts here and there that stand out. The character designs are unique and interesting to look at, and the music supports the atmosphere it is intending to go for. Even the overall plot manages to run pretty smoothly, factoring in a plethora of twists and turns.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the series suffers from many character, mood and \u201cminor detail\u201d inconsistencies in addition to jumps in development I still don\u2019t comprehend. One moment there may be a brutal slaughter, and the next there may be a moment that was almost slapstick. The main character is a grating, whiny, child whose logic I can only conclude stemmed from mind-boggling cowardice. I was sorely disappointed every time some murderous intent missed him by a hair.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters likewise had responses, reactions, and made decisions that felt more a victim of lazy and contrived writing than anything else. In the same lifting of believability, many of the wounds  inflicted and brushed off as insignificant would have made Bleach gape. Add a suspiciously recurring rape theme that felt more like an overfondness than for character development, and light treatment of middle-schoolers partaking in sexual intercourse, and Future Diary pulls the rug from under its own feet.\\n\\n\r\nThe end result is a series that is too immature to handle its subject matter in the way it desires. Sure, it tries to point out the depravity of a survival game, but the mood swings ruin any attempt to be taken seriously. In fact, Future Diary may have fared a bit better if it had gone for a black comedy in its moments of humor than for light-hearted silliness. It tries, and although there are moments of genuine emotional depth, and does have a fairly solid ending, in the end it is merely another story that falls short of any lasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback on what is helpful, not helpful, or how this can be improved is appreciated.",

            "content": "I was very reluctant to watch this Anime as I had heard good and bad things about it, and when I watched the first episode when it was released I didn't really find it all that interesting. But I'm really glad I went back and stuck to it, because by the end of it, it become one of my most loved anime series of all time. \r\nThe Future Diary or Mirai Nikki revolves around a young boy named Yukiteru Amano who unwittingly finds himself thrown into a \"Diary Game\", in which all the contestants are given special diaries which can predict future events in theirown unique way both with advantages and disadvantages. During the Diary Game he meets a seemingly friendly girl named Yuno Gasai, who, in reality, is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru to the point where her personality resembles that of a yandere character (yandere is the term for someone who is shown to be naturally kind and friendly to someone they really care about to the point where their romantic attraction becomes increasingly destructive and they will use any means, usually violent, to ensure that they stay with their romantic interest forever). As Yuno and Yukiteru progress through the Diary Game, they meet the other contestants that either intend to kill them or attempt to join forces with them as allies. Through these interactions, Yukiteru begins to questions the motives of those around him, and uncovers the truth about who Yuno Gasai truly is. By the end of the series, Yukiteru becomes a very changed person who is far from who he was at the beginning. The ending has a big twist which I won't spoil here, but it was a twist that I definitely did not see coming. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY 10/10\\n\r\nThe story of Mirai Nikki at its base level is one between Yuno and Yukiteru and their twisted love story. It was very interesting to see how the two characters interact. The Diary Game storyline also shines, but is sort of secondary to the main characters' relationship. The twists and turns the story brings are truly award-worthy, with the ending being the ultimate bringing the ultimate twist that no one saw coming.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the two main characters is great, despite the two of them having very different personalities to begin with. Yukiteru starts off as a very kind, shy person who does his best to avoid killing people, but also lacks the ability to protect himself properly, whereas Yuno will do anything to protect him, even murder others. Her Yandere tenancies is what bring the whole show together in my own opinion. Her psychotic personality and the identity of who she truly is was a defining moment in the story. The character evolution of the two is intense, and by the end of it you'll see Yukiteru end up as a completely different person. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters in the series have great progression as well. Some of the Diary owners are actually genuinely caring people, like Keigo, a police Captain who helps Yuki and Yuno and forms an alliance with them. Minene Uryu is also a character with great depth and my second favourite character of the show. She is also a Diary owner who starts off as an antagonist to the main characters, but eventually ends up as a protagonist by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters have an interesting story to tell, and as you watch each episode, you'll begin to wonder and look forward to finding out more about each Diary owner, and the ability of their Future Diary. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC 8/10\\n\r\nThe first OP was probably my favourite of them all, by I didn't really enjoy any of the EDs, but that's just my personal opinion! \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, Mirai Nikki is a great suspense/thriller with plenty of action and no boring bits, leaving you at the edge of your seat after every episode. I was so hooked that I wanted to binge watch the entire series in one go. The ending had me wanting more, because I felt that there wasn't any closure for the main character, however, the OVA rectified that. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy action, drama, and suspenseful thrillers involving time travel with fantastic character development and storyline, you'll enjoy Mirai Nikki hands down. It's a show you'll end up loving or hating, depending on what kind of anime you enjoy, but to me, it would definitely be worth a watch.",

            "content": "Warning: minor spoilers\r\nThere are certain standards and requirements that make a good show or movie. Well-written story, good character development, steady pacing, the works. The problem with Mirai Nikki is that it fails miserably at even the most basic rules of storytelling.\r\nThe story itself is sloppily written at best. The concept itself is actually quite great and the whole idea of being thrown into a survival game that uses future predicting cell phones where the winner becomes god of time and space is brilliant and it definitely adds interest to the show. However it\u2019s the concept\u2019s execution that causes the story to fall apart. \r\nMiraiNikki constantly presents itself in a way to make you expect certain things and then go in the complete opposite direction. The main weapon that all the contestants use are obviously their diaries all of which are able to predict the future and each have their own special abilities that make them unique and as the diary owners take actions, the future written in the diaries will change. With a concept such as this you would assume that means that the characters will have to use their diaries to outsmart their opponents and will show a lot of intelligence, cunning, and elaborate planning. But nope! Most of the characters are idiots and instead Mirai Nikki focuses not enough on the diaries and too much on action, fight scenes which are mostly bland and boring, and back stories for characters we don't care about. Many diary owners are defeated the same way. Yuno brutally hacks her way through all their minions before finally reaching the diary owner and slaughtering them in cold blood or destroying their diary. Mirai Nikki also has a bad habit of throwing in bad jokes in serious moments and there are MASS amounts of mood killers in this show that make Mirai Nikki seriously unworthy of the title \"psychological thriller\" the story moves slowly, the plot forces itself along constantly, and the overall show is ridiculously repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries way too hard to get you hooked as nearly every episode will leave off with a major cliffhanger, which would be fine except the next episode almost never picks up where it left off and will usually take several episodes to get any answers. The questions all lead up to huge plot twists that yes are definitely surprising. I did not see them coming. But surprising does not necessarily mean good. Most of the plot twists create more questions than they answer. Most of which will also take forever to answer or will just not get explained at all and there are a mountain of things in Mirai Nikki that simply don\u2019t make sense. It gets even worse towards the end of the show when they start hitting you with plot holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through. Plus all the completely random crap they start making up on the spot towards the end to the point where there is no longer anything in the show that makes any sense anymore.\\n\\n\r\nWarning: The next paragraph contains spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally like to include spoilers in my reviews but I feel like I just have to talk about this. When you get right down to it, Mirai Nikki is a love story and if you want to see the worst, cheesiest, most forced love story ever that makes soap operas look like masterpieces then look no further. Yukiteru has a million reasons to hate Yuno, he spends most of the show lying about loving her, and then at the end he decides to fall in love with her for real with no logical or believable reason other than \u201cjust because\u201d. This is immediately after she made him kill all his friends by the way. Not to mention that there is absolutely NO chemistry between the two of them at all. And even if she did save his life a few times, it does not justify the horrible way she treated him throughout the series and is still not a good reason to fall in love with a psychopathic serial killer that could do who knows what to you. *cough cough* She tries to kill him. *cough cough* \\n\\n\r\nStill a better love story than Twilight? Nope. Not this time.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers over.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters overall are horrible. Many of them will often take actions simply because the plot demands it and as far as intelligence goes, the characters are flat out stupid. You know. The kind of stupid that\u2019s painful to watch and makes you want to go smash your head against the wall. Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a psychological thriller.\\n\\n\r\nAmano Yukiteru himself is without a doubt the WORST protagonist I have ever seen. Period! Seriously, how do you screw up the main character this badly? Why is he bad you ask? Because he\u2019s a terribly written character who fails to fulfill his role as the protagonist and is simply unlikeable. Starting at the beginning of the show, Yukiteru is portrayed as weak, pathetic, spineless, cowardly, annoying, and helpless (hell he\u2019s even voiced by a girl) But that\u2019s alright because that\u2019s what character development is all about! And we know he\u2019ll get stronger and braver as the show progresses right? WRONG! Yukiteru spends the entire show doing pretty much nothing but hiding behind Yuno while she does all the dirty work and by the end of the show, Yukiteru is the exact same person he was in the first episode and has not changed at all. The protagonist is supposed to be the hero of the story. The relatable character we root for. Yet Yukiteru doesn't care at all about winning the survival game and does so little that his character could probably be removed entirely and the show would still work. Even when he does start to care about winning towards the end, it's for the most illogical reason imaginable. His character is incredibly inconsistent, he puts way too much trust in all the wrong people and is too quick to forgive thus he ends up consistently making things worse for himself, and as with most characters in this show, he is an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the other main lead. The yandere poster girl. Yuno is your typical yandere who obsesses over Yuki and threatens to kill anyone who gets near him and she does this part of her role quite well. Murata Tomosa also does a fairly good acting job and her voice fits Yuno pretty well. On the flip side, like everything else in this show, her great potential is ruined. There are many traits that drag down the seriousness of her character. She often acts goofy. Many times even in serious situations and her dialogue is pretty pathetic (not a good trait of a psychotic character) and consists way too much of her constantly crying out \u201cYukki!\u201d She is also seriously lacking in any decent personality besides yandere.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the other diary owners, they are obviously supposed to be the antagonist of the show and as such are portrayed as crazy psychopaths. Many of them also get their own tragic back story that I\u2019m guessing is supposed to make us feel sympathetic towards them though it does not excuse the horrible acts they commit and ultimately just creates confusion. Are we supposed to like these guys or not? Of course it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you like them because most of them won\u2019t be around long enough for us to care much anyway. One of Mirai Nikki's major faults is that it spends way too much time and effort in giving us detailed back stories on minor characters that are only around for a few episodes while the back stories of our main characters that actually matter are barely touched on.\\n\\n\r\nAs for all the other characters, they are mostly bland, forgettable, and as I mentioned before\u2026 IDIOTS! Though I will say that I kind of liked the character Akise Aru (and when I say \"like\" I mean \"hated the least\") Akise seemed to be the only character that possessed intelligence, which makes him a good fit for a psychological thriller like this, though his character is still far from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art style, it\u2019s fairly good though nothing special. The soundtrack is also pretty average overall but the tracks do their job of fitting the scenes and neither of the openings are bad. Mainly the first intro, which is definitely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there anything good in Mirai Nikki? Well... actually yes. As a matter of fact Mirai Nikki is overflowing with amazing potential to be a great show. The problem is that every ounce of that potential was wasted and shat upon in some way or another. And that's exactly why I consider this to be the worst show I've ever seen. I would rather watch a show that is bad from the get go (e.g. Pupa) than have to sit through the torture of watching such great potential be thrown into the trash heap. And believe me, I REALLY tried to enjoy this show. What\u2019s upsetting is that there are so many underrated shows out there with fantastic characters and stories that clearly were well thought out and had a lot of effort put into them. Of course none of that matters anymore because nowadays you can just slap yandere on a character, throw in a bunch of hack and slash action and apparently that works. And it\u2019s very disappointing that that's the type of show that gets popular nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Mirai Nikki worth it? Well if you\u2019re one of those very casual viewers who likes to pull the good ol' \"turn off your brain\" trick and watch shows based on pure enjoyment alone and doesn\u2019t care about flaws then by all means feel free to watch this show. Don\u2019t think about it at all and you might like Mirai Nikki. On the other hand if you're any kind of critic with standards then you will probably want to avoid this show as you will most likely see it as the big jumbled mess that it is.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "What happens when you combine the creative premise of Death Note, the character depth of your typical ecchi harem anime, and the writing quality of a Tyler Perry movie?  The answer is Mirai Nikki.\r\nI recently rediscovered my love for anime a few months ago and in that time I have focused mostly on romances, but I have taken time to check things out that seem to have built strong followings and come highly recommended.  Over and over I continued to be pointed to Mirai Nikki.  I now know to not trust a few individuals on what to watch.  Although I havenow seen several poor reviews of this mess of an Anime, I still have to say that for all of the hype, this might be the most overrated anime of recent memory.  However, what makes this most interesting is how good this anime COULD have been if it had been helmed by a more talented writer.\\n\r\nStory- 6\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to really review the story of this anime without spoilers, but I will try.  Surely you have read the premise of the story.  Sounds really interesting right?  Well it is.  The set pieces and conflicts set up by this really cool premise do not disappoint\u2026mostly.  Here is the problem.  The plot relies on stupidity to maintain momentum.  This is more apparent in the beginning than toward the end, but on so many occasions I found myself asking WHY!  Why are you doing this, why are you with these people, why are you making this decision, etc.  There is a part in episode 9 where one character literally shouting \u201cWhy are you doing this\u201d and \u201cthis makes no sense\u201d but the writer didn\u2019t seem to get that this is exactly what the audience would be thinking. The story too often asks for the viewer to ignore the ridiculous logic of the characters in order to allow for the various twists and turns of the story to have an impact.  The only redeeming factor is that because of the cool set pieces and conceits, the story is still engaging as long as you agree to play dumb for it.  Toward the end, the story escalates to ridiculous proportions, but I was not as offended as others.  This is anime were talking about, and aside from a few confusing twists, I must say that I found the ending a satisfying close to the problematic story. This is something that cannot be said about waaaaay to many animes.  Overall, the biggest problem with the story is that it fails to deliver on what could have been a really cool story.  It tries to crib Death Note, Evangelion, and High school of the dead and ends up just being a mess.\\n\r\nVisuals/audio- 8\\n\r\nIn my other review I explain that I am not very qualified to really discuss the merits of the audio and visual quality of a manga.  I just like when it doesn\u2019t look dated or boring.  I will say that I was impressed with the overall direction of the manga.  The way they framed many of the scenes definitely helped heighten the tension.  I found the constant use of the \u201cyandere\u201d face annoying after a while though.  Also, I really could care less about OPs and endings  but this is the first one I didn\u2019t start skipping over once I got into the anime.\\n\r\nCharacters- 2\\n\r\nThis is where the anime has the most problems.  The characters in the story are completely devoid of logical human thought.  First you have Yuki our male lead who spends the first half of the anime doing his best Shinji Ikari impression.  Maybe it\u2019s because im an American, but I will never EVER get Japan\u2019s infatuation with these spineless whiny character archetypes.  If you took a shot every time you see him cower in fear in the first 10 episodes you will die from alcohol poisoning.  Then toward the end he suddenly turns into Lelouch Vi Britannia and starts working out these elaborate plans on how to eliminate his enemies, and suddenly and inexplicably falls in love with our other main character. The other major character is the now iconic Yuno.  While Yuno is definitely intriguing as a Yandere turned to 11, her behavior, inexplicable assassin skills, and understandably bipolar nature make her a chore to deal with.  She is too crazy to like and connect with or be a fan of, but too sympathetic at times to hate purely as a villain.  A more skilled writer could have made this conflict more engaging, but much like the aforementioned Tyler Perry, the author can only make her a moe fan service idol, or a psycho yandere killer and nothing in-between. The real problem is the \u201clove\u201d between these two nutjobs.  It just happens and It is never explained or built up to.  Although they save each other\u2019s lives on many occasions, you never really get to understand WHY these two became drawn to each other.  Even at the end when the elaborate and silly backstory  connecting them is explained, you still don\u2019t really get to see why this whiny wuss eventually falls for this bipolar sociopath that he has watched kill dozens people.  Aside from a few standouts, other characters serve little more than enemies of the week akin to a power ranger episode.  We have an L clone (who satisfies some of the deep rooted wants of a certain sect of Death Note fans), a Tsundere Gothic terrorist, a woman with a huge head, a three year old with a love for puppets, and a bunch of other psycho\u2019s whose motivations are not explained but at least most of them were fun to watch.  Overall the issue here is that even though the literal fate of the world hangs in the balance, and the body count is quite high, you simply do not care what happens to anyone other than wanting to understand what is actually going on.  \\n\r\nOverall- 6\\n\r\nThis anime is not really worth watching for the average fan, but it does have some interesting and intriguing moments.  Its biggest problem is its hype and the unfulfilled promise of its story setup.  If you can turn your brain off and just get engaged in a psychological thriller with tons of twist and a halfway decent payoff in the end, then go for it.  But if you need characters to have sensible motives, stories to stay grounded, and writing that doesn\u2019t make you face palm, then you might want to pass.\\n",

Sometimes, that shit does not end up in the sewer, but it lands on paper. Sometimes people don't know what shit looks like as it comes and different forms. This turd took the form of Mirai Nikki.\r\nAside from the vulgar metaphor, Mirai Nikki is an awful show. It fails on every level: sound, characterization, pacing etc. This show is abysmal.\r\nThe characters are very badly developed. Yukiteru, the male protagonist, is one of the worst protagonists in recent memory.He is whiny, abrasive and too trustworthy. He makes decisions that defy basic logic and reasoning. He is also bipolar and switches personalities every five seconds. The female protagonist, Yuno, is just as bad. She is a psychologically disturbed, stalker, who needs some kind of help. But the writers try to romanticize her mental illness by making her come off as overly affectionate. This couple has one of the worst chemistry I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are all very bad. Apparently, the writer thinks if these characters are raped or tortured in some way, that some how makes them sympathetic characters. They are not. The way rape is used in this show is disgusting and crude and makes you wonder how anyone with a decent IQ can enjoy this show in any intellectual capacity.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no themes that make this show worth it. There are plot holes the size of mount olympus and it poor integrates all the elements of a successful thriller. The tension dissipates after the first couple episodes. There are jarring moments between comedy and drama. Comedy shouldn't be in this show in the first place. The premise is also flawed to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is very bad and shouldn't be watched, unless you want to laugh at how terrible it is.\\n\\n\r\nI give it 3 wipes of 10 wipes total.

Yes unnecessary violence for the sole purpose of pure shock value that adds nothing to the actual plot of the series ,exactly like in a low budged horror movie.Whats funny is that without these stupid moments the series would have ended up completely forgettable ,so at the very least it has that going for it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to the story shall we.\\n\\n\r\nLike most anime series nowadays the story starts out immediately from the very first episode, you are literally thrown into this world and into its plot with no proper introductions or any kind of foundation to it.\\n\r\nAll in the idea of suckering in the viewer and leaving him/her curios as to where its going and adding crucial details and flashbacks along the way whenever it feels like doing so.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise is a survival battle royal following a young high school boy  (of course) named Yukiteru and his classmate Yuno ,the other main character, in their efforts to combat the other participating members with their help of their future diary phones which can predict the near future.The winner of this death game will be successor to the God of space and time.Sounds simple and straight forward enough right ? How can it go so wrong then? \\n\\n\r\nWell for starters the whole battle royal premise if misunderstood by the author from the very begging since all opposing opponents all politely take their respective turns to \"battle it out\" with the 2 main characters and almost never go against each-other.There are just 2 exceptions to this,where they do fight but it also directly involves Yuki and Yuno so it might as well not even matter.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly the writing is just god awful,completely amateurish (he-he) as if written by someone just starting out in their early teens.\\n\r\nFlimsy plot - check,completely inconsistent characters with sometimes multiple change of motivation in the same episode - check,overly stretched story that takes to much time to go anywhere - check,plot elements that go nowhere or are completely forgotten -check, lackluster ending that cops out of whatever has happened and developed so far -check.\\n\r\nMirai Nikki has it all that's for sure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe absolute worst part of this anime however lies with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nYukiteru is just a atrociously bad and useless main protagonist ,he even makes the infamous Ikari Shinji from Neo Genes Evangelion look good in comparison. Spineless,childish ,gullible to the point of mental retardation,but of course very kind to his friends with no other defining characteristics .He is absolute joke of a character and downright cringe-worthy to have to watch.Even die hard otakus with no self-esteem would be like \"ugh even i'm better than that loser\". \\n\r\nWhats worse is the series tries to make a sudden 180 turn in character for him in the very last episodes ,but by that time it just comes out of nowhere and in no way well presented or acceptable story wise.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character and the entire reason this anime got any sort of attention (the ridiculous fandom she has received over the years is just mind boggling), Yuno is a straight up psychopath.Lets not miss words here with all the yandere crap and so on .She is a psychopathic character which would have been good and maybe great if the writing wasn't so damn bad.\\n\r\nThe motivation for her behavior is just laughable and a complete disgrace for people who actually suffer from this mental instability.Plus the anime never bothers to explain as to why she is so strong and has such keen reflexes and senses,the writer probably believed that if someone is a psychopath than he automatically is a super villain.\\n\r\nAnd lastly her constant shouting \"Yuki-Yuki\" will drive you absolutely insane by the time the anime finishes. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters are extremely lacking and completely forgettable,they vary from nonexistent just to take some screen time to boring with no strong or defining characteristics to just all out laughably comically crazy.Notable mentioning goes to Minene Uryuu who is completely inconsistent and changes her character and motivation like a hundred times throughout the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is the only thing this anime has going for it,but that's not saying much for a series released in 2011.Character design and backgrounds for the most part are good but somewhat inconsistent ,some character looks much better than others and there is some very weird use for CGI for simple things such as bicycles or mobile phones.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also ok,the VA for Yuno actually does a pretty good job at representing the soft and angry side of her character (minus the whole repeating Yuki-Yuki a billion times over and over) ,other VA do their job decent as well with no other stand out performances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall when its all said and done the series just falls flat on its ass in multiple ways,the primary being the story and character which are the main factors for making or breaking a anime series.You can have all the highest production values you can possibly get,but with a terrible story and weak characters it wont get you very far.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Mirai Nikki achieves is making the viewer either disappointed if they somehow still had any sort of expectations by the end of it or angry because they wasted so much time on such a sloppy series.\\n\r\n26 episodes is still a large number of episodes all things considered,you could easily spend your time with so many other series that don't have the nerve to mock the viewer the way Mirai Nikki does.",

            "content": "This is my first review. Read the anime description first as I will not include details written in there.\r\nFirst off, this is quite possibly my favorite anime of all time, but I will not be biased, though my overall score is biased. If I were to rate this anime in an unbiased manner, I would probably give it an 8 or 9. The rest of this review will explain why.\r\nOpening/ Ending themes - 10. \r\nSome of the best out there. They fit the mood really well and play a role in enhancing the experience of watching. I feel that the opening and ending themes ofan anime can magnify your attraction to it if they are good enough and the themes in this anime are.\\n\\n\r\nRest of the soundtrack - 8. \\n\r\nNothing really stood out for me except for the \"sad\" song (which made some incredibly emotional moments). The soundtrack certainly doesn't hurt and it can be quite complementary to it, but it is nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9. \\n\r\nI find the basic plot quite intriguing. To put it simply, the relationships between diary holders are quite fragile. If there is cooperation, it is doomed to end in betrayal at some point down the road. This creates a sense of tension, though it is not made nearly as strong as it could have been made (similar to the tension in death note, but very minor). This combined with some \"interesting\" characters makes for a story that is unpredictable and contains plot twists that you just don't see coming.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode Progression - 7. \\n\r\nThis category represents the flow of the anime by episode. To put it bluntly, it is quite rough. Some episodes are crazy and full of goodies and other episodes leave you feeling unsatisfied as virtually nothing has happened.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8.\\n\r\nTo be fair, I don't pay much attention to the art. I like some of the color schemes used and a lot of the character expressions, but I wouldn't say that the art stands out or is original/ innovative.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9.\\n\r\nI could just say Gasai Yuno and leave it at that, but I will add a bit more. I found that there was a good variety between the characters and aside from Yuki, I didn't particularly dislike any of them. No two characters are the same and you get a sense of individuality with each of them. Not all of the characters have depth, but a good number gain some through flashbacks. The anime does a good job at using the characters to create anticipation for future episodes (mainly Yuno, but Akise is a very mysterious minor character).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter connection - 10.\\n\r\nThere are a lot of flashbacks in this anime. It can be frustrating when you want the main plot to continue, but it really improves the experience as a whole. Most of the flashbacks give you a peek at the past of the diary holders and you find out their motives for becoming god, giving you an idea about the type of people they are. These flashbacks make it easy to be emotionally invested in some of the diary holders and can make some of the scenes heartbreaking. I can assure you that there will be at least one scene where you will want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development - 9.\\n\r\nAside from a few characters, they don't really change. There are a few fascinating relationships that characters have though and watching them develop is a treat. I will just throw this out here: a lot of people hate Yuki and I understand, but I wouldn't give up on the anime just because of how annoying Yuki is. He is a main character and that makes him a prime candidate for character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10.\\n\r\nIgnoring some of the frustrating aspects of this anime, I have found it very rewarding. This is because I am incredibly drawn to the nature of this story. The image of Yuno at the end of the first episode made me fall in love and Yuno is like the Naruto/ Ichigo of this series, but with a vastly superior character. Those who are hooked on the premise will love it and those who aren't are at risk of getting disinterested during a few strings of bland episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10.\\n\r\nIf you are not immersed in this anime, you will not give it a 10 because it has obvious flaws. However, I think there is quite a bit of appeal and a lot of people will fall in love with it like I have. The anticipation of the development of Yuno and Yuki's relationship keeps the viewer wanting more. Really, what makes this show so amazing is that you know that Yuno or Yuki will have to die for this game to end and as fewer diary holders remain, the suspense of how the game will end keeps building up.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nDon't judge this based on your first impressions of Yuki and try to watch at least half the show before writing it off. I get the impression that the end is going to be mind blowing, making the 2nd half superior to the first half.",

            "content": "I love reading articles that carefully dissect the flaws of this anime. The effort to pick it apart at its seams and meticulously state every fault possible is actually quite impressive. However, I would have to say that all these reviews of this show usually skip over the brilliance of the show as a whole. \r\n(((Non-Spoiler section; if you have seen show, I recommend you skip to the spoiler section farther below)))\r\nTo begin with, the main character is not made to be liked. Almost every review, good or bad, seems to believe Yuuki is a shit character. But to dive into why he\u2019s a shitcharacter is important. First off, he is your typical high school loner. His personality, thought process, and emotions all play into this type of character. He may not act like a likable person, but he serves as a reality check for the series. He is always afraid of danger, and Yuno (of course), because he\u2019s not a strong individual, mentally or physically. He\u2019s just an afraid teenager who doesn\u2019t want to die. This trait is perfect for the show in many ways though. Because he\u2019s so tentative, all the side character\u2019s unique traits become more emphasized. Yuuki\u2019s inability to relate to the more vibrant, lovable characters of the show highlights their way of thinking and the influence their past had on them. Many have tragic backstories or are fanatics, while Yuuki is just an incredibly average teenager with a fairly typical backstory. Most importantly, Yuuki foils Yuno so well that both of their characters can be summarized by their actions towards one another. Their relationship is a gem because of how different the two are from each other.\\n\\n\r\nNext, Yuno Gasai; you either love her or you hate her. If you\u2019re into psychopaths, thrillers, or lovable characters, I recommend you watch it. Her mindset throughout the show is brilliantly portrayed by a one-of-a-kind backstory, extreme actions, and hidden motives. By the end of the show, I felt like Yuno was by far the best character of the show. This is not because she is dick-hungry for Yuuki or just a crazy bitch incorporated into the show for entertainment. Her growth, her thinking, her actions, and who she is as a person were a welcome surprise for a show I had just picked for its battle royale concept. I can honestly say you could watch the show purely for Yuno Gasai and still enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the battle royale concept, here\u2019s where I believe Mirai Nikki loses its rating. I have to say the battle royale part of the show is definitely of a lower quality compared to its focus on the three biggest characters, and how (((SPOILER START))) each competitor faces off against Yuno and Yuuki becomes a bit annoying(((SPOILER END))). The competition was still good, and the fights always had great sound, fluency, and value. I\u2019d probably give the battle royale aspect of the show an 8. Thus, it\u2019s excellence in other aspects had to be terrific for me to give the show a 10.\\n\\n\r\n(((PARAGRAPH BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)))\\n\\n\r\nTo all who have already seen the show, this paragraph is about what specifically made me give it a 10. For episodes 1-20, I thoroughly enjoyed the show and could not stop binge watching it. Despite this, my opinion towards the show\u2019s quality was tremendously lower. The animation, the eerie music, and the interesting concept were probably my favorite parts. I enjoyed Yuno\u2019s actions and dialogue toward Yuuki and Yuuki\u2019s response to said actions and dialogue, but it wasn\u2019t \u201c10\u201d worthy. The relationship between Yuuki and Yuno was well established and entertaining, and I really enjoyed the amusement park episode, the \u201cmarriage\u201d episode, and the kidnapping arc. But it wasn\u2019t until episode 21 that I started to fall in love with the show. Three things happened in these last episodes that vastly improved its appeal. #1: Yuuki begins to view Yuno as more of a person and less as an asset. His change in perspective makes him a significantly better character. #2: All of the story begins to make sense. There were a few plot holes, but after watching the entire series three times, I\u2019d say they hardly lessen the show\u2019s value. The fact that Yuno traveled across timelines to come to Yuki really helped me understand why she acted so fearlessly throughout the show. If you claim there were plot holes that ruined the show, I feel you either didn\u2019t understand everything \u201cbelow the surface\u201d, or you have not had deep enough mental pain to sympathize with Yuno\u2019s actions (This is merely an opinion of some stranger on the internet, so please don\u2019t take any real offense). And most importantly, #3: Yuno and Yuuki\u2019s relationship gets exponentially better. Yuki learns of Yuno\u2019s past, and begins to love Yuno for who she is. He values her personality, her bravery, and her strength. He begins to love Yuno for who Yuno is, rather than for her loyalty to him. And Yuno\u2019s love for Yuuki becomes much better as well.  I was about thirteen when I hit depression hard. More days than not, I felt I needed a reason to live. I felt everyone around me was alright because they had things I didn\u2019t. So I made it my goal to outperform every one I knew in social life, athletics, academics, and romance. I felt if I could be the best of them all at everything, i could obtain the happiness I was missing and fill the void that had been drilled into me. I acted to solely fulfill this goal for the next two years, viewing others as only obstacles and genuine happiness as something I had to struggle for. Thankfully, I got on medication a year ago. The void of the depression vanished, but I can still remember keenly what it felt like. So to see Yuno Gasai act purely out of desire with no regard to herself or those around her felt like deja vu to me. Seeing people as merely objects, always chasing ideals, and acting on an intense desire to fulfill a sole purpose were all things I felt I shared with Yuno. The fact that she even conceded her attraction to Yuuki was shallow and she was pursuing him as a goal rather than a lover was phenomenal. In the end, her decision that Yuuki was truly a person who she had grown to love and was willing to die for (she kills herself instead of Yuuki, in case you forgot) in spite of her awful past and her likely mental illness was simply beautiful to me. I cried for about 30 mins after finishing the show.\\n\\n\r\n(((ENDING: For both non-spoiler and spoiler reviews)))\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I wrote this review because I enjoyed this show a lot. All I wanted to do in this review was entice other people to enjoy the same euphoria I experienced or to make those with negative feelings toward the show rethink their views. This show made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me think. Yuno Gasai\u2019s course of actions in relation to her personality and backstory were moving, and Yuuki and Yuno\u2019s romantic relationship has become my favorite among all anime. I love Future Diary, and I hope you do too.",

            "content": "Ever wish you had the ability to see into the future? even if it's only for 10 minutes or however long? I sure did, which made me interested in this anime.\r\nNow, I'll say I really did enjoy this anime, as it falls under my favourite genres, but let's not get into that and we shall hit the ratings now, shall we?\r\n(My second review, bare with me ;_;)\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story of Mirai Nikki is basically a survival game, you're given a diary that possesses a specific ability, maybe to see someones future? or to see what happens around you? The story is seen through the eyesof Yuki, a lonely kid that finds interest in writing what he sees around him in his diary. He believed to have two imaginary friends, Deus Ex Machina(the god of space and time) and Mur Mur, his servant. He was given a future diary, to see into the future, along with 11 other people, one of which including a friend from school Yuno(my favourite character of all time) who protects him because Yuki is a complete wimp.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll say for one, that this idea for the anime is really unique, that it was paced well, and had very strong points in terms of psychological breakdown and other things along those lines. I found episode 1 to be a bit slow, but then afterwards it just went from there, hits you with full force.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a bit half-assed though, I'll say that now, which is one of the reasons why this aspect did not get a PERFECT RATING, however the story made it very much enjoyable and I enjoyed every part of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art style of Mirai reminds me of that of Deadman Wonderland, very clean and simple, the eyes and structure and animation overall was done nicely. I didn't see very many mishaps on this end, the characters looked unique aswell, some of them a bit generic, but oh well, you really can't stop that. Landscapes and atmospheres gave off the moods of the anime right away, which was very nice.\\n\\n\r\nI had no problems with the art, and I really did enjoy it as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Whether it came from the killing of the characters, the voice actors sick laughter and the overall unsettling soundtracks, nobody will know. I loved the opening and ending soundtracks, and recently each characters themes, especially Kasugano Tsubaki - Cries of Avici. The sound effects were very well done as stated, no problems at all, I was impressed and even today, I still listen to the openings, endings, and character themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters of Mirai Nikki are all very unique, they come from all backgrounds which most of them get explained later on in the anime. The character development was very nicely done, as I said at the start, psychological breakdowns and slowly starting to break down. They did what they did and regretted and felt guilt, it wasn't like some animes where they just have a blank emotion, can't say the same for Yuno. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed all the characters, none of them were a bit of a clique, so that was nice, each of them just wants to become god to create a better life, so it's not like they're evil, but in the end, only one will survive lol.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed this anime, whether it came from the very gripping plot twisters, or the very conceptual music compositions, I enjoyed it all. I'm very glad I was able to watch this, and in my opinion it's a must watch for a fan of the genre.\\n\r\nButthurt critics, they can all go and leave, they will give this anime a low score, but rate mainstream animes 10/10, don't ask me why, biased.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to give this a 10, but some aspects could've done some refining and some work, overall though, I did enjoy it, and I recommend all of you to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nDon't take my word for it, just give an anime a shot, try to disregard reviews.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed me review.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I find myself having to rewrite my review after not getting the right impression about this series. It took me a while but I finally got my hands on the original manga for this show, and after understanding what the author really wanted to do, I find myself puzzled at how weirdly it's portrayed here.\r\nFirst off, and probably most importantly, Mirai Nikki is a psychological horror manga. The anime, on the other hand, is very action-oriented, with such an emphasis on the action that it takes away completely from the atmosphere. This is one mistake the anime made. The manga allows you to get amuch better understanding of the adrenaline rush you get from the main characters, and what makes them so interesting is your ability to relate more to their problems - their human aspects are ultimately lost in the show. This immediately takes the story down a few notches, a hindrance it absolutely cannot afford, especially when it's already sort of a jumbled mess, and especially when the pacing is totally off. \\n\r\nThe art style is very generic. At first I thought it was incredibly well done, but after reading the manga, I can't help but feel that I've seen it somewhere before. It almost seems like a carbon copy, and that's never good. Anime was designed with breathing new life in mind, and if it can't do that, it fails at being a faithful adaptation. The sound work is even worse; aside from the opening theme, it almost seems like the entire time, it's trying to confuse you. Some of the soundtrack and character voice work do build up suspense, but it turns out to be somewhat of a cheap scare as a result. They're not too keen on the uptake, either; you can instantly tell exactly what character is supposed to be doing what by their voice acting, and it all seems kinda stereotypical and bland. That said, what this anime does excel at is what its manga excelled at as well; it's a very charismatic and clever combination of things. I didn't really fall in love with the individual aspects, but I absolutely loved how it all came together. This allowed me to enjoy it probably a bit more than I thought.\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a terrible anime; if you're an absolute critic, you can tear it to shreds and absolutely hate it, but if you're looking for entertainment, this may or may not deliver what you're looking for. I'm still going to keep watching it myself.",

            "content": "I never knew about Mirai Nikki (or Future Diary if you want the english title) before my friend mentioned and I am glad he did. I am loving each episode as it passes by.\r\nStory - *Slight spoilers for Story and Character*\r\nMirai Nikki starts off about a socially awkward boy named Yukiteru Amano who uses his phone to make diary entries on the world around him, the people he notices etc. Being socially awkward, Yukiteru made friends in his mind. One being Mur Mur and the other being Deus Ex Machina (the God of Time and Space). During a conversation between Deus Ex Machina and Yukiteru,Deus makes Yukiteru's phone have future diary entries. So for example, when he finishes reading the future diary entry on his phone, the first thing it says is \"April 22, 6:59 [My Room] I hit a double bullseye at my morning dart throw. At first Yukiteru thinks he wrote all of this during his sleep, then later thinks it is all a coincidence. He is able to use his phone to know when their is an upcoming maths test and his phone has the answers to it. Anyway, to sum up the premises up for the rest of the series, Deus pits 12 random diary holders (just like Yukiteru) to play a game, where they have to kill each other. The last one standing's prize is being the successor to Deus Ex Machina of the God of Time and Space.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Bright colours, for a dark anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound -  I like the sound of Mirai Nikki, this anime knows when to play the right type of music, being it suspensful or a happy tune.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The character Yukiteru himself, is like I said before socially awkward. But he is pitted against other diary holders trying to kill each other and also him in the inclusion of that. So he has to make actions, he wouldn't normally do or say before any of this actually happened. \\n\r\nAnother character I have yet to mention, is what I believe is the main factor, the bread and butter, without this character, the show wouldn't be what it is. Her name is Gasai Yuno. Gasai Yuno is also a diary holder, but she is different from the rest. She doesn't want to kill Yukiteru, she wants to protect him at all costs. Sure that might seem all harmless and all, but she has this particular trait about her, that differentiates her from the other diary owners and side characters. She can go from sweet and cute to one crazy SOB (not like in some ecchi/rom-com animes) when it comes to protecting Yukiteru. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really love this series, pretty much all the episodes leave you on a cliffhanger and it really does grab your attention. I am not sure, you'll get what I mean from just reading my review, but I am loving this series. Can't wait for more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Even though, it is only up to episode 9, there are still 17 more episodes to go.  The character development and relationship between Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno does have you asking \"Why would she go so far to protect Yukiteru\"? It is a really gripping anime, and does take you for a suspenseful joy ride. If you enjoyed the likes of Death Note (only with the odd funny/awkward scene every now and then) then you'll without a shadow of a doubt, love Mirai Nikki. As soon as it gets released in DVD format, I will be picking it up. A perfect 10 from me.",

            "content": "[Adapted From Blog Post]\r\nCan I say something crazy? I absolutely adore the genre \"battle royal\" whether it be the movie \"Battle Royal\", the book \"The Hunger Games\", or that one video with the \"Sesame Street\" characters. I always find myself drawn to to this kind of story, that is the kind where an X number of participants are put in a remote location and are told to kill each other until one is left standing; I think they make up for thrilling stories. So you can imagine, when I find a story of this nature in anime, it pretty much goes straight onto my 'Planto Watch' list, for better or for worse. While Fate/Zero was an absolutely amazing delight, and Danganrompa...less so, where does Mirai Nikki fall in the spectrum, hit or miss? Let's say it hit the ball out of the park...and into the river. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with our main protagonist: Yuki Amano, a shy high-school kid who has a quite distinct lack of anything resembling friends. He's not bothered by this however, and instead spends his time constantly updating a diary kept on his phone, a diary that pretty much chronicles every single little thing Yuki does over the day, hour by hour. When he isn't updating his slightly creepy hobby, he talks with his imaginary friend: Deus ex Machina, the lord of time and space. Having a strangely vivid imagination, Yuki divides his time between having curiously detailed conversations with 'Deus', and building an entire timeline of his life on his phone.\\n\\n\r\n      One day however, Yuki learns that his imaginary friend Deus, is not quite a fictional as he lead himself to think. It turns out Deus is actually god, but a god with a problem, he's dying, and the time to choose a successor has come, and turns out Yuki is lucky enough to be considered for the position. Not so luckily however, Deus also informs him that the only way to succeed him as god is take part in a specially crafted death-game where himself and 11 others will battle to death for the right to become the new king of time and space. In addition, each participant in the game has been given a \"Future Diary\" a device that will tell the future; Yuki's cellphone becoming his own diary, detailing everyone happening around him...a minute or two before it actually does. Armed his this information Yuki returns to his school, waiting his moment to track down the other \"dairy users\", he soon finds out the the death battle fully intends to bring the party to him when a masked man with a knife attempts to saw his head off. He is eventually saved by a classmate named Yuno Gasai, who turns out to another dairy user in the death-match, and also completely insane. She claims to be completely in love with Yuki(even though he can only remember talking to her once), and helps fend off the attacker. Yuki, reckoning he can use her considerably more skilled knowledge of fighting to stay alive, so he plays along with her love story, though as he uncovers secrets of her past, turning and running the hell away from her seems to become the more viable option. Together the two, will need to have to outwit the other psycho-paths Deus has chosen for this game, and discover the real reason behind this death-game.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's be honest here, this is a pretty awesome set-up, and leaves room for a lot of cool ideas what with the time prediction aspect of the death-game. The first few episodes of Mirai Nikki I actually found quite intriguing and I also really liked the dark tone and gritty violence it was going for, which is something I think is often underused in anime.  Not only could I expect some cool action and entertainingly crazy characters, but the whole mystery behind why Yuno is so infatuated with Yuki was also fairly interesting.  Unfortunately, it's the manner Mirai Nikki goes to answer its questions that leads to its downfall, as well as a few other pressing problems that need to be addressed. The series has a bad habit of trying to outdo itself far too often. It'll throw plot-twists at you as the series progresses with increasingly regularity. Here's the problem with that: if you try to continually provide mind-blowing twists that change \"everything\" you only end up pushing your plot and characters to the limit, you'll end up contradicting yourself, and relying far too often on convenience.  If you want to enjoy the show, you'll need to ignore the increasingly flawed plot, as problems start pouring in as episodes continue. Of course though, the show leaves the biggest \"twist\" for the very end, which completely destroys any continuity the series had left, and is so ridiculous that its hard not to roll your eyes. \\n\\n\r\n     Also, Mirai Nikki is not one to be subtle with how dark its trying to be. It'll completely lay down horrific information with absolutely no build-up or purpose, just because its trying to shock the viewer. By the end, Mirai Nikki has brought rape, entire families being killed both on and off-screen, and murderous little children to the table, really for no reason at all, and is exasperatingly dramatic for the most part. Yeah, that dude will definitely abandon his child to die, because \"this is a dark show guys.\" Not to say the horror aspect never works, because personally Yuno has a couple scenes that freakin' terrify me, but its not enough to make up for the rest of the melodramatic crap. ...Onto the characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let's be honest here, this is a pretty awesome set-up, and leaves room for a lot of cool ideas what with the time prediction aspect of the death-game.

He starts out the series as a complete wimp, and while his gradual growth of confidence is nice, it's handled sloppily at best. The animators never really seemed to care too much about his character, and this leads to a massive personality change for him in the last third of the series, which reasoning for is extremely crude and hard to see how he got from point A to point freakin' point H so quickly. To be fair though, he's probably the most down-to-earth character here. He really gives off the impression that he's in a fight he never asked for, and especially considering how much his life starts to crumble apart during the anime, its hard not to at least respect him for how well he takes everything. Unfortunately his character is often brushed aside because the animators apparently thought we need to again see how awesome and crazy Yuno is again. Why do you think I needed to settle on a Yuno thumbnail for his review? Since the animators didn't care enough about his character to make him good, Yuno pictures were my one and only option. The hell? He's supposed to be the main character!\\n\\n\r\n  And now for the only character in this entire show that we're supposed to care about: the queen of stalking herself, Yuno Gasai. For the first half of the show, the character development she's given literally begins with she loves Yuki and ends with she's insaaaaaane. Thankfully she's given enough back-story to make her a decent character by the end, even if her reasoning for doing the things she does seems a little sketchy, though to be fair she is crazy, so I guess that's an excuse. I just can't help but feel that Yuno is just the perfect \"yandere\" that we're supposed to worship, and draws complete character attention so that everyone else in the show becomes super 1-dimensional. It's same problem shows like Sword Art Online and Gosick had, just concentrating on one character simply means that you didn't care enough about your world as a whole to make it fleshed out and interesting, which you know, sucks, and means I won't have to much to say on this next character. \\n\\n\r\n     Akise Aru is an enigmatic want-to-be detective who regards attending school with quite a bit of contempt, and prefers to spend his time solving cases. He appears later on in the show and becomes an ally of Yuki during the death-game. Besides from this though, he doesn't have a lot more to him, besides from acting mysterious and totally not like Kaworu from Evangelion. The only other personality trait he acquires would be traversing into spoiler territory, but even that is completely out of left field with its reveal, and only really serves to aid Mirai Nikki's worrying habit of digging its own grave. While he has a cool reveal at first, he quickly falls into the category of characters I would list as \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\n     The students that make up the high-school characters are fairly one-sided and boring, and the other participants of the death-game are killed practically as soon as they're introduced, but there's one more additional character I would like to touch upon briefly. Ninth is a part-time ally of Yuki and part-time terrorist participant of the death-game. She's generally likable and has some awesome moments, and ell, the anime was even kind enough to give her a decent back-story before switching instantly back to Yuno smashing someone's head open. \\n\\n\r\nFinally something positive to talk about. The soundtrack for Mirai Nikki was composed by Katsuhiko Takayama and it actually contains some bad-ass tunes, from two exceptional openings and that track above this paragraphs. It's full of those high energy action songs that really get you ready for what's to come, though if I had to add, certain tunes can be overused due to the low amount of actual music on the OST. \\n\\n\r\n     The animation was handled by Asread, and don't feel too sorry if you haven't hear them. They've only ever been credited with making 7 anime series as well as a couple OVA's, so understandably, the animation is fairly average. Oh, it's not bad, but there's never any time the animation is superb or standout moments, though they do tend to make the series's many fight scenes engaging and exciting. The character designs are a bit of a mixed bag, with some designs looking semi-realistic, but others quite literally resemble the Pillsbury dough boy. I'm not even joking. All in all though, most of them are distinctive, which is really all you can ask for, and once you see these characters again after watching the show, you should recognize them instantly. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion I'm not going to say Mirai Nikki is a good anime, or that it's even worth your time. Its great premise get completely ruined by the over-the-top plot twists and bland characters. It handles its mature themes in an immature fashion, and pretty much falls apart plot-wise by the end of it. Though if you're in the mood for a good ol' bloodbath to turn your brain off to, I'm going to not stop you.This series can be fun at times, even decent, but that quite long list of problems I mentioned above will stunt that pretty quick. Also if you don't like Yuno's character you're basically screwed enjoyment wise. Yeah. She's crazy.... and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: You'd think Deus would have saved a lot of time by just picking slips of paper out of a hat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

From a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it\u2019s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly...timey-wimey...stuff. This anime is nothing like Doctor Who, Here\u2019s The Future Diary!\r\nYukiteru Amano is a loner who never really interacts with people and prefers writing a diary on his cell phone with his only companion being an imaginary friend named Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space. However, Yuki soon learns that Deus is not a figment of his imagination when Deus makes him aparticipant in a Survival Game with other contestants, the participants are given special diaries that can predict the future with each diary having unique abilities that gives them both advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\n\r\nThe Future Diary is animated by Asread and I have to be honest here. The animation is a mixed bag. The Character designs are ok I guess The 3D Animation shortcuts look awful and the movements can look a bit cheap at times. When the plot goes balls to the wall, the animation sometimes has its highlights. the animation will vary your mileage. Asread has not done a whole lot over the years as a studio and I can\u2019t really say that Future Diary is their best show since\u2026 one, I have not seen a lot of their animation productions, and two\u2026 I stated before in my opinion that the animation is a mixed bag. However, there is a highlight... The First opening.\\n\\n\r\nNow I usually mention the soundtrack first before mentioning the opening and closing themes, a but The Future Diary is an exception. Most of you may find the first opening to be a highlight in the soundtrack and I would agree. It is pretty catchy. The first closing \u201cBlood Teller\u201d Is alright, but I sometimes skip the closing since it really doesn\u2019t click for me. Halfway through the show, Future Diary just happened to replace its catchy first opening with a second opening and I didn\u2019t like it as much, that and the song \u201cDead END\u201d was pretty average at best for an opening. As for the second closing \u201cFilament\u201d. I found myself skipping it after seeing it after a few episodes. I didn\u2019t like it that much. So...How does the soundtrack fare out. It sounded pretty average. I can\u2019t think of one theme that is worth listening to outside the show except for the first opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese casting is pretty average. Misuzu Togashi as Yuki may not be your cup of tea but it\u2019s a fitting voice considering the character. Tomosa Murata is okay as Yuno but I don\u2019t have much to add on that. I will give Future Diary some credit on the side of the Japanese casting for actually having a few seiyus that are not big names. However, there are some notable seiyus that did get to play a part here. Akira Ishida is fine as Akise and this anime also has Norio Wakamoto in it too, and he\u2019s listenable here too like most roles he has had. I don\u2019t have much to say about the Japanese Cast but I do have quite more to say about the English Dub of Future Diary. The adaptive script took major liberties with the original dialogue and I am totally okay with the adaptive script as is because not much of the context is lost in translation. As for the performances *sigh* I thougth Josh Grelle was the lowlight of the dub. This is because the original character intent of Yuki felt reduced. This is similar to his role as Armin in Attack on Titan except he played the part while the adaptive script of Attack on Titan kept most of the original character intent of Armin faithful. In regards to Future Diary, I did not care much for Josh Grelle\u2019s performance as Yuki. Brina Palencia is not a bad voice actress but I think Tomosa Murata does Yuno better. Interestingly enough, Yuno was not tinkered around much in terms of the adaptive script . There are some noteworthy voice actors in the dub such as Kent Williams who is decent here and there\u2019s Todd Haberkorn. I will admit that I think he\u2019s the highlight of the dub but in all fairness. Like the Subbed Version, I do feel that the Dub is average as well. But because of the main leads in the dub, I do prefer the Subbed Version on this one but the dub really isn\u2019t absolute shit, it\u2019s just not one of Funimation\u2019s strongest dubs since some casting choices were hit or miss, and Zach Bolton was responsible for ADR Direction here and it seems he has average dubs in his resume but Soul Eater is perhaps the best he has done with ADR Direction. Future Diary could have been fixed in a few areas if it could but it is what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Future Diary are an interesting case but first\u2026 I would like to address that I do not like Yuki. he\u2019s a pussy. Sure, I understand the fear he goes through during this whole Survival Game, but he takes a while to get used to. Oh and as development goes, it\u2019s not convincing. Yuno is\u2026 well...I don\u2019t want to bring her up. The one decency in this show is that there are a variety of characters which most of them are the participants of the Survival Game. most of the participants has their own backstory, ideals, and goals and these characters did make the ride watchable. However, the characters are one of the things that makes Future Diary a bit predictable and this is after a few instances with the Diary Users. Then there\u2019s Minene Uryuu. She is actually one character I had no major issues with. Oh, and Deus Ex Machina\u2026Where do I begin with this guy? Oh, I don\u2019t know\u2026 His full name doesn\u2019t make sense!, I think a simple Deus would suffice. I do have a problem with the characters as a whole in this show but it\u2019s not the majority of characters\u2019 fault. Oh no, This brings up the major problem I have with Future Diary.\\n\\n\r\nI could not take the plot seriously and here\u2019s why. The setup of the first episode was unplausible and when the plot goes full circle, it does not explain everything and there are some things that never get explained, leaving some plot holes that time and space cannot be altered to fix them. The Cell Phone \u201cDiaries\u201d are a bizarre plot device but assuming a god of time and space could make it possible, I suppose it makes sense, right? Oh who am I kidding. Some of the shit that this anime has makes no sense. Fortunately, this anime wasn\u2019t too boring and to be honest. I actually enjoyed it to a degree despite the completely implausible plot. But there are some moments that really come in at the wrong time. From what I can tell you without spoiling anything is that when something bad happens. there was one time where an instance of that came along and the following episode starts off with something attempting to be funny. I am actually not joking about that. This kind of directing will induce slapping or at least thoughts of such a thing and Naoto Hosoda should have known better. Oh but the bigger problem is that this show has a \u201cDEAD END\u201d, since the show is implausible with no direction. I was not surprised that the ending wouldn\u2019t redeem the show by any stretch of the imagination and it\u2019s a clusterfuck.\\n\\n\r\nThe Future Diary is available by Funimation. The Future Diary: Redial OVA was never licensed which means...no dub has been made for it. It is currently unlicensed which is a shame. The manga of the same name written by Sakae Esuno is available by Viz Media after Tokyopop went under.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said and done, The Future Diary was an amusing series with or without direction but it ends up being not as fun later on and it gets to a dead end. And  I don\u2019t regret using that pun. It\u2019s animation is a mixed bag, the soundtrack is average, the characters are what made this amusing at first but the story is a complete bloody mess.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I give The Future Diary a 4 out of 10, it is NOT REALLY GOOD!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Diary - Earthdate: February 14, 2015. Supplemental Review: Future Diary: Redial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Future Diary: Redial OVA is actually made as an epilogue to the show which was left open. The animation looks somewhat improved, nothing\u2019s different with the characters or the soundtrack. The plot to Future Diary: Redial is also implausible and I don\u2019t care to explain it because I did not like the epilogue\u2019s ending to it either and I\u2019m glad i\u2019m done with it.",

            "content": "This review contains mild spoilers.\r\nIt's hard to bring up Mirai Nikki without mentioning how great its premise sounds on paper. A survival game between twelve diary users, all with different motivations and reasons, to overwrite the future and survive a thrilling game of wits, courage and luck. It's an excellent premise, but also tried and done to death (especially in recent years, thanks to the Hunger Games movies/novels).\r\nWhat often tends to be a deciding factor in them is how to make characters feel human, their panic and sense of calm in between feel real, and well...just not feel too extreme, really. A basic understanding ofhuman psychology is required to capture that, and it requires a lot of solid character writing to accomplish that.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there is also the (arguably) equally important plot armor aspect. A lot of what makes survival games so intense and thrilling to sit through is the unpredictability of what happens next. However, that can be sacrificed if the actual show has a script solid enough to carry through and excuse all the questionable incidents that occur over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki fails in every single way, and it is easily among the most anti-climactic series I've ever seen. The script mocks me constantly for taking it seriously, yet takes itself more seriously than it can ever dream of being self-aware of.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline goes nowhere past the basic premise, and there is no theme whatsoever to think about. The show pretends that there is the whole theme about \"being able to dream of future and fight for it\" and all that, but honestly, the show never foreshadows that theme til very late onto the show, as well as the ending, well, pretty much contradicting that.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention how much plot armor this show has? No seriously, any situation Yuki and Yuno are put into they manage to walk out of with little to no harm, and there is no real suspense once you realize that there is a particular formula which is pretty much that Yuno and Yuki come across one of the other twelve, that person either pretends to be an ally or becomes an enemy (don't expect any reasonable explanation either) and then they defeat that person only for a period of calm to come and then the cycle repeats itself again.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this show is in some ways the worst thing a survival game should be. It's predictable, formulaic, the script is a walking joke and the characters are equipped with enough plot armor that can make Ichigo from Bleach blush. The worst thing is that this show has absolutely no idea how to balance its quiet moments with its hectic ones, with the quiet moments coming off as forced or too quiet, and its hectic ones coming off as extremely over-the-top and silly.\\n\\n\r\nI also need to mention just how bad the script feels. It's bloody ridiculous, and some of what is permissible in this show can break any sane person's sense of disbelief. A terrorist blows up the school bit by bit and the show tells you that she is a terrorist with no real care for a human's life. Why? Just because. Why didn't she just blow up the whole school? A little kid tries to kill Yuno and Yuki with poison gas. Where did he get the poison gas? Who sold him the poison gas? Don't know? I don't think the show does either. I can go on and on, but I really don't want to spoil the entire show. Honestly props to anyone who somehow managed to suspend their disbelief for all this, it takes a lot to be able to manage that with a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the characters. Where do I even start? They behave irrationally, act like a pack of immature brats who can't fight their way out of a paper bag one moment and suddenly can do complete and utter miracles the next. There is so much inconsistency in their behavior that I'm not even sure they even can be considered \"characters\".\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are especially guilty of this. Yuki changes personalities to be whatever the plot demands him to be. He is normally a coward and a wimp, but you'd never guess that if you watched clips of his clashes with the various diary users over the course of the show. He is a wimp in the quiet moments of the show but becomes a complete badass when the plot demands it, and can throw darts with a surprising level of accuracy (which admittedly is foreshadowed early on). No matter how good you are at throwing darts, they can't be the Deus Ex Machina solution when all else fails. \\n\\n\r\nYuno is no better, with her character being foreshadowed to simply having a crush on Yuki then later turning to be a complete and utter maniac who kills people for fun and games, simply because it makes the show more marketable and easy for people to not get bored. To be fair, she is entertaining (and the main reason I finished the show) but I'm not entirely sure that it's for the reasons the writer planned her to be. She changes personalities off the drop of a coin and her monologues boil down to \"this person looked at Yuki, I must kill them\" and \"this person is dangerous to Yuki, I must kill him\". She is completely defined by her relationship with Yuki, and as such never once feels like an actual character. The show does attempt to explain this and fails miserably, coming off as incredibly edgy and laughable at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters vary wildly, with most of them being every bit as stupid as our main duo, and others being pretty decent. I kind of like the detective in particular, his motivation was really easy to sympathize with and he is also the only person who was talking sense in the show. I could go on about other examples but I really don't want to spoil the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nA special mention needs to be addressed about how women are treated in this show, however. Every single woman in this show is sexually abused or raped, sometimes both, and there is literally no special thought put into making this work or its psychological consequences. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, it's like the writer and the publishing company were thinking to themselves about how to give the female characters the harshest and most edgy back story possible, and they kept seeing rape and sexual abuse as the answer. It's absolutely disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is unremarkable at best, with some very strange tracks being put in the wrong time, sound effects being poorly implemented and the voice acting sounding poor and inconsistent, with a lot of strange noises that actually made me laugh whenever a character is dying or put into any danger.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is alright but nothing particularly remarkable to look at, with backgrounds looking really bland and the entire show looking as though everything is in a darker color simply because they wanted to make the show look dark, but coming off as incredibly edgy and (maybe I have bad eyes or something, I don't know) but I could swear that the character designs have this dark shade that is pretty nasty to look at. Seriously, why do that?\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people like Mirai Nikki. I kind of admire them for that, since there is so much that the show does wrong in my eyes that I found myself struggling to watch episode to episode. The story is stupid, the characters inconsistent and the themes non-existent.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't recommend this show, just watch the Fate series, read/watch the Hunger Games and read Battle Royale. I can assure you it's a better use of your time than this show if you're looking for some survival games. I'm not saying any of them are perfect, but they're way more satisfying to watch than this show.",

            "content": "A MONTH BEFORE THE GAME STARTED-\r\nI was handed a Diary by a tiny girl named Mur Mur. The 'Reviewer's Diary'. In this survival game, I'm the 13th Diary holder. I think I have the \"weakest\" diary out of all the other diary holders. \r\nThis \"Diary\" of mine automatically writes out my thoughts and comments while watching the anime, Mirai Nikki.\r\nDiary Entry #1 (1/5/13) 11:24 AM\r\n========================\r\nBased on the Sypnosis, Mirai Nikki is a psychological thriller, based on the manga written and illustrated by Sakae Esuno, is about Yuki, a loner who's not very good with people. He prefers to write a diary on his cell phoneand talk to his imaginary friend, Deus Ex Machina \u2013 The God of Time and Space. However, Yuki soon learns that Deus is more than a figment of his imagination when he makes Yuki participate in a battle royale with \"TWELVE\" others. The contestants are given special diaries that can predict the future, each diary possessing unique features that give it both advantages and disadvantages. Within the next 90 days, the contestants must try to survive until there is only one left standing. The winner will become the new God of Time and Space.\\n\\n\r\nDiary Entry #2 (1/7/13) 3:52 PM\\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nMirai Nikki premise is pretty unique, I'll have to admit. \\n\r\nThe first episode was good. \\n\r\nIt got me hooked almost instantly.\\n\r\nAfter the first few episodes, Mirai Nikki starts becoming stale.\\n\r\nMirai Nikki's graphics are pretty nice though; nice backgrounds, decent visuals\\n\\n\r\nDiary Entry #3 (1/9/13) 4:21 AM\\n\r\n========================\\n\r\nGOOD LORD, Gasai Yuno. I thought she was one nice, sweetheart at first, but then turns out she's one crazy, Yukiteru-stalking, psychopath. She's only 14 years old, but to me she looks like a 16-17 year old. Whats with her over-developed body?\\n\r\nAnd, Amano Yukiteru, why are you such a coward? You can't have a girl like Yuno protecting your butt everytime you're attacked by another Diary Holder. Geez. Probably the first protagonist I don't like in an anime.\\n\r\nEpisodes are getting progressively becoming dull too.\\n\r\n\"Blood Teller\" by Faylan is a really nice song to listen to! INSTA-favourite ED of the week or month.\\n\\n\r\nDiary Entry #4 (1/10/13) 2:23 AM\\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nI'm starting to feel awfully bored in the middle of series.\\n\r\nSeries is starting to introduce more Diary Holders; but most of them are annoying as hell. Though, it was fun watching them fight, while I was hiding in the background.\\n\\n\r\nDiary Entry #5 (1/11/13) 9:37 AM\\n\r\n=======================\\n\r\nManaged to complete (barely) the anime!\\n\r\nThe ending was absolute meh.\\n\r\nWhat's with the Dragonball-like fight in the few episodes, couldn't stop laughing at that part.\\n\r\nHmmm...I'm getting this feeling that someone stalking me...\\n\\n\r\nDiary Entry #6 (1/12/13) 10:00 AM\\n\r\n======================\\n\r\nDEAD END\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so please go gentle on me (>^.^)>\r\nThis review will contain some minor spoilers, so please beware.\r\nI'm a big fan of this anime, but I'll try to give an unbiased review and will look at the positives and negatives.\r\nI haven't watched that many animes so I may not be able to dig up on some topics/criticism.\r\nNow, lets get onto the actual review :D\r\nMirai Nikki was an anime that is based around survival, deception and trust, it has many plot twists throughout the 26 episodes, with the characters often deceiving the main characters (Yuno Gasai and Yukiteru Amano) which  gives asense of unpredictability and not knowing which characters are good or bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is one of the most original I've seen, it is full of plot twists as I stated earlier, and keeps the viewer engaged in the show. It revolves around the idea of \"Kill or be killed\" and \"survival of the fittest\" which develops into a much more complex story line towards the end of the anime, leaving many questions unanswered and many plot holes. Overall, the story was good and original, with plot twists however, it also has many plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was fluid and the art was good, nothing else to be said here :| \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, the music fitted each scene and created a sense of tension in the anime, once again, nothing more to say :|\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were either over-baked or cliches, regardless, they were very interesting and unpredictable to a degree, Yuno was probably the most interesting to watch,with her yandere personality often making her hard to predict. Tsubaki's real nature was a big shock to me, and that shows how deceptive and twisted this show can be. 5th wasn't the best choice of character, a 5 year old murderer doesn't really add a sense of realism, rather the opposite - A sense of fantasy, although then again, this is anime, not real life. \\n\r\nYuki is a weak-minded male lead, who thinks a thousand times before doing anything and often panics quickly, accompanied with Yuno, his \"Stalker\"who is obsessed with Yuki and will protect him at ALL costs.\\n\r\n9th was one of my favorites, she had an original character, was quick witted and unpredictable. She played a significant role towards the end.\\n\r\nOverall, the characters had original personalities with different back stories, some characters were cliches or over-baked, nonetheless they were good.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed mirai nikki and it is one of my favorites, I recommend it to anyone that enjoys: Romance, action, blood, dark fantasy and psychological thrillers. \\n\r\nOverall my personal rating of mirai nikki is a 10/10 however for the purpose of this review and not solely being about my enjoyment, I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Panda \\n",

            "content": "You want to know the truth about Mirai Nikki\r\nIT SUCKS\r\nNow of course that won't do so now I have to explain in great detail why it sucks which trust me won't be fun, but the people need to hear the truth. I'm not too impressed with the current reviews of this show on MAL mostly because THEY ARE NOT REVIEWS, THEY ARE FANBOY/GIRL RANTS. A review should be analytical and look from a CRITICAL standpoint. True as a flawed being I am unable to bypass my bias but at least actually i'll try.\r\nMirai Nikki/Future diary is a psychological thriller.... appaently. But its also a romance,action, horror and fantasy show. Since words can't really define it i'll move on to the categories.\\n\\n\r\nStory-When I review anything that is a story in any regard I generally judge the storytelling itself by three categories. These categories are Premise which is the concept and basic plot outline, the execution which is how each part of the plot was handled and finally the pacing which is how these parts fit together and how natural the progression felt. Mirai Nikki's premise is actually not bad, its certainly not original but it could have worked MUCH better than it did(which is still not very good) if it had not completely fucked up everything else in the most spectacular way possible. The show starts off decently with the concept of these 'future diaries' being introduced but instead of explaining them and how they work the show immidiately throws you into a cascade of bullshit.\\n\\n\r\n Mirai Nikki is horrendously cliche while at the same time making no sense. The show dosen't have plot holes as some say, it IS a plot hole.  The concept of telling the future already opens up lots of room for narrative fuck ups but the show also breaks basic logic almost consistently just so it can appear more 'dark' and 'daring'. This is why Mirai Nikki shoots itself in the foot, it tries to be mature by adding in lots of gore and crazy twists but ends up going the other way and feeling ridiculous because of how little sense it makes and ultimately feels childish and stupid. The pacing is breakneck and never slows down apart from pointless filler episodes that add nothing and just kill any tension that would be there in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n The romance aspect fails because it STILL feels shoehorned in despite being a major plot point and because the characters(who we'll get to later) are annoying and don't make a good couple. As for the thriller aspect and the future diary concept itself, well it could have been cool but it tried way too hard to make the audience take it seriously despite it not being very original, interesting or thrilling at all. It tried a 'Death note' approach of mixing supernatural powers and mind games but for some reason forgot that it wasn't as smart or well written as that show and just made all its characters seem like complete morons(moreso than they already are). The ending to the show is horrible and unsatisfiying while the ending to the OVA is ridiculous and contrived so its a lose-lose there. In terms of themes obviously there's not much to say except that this show handled sensitive topics like rape and abuse with all the care and subtlety of a bull in a fucking china shop and at times came off as either disgusting, exploitative or offensive rather than just edgy bullshit thrown in to hold the interest of people watching this train wreck.\\n\\n\r\nScore-2,5/10 Stupid, contrived, ridiculous, nonsensical and at times offensive \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-You'd think that after bashing the general plot so much that would be my least favourite aspect but no somehow prehaps by the gods of awful writing this show has characters so laughably bad it even overshadows the godawful plot. All the character are given one note personalities and often ridiculous, overblown defining traits so the show can continue to shove logic up its ass and blow shit up for the sake of encapsulating more mindless casuals in its insanity. Characterization for most of the diary holders(who are the main focus character-wise) is limited to a short backstory which makes us either feel sorry for them or hate them depending on what one dimensional hack is getting 2 minutes of backstory in the middle of a episode because PLOT CONVINENCE and gives them a motivation before they are killed by the main characters. So you'd think aside from the 10+ other diary holders there would be some good development for the main two characters Yuki and Yuno right? NOPE.\\n\\n\r\n Yukiteru is basically hack Shinji Ikari in that he is a similar archetype but isn't explored in enough depth and has all of Shinji's undesirable traits magnified by 1000. Aside from being annoying he gets no real development and dosen't really do anything meaningful in the story. And now for everyone's favorite yandere, Gasai Yuno!.... is a godawful character. Many find her crazy actions fun and exciting but in my opinion its creepy and she really isn't well developed or believable, and even if she was entertaining to watch you shouldn't force yourself through a show for one character and if you do you have low standards and would probably like this show anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-1.6/10 Cliche, one note, underdeveloped, annoying and sometimes creepy(not in a good way)\\n\\n\r\nArt-The artstyle is very bland and dosen't help the series stand out in any way, there's too many bright colours and it ends up looking like a mashed fruit bowl and dosen't fit the supposedly dark tone the series is trying to give off(key word being 'trying'). The character designs are cartoony and undistinct and none really stand out. Its pretty standard stuff, weird hair colours+large crazy eyes which I guess fits but seeing how bland the characters were anyway it only makes them blander. Some of the character designs are totally ridculous and goofy which once again you'd think might fit seeing as how silly the series is but then you remeber its actually trying to take itself seriously, FAIL.You'd think the series would have really good animation to show off all its fight scenes and gore but its kind of underwhelming. The animation in the opening sequences is pretty cool and unique though the way it presents itself is slightly pretentious considering how bland and uninteresting the rest of the animation was. I always consider animation to be less important than story and characters so therre's not much to say unless its good or it fits the series, in this case it is neither\\n\r\nAnimation-5.2/10 BLAND\\n\\n\r\nSound-Well as for the music it can be summed up in a similar way to the story in that it tries to create a creepy and disturbing atmosphere and as music alone its not that bad. Its mostly techno/electronic with some more experimental flashes here and there and also synth strings and the like to build tension and some piano when the plot is trying to be emotional. It would fit the tone of the show well if the show itself knew what tone it actually had and on top of that none of the tracks stand out or are that well composed. Even if the series had been better the OST is rather cliche and typical of modern thriller anime. Special mention must go however to the first opening song which is FUCKING AMAZING, the song is easily the best attached to the series and really gets you hyped(even if it is for nothing).\\n\\n\r\n The voice acting in Japanese is decent as Japanese dubs are rarely terrible but nothing stood out and the actors sounded either bored or overacted the scenes but seeing as what they had to work with I really acn't blame them. Also, Yuno's seiyuu got annoying very quickly but the constant screams of \"YUKIII\" in the script are probably to blame for that. I must admit that I have not seen the English dub but quite frankly I really don't want to as 1.I don't wanna sit through this mess again and 2. Even fans of the show hold it to be godawful and judging by their standards on things my reaction to it may be enough to crush my jaded, snobbish mind for good. Just be thankful I haven't so I still exist to write this review and don't give the sound a lower score\\n\r\nSound 4.8/10 MOSTLY BECAUSE OF OPENING 1, bland OST and acting everywhere \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-For some anime fans, watching this trainwreck may actually be an enjoyable experience as it has plenty of action and twists to keep people who are capable of turning their brain off(or don't have one to begin with) entertained. Unfortunately if I turned my brain off I would cease to be so for anyone who isn't capable of this the show will almost constantly piss you off and make you feel dirty and be generally not a positive experience especially if you favour substance, good writing and subtlety over shock value. If you base enjoyment on getting cheap thrills, shocks and favour spectacle and scale over substance then you might actually enjoy it. Keep in mind that this is not praise for the show but merely my explanation as to its popularity and NOT how I believe one should judge a show. \\n\r\nEnjoyment 2.0/10 since I have to base it on my own enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nFinal scores\\n\r\nONS(Overall narrative score, Story+Characters/2)=2.05 Grade: F\\n\r\nOAS(Overall aesthetic score, Art+Sound/2)=5.00 Grade: D\\n\r\nOFS(Overall final score, average of all categories)=3.22 Grade: E\\n\\n\r\nConclusion-If I had to describe Mirai Nikki in one word it would be clusterfuck, it tried its hand at so much random shit and not only failed at pulling that off but also managed to fuck up each individual aspect and is a disgusting trainwreck of edgy bullshit.\\n\\n\r\n If you are entertained by shallow nonsense of this kind then feel free to rage at me all you want. I just think MAL reviewers need to be more critical when reviewing their favourite shows otherwise it becomes a fanboy rant/gush site rather than a legitmate place to find people's critical opinions on anime.",

            "content": "The future holds many surprises for us. At least for our main character Amano Yukiteru who has been caught up in a battle royale game including 11 other people for the purpose of becoming the next God over time and space. He was given a cellphone which updates his future entries for his diary and makes it a future diary for him to use in the game. \r\nAs one can see, the scores and reviews for this anime varies a lot. Some people can't stand it while others, like myself, absolutely love the series. \r\nStory (10): Battle royales aren't anything new. But Mirai Nikki makesthis much more interesting by giving all players in the game a future diary which can predict the future and makes it possible for all the players to change their future and put a - DEAD END - flag on another person. This is what makes Mirai Nikki so great. You never know what will happen or what to expect. \\n\\n\r\nThat aside, the story revolving the extremly yandere Yuno, the second main character, who we don't know who she is, where she's from or what she's thinking, builds up a lot of suspicion around her and makes the series even more thrilling to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8): The art is great. They've paid much attention to the details. There's a lot of fighting going on in the series and they've managed to make the art for that really good. Form, color, details... everything's great, BUT, the reason why I didn't give it a full 10 is for one reason. The sizes of the characters, weather it's their boobs, height, butt or whatever, they change from episode from episode. That was the only less good thing. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10): Both openings (Kuusou Mesorogiwi and Dead End) were well done. They chose the music wisley for the openings. I actually felt like I was going psycho myself after hearing Kuusou Mesorogiwi. o_O \\n\r\nAfter every episode there is an ending too. And the endings kept the exciting, suspicious feeling you've had while watching the episode. Some endings are like a cock block after an episode but that wasn't the fact for Mirai Nikki. Other than that the sound really fits for the anime. The tension builds up even more with the music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): All characters were well thought out, well done and had strong personalities. Some were annoying, some were horrifyingly scary, some were hilarious. The strong varieties of personalities, the details and all background stories for every character made them feel alive. You have some kind of hate and love relationship to all of them. Sometimes Yuno was adorable and sometimes her psycho-mode hit and she became frightening. The only character that both I and others were annoyed of was... Yukiteru, the main character. But not only he developed, all of them did. Great job!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (10): This is a thrilling, frightening, well thought out and pcychologial anime at its best. The story develops into something you never could imagine, making you stand at the tip of your toes all the time. The cliffhangers, the surprises and the revelations. I just have one word to say. Wow.",

            "content": "First of all, if you dont like any gore and bloody scenes you better find another anime, because this anime is not for you. Just find any ecchi anime or another H anime.\r\nand another things, i really bad with the words, so i didnt think it would present how i love this anime was. \r\nOk, lets begin the review. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story involves about a boy, his name is Yuki. He is a bystander, and always write something that happen to him in his diary. and his life changed when his \"imaginary friends\" Deus ex Machina calling him for playing \"games\" or we can callit survival game, the person who last standing will be a god of time and space. and not just that, his phone diary become a future diary which can tells him what happen in the future, and his adventure began more complicated when a girl named Gasai Yuno appears and helped him.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this story is incredibly amazing, you will have a lot of twist that makes you think \"Oh, i dont know it would be happen\". and since this story focuses on Yuki and Yuno, you will see the development between two of them, from wimp into a real man, and what i love from this show is the weird romance between two of them, a tsundere girl and a wimp man. its truly interesting. and i must say, the \"twist\"  and \"weird romance\" in this show are the strong points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nAgain, i must say. Fabolous, beautiful, gorgeus, and epic. that what can i said. the artwork in this anime is suprisingly amazing. From the character into the environment is absolutely beautiful. Especially the character, the character in this anime is so well made, i cant help myself to love the female character in this anime especially Yuno. lol\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the opening songs and the ending is truly remarkable, well, i really really love the opening and the ending even i buy the soundtracks! i just love this OST, it gives you thrilling and  it goes well with the anime. and really perfectly fits with the story. and if you had finished watching this, i think you will know the meaning for this opening (when there is Yuno killing herself). oh and seiyuu itself, really doing well. it goes along with each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nHere are the strongest point of this anime, the character. the MC alias Yuki, is truly a wimp. he will easily scared. for me, this actually what we call REAL. there is absolutely no one except psychopath who didnt scare when seeing someone died in front of him or bombs ? he is still 14 years old ! i think i am gonna scared too if that happen to me. and for Yuno, i think she is perfectly fine. with the tsundere role.  pretty but suprisingly dangerous. and for other characters, they are so many characteristic characters appears, like police, terrorist, even government. its truly fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime so much. unique story and the thriling are so real. i couldnt have any words to describe how epic this anime was. you should watching this anime especially when you're looking for an anime that makes you mindblown. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll be VERY honest.\r\nThis is probably the first anime that I've been blown away by.\r\nIt left be in a state of depression when I finished it because it was over...\r\nSo I had to rewatch it over and over again. Then afterwards I couldn't ever be content with an anime again without thinking \"Wow... Mirai Nikki was so much better...\"\r\nI may be exaggerating, but it's my opinion. This anime was just my perfect cup of tea!\r\nWARNING: I CANNOT GUARANTEE SPOILER FREE\r\n(I'm sorry it's so hard not to give away the story when talking about this anime!)\r\n--\r\nStory\r\nThe story goes to tell you about what happens in thissurvival game and you get to meet all the people in the game. You get to know everyone pretty well and learn their past history (apart from 1 person, but he wasn't that important). So when you see how everything links together, it becomes a really exciting story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is a beautiful balance between how much is focused on the main characters and how much is focused on side characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a nice balance of serious parts and the little drops of humour so it isn't so heavy on the story.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some err ecchi parts, so if you don't deal well with it, I recommend skipping it. It can easily be ignored if you want.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it isn't perfect.\\n\r\nThere was one episode which had a MASSIVE section of two people having this game of hide and seek in a house. (I mean there was more to it, but it was just a boring chase scene) So I just skipped that part.\\n\r\nAlso there were parts in this anime where I felt like it was just SO unneeded and rather pointless.\\n\r\nBUT. Then it helped to build up the next part and so on and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is mainly a give and take game.\\n\r\nIt provides you with so many thrills and then every now and again you have to give back a little patience and time and then you're rewarded with a thrill!\\n\\n\r\nThe ending left me speechless... I think that's all I got to say for that...\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAnimation was very well done!\\n\r\nIt was dynamic and story especially in the fight scenes.\\n\r\nFacial expressions were done really well, and it helped to show the strong emotions!\\n\\n\r\nDesigns were done well and I haven't a problem with any of the art.\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice acting was really good in my opinion, though every now and again Yuki's voice did annoy me slightly that it sounded slightly too girly, but other than that I haven't a problem with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects were hit and miss. Mainly hit, but some of them sounded a little cheesy and cheap.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st and 2nd opening and the 1st ending are really good in my opinion.\\n\r\nI really love them~! As for the 2nd ending, I wasn't such a fan...\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nPeople may complain that too many of them are psychopaths but I think that's the point of this story.\\n\r\nPersonally I really liked them, and there was a nice balance of them all.\\n\\n\r\nI like how I felt I had this love/hate relationship with Yuno, I thought that was really good.\\n\\n\r\nI wished there was more of 10th in the anime though, when he appeared I thought he'd be the weird/funny/scary bad guy, but he didn't get that much in the story to do.\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\nOverall I REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoyed this.\\n\r\nI hope you do too!\\n\r\n It's such a brilliant anime and it needs more recognition!",

( including the OVA ) However what makes this anime ultimately unique are the ranges of characters and the concept of future diaries. \r\nIt follows Amano Yukiteru; a lonely solitary boy who writes in his diary day after day, consoling himself into a world he created by his imagination. There off the survival game starts, and the contestants true colors start to show. I would definitely recommend this to people who like action anime, as it has so many plot twists throughout the show. \r\nOverall I give this anime a 9 asit was an amazing plot and outstanding character development, I also immensely enjoyed the show, it's a great watch!",

            "content": "When I first heard Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) appears estimate that this anime tells the arrival of someone from the future and provide records to the protagonists of future disasters and prevent disaster or simply like the anime \"Steins; Gate\". But while watching it all the estimates were wrong because Mirai Nikki (fuure diary) the theme of a different, more creative, more curious, more interesting and arguably even more thrilling and full of emotion. Sometimes there are good stories, sometimes there are stories poignant, sometimes annoying and sometimes there is a story of regret..\r\nCan I say Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) is a very interesting anime,the author has an incredible imagination in which many young people today to write a diary in Phone. Seeing this situation the author gives a different impression in which the diary was turned into a diary that can predict what will happen in the future according to what is usually written by the user. The more interesting part of this anime is a competition where competition is eliminated fellow users and the winner will be able to realize all that God desires. But the story is not that easy, pull all the users have a different diary so as not to know the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy. Because of this Mirai Nikki interesting, the story is not predictable, there is always a new story, a lot of surprises and always make a curious.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThis story is not simple, always interesting change in the direction in which we demonstrated in the early episodes of bystander boy whose lives are only concerned with his self and ignoring the situation around, but when he gets Mirai Nikki his life changed drastically would not want him to fight if not then he will die.\\n\\n\r\nFull of emotional stories, because the audience will be confronted with the background story of each character and why they wanted to be God. Starting from Yukiteru (the protagonist) who want to God because he wanted to revive his parents. Yuno who want to be a companion Yukiteru (the protagonist) because he was the only person who understands the situation and want to be a companion of her life. Keigo's detective who wants to heal his son. Marco who want happy Ai because he promised to always live happily together. The mother (Kamado) who want to see their children happy. John (mayor) who just want power. Minene (terrorists) who want justice by her self. Tsubaki (astrologer) who wants to turn back her happiness.\\n\r\nThe story is full of mystery as a puzzle start coming Yuno who suddenly came Yukiteru and said that she is the savior. Not only that but also the mystery of who the opponents are and who our allies because here Yukiteru actually made the audience was definitely confused and wondered what would happen next. The story becomes very interesting when all the contestants pursue Yukiteru, because these circumstances he became hostile to all men and just trust Yuno because only she who is always at his side and always helpful. When in the middle episode we'll be hating the protagonist (Yukitru and Yuno) because they killed all the people and betrayed their friend, but apparently this is where the psychology that we are given a choice between \"Drop\" or \"Watch\" drop if we include those less patient, but if we Watch it we are people curious. We will be satisfied when the last episode and then we can make a conclusion of this story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIncluding the design of \"Dark\" because there are so many massacres, broken arms, a severed head and the wound is not natural but unfortunate lack of added effect of graphics so the picture looks just plain awful and less when it is Dark Anime. When talking about the character designs, there is no difference to most anime. Here that stands out is the design of the nature of God and the world will be destroyed. One again the greatness of the graphic art of the surprise appearance of the characters that the audience is not ready to be surprised, but to make a picture like this required precision of timing, circumstances and the picture of a different character for example is when the Yukiteru opens a secret roomYuno and Yukiteru was surprised because there is a skull and suddenly Yuno emerge from the side of the protagonist's face with a sinister figure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nWhat I like about the character here is that they are human figures today. If in most anime characters are always a perfect imaging from a strong, protective, romantic and intelligent. But at Mirai Nikki all the characters are human figures in today's start of a bystander Yukiteru obvious nowadays many people are only concerned with themself. Yandere Yuno that figure or in the language of psychology \"psychopath\" are like that because she was tortured during his lifetime and not have compassion. Minenen who want independence according to her. Keigo is only pursuing a career and rank. John is greedy. Marco is willing to die for Ai. And Kamado who sacrifice everything for their children. I'm sure the author did research before deciding to make a character like this\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nBut if we continue to watch this anime then this character will have evolved so that the audience did not feel bored. Yukiteru finally decided to become a fighter because of circumstances and environment, and eventually he became an adult figure. Minene who decided to become a good person and a family\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDuring watching this anime, I kept asking myself why this and why thath. It turned out that the author managed to make me curious until I can not wait for every Monday. Actually I do not like gore and violence, and this anime a lot of people die not fair but this animie always makes me curious inevitably forced to see the cruelty Yukiteru and Yuno but luckily it all ended happily be at least able to pay off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall success of the anime genre psychology, mystery and thriller. Anime is not for kids, but for those who are prepared mentally and anime lovers of mystery. Hopefully you are not disappointed when watching it ^ _ ^\\n",

There's a lot of violence but not in an excessive way and the story constantly keeps you on your toes with no boring bits. The characters (though crazy) are memorable and intriguing. \r\nFor me, Yuno's yandere character especially hit the spot. Her obsessive love for Yuuki is both disturbing AND kind of sweet...which is all the more satisfying when that love is somehow returned. I won't spoil any of the plot but therelationship development between Yuno and Yuki was one of the major reasons why I like the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is fast paced and visually stimulating in a Battle Royale/Hunger Games-esque way...so much that you won't have time to get bored. You really need to watch it to understand which is why I recommend it to everyone!",

            "content": "This will contain two reviews, a quick-short one without any spoilers, followed by an in depth one with some minor spoilers. Any major spoilers will be marked again.\r\nShort Review (No Spoilers)\r\n  Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary) incorporates several different genres, the more prominent ones being psychological thriller, romance, and comedy. If one or more of those categories interests you this anime is undoubtedly worth at least giving a shot, as it's only 26 episodes - not a huge time commitment. The most important factor I would recommend using to gauge if this anime is for you, is how serious you want to take things.While the main plot it's self is very serious, comedic relief is used very frequently to contrast from the darker things happening. To some, this mixture of comedy and thriller will be very entertaining, however to others it may come across nonsensical. I personally strongly disagree with the view point of the later, that mixing comedy and thriller does not work, especially when those same people praise death note and seem to ignore that L was, in many aspects, a comedic relief character. Ultimately, you owe it to yourself to watch and decide for yourself. For the sake of this review I give it an 8, because it isn't perfect, but to me personally (and most people who enjoyed it) it's an easy 9 or 10. THE OVA IS A MUST WATCH, after having finished the original 26 episodes. It is essentially a 27th episode extension providing further closure and an ending similar to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nLong Review (minor spoilers throughout, bigger spoilers marked)\\n\r\n  Mirai Nikki has two major points of appeal, one being the psychological thrill/suspense provided by the main plot and the character Yuno Gossai, and the other being romance. If you have seen and enjoyed Death Note, Akami Ga Kill!, and/or Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, I would further recommend Mirrai Nikki for having similar themes, dark tones, and points of appeal. To most fans, Yuno Gossai is the main reason to enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\n  Plot: After the first watch through, I found the enjoyment moderate with most of my entertainment coming from Yuno's character unfolding, and comedic relief used throughout. I was unsure about the plot, mainly because I hate how reliant modern society is on cell phones, and cell phones are a big part of the story. However certain aspects of the story seemed contradictory to me and I thought created plot holes. After a second watch through I was far more impressed with the plot however, and found answers to all serious things I considered to be plot holes. Paying close attention to dates/times/messages on your first watch through may prevent you from encountering some of my initial confusion, however two watch throughs may be needed to fully understand the story/timeline. --[[ (HUGE SPOILER): The very first scenes of the first episode provide MASSIVE insight/hints to several questions raised throughout the show, as well as insight into the ending. While this is not an outright spoiler, it provides you with the tools to infer some of the biggest ones, so I felt it should be marked. To me this also reflects the quality of writing, that something so profound is displayed as the very first scene, but does not make complete sense until the end. ]]--\\n\\n\r\n  Characters: There were some exceptional characters, as well as some average characters. I was not disappointed with this, as the most relevant characters are given enough depth and insight to appreciate their motives, using flashbacks when necessary. Not everyone is given a whole lot of depth however, which makes sense. Some characters simply have a small role to play, and any further insight into them than was provided would of been a waste of time to me, given their relatively small role. There are also some characters that may turn away some more serious-minded viewers I.E; --[[ (HUGE SPOILER): One of the diary users is a five year old prodigy, having the intellect of an adult but the maturity of a child. ]]-- As I said above though, if you end up enjoying the show it will most likely be on account of Yuno, and the depth/backround provided on her leaves little to nothing to be desired.\\n\\n\r\n  Notable Pros (in my opinion): Yuno. Yuno. And once more, Yuno. The plot is fairly good, with the ending wrapping it all together nicely, and there is plenty of comedy, cute moments, and a bit of romance. Decent soundtrack to accompany scenes, and especially good OPs.\\n\\n\r\n  Notable Cons (in my opinion): . Mirai Nikki had one big drawback for me; the nudity. While the nudity isn't extremely heavy in this anime (couple boob shots), and nudity in it's self doesn't bother me unless over used, the circumstances surrounding the nudity in Mirai Nikki made it extremely uncomfortable to me, because it is usually a 14/15 year old girl. To younger audiences, or those raised in different cultures, this may not be such a big deal. I could of gone without that aspect personally however. Also, to me the first two episodes were a little slow, however it picked up pretty quick and this issue was overcome.",

I actually started reading and finished the manga a couple nights later.\r\nThe story is fairly unique for me in that there are no other anime's that come to mind that uses a game based on forms of \"diaries\".  \r\nThe art is extremely well done and I feel it really helps bring the story to life.\r\nThe Opening and Endings are also very well done with songs that complement to the theme of the anime.\r\nAs for characters, I reallylike how they develop the characters in the animation and excellent voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel this anime really does the manga Justice.  It brings the story to life and all the elements from the animationto voice acting to OP and ED, etc really help make this anime stand out from others. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"-insert touching quote from Mirai Nikki-\"\r\nAlright, before I begin. . . if you don't like slightly messed up things. . .Well, more like very messed up . . Actually, extremely messed up, then you won't like this anime at all. I recommend you go back to whatever shoujo or shounen anime you were watching. However, if you do like that kind of messed up, common-sense defying, bloody as hell anime, then this is for you.\r\n- there are no spoilers, more like my personal opinion on everything. -\r\n-\r\nStory: Let me blunt- even if i gave the story a 9/10, this story has to be the mostunique thing i've ever seen. In my opinion, the only thing that'll top this plot is Code Geass R2's. However, i gave it a 9/10 mostly because sometimes it gets confusing and i'm just like. . . . what just happened? However, i'm pretty sure if i was rating it again after i re-watched it, it would be a ten out of ten because i would understand it better.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nArt: Again, 9/10. While the art is very appealing and everything is top notch perfect, that's all it is. It's in no way unique or special- there are some parts that I think are masterpieces, but to be honest, most of the art is just kind of normal. I think the art's unique side mostly comes from what is actually being drawn- like, Yuno Gasai's stalkers moments for example. Normally, she looks. . . like your average anime character. Nothing too special, nothing too plain- just normal. But then add in the yandere-ness. . . and it's suddenly amazing. You'll get it when you watch the anime.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nSound: Perfect. Ridiculously so. The OP and ED's are a perfect match and even now, I still listen to them everywhere I go and never get sick of it. (And I'm one of those people who change favorites on a weekly basis. . .) In addition, the voice actors voice everything so perfectly, and again lets use Yuno as an example. Normally, a yandere character would scare the hell out of me (not gonna stop me from watching an anime that's good, though) but Yuno. .  Yuno is my goddess. . . and her cute-sometimes-sexy voice is part of the reason why. When Yuno has her little \"moments\", the blend between cute and macho is just perfect. I'm not sure how Yuno's VA did it, but even if she did it unconciously, it was perfect. There is no character who matched their VA better then Yuno Gasai- ever. Anyway, the bgm and extra little noises were good too, but I would place them as average because that's exactly what I expect from an anime.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. Yuno Gasai. End of story.\\n\r\nNo just kidding. ~\\n\r\nThe characters (besides Yuno) themselves are pretty average, actually- they're pretty popular type of characters. However, what made them that way and the little things they do because of who they are is what gives this part of the anime 10/10. In addition, the character developements with one another are splendid. (Although I did wish, somewhere deep in my heart, that Akise and Yuki ended up together, and was disappointed there wasn't any of that.) Now let's talk about Yuno again. . . . \\n\r\nYuno is splendidly different from mainstream characters. Yes, so what, she's a yandere and that's all, right? is what your probably saying. While yes, being a yandere is one of the unique things, the best part is WHY Yuno is a yandere and what made her have her occasional. . . paranoia attacks. In addition, her total character change at the end of the story (as well as Yuki's) are perfect as everything builds up perfectly, and you knew it was coming, but it still surprises you. Now before I start going on a tantrum about the ending which doesn't even belong in the \"Character\" section, NEEEEXT ~\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall : 9/10\\n\r\nIt was something I loved and would rewatch whenever I have nothing to do, and the characters felt like my best friends (although. . . you know, Yuno. . .)    however, while Mirai Nikki was so unparalled, rare, and plain out uncommon, i'm not really a fan of it's genres. While i love all animes, my personal preferences lean towards a veeerryy different direction then Future Diary. More like I just decided to pick up Future Diary because it was so popular, the music was catchy, I was bored, and nobody was home to listen to Yuno's insane-phases besides me. However, in the end i DID like it, but I must say i prefer the manga version.\\n\r\n-",

            "content": "There are three types of people who will dislike this anime:\r\n1. People who are Genre rigid. This show is action, thriller, mystery, romance, comedy, etc. and often likes to shift from episode to episode or arc to arc. I personally can not place this series purely into one genre\r\n2. People who are looking for a stable story. This show has more of a general story that changes as a result of the game. This is natural given that many characters initially DO NOT WANT to play the game and are FORCED to play it. Naturally, morality is thrown around and a simple story with aclearly defined goal isn't present.\\n\\n\r\n3. People who cannot suspend their disbelief over the slightest thing. There are moments in this story where you ask yourself \"Why don't they just kill them and be done with it?\" which can be frustrating. There are also moments where a character will do something illogical. While these problems sound glaring, they don't take you out of the anime, and simply leave you with a \"I wouldn't have done that\" thought as the story continues. \\n\\n\r\nIf you got past that, welcome to my review of Future Diary. Future Diary was one of the best animes, no series, I have ever seen in my life. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is this: There is this Time God who only seems to be known my introverts and outcasts. He decides to throw a \"to the death\" tournament to see who will take over his role of god. Each person is given a different \"power\" to their cell phone diaries that give them an edge in this competition.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is built around this idea initially, with some of the \"players\" wanting to win and become a god, and others who just want to be left alone. \\n\\n\r\nThis all begins to change as personal events unfold that cause people to become more actively involved. Each diary itself has a different and unique power, but the power is unique to the user specifically for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people found the ending to be unsatisfying, but to me it seemed more like the logical conclusion with the exception of some minor continuity issues. The only fault in this series typically comes from characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nImagine someone you love romantically, real or not, obessively so. Imagine you have a journal or diary that confirms at the very end that you will end up with this person. Imagine being in said game above and that person also being a fellow competitor. Imagine that said person is also a bit helpless and will not survive unless you get involved. Imagine your diary also keeps track of what is happening to that person, so you can help them whenever you can. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, deep down you know that even if you help them, there is going to come a point where it's only going to be the two of you left in the game. This is the MAIN character, Yuno.\\n\\n\r\nMany people wouldn't call Yuno the main character since she is not the focus character. However, the series essentially is all about her and the actions she takes. She is psychologically unstable and is THE definition of a stalker taken to the extreme. \\n\\n\r\nYukki, her love interest, is essentially a bit cowardly, but has nerves of steel once in awhile that helps keep him and the others alive. He is the focus character of the series, but doesn't really act like a protagonist until near the end. He is more like the \"Damsel in Distress\" of this series, naively getting himself into trouble. It was a good move for the series to make him the focus character since it makes him more likable and since Yuno has the stronger story. \\n\\n\r\nYukki's friends are okay. Not much to say since I'd be spoiling the series. Luckily, they only really appear in the series to serve as support when more important stuff is going on, so their lack of development is not painful.\\n\\n\r\nThe other diary users I felt were written very well. They all had motivations and different ways of trying to achieve their goals. Some people might feel that they didn't give them enough story, but the story really isn't about them and that is what people may miss and that is why they were written well. Most of the users and their perspectives are told through the lens of Yukki, and this sometimes confuses the audience into thinking they are main characters when in fact they are simply well written support. \\n\\n\r\nWhat are the problems with the characters? Well, some of the characters act almost too honorably given the situation, and instead of crushing their opposition they may prefer to toy with them instead. Other times, the characters seem to act dishonorably and betray each other. While this makes sense from an emotional stand point, causing Yuno and Yukki's relationship get closer despite understandable apprehension Yukki has with this, it sort of comes across as nonsensical to the character's motivation. In fact, there is so much of this that goes on that it made me feel that only Yuno was reliable and predictable. Which again works from the series stand point but takes away a bit of the realism from the support cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this series and the twists that resulted from it. I consumed this anime over the course of a night and the following day, which is to say a lot as to how drawn in I was. The last, 4 or 3 episodes I felt less invested in, but didn't drain from how great the rest of the series was. There are even subtle, one scene or one line incidents that change your perspectives on characters, or the story itself. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it as a MUST SEE. There are areas it could have improved in, could have made the characters a little more realistic, and could have ended it in different ways to convey different tones. However, I believe the few mistakes or over-sights that were made are worth the sacrifice of building up a stronger emotional investment. \\n\\n\r\nI challenge you to watch episode 1-6  (or 4 at the earliest) and see if you're not interested enough to see what happens next.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki\u2019s mission statement is one of its more obscure characters. Yomotsu barely has 20 minutes of screen time. He seems at first like an out-of-place oddball with his posturing as a Hero of Justice. This posturing is crucial. He says that the way to know who\u2019s just ad who\u2019s evil is according to who wins.\r\nIt\u2019s a blunt way of saying it, but it\u2019s true of many stories. Our hero defeats the villain with brute force, and we know he\u2019s right because he didn\u2019t deliver a speech about World Domination. In Death Game scenarios, it\u2019s even worse. In Hunger Games, Katniss never has to cometo terms with killing innocent people.\\n\\n\r\nThe Death Game scenarios are scary because they force people to fight who\u2019d otherwise won\u2019t. Katniss never has to face her fellow players\u2019 humanity. She just happened to face the cruel ones. No such shortcuts are taken in Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is funny in their head, but no one is outright evil. Some are more crueler than others, but that cruelty is explained. We\u2019re invited to understand these characters. Even when the cruelest of them die, there is tragic vibe to it. Things could have been different for them. Reisuke and Tsubaki are characters who made wrong decisions based on their circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nEven John Bacchus, the character who could most easily become a caricature isn\u2019t. He has grand plans for humanity, but not cheap World Domination. We see his plan\u2019s failure in action, rather than have a boring speech about megalomaniac aspirations.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach to the Death Game brilliant. Not only it gets why the scenario is interesting in the first place, but it makes it more thrilling. Some have criticized the show for having a cast of stupid and psychotic characters, but that\u2019s the point.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thrillers aren\u2019t just a bunch of intelligent people playing mind games. Playing games is more fun than watching others do it, anyway. The best thrillers are those that are concerned with the emotional consequences of the scenario. They create thrilling set-pieces. They use atmosphere, symbolism and visual style instead of constant feedback.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is closer to thrillers like Pi and The Machinist, rather than the constant build-up of Death Note. It has a cast of weirdos who are thrown into a scenario with other weirdos and try to navigate it. The thrill come\u05d3 not from wondering What Will Happen Next, because it\u2019s interesting to see these personalities clash.\\n\\n\r\nThere are not highly-skilled badasses. Since they\u2019re all emotional wrecks, that makes them unpredictible. We can expect an intelligent person to come up with a solution, but we\u2019ll never know when a regular person will act on his rationality or on an emotional impulse. Whereas many thrillers just give the characters random skills, Mirai Nikki literally gives skills to the characters based on who they are. A loner is given a diary which records all his future observations. A couple is given diaries which predict their lovers\u2019 future. An owner of an orphan home is given the ability to produce diary owners, like giving births.\\n\\n\r\nIf this starts to sound meta, then it only gets worse. Aren\u2019t Yukki and Mur Mur a paralell to the us, the viewers? Yukki was, until the game starts an observer who wrote what he saw but didn\u2019t participate in things. That\u2019s how consuming media often works, especially when you write reviews like these. Mur Mur\u2019s motivations seem like she might be evil for evil\u2019s sake, but her desire for amusement is familiar. Don\u2019t we watch these Death Games stories to be amused, too?\\n\\n\r\nWhile the Death Game scenario is the main theme the series questions for a while, there are a bunch of other ideas scattered around. Romance is being satirized with Yuno. Her character is more clever than people give her credit for. She\u2019s a response to people\u2019s desire for someone to love them deeply. Yuno\u2019s love is serious, but it\u2019s also selfish. She\u2019s concerned more with protecting Yukki than what Yukki wants, although she matures a bit as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also some things about the nature of God. If Deus\u2019 death seems like a giant plot hole to you, then you\u2019re unfamiliar with mythology. Gods die and humans replace them all the time, and Gods are often limited in their power. We also get a Badass Switch, which addresses the topic at hand. Yukki doesn\u2019t simply become a gun-packing OG. He\u2019s suppressing his sensitive self, but still acts on his desire to help others. We even got a Metaphysical Rebellion thing going on. The owners are all given the ability to change the future, yet do they really change it? Yomotasu appears again. He\u2019s being told he will die, so he just kills himself.\\n\\n\r\nSome of them try to rebel, to do something other than become Gods. Mostly, they all go along with the circumstances they\u2019ve been given. That\u2019s the reason why many of them became crazy in the same place. It\u2019s not an accidental detail. The whole Final Battle is one big metaphysical rebellion. It sees the characters trying to create an alternative future.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this sounds very clever on paper, but the execution is closer to the violent use of that word.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Mirai Nikki is that it\u2019s too original and has too much to say. It\u2019s full of ideas and it wants to deal with them on its own rules. We get a few pretty women, all of which spend more time being characters rather than let us stare. There\u2019s an extended sequence where Yuno is in underwear but it never slows down to give us good-looking shots. There are shifts in tone that feel appropriate. Such an overblown story can\u2019t work without some humor. The progress of the story is more thematic than realistic. Things exist and happen because they fit the tone and meaning. Questions like \u2018how did Rei get the poison?\u2019 are left unanswered because they\u2019ll most likely not add much.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with creating your own rules is that you\u2019re a first-timer in the game. Digimon Tamers might be brilliant, but it\u2019s the result of past failures. The story is archetypical. The creators looked back on similar stories, saw where the holes were and filled them.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki has no such tradition to draw from. It borrows freely from School, Death Game, Psychological Thriller, Action and Fantasy. It\u2019s both excited by what it has, and unsure of itself. That\u2019s why the pace is too fast, but the series never runs out of stream even when it\u2019s off the rails.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I\u2019d complain about a few unnecessary episodes, but this one needed more. The characters all have quirks that point to a personality, but that\u2019s all they do. Their defining features are too often external \u2013 a tragic event in their past, an ill son. We don\u2019t get enough of moments that show us how these things affect them.\\n\\n\r\nThey are affecting them enough to feel different. Both Rei and Tsubaki have their tragic pasts, but one is full of hatred and the other is just cruel. That\u2019s a pretty significant distinction. It\u2019s not explored, though. These characters die too quickly.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made the Cult of the Sixth so exciting is because it threw all these weirdos together. Instead of having boring one-on-one match, we have different people doing their things according to how they see fit. You can\u2019t do it for 26 episodes if everyone is constantly dying. They kept some of them alive for a long while, so why not all the rest?\\n\\n\r\nThere is also an added mechanic which might feel like an asspull. It actually fits the theme of the series and is necessary for the metaphysical rebellion thing. The problem is, by the time it appears our story shifted focus. We\u2019re no longer following a cast of weirdos and their plight, but see the metaphysical rebellion itself.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting enough, but it calls for a different series. A story ends when its ideas conclude, not when stuff stops happening. In this case the survival game ended, therefore the first story is over. Shifting a focus just causes unnecessary confusion. If they dedicate 26 episodes to their ensemble and expanded the final battle to a short second season, it\u2019d be better.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the the series never runs out of steam. From the beginning the show feels like it will go off the rails, and it does. The train keeps going forward though. The track might be lost, but you won\u2019t reach your destination by standing still. Even when it loses itself it refuses to play by anyone\u2019s rules but its own.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s something admirable how it keeps going forward. Better anime than it fall to convenience when things get too hard, but Mirai Nikki just speeds forward. If we compare anime to Icarus, then Sword Art Online gives up on the sun and drowns. Mirai Nikki forgets about the sun and tries to fly to outer space, but burns in the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCredit must be given to the visual style. Mirai Nikki features some of the best character design in anime. No one is spared. Many anime have talented designers, but only the women get this treatment. Just look at Date A Live, which has brilliant designs like those of Yoshino and Tokisaki, but Shido might as well be a stick-man.\\n\\n\r\nHere, we have an attention to detail. Yukki isn\u2019t just another black-haired hero but given an actual style, even if it\u2019s less flamboyant than others. Everyone has their own facial expressions, their own hairstyles and their own outfits. It speaks volumes about the series when it creates pretty women but doesn\u2019t linger on their bodies, and finds room for a deformed one too. There\u2019s something beautiful in the picture of the ending theme. We see all the owners\u2019 shilouttes standing, each with his own unique shape.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes everything feel so alive. It may look unrealistic. Marco\u2019s hair definitely can\u2019t stand like this, but that\u2019s not the point. Animation is expressing ideas using visuals. Human beings are often weird. I lived with many of them, and few turned out to be normal. Their personalities are closer to Mirai Nikki\u2018s flamboyant design rather than Mushishi\u2018s, where everyone looked the same. Now what is more realistic?\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is full of flaws and little holes. There are       average anime with less obvious problems. There are also not many with so much life and energy, that play by their own rules rather than someone else\u2019s. There is a masterpiece here somewhere, but the pacing is too rushed and there are too many ideas than it can carry. It\u2019s never boring, it\u2019s rarely convenient and it\u2019s always unhinged and bizarre. In this case, I\u2019m willing to forgive the flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest plot hole that nobody talks about is Uryuu Minene never wearing her twintails again. These are the best twintails in the history of anime. Why not use them?\\n\\n\r\n4 blind eyes out of 5",

            "content": "First of all, let me start by giving you the biggest advice of all, putting aside this review, do not listen to any reviews unless they are POSITIVE. Reviews are usually written by people who have a very judgemental personallity and people like that hate things that make people scream out of joy.\r\nBefore i started watching Mirai Nikki i read a few negative reviews about it and appearantly, the details of the review were totally right.\r\nHowever, the conclusion was absolutely wrong, i admit that mirai nikki doesn't do a very good job at what it was meant to be, mirai nikki is not a goodthriller or a psychological drama (except for Yuno who is one of the most interesting characters in the history of anime), and appearantly that's the reason of all the bitching.\\n\\n\r\nOk so let's actually start this review.\\n\\n\r\nStory - A- : \\n\\n\r\nThe main idea of Mirai nikki is good, it really is, but appearantly this is not what this anime revolves around, the anime's main source of interest is the relationship of Yuki and Yuno, the two main characters of the show.\\n\r\nWhile being a little reinforced by their surroundings, you'll find out at the end of this anime that the only characters that you really care for are those two, and if you ask me it's totally fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -  B - :\\n\\n\r\nSome characters in Mirai nikki are very generic and meaningless, but atleast they don't harm the story, a few characters are well thought of and developed and those are the ones that you are likely to remember.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, we have Yuki and Yuno, which are clearly the most interesting couple i've ever seen in an anime ( Maybe except Kirito and Asuna ).\\n\r\nYuki is an amazingly well developed character who goes through a logical and major change through the show, you may not really like him at the beginning, but after a while he just does what he has to do and turns the entire show upside down. Then we have Yuno, she is absolutely the main trigger of this show to exist to begin with, she doesn't go through alot of development but that's cause she's already figured out, and you'll find out why later on.\\n\r\nSecond of all, we have Yuki's friends, Hinata, some random uninteresting girl, some stupid goofball who keeps making fun of himself and Neon genesis evangelion's tribute.. Akise aru, the mysterious detective guy that you suspect throughout the entire show, sorry for not saying anything about the other characters but Akise is the only one i feel is worth talking about, this character gets little screentime but every time he pops on the screen you're being reminded of why this show is so interesting in the first place, he's the one who's thinking outside of the box and asks himself questions that nobody else has thought asking.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, i wanna review something that nobody else reviews and that would be:\\n\\n\r\nAttachment to the characters A+ :\\n\\n\r\nThis is something that absolutely doesn't apply to everyone, but if it does apply to you, you're in luck, because you've won a great prize, this show offers the best of the best to people who have a high enough EQ to attach to the characters ( Most people obviously do ), ofcourse i'm only talking about Yuki and Yuno..\\n\r\nYou'll find yourself sitting with a blank look on your face, thinking why they are not real when you're finished because they just make the most interesting couple ever written in anime history, and that's because they're so unusual.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - A :\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the animation of this anime, it's really good in my opinion, if you don't particularly like this kind of animation then it will just do what it's supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nMusic B- :\\n\\n\r\nNot too much to say about the music either... the soundtrack is really forgetable but the opening and ending themes are just classy and cool, especailly the first one ( My opinion ).\\n\\n\r\nOverall B :\\n\\n\r\nI really wanna give it an A+.. i really do.. and that's because that's why i specificly feel about this anime, i've been through a short but amazing ride while watching this show but unfortunately what i like doesn't apply to anyone, everything else i said is pretty much objective so don't worry, just give it a chance ( It gets better after a while, the beginning is not as good, it still is, just not as good, and the rest of the show is amazingly well thought of )\\n\\n\r\nStrong points :\\n\\n\r\nPlot twists\\n\r\nCharacter development ( To some characters )\\n\r\nMystery\\n\r\nAttachment\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Future Diary/Mirai Nikki is a well written novel-like story.\r\nFuture Diary was a suprisingly awesome anime/manga (I watched the anime only). I wasn't so sure about it at first because I thought it was going to be another bloodbath without enough story to justify the bloodshed that was happening/going to happen but I was wrong.\r\nWhat if you could look into the future just by looking at the screen of your cell? Sounds awesome, right? Well what if I told you that several others also had the same ability but you have to kill each other or else the world will end and whoever is the lastperson standing becomes god of time and space? Shit just got serious now!\\n\\n\r\nFuture Diary is an anime I would've dropped by the end of the 2nd or 3rd episode but I was forced into watching it because of the damned anime recommendation circle I'm part of but I'm glad I finished this anime because it was worth sitting through the whole series. To be honest, the realizationg of how good this anime is didn't hit me until about halfway through and Future Diary definitely earned the right to carry the genre name of suspense. This anime had me sitting on the edge of my seat wishing I had popcorn to snack on while watching this psychotic masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nFuture Diary started a bit slow for me but it's not so much that it's a slow paced anime, oh no, that's definitely not the case, it's just that murder action suspense isn't my cup of tea but the character writing was way better than I initially thought and the anime grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nOur MC in Future Diary is a middle school student named Yuki Amano. Yuki is a loner (and a total wimp too), he records his daily events like a diary in his cell, he also has 2 imaginary friends; Deus Ex Machina the God of Time and Space!, and there's Murmur (assistant of Deus Ex Machina the God of Time and Space). One day Yuki learns that his diary recordings are showing events that are yet to happen and end up coming true. This brings Yuki discomfort and he learns that he is a player in a survival game where all players must kill each other in order to take Deus Ex Machina's place as god of time and space because he's slowly deteriorating.  Yuki (also known as 1st) ends up teaming up with Yuno Gasai (aka 2nd) who is an obvious psychopath from day 1 but she is madly in love with Yuki which causes her to go to extreme lengths to protect the love of her life.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really like Yuki all that much because he's incredibly wimpy and weak-willed (especially in the stting in which he is placed) however, at a certain point in the story he becomes more confident, badass, likeable, and a character I could root for. Yuno stays psychotic til the ending but over the course of this 26 episode+OVA we learn more and more about our heroine of this story. Yuno Gasai is the most psychotic yandere character in anime I've ever seen but I just couldn't bring myself to hate her (especially after learning why she's the way she is). Honestly I couldn't care less about the characters who weren't chosen as candidates/players. They just weren't interesting enough for me to care about them, the psychopaths were waaay more interesting like the terrorist, the cop, the child, the mayor, and everyone's favorite, Yuno (the MC's love interest).\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Future Diary has this brilliant formula that makes an excellent suspense story; plot mixed wth confusion -> problem -> answer to problem in next episode -> new problem -> answer to problem in next episode -> slight explanation -> new problem -> answer to new problem in next episode -> more explanation -> new problem -> answer to problem in next episode -> rinse and repeat. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good and it really captures the psychotic looks in the characters eyes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the end of each episode there are mini episodes attached on about Murmur's silly adventures and her interactions with certain characters in the series.\\n\\n\r\nI shall not spoil the ending but I will say it has a depressing turn that I couldn't help but compare it to Serial Experiments Lain's ending but with a love plot attached. After the credits of the 26th and final episode, there's hope!\\n\\n\r\nThat scene after the credits of the last episode is explained through an OVA that I imagine many people would call the true ending.\\n\\n\r\nThis was an epic anime with plenty of unexpected twists and turns and would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense, mystery, violence, character development, psychotic romance, and thick plot. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're interested, PLEASE GIVE IT A SHOT!\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is one of my favorite manga. the excitement, the thrill, the pyschological factor and that memorable romance was something i thought could not be duplicated. I remember what i said in my head when it was green lit for an anime adaptation :\" this is gonna be good\"....what i didn't know was it was actually going to be awesome. The beginning of this review is going to make me look like an ass-kisser but there are some very small downsides. \r\nstory- wow....if more words are needed to convince you then i shall continue. We have such a thrilling situation where the concept of\"survival of the fittest\" comes into place with the reward to be god. Although i have only watched 3 episodes at the time of this review i can say that the feeling i had when reading the manga is coming back in a more visual form. The twists and \"oh damn\" moments are as lively as ever and leaves you wanting more and more (kinda similar to Deadman Wonderland). I suggest this plot for people who want to spice up their anime list and want something new and original to the plate. \\n\\n\r\nart- the art is consistent and has great quality. i can't really say that the art is jaw dropping but its clear, beautiful and fits the atmosphere almost perfectly. this is a typical present day anime quality art basically but with more consistency. \\n\\n\r\nsound- Quality is perfect. There are no akward sounds, and if there is then its nearly impossible to spot. The many situations are accompanied with clear cut sounds and the background music slips in to make the situation more intense or emotional. But to be truthfull all sounds seem to sound the same to me so your taste would most likely be more critical. Also if we are talking about OP and ED then they are great especially the ED imo. unfortunately i am not too familiar with Faylan and Yousei Teikoku. However i have heard them sing in1 or 2 animes i have previously viewed but their impact was not enough for me to remember the name. \\n\\n\r\ncharacter- here we go. \\n\r\n1. Yukiteru Amano is a boy who seems to prefer being a side character. At first he appears to be a typical highschooler excluding the fact his hobby of recording things on his phone. thats just sounds painfully boring. He is a more exciting person then you would expect at first....well he better be because he's the main character. Yuki's thinking is quick and filled with overflowing emotions in pressuring times. This is a really intresting point about him that i think you will also enjoy. BTW when i say overflowing emotions i don't mean it has to seem like he has some disorder or an insane case of ADHD. \\n\\n\r\nYuno Gasai- YANDERE. by far the most eccentric, bloodthirsty, and intresting character in Mirai Nikki. You will never see another character with Yuno's traits. She has a rather akward and scary crush on Yukiteru which fuels the pychological factor but also puts an new twist in the romance genre. Yes there is some romance but don't expect it to be generic. \\n\\n\r\n-enjoyment- Yes you will enjoy this. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone but if ur looking for a lil adrenaline then go ahead and watch Mirai Nikki because it will not disappoint. I am still suprised that the adaptation is almost perfect but more suprisingly the adaptors captured the feelings in the manga and successfully portrayed it in the anime. I feel as if there is something missing that could push this anime to a ten. perhaps other reviewers would give this anime the ten but its missing that ulimate spark that i haven't seen for a while. regardless its a great series and it is my favorite anime of this season. \\n\\n\r\nCurrent Overall: 9- Right now its at a nine in my opinion. it, however, can change as the series continues. i hate giving out a rating before the anime ends but thats my true rating for now. \\n\\n\r\n-Dead End- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Editied for up to Episode 12:\r\nThere have been a couple spots of relativly lower quality animation scattered in what has otherwise been very good qualty video. - 8\r\nThe soundtrack, while it can seem a bit, well lazy at parts throughout the course of the show, still managed to boast both the best OP and ED of the season, from what I watched.The voice actors/actresses all seem to match up with their designated roles, although I may have liked to have heard someone else play the role of Yukki - 8\r\nIn terms of characters, well everyone (at least to my knowledge) watches it for Yuno soits actually more practical to talk about the other characters.\\n\r\nYukki really dips between points of being annoying and points where I can appreciate his struggle and how he overcomes obstacles. But the true character strength in this show seems to come from the other diary holders, each of whom brings something new and diverse to the scene, not just with their external character traits, but their back stories and especially their personal diaries. - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall was the first of the genre that I had picked up, so at least for me it was unique and intriguing, although I'm aware some may find certain aspects of it over emphasized by the creators and over-hyped by the fans. Overall the fluidity of the narrative combined with great character interaction with limited, yet useful anime-only fillers, is well thought out and well executed. - 9\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I found it to be my favorite show of the season, closely followed by Fate/zero and assuming it continues the way it is now It will be a show to watch whether you are just picking up or waiting for the end to marathon. Overall Mirai Nikki scores a 9/10",

            "content": "Whew, Mirai Nikki. One of the most controversial anime series to ever air: some hate it with a passion whilst some praise it as a masterpiece. It creates a definition for the terms \"yandere\" and \"overly attached girlfriend\" and taught me a new meaning of love. For me, it was a roller coaster ride of a lifetime with so many twists and turns that never bored me for a second and believe me, that is a feat indeed. I believe Mirai Nikki is something worth checking out no matter what genre you like and honestly, if you don't like it you don't have to seeit another episode. Ever.\\n\\n\r\nStory: If you are interested in a long, suspenseful thriller then Mirai Nikki is for you. The story is a great ride through a fictional town with various places including schools, hospitals and towers being explored. Each story arc tells the struggle of one of the minor characters, their background and their reason to fight and ultimately become God. I have learnt many things about being human watching this series and hope you can too. And who can forget that ending? Countless have shed tears watching that. BUT, one of the main reasons this show is hated by many is because there are many plot holes. Sometimes you may find yourself asking \"wait, how exactly did that happen?\" or \"why would this thing do that?\" but ultimately, at the end of the day it is your choice as to whether you let these plot holes obliterate your enjoyment of this anime or whether you choose to ignore them as I did and enjoy it anyways.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This anime aired in the 2010's, therefore the animation quality is of course going to be good. However, if you are only looking for good animation, then I don't recommend this series as there are better ones, such as Guilty Crown. However, I do believe the team did a very good job with the animation in terms of the quality of the explosions, crumbling towers and various other special effects. I also like the design of many of the characters, namely the two female protagonists and Deus Ex Machina (who is a character). \\n\\n\r\nSound: The BGM in this anime really help to convey the mood of the scenes, especially the \"horror vibe\" which is what the series is supposed to do, among others such as a romantic one. My favourite OST by far is \"Here with you\", which is probably one of the most emotional and beautiful soundtracks you can get out there, which plays during emotional scenes between the male and female protagonists. It functions as my lullaby, study music, relaxation music...ok sorry I'm going off topic now. But you get the idea: it is good. OP 1 is also very good, though I am not a big fan of Japanese singing in English, hence not really OP 2, but both ED's are sugoi, especially 2 which really shows the pain of the female protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Mirai Nikki has a very good set of characters. The cast are a generally likeable bunch, and of course the seiyu of the female protagonist did a very good job voicing her with that high-pitched voice (I do not recommend dub) and rampage voice. the minor characters all get a share of the development, as each of their backstories, their personalities are all told as well as their reasons for fighting. And my favourite part is that they are not all souless, heartless killers: they act like their personalities. And of course who can forget the Yandere queen herself: as stated she gave me a new definition of love and clingy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this anime to you guys. If you don't like it then you don't have to keep watching, but like I said there is so much in this anime that you will be missing out on.",

            "content": "Future Diary...\r\nA number of people recommended this show to me, saying that it was some kind of masterpiece. Although I can vaguely see the appeal others may have, here I am to try and prove you wrong. Future Diary is very interesting in concept that falls flat on it's face in terms of story and characters.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory:\r\nAlthough we have seen Battle Royale types of shows come out in all types of media beforehand, Mirai Nikki brought on a fairly unique take on the genre. That, however, is the only real praise the show gets in term of story. The writers basically made the show into agory mess, trying to appeal to people who enjoy that kind of stuff. *MINOR SPOILER* For example, you have this 5 year old kid who is apparently taught himself to be some kind of killing genius and can get a hold of poison gas.*MINOR SPOILER END* They litter stuff like this to make the show more flashy than it actually is, which is a major dissapointment in my opinion. Also, like a lot of thriller shows, plot twists are thrown in to make things more dramatic. In this case, however, more is actually less. The plot twists are sloppy at best, and if you inspect them closely, you can see how flawed they are. While I won't spoil you on anything, around the 20th episode, this becomes blatantly evident. This anime just throws in so much random bullshit by the end of it that makes it so confusing that they try to hide the massive plot holes they have created.\\n\r\n The ending also wasn't much, as it was more or less entirely predictable. In the end, Mirai Nikki was a beautiful premise that failed with, to be blunt, sloppy writing.\\n\\n\r\n*MOAR SPOILERS* One more thing about the story. We have this mess of a romance between Yuki and Yuno. I understand where Yuno was coming from as Yuki gave her a purpose to live, even though that purpose itself was flawed. Yuno never really listens to Yuki or what he wants, and just acts on her own desires. Like, she ties him up midway through the series and keeps him hostage for a short while. Yet, Yuki still, after all the shit she pulls, loves her. I swear the romance is written by a bunch of 2 year olds, but I digress. *END OF MOAR SPOILERS*\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIf you thought the story was bad, take a gander at the characters of this series. I just couldn't stop shaking my head at the terrible mistakes and lack of backstory they got.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Yukiteru. He starts off as a complete coward, scared for his life and not knowing what to do. Because of this, I sympathized with his character for a short while as it added a sense of realism to him. But for half of the series, he just whines and cries about his shitty life, even though nothing really bad has happened to him. Also, when talking about character development, Yukiteru is an example of character development done COMPLETELY WRONG. There are moments where it seems he is finally trying to break out of his spineless cocoon, just to crawl back into it by the beginning of the next story arc. He does, however, start to completely change during the second half. This is also flawed as he changes from spineless wuss into ruthless killing machine over the course of 2 seconds. \\n\\n\r\nNow, we have Yuno, the yandere for this series. She is basically put into this series to act as the resident badass who Yuki uses as his killing machine until about the halfway point. It was very refreshing to actually see a girl with a backbone, rather than having a useless girl who relies on her damn boyfriend to do anything useful. Still, the dedication that Yuno gives for this crybaby never failed from continuously angering me. I don't see why she has this undying dedication to Yuki, as he really isn't worth stalking in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nWe are introduced to a vast array of characters, ranging from Yuki's classmates to the other diary owners and so on and so forth. However, none of them except for maybe one or two get any development at all. Some get a minutes worth of backstory, but in the end, it doesn't really help. This is just me, but when someone died, I really didn't feel any emotion towards them, as it just felt like their death was just convenient for the plot to move along. Of course, there is one ray of light known as Akise. He is undeniably my favourite of the series, as he probably gets more development than the main character himself. He doesn't even have a diary, yet hes more useful than him.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation was good, nothing spectacular, yet nothing that burns the eyes. Some scenes have a sense of style and fluidity which was a pleasure to watch, but some were just really flawed and very static. Also, special mention to the character designs for making the most laugh-inducing characters I have seen in a long time. Like, we have a girl version of the Pillsbury Doughboy. Why the hell...\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLet's start off with a good note. The opening. Fast paced, great animation, fits the show well enough. Let's just say I loved the heck out of it. The second one wasn't as great, but it was still enjoyable to say the least. The soundtrack used for the actual show wasn't really anything special, but my eardrums are still intact, so that's a plus in my books. I did have a problem with the sound effects, however, as some did seem out of place, and didn't really fit with some of the actual scenes. In the topic of dub vs sub, sub is definetely the way to go. For someone as whiny as Yuki, you have a relatively deep voice portraying his character, which was terribly miscast. This is also a problem with Yuno's engrish voice actor, for basically the same reasons.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I wanted to enjoy this series, there was just so much wrong with it that I just ended up shaking my head for the whole ride, just waiting for the train to come to a crashing hault. The story has so many plot holes you could fly a plane through it, the characters either had no development at all, or, in Yuki's case, had too much of it. Also, the decisions each of the characters made where unrealistic and not very interesting in the slightest. There were some high points in the Sound and Animation departments, but nothing to really bring the show out of the rubble that it caused. Although, I know a lot of people will disagree with me, so even though I don't recommend it really at all, feel free to check it out as you might find something to you're liking.\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is said to be a psychological trailer, however it is everything but. It fails to present a feature every psychological trailer should have and that's good character development and strong emphasis on characters emotional state, this state should also be realistically presented. This however, does not happen \r\nin Mirai Nikki. \r\nThe only way it is psychological if it was a creators idea of using advanced psychology to get a reaction from the viewer and make them angry at all it's flaws, with every episode even more. If it was so, then it certainly succeeds.\r\nThe weakest point of this anime, undoubtedly, is it's story.\r\n[Veryminor spoilers to follow]\\n\\n\r\nThis story was supposed to be a deadly battle for survival, where no one is safe and everyone could die at any moment. It turns what was suppose to be a survival struggle to a simple shounen series full of plot holes, characters acting irrational, and one of the worst character development I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen such plot shields as in this anime. Every character was always miraculously saved at the last second, no matter how weak his chances for survival were.. no matter if their throat was cut, the characters always woke up and performed their final action to prolong the story, build tension, and of course, to earn the author more money with another manga volume, cause if it wasn't for that, the manga, as well as anime would have ended a lot sooner.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when it was time for the characters to die, they did,  usually in a very melodramatic way, being able to say their final speech.\\n\\n\r\nTheir actions often contradicted their beliefs. Some key points to the story were never explained ,the actions of some characters, and even how did they manipulated their victims for example, was never explained later.\\n\\n\r\nMost notable example would be a certain diary owner, and how he manipulated people into doing his deeds by hypnosis which affected hundreds of people, and he didn't even had to look at those people or even be in a direct vicinity, quite convenient for the plot, isn't it? This subject was never even mentioned during the entirety of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd out of all characters in the story none of them was actually serious about being a god.\\n\r\nEveryone had their motives and yet they formed alliances with characters that they knew would have to die for them to win. And even when they faced their enemies and had a gun pointed to them they'd rather talk and not fire thus almost always letting them escape. And as escaping goes, characters were always avoiding death in very ridiculous ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues that way till the very end, with only one episode breaking the streak of the best plot armor example in any anime I watched.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the previous episodes might even be considered decent by viewers not demanding realistic presentation, the last few episodes turn the genres upside down as the anime starts becoming mahou shoujo instead of the thriller it was suppose to be.\\n\\n\r\nWe then have a girl who can leap for hundred meters with two people on her arms, just like she would be in zero gravity, a little creature who later turns into cannibalistic vampire while throwing magical balls that can also serve as the mini universe creator. \\n\\n\r\nWe have everything BUT realism and consistent, good storytelling. The story also tries to deliberately confuse the viewer at the end so he wouldn't notice all those atrocious mistakes. And in fact for some of the viewers the anime may cause to turn their brain off a little cause of how much is going on.\\n\\n\r\nYou could have a great time watching this series, If you don't concentrate on story and just have fun watching, although not believable at all, but quite entertaining survival game and maybe even laugh at some of the earlier episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while the anime it is indeed full of holes and doesn't rationally explain anything, the ending is quite surprising. It is not a simple shounen ending. It is a surprising and very interesting ending, for the most part. Of course it doesn't explain almost anything, it simply ends a story. Although at the end there are more questions than answers.\\n\\n\r\nI personally didn't like the idea that they portrayed god in. He didn't have much power and was presented as just sitting there while he had very little to do with the world as it stayed the same place all the time. I mean if he could be god then he could create a world full of peace or completely free of money and boundaries. \\n\r\nHowever he either didn't want to or couldn't do it which made being god completely useless and only sufficient for selfish reasons and creating world for yourself only.\\n\r\nAlso there's one thing that god couldn't do that absolutely i think don't qualify you as a god, cause as one you should definitely have such powers.\\n\\n\r\nThe series shies away from being a strong, gory series and impose too much comedy into most of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo as you can read I did not enjoy it for the most part cause I was expected a deathly battle for survival and it turned out to be a full fan-service shounen unfortunately. \\n\r\nSome people,whose do not demand good character development, may like it, I don't. It's a good anime, for those that likes to have fun just by looking at the bloody action, not looking to much into it's storyline. Cause when you do, you immediately notice all the mistakes and silly coincidences that makes this anime not very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and background design look very good. It is noticeable that the anime used a bit of CGI for some scenes, especially the ones with Deus but it blends good and isn't very disturbing for the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters design are very off however, while Yuno and Yukki are drawn very good and naturally, the rest is quite opposite.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are sometimes just hilariously bad drawn for example eights head being so huge it almost as big as her body, and the hair of ninth makes her look ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a costume for a certain character making him look more like a clown than a psycho.\\n\\n\r\nThose little things really disturb the mood that is set and it's very hard to get back into it once you pay attention to them. Those are a really noticeable things that stroked me. \\n\\n\r\nExplosions looked quite good and there are a lot of them so if you like this stuff it's going to be a treat for you. Ruined buildings and structures look pretty realistic and it's a very good compliment because realism is a thing this anime lacks the most.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\\n\r\nWith first opening sounding amazing and lyrics reciting the names of various gods that as you can imagine ties perfectly into this anime and it was made exactly for it. Red color which is present everywhere in this anime and various gruesome scenes in the OP symbolize that it's a death struggle and it's not going to be pretty. Which wasn't entirely true. All the endings were a good pick, they are used nicely and in some episodes close the scenes with a cliffhanger very emotionally. \\n\\n\r\nThe exception, however, is the second opening for the series. Both lyrically and musically it's one of the worst I've seen and it's definitely one of the worst you could pick for a series like that. Lyrics sound like someone typed some words connected with death to a translator and then randomly put them together. \\n\r\nThey made absolutely no sense. And while nobody watching this in Japan will probably notice, it's horrid for most people who know this language. And certainly it was for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe singer also had no idea how to pronounce English words which resulted in the worst combination of vocals and lyrics I have ever seen in my life. Musically it's not that bad so I wished they just left it in instrumental if they had to use this song. Or better, not change it at all. But they didn't and I skipped it every \\n\r\nsingle time. Such a shame.\\n\\n\r\nAs for OST it's pretty good although I felt like some pieces being a little too light hearted for some scenes. But it wasn't very disturbing cause there were very creepy and fitting tracks as well, whom I later listened to with pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nThere are twelve diary owners taking part in the deadly game to become the next god.\\n\r\nAnd most of them aren't very serious about that.\\n\\n\r\nYukki was the worst character, or certainly the most annoying I saw in an anime. He's done nothing but complaining the whole time. Even worse, in the first episode he asks Yuno, the girl who is in love with him, to protect him to which she gladly agrees. But that wouldn't be a bad thing, and I could understand there may be such cowards like him, he didn't chose to be a part of this game, anyone would be scared. But he was not only a coward, but also a complete moron.\\n\\n\r\nHe tries to form alliances with other diary owners, befriend his friends killers and\\n\r\nacts like the person before him didn't just kill dozens of people \"Hey killer, let's be friends?\". \\n\\n\r\nAlso he forgives his father for doing a certain thing that I know nobody would forgive anyone for, he does it in one day and expects to be great friends with him. I could understand he was very traumatized and confused by that point, but.. seriously?\\n\\n\r\nThis character is a definition of stupidity. \\n\r\nThe way the story progresses around him is atrocious too. \\n\r\nHe is always protected by Yuno, and when certain event happens that makes him change by 180 degrees, it is probably the most forced and irrational change I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nIn five days since certain event he now is a total bad-ass and can parachute glide, drive a car like a first class racing driver, shoot a gun so good and so accurate that he can knock out the gun from the person holding it in a way that doesn't harm them at all, he is also a great mercenary with incredible sense of danger and then jumps from a tower with a parachute without fear while holding a girl on his arms, like not frightened at all macho lover. \\n\\n\r\nSince the change, I couldn't help but laugh every time I saw him.\\n\r\nOr maybe he learned it all from Yuno, who never had no experience in that matter as well?\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the devil. Quite literally. \\n\r\nIf there's one reason why you definitely should watch this series that is her. \\n\r\nBeing the perfect example of Yandere, she drives this series with every episode showing even more of her insanity mixed with incredible cuteness that is an absolutely pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nShe is madly in love with Yuki and protects him  at all cost with anime strongly suggesting that there will be only two people standing alive after all this is over and makes us ask ourself what would happen then. I recommend watching this series so you could find out the answer to this question, as it will probably surprise you, maybe not in a good way, but it's always better than predictable ending, or is it? \\n\\n\r\nBy the end we also find maybe the most interesting and unpredictable thing about Yuno that really makes you want to stay with this anime till the very end. \\n\r\nIt was the only thing that made me watch the whole of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as Yuno is the only character worth watching, the rest is a disaster cast.\\n\\n\r\nExample of others 'very clever' characters include:\\n\\n\r\nThere is one guy who gets dressed in the strangest outfit possible who makes him blind and surprisingly he is able to hypnotize people without any explanation of how he does that, until he gets killed in most anticlimactic way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a four year old who is a professional killer, of course, and the mastermind, whose tactics are outsmarting every owner out there. For example, he mails himself his diary so that the others would find out and take it from him, but if you open it from the outside it surprisingly releases an incredibly dense gas enough to fill a whole house even though this gas is released from a tiny envelope. It doesn't flow out even though the door is open, oh no, It spreads throughout the whole house making it deadly to breathe. \\n\r\nHe is the master of disguise trying to make his kills look like accidents. And he is of course a four year old trained to kill since the day he could walk by his father Joker (NOT!). \\n\\n\r\nAnd that what characters look like in Mirai Nikki, it looks incredibly stupid and you just want to laugh seeing all of them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is a woman whose head is twice as big as her body, It seems there are no limitation as to the stupidity and irrational behavior but there are no limits as to the characters ridiculous designs as well as some didn't even look like humans.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a lovers couple who once they meet with Yukki and Yuno triying to kill them by proving their love is stronger. And when they defeat them both and they are unconscious, the prove they are not serious about becoming a god at all and leave them alive, so you could ask why did they follow them all the way to this point just to leave them alive. Well, I have no idea. Perhaps to make more money for the author by prolonging the story yet again?\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there is Deus, the god, whose powers are very, very limited. Well, apparently he is able to pick out his successor cause he is not an almighty god and can do almost nothing a god should be able to and is dying, as god should of course.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a little creature Mur Mur, whom we later find out it some sort of demon, or a vampire, who has much greater power than Deus. She can create her own world within a small sphere and put people in it, which Deus cannot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Deus were in talk with all of the diary owners before the game and one of them even designed the diaries himself. You would've thought that would be slightly unfair, to let the creator of one thing participate in the game, he could for example know of some hidden features that others don't, Deus didn't think so however and he agreed, he also gave him the best diary in the game.\\n\\n\r\nNo one was really serious about becoming a god, characters were forming alliances knowing that they would have to kill each other at the end, and some were just idiots talking so long that they let opponents escape, and some even missed from 2 meters having characters at gunpoint and so on...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the weakest point of this anime and this should be an example of how to not create a characters personality. There is only one exception, that being Yuno, but she however is not that experienced as well and yet her knife skills are phenomenal. She makes up for it with her cuteness though so it's hard to notice that for the most part. Shame that the rest of the characters are awful. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt is a horrible shounen and should be treated like one. Do not expect realism or good character development, but if you don't pay attention to this and you just want to watch a blood bath then you will definitely have good fun. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this for the reasons stated above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is not a good anime, it tries to make you believe it is, but when you start noticing all the plot holes, all the inconsistencies, all the characters irrational actions and so on you cannot unsee the mistakes in every single episode, and they get bigger and bigger in the end. It is not realistic and believable and can only be enjoyed by turning off your mind and watch characters kill each other without thinking about why they do it.\\n\r\nI couldn't enjoy it and never will. 3/10",

            "content": "The first thought that crosses my mind when hearing the name of this anime is the word weird.\r\nThe story is about a boy who gains a diary which tells the future, twelve other people have different types of diary and the final survivor becomes \"God\". Their version of God is a little different, but it's just basically someone with tons of power to control things etc. \r\nWhen first watching this anime, I was definitely sure that I'd rate it no higher than a 7. However as the story progressed the plot sped up quickly I became more interested in the story, but once it gotto the middle of the anime the story drastically slowed down and became slightly boring. What kept me watching the anime was the curiosity of what the end result of the story would come to.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has \\n\r\n-Psychotic\\n\r\n-Dark\\n\r\n-Creepy\\n\r\nthemes.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10: The story itself wasn't bad, it's kind of interesting to see how things work out and the idea of a \"future diary\" is intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Nothing really special about the art. It's not bad, but it's not something that'd amaze you. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10: The songs are pretty good so is the background music\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: At times I strongly disliked the two  main characters throughout most of the story.. Some other characters I found really touching, and momentous but often times the main characters are simply just annoying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I watched this anime in two days, it was an interesting watch. I don't feel like I wasted my time, it's not that the anime is bad it's just not \"blow your mind\" type.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: This anime is probably worth a watch if you're out of anime to watch, or want to save up some episodes on your ongoing series. I would not judge the anime by the first 5-ish or so episodes, because things speed up quickly.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki or Future Diary is really an exceptional anime. In my eyes, it is a story with so much potential. Unfortunately I think they didn\u2019t used all the potential it had. After the first five episodes I had something as WOW. This is the best thing I ever saw, this is just insane but how closer I came to the middle, the slower the story became. It started to get fillers and things that weren\u2019t as original anymore as in the beginning. Luckily the last episodes became as original as the firsts again. What gave it a wonderful end that is really insane. UnfortunateI was still frustrated of the middle part that is why I didn\u2019t enjoyed it as much as I was supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a boy of 14 Yukiteru (a bit background information: They all have god names. I am just telling this because I didn\u2019t noticed it myself back then. The numbers they later get are based on the ranks of those gods, so Yukiteru symbolizes Jupiter or in greek Zeus (who is the boss of the gods). Thats why he is number one) that holds a diary (his cellphone). He has become an observer that take notes of everything he sees. Along with that he has an imaginary friend (or at least he thought he was imaginary) Deus Ex Maxima the god of time and space. On a day after a weird conversation with Deus Ex Maxima about an unknown power, he stands up and was planning to write something in his diary. But he discovers that it is already filled in. First he thought it is fake and that he did it in his sleep or something. But still decided to give it a test but without any expectation of Yuki everything happened exactly as it is written. From throwing a double bullseye to getting the answers of a test he had that day. After that all 12 discovered the power of the diary Deus Ex Maxima took them all together with their bodies hidden as a shadow for each other. Then he starts explaining them the rules. It basically is the last one who survives becomes the new god of time and space. They yet don\u2019t knowing each other's names or faces. They start looking for each other with just one clue their mirai nikki. Already the second day  Yuki was discovered by Yuno (number 2) that has a Yuki diary. But she asked to cooperate with him cause she sees everything what will happen to him while he sees what he will see in the future. So together they have a perfect view on his future. Just don\u2019t forget that nobody can be trust in a game like this and just imagine that someone knows everything you do even before you do.\\n\\n\r\nGuess you can start to understand now why I think it has so much potential. It isn\u2019t just a survival game. It is way more original than that. Especially because that not two mirai nikkis are the same. The way this psychological thriller starts is insane. You know what will happen and only people with a mirai nikki can change that. However when the future is changed that much that you are going to die. The only thing the mirai nikki says is dead end, then you need to change the future as quick as possible. But the biggest problem is that you don\u2019t know what you need the change. Another great thing is that it isn\u2019t predictable at all. You simply never know who is going to die next.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is said you probably have a good idea of the principles of the story. So now I can go further on the other elements. To be honest there is only one thing that really made me fell in love with this serie. That reason is Yuno. She is just the most insane character I ever saw. Her unbelievable love for Yuki, The way she does everything with passion especially killing is so great. She is just a real psychopath that isn\u2019t one bit predicable. She can be the best girlfriend you could ever wish for while tomorrow it might be the baddest you ever had. Yuki wasn\u2019t bad either he just needs time to blossom in a beautiful character while Yuno was that insane from the beginning. Unfortunately things can never be perfect. Because Yuno is such a wonderful well thought character the other characters are being placed at the background and not only that. Because of that they other characters aren\u2019t also well developed and thought out. It is so unfortunate that the best part of the serie causes one of the baddest parts of the serie.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest it has a bit or even plenty of everything. The emotions the serie creates cannot be expressed in words. It is full of despair that creates hope. They can let you feel like two persons. It was the first time I had experienced that I was sad and happy at the same time. It isn\u2019t completely like that. It was actually more that something happened and that I didn\u2019t know how I should\u2019ve felt about it. Even though I didn\u2019t knew what I felt, I knew for sure that the music only made it even ten times stronger. So however I was full of emotion I didn\u2019t knew which one it was. They just mindfucked me so mutch that they literally made a autist of me. The voice acting and the Ost can really do a lot here under the right circumstances. The rest (drawings, excitement) where nothing special, they aren\u2019t bad though.\\n\\n\r\nSo it is really unfortunate that the middle was full of boring and bad fillers where the creative level sinks for more than hundreds of meters. Otherwise this could\u2019ve been the best anime ever in my opinion.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki \u2013 A bloody psychological/supernatural thriller. Initially you will no doubt notice similarities between Mirai Nikki and the incredibly popular Death Note, but in the end its completely different.\r\nThrowing middle-schoolers and deranged psychopaths(or in case of Yuno both at the same time) into a battle royale that will decide who will become the next god of time and space \u2013 Mirai Nikki is great series, but definitely not for everyone.\r\nArt 7/10\r\nThe art of Mirai Nikki is decent, but by no means great.  Animation is not always fluid, there are allot of undetailed objects, and characters are by no means pretty. However the artdirection Mirai Nikki has taken fits the story very well. Its dark, its bloody and psychopaths look like psychopaths(but more on that in character section of this review). As the source material \u2013 the manga is not pretty(average at best), the anime adaptation actually improves the characters in my opinion, while staying faithful to the source material.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki\u2019s openings are truly great, especially the first one, they fit the anime perfectly, the animations might contain spoilers but in a way that you will not realise that you are seeing a spoiler. Ending songs, are decent as well  once again first one being better. The OST is also very good, especially during the fights in the last part of the anime.  Voice acting is splendid \u2013 especially Yuno, her seiyuu(Murata Tomosa) perfectly plays both her cute and innocent side as well as the bloody psychopath side, I was really surprised when I found out her voice actress only had one other role: a supporting character in Desetsu no Yuusha no Desetsu \u2013 after her amazing performance in Mirai Nikki I think we will be hearing her quite often. Other voice actors also did a solid job, but nothing groundbreaking there.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\\n\r\nStory in Mirai Nikki is hard to rate: While early on, and in the middle its really good, the last few episodes are a mess. It feels like Mirai Nikki didn\u2019t realise its full potential, it could have been the next Death Note, The Future dairies that characters possess offer a great deal of tactical possibilities, yet most fights involve knifes, hatchets and guns and little thinking. The twists in the story are really unexpected, but not in a way \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of that!\u201d more like \u201cwhat? How is that even possible\u201d, there are plenty of plot holes and inconsistencies(especially later on), that you will have to ignore if you want to enjoy the series... and about ending...let's just say it's ... mediocre although the studio didn't have much to work with - manga ending is arguably even worse..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8+/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought the story was a mixed bag, then just wait until you read about characters. On one hand we have Yukkiteru \u2013 the male lead. He is beyond pathetic with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Its fine if male lead is a weak coward, but he is intelligent, but Yukkiteru is not only weak, cowardly, easy trusting but also incredibly stupid. I guess you could blame it on the fact that he is a middle schooler. But without Yuno he probably couldn\u2019t even tie his shoe laces. Also when you think he has progressed he will go back to his old useless self the next episode. Now the other lead \u2013 Yuno Gasai is completely different, she is an amazing character \u2013 incredibly strong in a fight, smart and obsessed with Yukkiteru. She kills without a second thought, and when someone or something gets in the way of their relationship she wont think twice about murdering said threat.  You don\u2019t see murderous 14 year old psychopaths as main characters often. The rest of the cast is also great (apart from the \u201ctrio of friends from school\u201d, they will definitely piss you off), almost all of the characters have at least a slight mental disorder which is definitely cool.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9+/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Mirai Nikki succeeds, an almost flawless victory in fact. Every single episode ends in a way that you will immediately want to watch next one, there are no fillers(maybe half of 2 episodes). I have really enjoyed the series, even with the plot holes and inconsistencies in the story, however if you are the type of person that really gets annoyed when something doesn\u2019t make much sense or you hate Deus ex Machina (not to be mistaken with the character from this series) then it might not be the best anime for you. There is also plenty of gore - this obviously is a good thing for some and bad for others, none of the gore feels forced and I think it fits the atmosphere of the show perfectly so it is a plus.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8+/10\\n\\n\r\nI was torn between 8 and 9, mostly because Mirai Nikki has many flaws Its going to be 8+. I enjoyed Mirai Nikki immensely, but I can see why people might rate this show 7/10 or even 6/10, it's nevertheless worth watching.",

            "content": "Pro-tip for watching this anime: Don't try to piece together anything cause you'll be wrong unless your imaginative skills are over 9000!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nI think that this anime had a really strong story. Basically the story is that there are 12 people chosen to possess a \"future diary\" which is a diary that is kept on their phones. Using these diaries, the 12 contestants are able to read about the future and what will happen. However, every diary is different as each of them have different things they show. For example one may show if someone is lying and whether they will betray you later whileanother may show you the best way to win a fight (neither of these two examples are in the anime so no spoilers!). As you can imagine, it can be quite crazy at times and you can't really predict what will happen as the diary holders can obviously alter the future to their liking (if possible). Although because of the craziness, there are plot holes that arise but can easily be looked over due to the fast paced action going one.\\n\\n\r\nNow while I did enjoy that aspect of the anime, I didn't find the romance part of the anime too appealing. Usually when you have two people that like each other, more good than bad comes out of it, but in this case more bad than good came out of it and that led to many of our heros dying. Usually because they were trying to save our [pathetic] protagonist that couldn't do jack ****.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing too bad. The colors were a little dull sometimes, but yeah nothing that'll kill you.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nYeah everything sounded very nice. I mean everything from the gunshots to explosions sounded fine. Even the sound of someone's eye coming out was *gags* great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nOH MY GOSH this had to be the worst part about this anime. Yukki, the protagonist, had to be the most annoying character you could ever think up. You know how in mostly everything it's the girl who's the \"damsel in distress\"? Well guess what? This time it's a dude. And the person saving him is... yep a girl. And not just any girl, but a yandere styled girl (a person that is overly obsessed with someone else, usually going to great lengths to care for them). Now you may think this is an ok match up, I mean the roles are just switched what's wrong with the girl being the hero? Well did I mention that she's a psychopath on top of being a yandere? Basically when our main character is in danger, Yuno (the psychopath), will run to save him killing everyone in her path without hesitation (because she's a psychopath so it makes perfect sense). And while that's going on, Yukki is crying. Like I swear, every single episode has at least one scene where Yukii is crying and let me just say that this anime has a timeline of a few months. I'm sorry if I'm ranting, but it's quite awful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nWell the show was certainly one of a kind. I kept trying to piece things together, but I always ended up at the same result: nothing. I think that was great as it left a sense of mystery for each episode especially the later ones. If I could change one thing it has, has, HAS to be the main character. He was so bad as the protagonist that even when he was trying to be good he inadvertently killed someone else. But even so, this is a show that will get you hooked and begging for more.",

            "content": "Anime based on elimination games are usually predictable and uninspiring. Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) started out along the same path, but ended up being one of the more successful anime of the year\r\nStory 10/10\r\nWell plotted story. Its like a balance of love and hate. Though it was gory, the story makes you see why it was needed. Also that it makes you want to know how it will end up like despite the killing. A little cute in a way freaky how the obsession on a guy is but pretty interesting .  _ . \r\nThe story revolves around a 14-year-old middle school boy namedYukiteru Amano. Yukiteru is a complete introvert that doesn\u2019t like to get involved with others and even has his own \u201cimaginary\u201d world where he can talk to Deus Ex Machina (a.k.a. God). One day Yukiteru finds that the diary that he has been keeping on his phone is suddenly filling up with entries that predict the future. After narrowly escaping from the hands of a serial killer, Yukiteru finds out that Deus isn\u2019t just a figment of his imagination, but an actual God. Deus informs Yukiteru that he has been chosen to participate in a battle royale with 11 other people that possess diaries that can predict the future. The winner will take over Deus\u2019s place as God of the world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt I'd give it an 8/10 \\n\r\nSince it not that much was amusing they didn't take much detail on each character. Times when they are giving the look upon a person killing someone should look that scary or shouldn't turn away from their personalities, and image. It wouldn't be nice to scared or turn those people off about the characters they love. But the back round,was quite amusing. Nice landscapes .For such an intriguing series, it\u2019s disappointing that the animation quality ranged from poor to average depending on the scene. Nothing really stood out that made me think \u201cwow, this looks nice\u201d, with the majority of scenes being of acceptable quality. Unfortunately, there were a few moments where I thought that characters looked more like stick figures than anime. The animation isn\u2019t essential to the story, but the varying quality level detracts from the overall enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nSince it sometimes wouldn't fit the situation at.Although the OST's were wonderful. But more fit to be on different kinds of situations through out the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThey plotted the character out well. On each and everyone's personality. Was very much clear if this was the killer, or what ever is up your mind. Times like this leads you to make conclusion or then making references.\\n\r\nThe personalities of the characters are definitely a strong point of Mirai Nikki. While Yukiteru is uninspiring, all of the other participants in the battle royale have some kind of quirk that makes them unique and interesting to watch. For example, one is the leader of a secretive cult that treats her like a god, while another is a young terrorist. Mirai Nikki doesn\u2019t just leave it at that though, as most characters are given a descriptive background. The cult leader was once gang-raped by the very people she\u2019s leading and the terrorist was orphaned in a war zone, leading her on a personal crusade. The most interesting character is by far, Yuno. She isn\u2019t your typical head-over-heels in love girlfriend, but a psychopath bent on destroying anything that comes between her and her love. Yuno is the very definition of a yandere, which is someone who is so in love that it causes them to act in extremely violent ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nWith no doubt will end making you wanting for more.\\n\r\nEveryday craving another yet interesting episode. Too bad theres no more season 2 :P\\n\\n\r\nOverall is an 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the striking things about Mirai Nikki is that it has no reservations about using extreme violence. Those looking for action will find plenty of it here. There is everything including stabbing, mutilation, guns, poison, and explosions. What makes it even more shocking is that most of the characters are still underage. The extremes to which the children in Mirai Nikki will go to achieve their goals is disturbing but it\u2019s what keeps you on the edge of your seat through the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t mind some inconsistent animation and want to see some bloody action with a good plot, then definitely check out Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way theres an OVA-ish for those who have finished Mirai Nikki. Called the Next project showing around the month of June? Or April.",

Of course i have seen more mysterious anime's like Bakemonogatari,Mekakucity Actors etc. So here's my review for Mirai Nikki (TV).\r\nStory (9/10): Ok i reaalllyy like these anime's that have the Genre: Action,Mystery,Horror,Thriller types...so much that i even watch a whole anime in one day. :D and the first episode till episode 7 got me HOOKED!! I was like:OMG Another another!! XD. A Bystander Teenage boy who doesn't interact wwith many people. And is always writing in his what we may call \"Diary\" which my curiosity mode switch got flipped on. So to describe the story for me its a 9. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): The art in this show is quite normal in my sight..because i really don't understand true \"Art\" yet in anime. But if i had to describe it....for example the eyes and hair...are a bit way out of line sometimes?? Like the eyes are far away from their original position? Meh...well it still got me excited every episode anyway :D so....7.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): Ok...the sound in this anime is BADASS...really like it!! It fits the situation perfectly..! Heart Racing Scenes,Heart Warming Scenes. Even the OP and ED Song are good!! I like it very much so....8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): Hmm...this is one of my \"Most Important Part of the review\" comes...i really..really....really!!! Hate the MC in this show...he acts like a wimp and like a girl!! (even if he does get badass later on) i still hate his first impressions he had on me..so why did my score in this one still got a 8/10?? Because of the Female Protagonist..The most weridest and Psychotic lover and stalker you will ever have! XD. So she made up for the MC's stupid actions. So therefore 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): What can i say?? This show really thrills me a lot!! A lot of suspense and intensity and curiosity! You will really get hooked on it :P....so here it is!! 8..!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10): Overall this review summarizes up my \"Own Opinion\" so the other's who dislike my review please don't hate me for it :( newbie in MAL even though i already watched anime for 2 years....well of course the anime itself captivates me with different aspects and genres that i will be left confused..which is what i expect from these genres >:D. So overall it's a 9/10 for me!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for taking your time on a newbie such as me on reading my review for Mirai Nikki (TV) ;) Good day all",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is the anime that made me realize how amazing japanese animation can be. Although, it's not as enjoyable for everyone. For say, if you don't like death and gore, chances are you won't like this anime, but without further ado, let's start the review.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nTo do this anime justice, you really need to look at the story in two parts, concept and plot. The concept of the story is actually amazing, basically twelve humans are given devices from the god of time and space, Dues Ex Machina, called \"future diarys\" that allow them to see up to 90 days into the future.Then, as explained by Deus, he is nearing his death and commands the diary holders to kill each other in a survival game, and the last man standing becomes Dues' replacment. This sounds great on paper, but as the story starts developing after gradually going through the anime, it feels as if it's just pushing you through a pile of cow manure and at the end is the largest peice of shit you've ever seen, the ending. I won't spoil the ending, but i'm going to say you WILL be dissapointed, and the stupidest part is that the OVA, Mirai Nikki Redial, I presume is there only to fix the shit ending, and THAT is still bad aswell! To sum it up, if you liked the concept, you will still enjoy the series and be able to get enjoyment out of the later episodes. BUT, if you don't like the concept, you might as well drop it before reaching Episode 10. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation looks great, the characters look great, and the blood sure looks great! And that's great, because you'll be seeing alot of blood! That's really all I can say for the animation, it's great!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nMirai Nikki's soundtrack is phenomenal. Opening 1 sounds amazing, it's fast, catchy, and is something I could listen to for hours without wanting to bash my head in AHEM Caramelldansen AHEM- Jokes aside, Ending 1 isn't as catchy as OP 1, but it definetly is pleasing to the ears. Opening 2 is my favourite track of the bunch. Yes, I like it better than OP1, mainly because it shows off all of the diary holder's powers. Sure, it's not as fast or catchy as OP1, but I'd rather sing this then that. Ending 2 is the worst track, just because it dosen't feel like any of the other songs at all! Overall, the sound really is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10 \\n\r\nThe characters are BY FAR the best thing about Mirai Nikki. Aside for the cowardly main character, Yukiteru, all of them are likable in one way or another. And there are ALOT of characters, so your bound to find one or two you like. I mean, Yuno is a murderous psychopath yandere, Fifth is a five year old who has access to poison gas and other deadly weapons, Ninth is the best terrorist ever, and Twelfth (My personal favourite diary holder) basically thinks he's a superhero of justice, and that's just to name a few awesome characters!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nAside from the bashing I did on the story earlier, you will find at least something to enjoy about Mirai Nikki. Please, give it a chance, even if the story turned you off. \\n\\n\r\n Overall - 9/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, Mirai Nikki is the anime that made me like anime, and there is a reason why. Maybe it's because i've always liked shows with alot of characters, or maybe it's because I like gore. I really hope this review made you at LEAST interested in Mirai Nikki, and to be honest, all of the great things about this anime probobly will pull you through the bad story in the later episodes. So, with that, thanks for reading! \\n\\n\r\nP.S: This was my first review! :D \\n\\n",

Twelve contestants have been selected to participate in a survival game where the winner becomes the next god. The main element introduced is the usage of diaries that can predict the future. The idea is incredible and it drives the anime really well. Diaries being put on mobile phones works very well in a way that it allows them to easily blend into modern society. Future being accessible, but varied with the interference of otherplayers, gives conflict between the users a lot of potential. The life-link between the user and the diary adds some thrill as well. \\n\\n\r\nIn the several opening episodes, future diaries were utilized well during conflict, especially for combat. In the early stages of this anime combat feels very rushed. Going into the middle of the series, future diaries don't appear as a crucial component to winning the fight itself which completely bashes the logic behind this anime. Strategic diary usage is suddenly replaced with Yuno's crazy instincts and reaction times which yes - can be completely justified after watching the whole series, but make cruising through the anime a lot less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters which you might deem important are being killed within seconds. A chunk of contestants are eliminated very fast which makes them feel more like pawns than characters. One would think all the emphasis would be focused around the competition, when side characters end up being more important for the series than most of the contestants themselves. From a perspective of a viewer that does not yet know the whole story behind Yuno, some actions and decisions were completely unexplanatory. Foreshadowing of her character has only been very slight and the truth being more gradual would surely make this series more enjoyable. On the other hand, her being a complete lunatic obsessed with Yukki actually works surprisingly well in the end. The way she took Yukki for granted right from the beginning illustrates that quite well. She carried the whole show since Yukki was too busy being a complete coward. \\n\\n\r\nNow Yukki's character progression has been pretty much non-existent. His motivation for friends has been justified by not having any during his school days, when all he truly needed was protection. You'd expect his confidence and independence would rise throughout the series. They only appear as occasional spikes and happen in the presence of others, which makes him a character completely unable of being independent. The source of protection he was receiving never truly mattered. The choice between friends and Yuno has always been the one which appeared safer. In a situation where Yuno locked him in, he trusts his friends more, and later he ends up killing them himself. Main character being completely unable of becoming more confident makes going through the series quite unenjoyable but it somehow feels crucial at the very end. Also, the fact that Yukki wasn't utilizing his observant nature felt very disheartening, i.e Yuno noticing there were no starches on fake phones.\\n\\n\r\nThe 4th was shaping up into a what seemed to be a really impactful character. I felt like the police would have been a significant factor since the character would represent the police, he was a diary holder that had an army on his fingertips. It was really sad to see this character go completely insane and get eliminated, after which the police completely loses any function in the series despite all the chaos and murders happening. Minene Uryuu, the 9th, was a really great character. She changed significantly after getting her eye stabbed tough. Her past is explained quite well and she goes from being a crazy terrorist to realizing the game and situation she's put in. She was the only character that stayed true to her spirit and motivation. Her progress is very natural and she takes a role of a really stable well-rounded character.\\n\\n\r\nThe frames are really well-drawn and they show a lot of detail while the the animation did not have the chance to shine apart from the last few episodes. There isn't much memorable music played apart from the emotional piano theme and the violin battle theme which are definitely quite significant. More often it felt like music was used as a filler to the sounds. A lot of sounds that lean towards horror have been used in this psychological thriller, which matched the quick bursts of movement nicely.\\n\r\nHumor in this anime series was handled pretty well. It holds a few memorable humour scenes most notably the one where Nishijima is very direct about his relationship goals with Uryuu. Anime humor does not appeal to me most of the times, but there were a couple of scenes that were pretty funny. I thought the addition of murmur in a from of a sketch at the end of the episode was amazing since it works as an optional addition. You can focus on anime when shit gets serious if you don't like the moment being spoiled by humor, which you can easily get back to later. Additionally, closing scenes with murmur provide some minor explanation of all the characters making your understand them just a tiny bit better.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a series that will blow you mind away and make you rethink everything that happened throughout the series, but I feel like there wasn't enough effort put into making episodes more enjoyable. A lot of optional conflicts have been very shallow and the tense parts ended way too early. The story line midst series can be summed up as Yuno being psychotic over and over again. Most of the emphasis was put into the grand final, making the story lack some progressive development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 \\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nSetting: 10\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nEsthetics: 9\\n\r\nPotential Used: 5\\n\r\nCliffhang: 8\\n\\n\r\n6.8 Final\\n",

            "content": "I came to check out the horrifying theme this show has that I keep hearing about. Turns out, people weren't wrong. First few seconds and it's already something gruesome.\r\nHonestly, this show is really confusing from start to end but luckily I have decent deduction ability so I was able to catch up with the plot. Still.. confusing though. I haven't really seen other series that have a similar plot to this so it's somehow a bit unique for me. Still.. I really can't seem to describe this show or find something else to say about it because I was kind of lost the whole timeI was watching it. Though my expectations were met and I now understand how the story goes, I still have that hint of dissatisfaction left in me. I can't exactly say what this series lacks but I think there is a lack of depth in the plot and story progression. I also thought that this series was a bit rushed even though the pacing was mostly adequate. I don't know if this show was great or kind of disappointing in general. Although I can see the amount of effort put into this and that is why I gave it this rating. I also can't say that I enjoyed it because I didn't get quite a grasp of the thing this show tries to say. \\n\\n\r\nWith the 4 genres that this show is tagged with: Psychological, Supernatural, Thriller and Mystery, I was kinda expecting great excitement that will kill boredom naturally but it seems that they were not properly blended with each other and therefore came out a bit wrong. The supernatural genre was pushed a bit too far with this show and it's like it forgot what reality was. Although the story gets progressively intense and it seems the thriller part went well with this. I was also wondering why it had the element of shounen having the characters with those kind of mindsets. But then this show is clearly not for kids. The amount of nudity here is something not even ecchi series can't offer and the violence can be compared to those horror titles. One thing I can appreciate from this series is the omake in every episode helps release the tension acquired from the progress in every episode. I guess that's the only part that I enjoyed from this. Mirai Nikki had its upsides and downsides but I guess I can now see why this show made it to become one of the popular ones out there. I do recommend it to the mature audience because I don't think kids can handle this stuff.",

            "content": "EDIT: So, on reading this review after awhile, I realize I'm being a bit mean (actually really, really mean). It's purely hyperbolic. While I can't say I enjoyed the show, please keep in mind I bear no ill will towards anyone involved with the production of this show (creating an animated show is extremely difficult, and I have nothing but respect for those who work on one) even though that's how I may come across in this review. The meanness is just me trying to be funny. \r\nI hate this show. It is without a doubt, one of the worst anime I have ever seenand I have no clue why people like it. Calling this show a travesty, a complete mess or an abomination would be too kind. BTW this review is going to be filled with spoilers from the show. Not that I'd ever encourage anyone to watch this...thing. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, I'll be fair. Let me start with the \\n\\n\r\nTHINGS I LIKE:- \\n\r\n(+)um...............it has a nice premise. Yeah, it's a battle royale with the players having the ability to read their future. Too bad the potential was squandered by the terrible writing but yeah, the premise is good. \\n\r\n(+).......................................................oh yeah, in one of the episodes there is this white-haired gay dude who creates a strategy to defeat an opponent and this strategy makes sense. Too bad it's the only thing that makes sense in this entire \"series\" and the rules this strategy took into account for only mattered in that one episode, but yeah, that was there \\n\r\n(+)and um..................................................................................................................................................\\n\r\n.............................................................................................................nope, that's it. \\n\\n\r\nSo, thanks for reading my review, fans of Mirai Nikki, and please leave your wonderful, smart, positive, constructive criticism which........oh, to hell with it, I'm going to be killed anyways. \\n\\n\r\nTHINGS I DON'T LIKE:- \\n\r\nEverything else. I'll just get the animation and sound out of the way. They were the only decent things in this entire show. I did not find the animation to be anything great and I don't remember any of the songs apart from the first opening. I won't say I hated but I definitely did not like them. There was CGI in the show, and it looked terrible. Some of the animation was rather clunky. Some scenes with a lot of blood and gore had a very light colour palette which felt off. Character designs were alright except for a muffin lady who probably had it's origins on toilet paper. As for the sound, I've forgotten about it. Nothing else to say here. \\n\\n\r\nSo apart from that, what is it that this show does so wrong? \\n\r\n(-)The Premise So the start of the show is that there is this Shinji Ikari clone(albeit without the depth and struggles) who always writes has daily events on his cellphone like a diary and has an imaginary friend and one day he finds out that this imaginary friend of his is actually The God Of Time And Space and he has chosen twelve or thirteen or some number of people (including him) to fight a battle royale to the death where each of the participants' phones have the ability to show them text messages about what is going to happen to them in the future. So does that mean that every single one of them had to imagine Deus ex Machina(I'm not joking, that's the god's name....probably a symbolic representation for what the entire show is about) the exact same way? Seems kinda weird some of them would even have imaginary friends considering that even the police captain and the mayor of the city are involved. How are these guys selected? Are they chosen at random or does the god choose them? The reason I bring this up is because... \\n\\n\r\n(-)The Participants Some of the participants include -an antisocial boy -a chick who should be in an asylum -that muffin lady who would normally never hurt anyone -a cult leader who never leaves a room because she has bad eyesight(instead of wearing spectacles) and has been molested by cult members as a child -a five year old (not a typo....for real) -an atheist (whose first act as god is to kill anyone who believes in god) But hey, he's a god, he knows everything. He also knows that setting a death tournament to decide the next God will result in the winner being of sound mind and body with positive ideals and good thoughts and values. The only thing the writers had to do in order to make it a little more sensible would be to make the god a god of death. Thus, it makes more sense for the participants to kill each other. I mean, the god of time and space doesn't do much to influence either of these things in the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that makes this whole thing worse is how retarded the characters behave. Firstly, every one of them goes against our protagonists instead of ever fighting each other. There is also a rule that says that if one breaks the phone of a participant, that participant dies. Which is something our characters will do only when the plot calls for it and it will always be in favour of the protagonists. There were so many instances where the characters could easily get rid of their opponents but unfortunately there is something else going on inside their heads. Things got to a point where one of the villains (i.e. everyone besides the protagonist, because everyone ends up betraying the protagonist) is actually able to get the protagonist's phone, but instead of destroying it, he waits until the protagonist arrives at the scene and then gives the phone to the protagonist's father, and asks him to break the phone! Thirdly, everyone has a Future Diary (that cellphone) but they will only read it when the plot calls for it. If any of you do a dare where you have a glass of beer every time an incident could have been avoided if the characters had just looked at their f*king diaries, you would probably be dead within five episodes. Unfortunately, there are more pressing matters for the characters to undertake such as going to school right after you've had a near death experience. Furthermore, no one has any proof that killing these people and becoming a God will allow them to do whatever they want to do which is, I don't know! What would five year old's want to do after becoming god? \\n\\n\r\nAnd no, the nonsense doesn't end there \\n\r\n-the chick, named Yuno- a name you may never have heard of- regularly murders people, and she has murdered a LOT of people including SWAT members who were told that this girl is a psychopath. In one of the episodes, she was taken into custody, and guess what, they just let her go. Genius! \\n\r\n-Yuno's parents used to mistreat Yuno because, and I quote from this anime's wiki, \"Yuno's mother was ill and believed she was a terrible wife and mother, and believed punishing Yuno was her only way to earn happiness.. While Yuno's father was objective to his wife's severe treatment of Yuno, he did little to nothing to stop her.\" Amazing! \\n\r\n-The five year old was chosen because he is the smartest five year old child in the world. I don't know how smart that is but it appears to be smart enough that the child can order poisons and gas masks the size of five year olds. Genius! \\n\r\n-We need to find out the identity of a particular diary user. What should we do? Oh, I know! Lets look at stocks! \\n\r\n-The mayor of the city converts an entire city's phones into future diaries. Oh my god! So evil! Our protagoninsts have to rush there to stop him now. Yuno what that means? Genocide of innocent civilians by our protagonists! \\n\r\n-Oh no! All phones in the city have been converted into future diaries! What is the reaction of the general population to such a huge event?.......................<no reaction>...........<citizens don't give a damn>\\n\r\n -Oh no! An apocalypse which is destroying the world has started! And guess what? The apocalypse is only around the ten people we know! I am not joking! There is not a single soul in the entire world aside from these people! \\n\r\n-And you know what? The master planner of everything was not Deus ex Machina but his chibi assistant who had planned everything, including the love between Yuki and Yuno, the gay detective guy, the mayor and more! And guess why she does it? Because she's having fun! \\n\\n\r\nAnd guess what! This is just some of the nonsense that happens in this series. And what I've written down here is merely a little glimpse into it. \\n\\n\r\n(-)Romance \\n\r\nLets play a game here, shall we? At the end of the series, Yuki(the protagonist) and Yuno finally get together. Tell me, what do you think, I thought when I saw that scene: \\n\r\na)<Yaaay> \\n\r\nb)<eh, whatever> \\n\r\nc)<groan> \\n\\n\r\nIf you thought b or c, then I am sorry, I did not enjoy this show as much as you think I did. This scene I talked about took place in an OVA that was released after the series. And it was something I did not watch as my soul was a bit too drained at that point. And that's because the romance in this show sucked! It was a one sided relationship for 95% of the series and it was based upon the fact that Yuno had an infatuation for Yuki which he doesn't share. And then a part comes where Yuki finally starts to like Yuno. And guess what Yuno does in return? She drugs Yuki, locks him up in a house and force-feeds him inedible food until that perfect day comes, as written in my future diary, where me and Yuki will finally 'become one'! Aw. And if you thought that Yuki(after being saved) now hates Yuno, you are clearly living in the real world which is not something Mirai Nikki wants. No here, after just one episode, Yuki forgives Yuno and things go back to square one. Oh and their next villains are beaten by them because 'their love is stronger' than this established couple's who have good reason to love each other! Amazing, right? And later that fateful day comes where Yuki and Yuno 'become one' and they do! Aw. I wonder what the next logical step will be. Oh, I know! How about Yuno takes out an axe out of her ass and tries to kill Yuki! And the Oscar for best screenplay goes to Mirai Nikki! \\n\\n\r\nYuno has no good reason to like Yuki the way she does. But she virtually becomes a slave for Yuki and is completely loyal and faithful to him! She is willing to die for Yuki because she is infatuated to him. She is willing to keep him for days in a stinking room, drugging him and force-feeding him crap just so she may one day 'become one' with Yuki. And Yuki, for the most part, sees her as an annoyance and only uses her to get him out of trouble and to kill his enemies and he knows that Yuno is a psychopath who keeps dead bodies inside her house. They're romance is unrealistic and Yuno needs to be sent to an asylum. \\n\\n\r\nSo there, I hate this show and I would encourage everyone to stay away from it. Unless, I guess, if you enjoy watching terrible shows because you find them funny because of how bad they are. So yeah, I know that my inbox is probably going to be filled with comments telling me to kill myself, but whatever, I don't care. I hate this show and I give it a biased score of 3/10. \\n",

Hasnot much friends except the god of time and space himself, who is also a part of his imagination.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality is very good, available in 1080p (Violent and Ecchi Content Included). For avoiding spoilers, DO NOT, i repeat, do not watch the opening or the ending song till you finish the anime completely. The background scores, OSTs and soundtracks compels you to think more and more about the plot further. Character development is the best thing that you will experience in the whole series(specially a hot overly attached girlfriend). Each and every character has its own importance and uniqueness. You won\u2019t find a single character useless (even for a very less time). Now, the best part, climax, thrill and suspense, which ..... I won't tell you. Go watch it yourself and get your mind blown. Final Verdict, if you love anime like, Death Note, Steins Gate, Monster, etc., do watch it.",

I will protect you.\" - Gasai Yino\r\n[This review is kind of spoiler free]\r\nIf you are a somewhat knowledge anime user, you have probably encountered the infamous queen of the yanderes (someone obsessed on another level with their crush), Yuno. She is obsessed with the male lead of the show and wants to keep him with her forever. She may seem like a useless, dumb psychopath, but she is extremely smart, agile, and powerful. \r\nNow, about the art and the sound. I am not an expert on these two themes, but since I watched a relatively high amount of anime, I can say somestrong points. The art is pretty good since it is very detailed, looks more realistic than the \"old school\" animations, and it even had some very cool fight scenes. About the sound, the OP and EP songs are fine, and the voices + sound effects are fine too. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, what truly made this anime stand out is not its plot, which is also very creative and fun for shounen/adventure audience, but the female lead, Yuno, is something the anime industry has never seem before. '\\n\\n\r\nI guarantee you that after you watch this anime, you will never be able to forget about Gasai Yuno and how she is such a yandere. Some may be afraid of her and become afraid of girls, others will love her and want yandere girlfriends. \\n\\n\\n\r\nand others like me will feel nothing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I recommend this anime if you like a drama/action/adventure plot with a little romance. However, if you do not like a little bit of horror or unrealistic themes, do not watch this. For someone who has no preference, you should try it out.",

But our heroes, same asthe audience knows that redemption may be achieved only through proceeding this, often gory, heart breaking, full of sacrifices and martyr path. \\n\\n\r\nStory in Mirai Nikki is no different, and it's audience shouldn't expect nothing else but having their minds twisted on this mad journey and hearts tugged at the cruelty of faith. Unfortunately if bright enough to foreseen but never to prevent the events. \\n\\n\r\nI'm from Europe and my standards may seem different but going through the list of 10/7/7/7/10/9 i consider the story very unique, even more as the majority of the problem escalates even from Godly grasp, but let's leave it as that, i wouldn't wish to spoil too much. Art should be set to 6/10 but i gave it a higher note, purely out of combat at the end of the series, the part that annoyed me the most were Chibi characters, which were successfully ruining the seriousness of the show. Sound was good, often i had a feeling that they could try harder, but it was actually acceptable to listen, and i didn't mind listening to credits at times. Characters were pretty average, actually the only characters which death made me care enough to shed tears died at the end of the show and concerning family matter (which hero? You'll see in show).  Enjoyment? Yes, very! Watching one episode made me crave to watch seven of them at once, so i eat the whole anime in three attempts. It's like a candy You never have enough of. It's much less complicated then Death Note and Code Geass, but it's still worth seeing, and to some even favoring it. \\n\\n\r\nGood Luck at watching this Anime, i'm giving it a 9/10, and a must see for everyone who enjoys mind games.\\n",

            "content": "Dear diary, \r\nI always watched anime, even as a kid although I didn't know what anime actually were. About four years ago I found out what anime really means, and one of the first anime I watched as a \"full time\" AnimeGirl was Mirai Nikki or Future Diary. That's why, in this review I will write about this, kinda special, anime show. \r\n-Your AnimeGirl\r\n Plot and Storyline \r\nWell, the first thing you'll probably say after you finish this anime is:\"What on Earth was that?\". \r\nMirai Nikki is, I promise you, the most psychopathic anime you'll see in your life. But that is exactly what itmakes this anime different from all the others. \\n\r\nIn the very beginning we meet Amano Yukiteru (Yuki), a rather shy and anti-social. Poor Yuki, his only friend is a imaginary god called Deus ex Machina(This is a phrase that comes from the Latin language and actually means \"God from the Machine, but never mind, let's move on)-The God of Time and Space. Too bad, this Deus is not imaginary at all. He soon makes Yuki participate in an survivor game where the winner becomes the next God. Here's the thing now. There are twelve contestants, and everyone of them has a diary that predicts them the future, each diary in it's own way. The last one alive is the new God. Yuki was very lucky, because after the game begun Yuno, his classmate, decided to protect him.And damn, that girl has some awesome skills. Now that everything's set, Let the bloodshed begin!\\n\r\nThe fact that all of you should know is that beneath every layer that makes this anime as it is you have the core of it. And it's believe it or not, a Love Story. That's right, the romance between the main characters is the \"engine\" that drives the whole story on. But it indeed is sort of a psychotic love. The romance between Yuki and Yuno is in the beginning rather a one sided love, but after a long \"on and off\" relationship, and some ups and downs they made it. But don't think of it as a boring love story, it'll definitely be the craziest one you'll ever see. Don't miss it.\\n\r\nNow let's focus a bit on the other contestants. They also made one part of the show, and contributed to it everyone in their own way by letting us know about their past. Their back stories play an important part in the show and make it interesting too. And besides, the more villains the better the show, right?\\n\r\nMirai Nikki wouldn't be Mirai Nikki if there weren't this many plot twists. That's crazy how much surprise lies in each episode. The makers really did a great job. A lot of anime makers get lost while \"twisting\" the plot and the result is a mash of unrelatable stories that just confuse you, and ruin the story as a whole. Future Diary is not the case, the story line was not ruined, it was exciting and interesting till the very end.  \\n\r\nTalking about the end, it will take much concentration if you want to understand why everything so far happened. So keep calm, and if you don't understand something watch it again. It is not so hard to understand but it becomes a mash of things that happened in the past, some other dimensions and the present that's complicated alone on its own.\\n\r\nThis is in short the story of The Future Diary, or something like that.\\n\\n\r\n Characters \\n\\n\r\nWell, if this is not a crazy bunch of personalities. This thriller anime really bombed me with mostly crazy, then funny, irritating etc. characters. \\n\r\nThe important thing about the personalities of the characters is that their diaries kinda reflect their personality, hobby, job etc. \\n\r\nIn this way trough the knowledge of the diary type you can easily guess a part of the diary user, which I found very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nYUNO GASAI is the sickest character ever. Still, I loved her for being like that. She was funny, awesome and always full of surprises. You really never know what that girl's gonna do next. She is also clever, fighting with both strength and mind. A lot of people hate her character because she is a psycho, but there is not a single character that could be compared to her. She looks like a cute, little girl that is possessed by an evil demon that she can't control. One one side you have her soft and caring side, and in an instant of time she turns in a killer machine.Typical Yandere. But the most important thing to tell about her is her ability to love. It's something like this: \"I love you so much that I'll kill you so nobody else does\". That's really something. Yuno you truly are awesome.  \\n\r\nI literary hate this guy. He is one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen. AMANO YUKITERU or YUKI is a perfect example of a cry-baby. He is a anti-social mother's son who gets scared in a second. He always depends on someone else and hardly gets something done on his own. But, I have to say that he had an immense character development in the end. It was a totally different Yuki than the one we had in the beginning. He becomes a bit stronger and more independent in the end. The thing that made me not hate him that much was the OVA episode Mirai Nikki Redial, whre he...(now this would be a huge spoiler). However, I can't get the similarity between him and Shu from Guilty Crown aout of my head. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is satisfactory. It is not breath-taking but it is good. There are two things that I'd like to commend. Fistly the character look of Yuno. It is amazing how they handled to make her look cute and creepy at the same time. Amazing. \\n\r\nThe second thing is the opening. It is kinda done in an interesting way, and the mix of fastly moving screens and the creepy music were perfect. But it really gives someone the creeps. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIf you like action, fights and thriller you will love this anime. If you want a good love story you will also love this anime. Mirai Nikki has something for everybody. Don't listen to people who say it is just a story about a sick girl that is in love. NO! Future Diary is definitely more than that. It is catchy, interesting and extremely amusing. I enjoyed watching it, I am sure you'll too. MIRAI NIKKI!\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

            "content": "Hmm, how do I start this. Actually, I didn\u2019t like Mirai Nikki before (while it was airing.) and placed it on hold. I was thinking, it was just the average survival game with a grand prize, so I stopped there. But that isn\u2019t the only reason for giving it up. At that time, there were heavy spoilers everywhere, people/fans talking what\u2019s gonna happen next, how they like the ending, what is the plot twist, and everything. Yes, it is a really popular anime and gained fans everywhere. Popularity somehow means discussion and discussion somehow means spoiler. It was stupid of me to read through thembut in the end, I didn\u2019t care. I liked the idea when I learned what\u2019s going to be the ending, I kinda imagined things, maybe even enough for my own fanfiction. after some time, I gave it some thought to finish the anime. So, enough of my own thoughts, let\u2019s proceed to the review. I minimized the amount of spoilers here to be safe.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT \u2013 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is neat, though what I didn\u2019t like is they are throwing out too much mystery then suddenly explaining it towards the end. I\u2019m sorry, my brain just couldn\u2019t handle that much. As I said, it is neat. I didn\u2019t really notice any plot holes or maybe I was just too hooked to the story to notice. For a survival game, I found interesting is the feeling you get from the story. It has the potential to bring out the feels in you. And yes, I admit, I cried a few times in several scenes. Also, there are a few plot twists which totally messed up my predictions in the story. I was like, what? The story is quite unique, I would say. There are many overused plots, character stories and backgrounds but this managed to stand out from them. I may have said I didn\u2019t notice any plot holes in the story but the part I didn\u2019t like is why did they have to face each and every contestant. I mean, there are 12 participants and one or two may have killed each other off because facing the others. Though they were able to use that effectively and I realized that the anime wouldn\u2019t be that great if it weren\u2019t for that. So for all the headaches, mindblown, feels, mysteries, plot twists, and everything they gave me through the plot. I gave it back a 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nART \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI like the art, yes, but I\u2019m still not going to give it a 10/10. I don\u2019t think the bloody scenes isn\u2019t enough for this anime, but I know that\u2019s just me. In fact, I\u2019m sure that the bloody scenes were just enough, it isn\u2019t overused and also not underused. The fight scenes were good though, I haven\u2019t watched some good fight scenes in a while since most are quite repetitive. Mostly you get is an overpowered main character who you know would win each and every battle and sometimes (worse, always) gets away with no scratches. The way they beat the opponent changes though and I\u2019ll give some credit for that. But this time its different, I actually got some thrill from this anime and I liked that. Also, there are 26 episodes in total, just enough for the whole story. You see lately, I feel that a manga\u2019s potential to be a great anime is reduced when it is adapted to just a few episodes and they try to compress the story to fit the number of episodes which I think is such a waste. So anyway, I\u2019ll give the art and animation a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very very good, in some way. I mean, the OP definitely fits the anime and its plot. Although I can\u2019t comment much on the ED since when it rolls, I start to think about the episode I just watched. You see, I just mentioned that the throw too much mystery at once. I try to anticipate the next events there. Anyways, before we get off topic. I think the background music during several scenes were a huge part of how it can bring out the feels. I mean, the story itself is kinda lonely, but without a great music to back it up, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll end up the same. I so loved both the two OP, they bring out some excitement like somehow the adrenaline rush. It makes me active, I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ll give it an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCAST \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI like how they used characters with so different personalities and how they made their background story but I don\u2019t think its great enough for a 10/10. You see, you get a main character who is always dependent. Yes, I understand how he is afraid of killing, who likes to kill anyway. Maybe me, but it isn\u2019t allowed, so\u2026 Off topic. I don\u2019t really like his character but he taught me some things I didn\u2019t expect. I was thinking that if I would be the main character, I\u2019ll get no hesitation to kill or whatsoever. I mean, when everything is THAT messed up, what choice do you get? None. But I learned that talking is important and the truth plus the reasons behind the events, will forever be hidden if we only resort to violence. In the end, I liked the main cast despite hating him before since I was like looking at a mirror. Like the pathetic hopeful dreamer I was. 9/10 if that was the only case. But I thought that, how come these people get this kind of background story and yet. Ugghh. There are some things I can\u2019t comprehend. I mean, there are people who I know are powerful enough to win but didn\u2019t. Pure luck or destiny maybe? Nah, it was the author\u2019s decision. Anyway like I mentioned above, main cast meeting each of them and learning their story, was an effective plot towards the ending. Such background story is 9/10 but the cast itself is 7/10. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the whole anime. It lasted in my brain for quite some time and I know for sure that the lessons and stories will be in my heart forever. Yes, I\u2019m quite serious in that and not just being cheesy. I mean, it managed to slip into my dreams so this anime may have been special to me. I watched it continuously with such excitement and happiness so I can\u2019t deny that I really enjoyed this anime. With all the anime that\u2019s been aired and airing, some just leaves a special mark in history and I give this one a nice thumbs up for that along with the anime which I really enjoyed before.",

They are the type of characters that makes you say 'oh not again' whenever they show up in the series, and since their are the main characters, sometimes it's difficult to watch they doing the same things and saying the same things over and over and over...\\n\r\nYuno is supposed to be the misterious badass girl in the anime yet she's so predictable and meh. \\n\r\nIf you can stand both of them, then the rest is pretty awesome, but those two really ruined what could be one of the greatest anime in this type of genre.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this based on the recommendations seen here on MAL.  After Steins;Gate I was looking for something kind of on par in terms of weirdness, and I got a LOT more than I bargained for here.\r\nThe basic premise is, the main character Yuki - for reasons I won't get into - is able to see future events via his cell phone.  Using this, he has a chance at becoming a god.  That's all I'm saying, from here you can guess why there may be conflicts with this, and where some of his enemies may sprout from.  I wasvery cautious with the reviews I read, and the whole series was just a complete surprise to me.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething this show did well was leading you into thinking one direction, then taking you somewhere else.  I don't know if I'd call it plot twists, but they're just simple explanations that you may not have considered.  That said, the scale of the story is pretty ambitious.  So it retains a balance between simplicity and complexity that kind of leads you guessing what's going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as just small enjoyment, there wasn't an episode where I didn't utter \"What the hell..\" during.  Not all the turns this story takes are huge revelations in terms of the overall plot, just subtle events that make you feel very uneasy that may or may not come back to haunt the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were overall pretty great, I can't say I have any complaints in that regard.  One thing I have to say is the initial intro is probably one of the best I've ever seen.  There wasn't an episode where I wanted to fast forward through it (until it was updated of course).  This goes along with my comment on the music, which absolutely leaves an impression.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with this show.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed every minute of it.",

After all, it's managed to obtain a huge amount of fans, especially for characters like the \"lovely\" Yuno Gasai. And it's not for nothing; the series has a very original plot that I can't say I've seen before even if it's, in its most basic form, a last-man-standing sadism game, similar to series such as Battle Royale.\r\nAnyway, so, why the bad rating? Simple. The characters. They are among the worstly developed and most unrealistic characters I have ever witnessed in any anime and/or manga. Funny considering what attracts the most amountof viewers is actually the characters, namely Yuno and Minene, and dare I say, sometimes even Hirasaka (also known as the weird Power Ranger with a balloon for a head).\\n\r\nI feel the need to explain this better though, mostly because otherwise I'll be bashed by fans on how the characters are extremely well developed and have amazing psychological facters well explained in the anime. Well... that's false. \\n\r\nWhy? I'll explain it character by character. Do not worry, I'll warn if there's gonna be a spoiler.\\n\r\nOkay, let's start with the fan favorite, Yuno, one of the best characters in the series indeed. The fact that she's a psychopath-stalker hides well behind the charade of her meek and cute character, and the events behind why she's insane make perfect sense, after all *SPOILER ALERT* you'd have to have an amazing mental fortress to be able not to go crazy when your crazy mother sticks you in a cage without food just because. *SPOILER END*\\n\r\nYuno, honestly, I don't have TOO much of a problem with...\\n\r\nBut now it's time to get hardcore. My favorite character is Minene, because she's just an awesome badass. Problem; she's a terrorist bomber. A terrorist. She kills innocents just because, and at the beginning of the series kills pretty much all of Yukiteru's classmates except for a couple lucky ones... yet afterwards everyone seems to forget the fact that she's a terrorist and she becomes a cute/badass tsundere... while she's awesome, that's a ridiculous flaw. Also *SPOILER* the fact that a cop falls in love with her and marries her despite her being a mass killer is just laughable. Also, that she has plenty of chances to kill Yukiteru but doesn't for absolutely no logical reason is yet to be explained o_O *SPOILER END*\\n\r\nI've really elongated this a bit too much so I'm just gonna skip to the biggest piece of f****ed up s***t in the series, Yukiteru. From here on out there's gonna be a lot of spoilers so if you haven't seen the series just jump to the last paragraph D:\\n\\n\r\nFirst, he starts of as a whimp. Then, he gets the diary... and remains a whimp. Sure, all okay for now. Then he falls for Yuno despite for her being a stalker...then discovers that she has dead people in a room of her house, that she logically didn't think of hiding or anything. Why even, when it's perfectly hidden in a huge fucking room O_O\\n\r\nSo, he discovers that yet doesn't tell a cop who he knows and just so happens to also be a diary owner... why? No reason. Instead he decides to act like he saw nothing and STILL HANGS OUT WITH YUNO! Sure he acts scared, but that doesn't change the fact he keep staying in the vicinity of a stalking, psycopathic killer... next we have how a new friend of Yukiteru's later reveals herself to be the daughter of a diary owner and tries to kill him... and her innocent friend who seemed adorable also tries to kill people because why not. Then Yuki does some random motivational speech and they are all friends again... even though one of them almost died after being stabbed by another one of them...  NEXT UP! Yukiteru's divorcee father turns out to be a royal asshole who leaves Yuki in a falling building to die while he escapes with the last parachute... and then kills Yuki's mother accidentaly on purpose... and Yuki then decidedly forgives him and wants to see fireworks with him...AND I'M JUST GETTING STARTED GUYS! I also have to add a ton of scenes in a ton of episodes in which Yuki discovers from freaky shit from Yuno, freaks out and stays away from her for an ep or two, and then gets back together with her. Constantly. Like, every 5 episodes. At least. Also, remember how Yuki is supposedly psychologically growing due to all the stress and hardships? Yeah, there actually gets to a point where he apparently doesn't care anymore and starts to kill everyone just to win... two episodes later, mental breakdown, and he drops right back to how he had begun the series. As a worthless whimp. Great psychological evolution, great indeed.\\n\r\nNow as for other flaws I want to point out. Apart from the diaries and Deus, we can more or less see that the world is supposedly our world... so then how is it explained that Hirasaka can create clones of himself and hypnotise people? How come the mayor not only talks to Deus, which we can push aside as the same with Yuki, but also somehow was able to, by himself, create the diares? How does a baby manage to get himself a ton of lethal armament and a gas mask? And forward mail? BEING A BABY? How come Yuno's father, apparently normal, knows that his wife is sick enough to stick his daughter inside of a cage without food for an entire day and doesn't do absolutely anything?\\n\r\n...as for a final scene, mayor spoiler here of course, I want to add that the ending, despite looking like a \"happy ending\", with every character o so happy and such... we have to remember that that's just a different dimension. Those are other people. In our present Yuki's real dimension, he killed his friends. They are dead. Forever. They ain't coming back and they know who killed him. That \"happy ending\" is practically just an illusion. It's like watching a war film where everyone dies but then showing a happy family on the other side of the planet with no care in the world. Sure, they are happy, but our main characters arent'. Not one bit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal paragraph here. So, in general, character development, character psychology... saying this series has it is an insult to psychology... this series is as realistic as Fairy Tail, although luckily this series isn't as bad as that one.\\n\r\nIt looks like I've ripped this series apart, and I won't say I haven't but its still got good things. The story, as I said, is really original and has some unexpected twists, the art is for the most part excelent and its quite enjoyable. The opening and ending songs are also a pleasant treat to listen to. So, good things are plot, art, music and general entertainment, but sadly it's not enough to cover the horrendous and blatantly terrible characters within.",

            "content": "I started watching Mirai Nikki when episode 23 aired. I finished downloading them all at around midnight, and I stayed up until I had watched them all.\r\n -The story is amazing (10). When I started watching, I thought it would a predictable story that wouldn't entertain me at all, but it was quite the opposite. I don't want to spoil anything, though, so I'll just leave it at that.\r\n -Art? Loved it (9). The animation is very good, and it stays with the sort of creepy feel of the anime, while at the same time looking normal when it needs to be. The characters havepupils. I don't know what it is about them, but it adds to the creepiness during the creepy parts.\\n\r\n -Sound. (9). I've enjoyed both of the OPs, especially the first. They both suit the anime very well, and they, unlike some other anime like this, don't show spoilers about the story. In the show itself, the voices and sound effects are great. They avoid having any music at some of the suspenseful parts, and this only adds to the suspense. I personally don't like it when suspenseful music plays at these parts because it just tells me something will happen. The voices are all good, too, especially considering how the seiyuus of both main characters are inexperienced. \\n\r\n -Character (9). Most of the characters develop over the course of the show, especially Yuno. I can't really say much else without super-spoilers, but the  only reason this isn't a 10 is because so far, Yukiteru hasn't developed as much as I think he should have. Not to say he hasn't changed, though, because he has. It would be a 9.5 if I were allowed to give it that.\\n\r\n -Enjoyment (10). It kept me up for about 8 hours or so, from midnight to about 8am. I think that's enough to say how much I enjoyed it. \\n\r\n -Overall (10). Sure, there are more 9/10 ratings than 10/10, but considering how good everything was, 10 seems fair. I think I will forever be a fan of this show, and regardless of your type of anime, you should watch it too. I'm usually a fan of slice of life/comedy type anime, and, hold off the \"lol of course, anything is better than slice of life\" jokes, I enjoyed this to no end. \\n\r\nGet off your ass, stand up, sit back down again, navigate to a site where you can watch this in 1080p, and spend the next 8 hours of your life watching it. That is an order, and you will enjoy it.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review so if I wrote anything that you don't agree on or you just hated my writing skills my apologies. Basically, this anime is about survival horror, psychological, romance, supernatural, suspense. If you like watching characters going CRAZY I recommend you to watch this anime.  It starts of a middle schooler Yukiteru, an anti social bystander who writes everything he see in his phone \"diary\". In his room he talks to his \"imaginary\" friend Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space. Deus told Yukiteru to participate in a \"Royal Battle\" with other eleven people. Thiseleven \"diary holders\" would have to kill each other and the last one standing gets to replace Deus. The diary has it unique ways to predict the future and trapped each other \"diary holders\" to a \"dead end\".\\n\r\nStory=9\\n\r\nThe story is amazing and it keeps me watching and waiting for a new episode each week. As you watch the anime along, you'll start to ask questions and it would just drive you insane. It's fantastic how almost all diary holders had a rough past and would do anything for love, power, and vengeance. \\n\r\nArt=8\\n\r\nThe characters is really drawn appealing and their facial reaction is perfect in every scene. But the violence, bloody, gory scenes is not scary or disgusting enough to make puke and not sleep at night. Well which is a good thing because I don't want that to happen to me especially at Sunday night since I have school and all that. :D The art is typically the one you see at most mecha anime but they made the color more lighter.\\n\r\nSound=9\\n\r\nThe first opening really fits the anime and probably the most \"original\" one I've ever listened to. At first I always skipped the opening because it gives me the chills but I got used to it and I totally loved it. \\n\r\nCharacter=8\\n\r\nI would give it a 9 but Yukiteru ruined it. He is the most annoying cry baby character you'll ever meet in the anime. He is one of those \"normal\" characters you'll meet in the anime while the rest are just INSANE which made them cool :D But of course they exaggerated a bit on the characters which made it  either annoying,weird,unrealistic (I know this anime is fiction but come on make the character traits more realistic or human).\\n\r\nEnjoyment=10\\n\r\nAfter watching only the first episode I can't stop watching it. I even read the manga to know what will happen next. Most of the time you'd probably be all serious, cry (a bit), or just scared.\\n\r\nOverall=9\\n\r\nMaybe 9.25 or 9.5. Great anime and I would recommend you to watch it. Not the kind of anime you'll see often. As you watch it, you better like NINE!!!! :) I swear she is the most interesting and attractive girl you'll ever meet in the anime. Have fun watching the anime :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Why should you comfort your butt in front of the lappy get the popcorn and the diet cola?\r\n- Pretty descent animation, awesome facial expressions  (especialy Yuno's), dim backgrounds making you feel the suspence of the series even more.\r\n- Breathtaking action scenes, plot twists one after another, fast pacing while you learn what you need to know about the characters.\r\n- Chaotic protagonist (Yuno) who will make you fall in love with and dispice at the same time.\r\n- B-roleswho actually are important. So no useless acquaintances.\\n\\n\r\n- Interest on the plot from the very first 10 minutes. Plot unfolds really smoothly.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not convinced, then maybe you should continue reading my review. The dissadvantages vary from everyone's taste on animes.\\n\\n\r\n- There is some kind of romance that a few fans may not find convincing, although, the plot unravels through the episodes based on the this \"kind\" of romance. I use the quotes, because this is a psycological thriller, not a romantic story. If you dont like any kind of romance, just trust me.... :)\\n\\n\r\n- You might find the other protagonist repelling, according to you standards on the toughness and strong will you may want a character to be. But that's the spice on the rice! Most of us, if we were in this kind of twisted situation (watch the anime godammit :P ), we would probably be like Yuki!! \\n\\n\r\n- Catharsis isn't always an option on psycological thrillers... And catharsis is ambiguous from viewer to viewer for this anime.\\n\\n\r\n- The story isnt that much innovative, but that's not the point for this anime.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nIf you want my proposition, watch first Magica Madoka the series, after the series watch the 3d movie, then Nikki Mirai and finaly Deathnote. \\n\r\nThe 3 series unravel the inner demons of the protagonists as much as the inner god of their souls.... Give it a try... PLEASE let me know if you found this review USELESS! It would make me happy to know the flaws of my way of thinking! :) :) :)",

            "content": "This review contains no spoilers.\r\nWith a newly acquired and unique future-predicting diary function attached to their cellphones, twelve people spread all over the city get involved in a battle royale to death organized by the current decaying god, in which the winner will become the new god of this world. And so our main character (who happens to be one of the twelve), an ordinary teenager shut-in named Amano Yukiteru, begins his journey accompanied by a mysterious female classmate that seems to know a lot about him. Which one of the Future Diary owners will rise victorious in this bloody thriller where toying with fateis nothing but child's play?\\n\\n\r\nMost synopsis for Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary in english) fail to be clear enough in depicting how amazing its possibilities were in terms of plot. What we get instead is an averagely entertaining show that is best watched with your brain turned off because its flaws are just too hard to overlook. The story, while apparently engaging at first, quickly devolves into nonsense that conveniently spawns one plot point after another. Even the whole constitution of the show (Cellphones that foresee the future and even your own death with some anticipation, while also getting you instantly killed if someone happens to destroy yours) is too far fetched and weak on it's own.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a loner with zero redeeming qualities who is afraid of everything and the female lead, Gasai Yuno, is an annoying and sick murderer (that somehow possesses top notch assassin skills despite the fact that she's in school) who is pathologically attached to the main character. Oh she's also another Diary owner. While I understand that any normal person would be afraid in these circumstances, it is no excuse to have such an unlikable and WEAK male lead. It deserves to be mentioned, however, the fact that the main character does a 180\u00b0 later on in the series, over the course of 1 episode or so, which adds to the overall hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast (the other 10 and some random characters) are hard to describe. They are mostly stereotypical characters with a unique trait or two, some border so much on the ridiculousness that it really becomes hard to take seriously in the context of this show, not to mention that most are obviously discarded as the show advances due to the nature of the plot. While some are sort of interesting (and certainly better than the main two) they are not enough to save the character aspect of Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation are solid. Special mention to the first opening because it fits the mood and initial tone perfectly, definitely one of the best I've seen. The rest of OPs and EDs were alright, just like the voice acting and soundtrack. Animation was fluid, I have no complaints on that matter either.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, it is a widely known fact that sound and art are not enough to save an anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo fast forward to needless fan service, decisions and plot devices that lack any logic whatsoever, plot holes, ineffective comedy and EVEN the inclusion of homosexuality; Mirai Nikki simply fails to deliver the strong storyline that it seemed to have at first glance. That's not to say that MN epically fails in every aspect though... the action scenes despite being brainless and devoid of any realism / logic can still be entertaining, the female lead's twisted behavior can be amusing at times (generally when she's not being annoying as hell) and the sound and art are good. Kinda sad that those are all the positive things I've got to say about Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nSo onto the detailed analysis:\\n\\n\r\nGeneral: \\n\r\nAtmosphere 7/10 --- Nothing stellar, I guess it's hard to build the proper mood for a battle royale filled with whiny teens for the most part. \\n\r\nCharacters  3/10 --- Disappointing and obnoxious. Secondary characters aren't that much better.\\n\r\nStory development & ending 3/10 --- Weak and inconsistent. Despite being a free-for-all, at no point it stops being an episodic battle of the main characters against every single of the other 10. Also plot holes galore.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical:\\n\r\nArt 7/10 --- Good, no complaints.\\n\r\nSoundtrack 9/10 --- Background music I don't know, but the OPs and EDs were great (mainly the first OP)\\n\r\nVoice acting 7/10 --- Annoying, but that's how the characters were supposed to behave, and they did a good job at that.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal:\\n\r\nPriority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 6/10 --- Caught my interest sometimes, not gonna lie.\\n\r\nMemorability 4/10 --- I didn't care much when it ended, I didn't care much when I heard about the OVA release. Forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n5/10 --- Mediocre\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I can see why some people enjoyed Mirai Nikki, but for some reason I just couldn't bring myself to put up with the glaring plot holes and lack of logic present in almost every point of the show (I can somehow do that for other animes though). The characters and story pacing obviously didn't help much with that, either. Mirai Nikki is an entertaining anime if you are willing to turn your brain off at all the flaws it has and still manage to enjoy it, it has a powerful synopsis and it sure showed potential but in the end, like it happens many times, the execution was poorly done. \\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is certainly not for kids! The themes it touches can be disturbing and the content itself is a little too explicit. I'd rate it for 16 y/o and higher.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, I hope you enjoyed it! \\n\\n",

So, I had to start off my reviews with one of the very first animes I watched. I will try to minimize any spoilers possible! Strictly my opinion on the matter and what I consider a good/bad anime based on my preferences. My scores will be based on a .5scale just to make it easier.\\n\\n\r\nMAL Synopsis: Lonely high school student, Yukiteru Amano, spends his days writing a diary on his cellphone, while conversing with his two seemingly imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, who is the god of time and space, and Murmur, the god's servant. Revealing himself to be an actual entity, Deus grants Yukiteru a \"Random Diary,\" which shows highly descriptive entries based on the future and forces him into a bloody battle royale with 11 other holders of similarly powerful future diaries.\u2028\u2028With the last person standing designated as the new god of time and space, Yukiteru must find and kill the other 11 in order to survive. He reluctantly teams up with his obsessive stalker Yuno Gasai (who also possesses such a diary), and she takes it upon herself to ensure his safety. But there's more to the girl than meets the eye, as she might have other plans for her unrequited love...\\n\\n\r\nMAL Score: 7.86\\n\\n\\n\r\nIll construct my review based on my views of what a psychological/thriller anime should have (especially one in this setting): \\n\\n\r\n{Intro}: There are 2 different intros across the span of the 26 episodes of Mirai Nikki. The first track which spans across episodes 2-14 is called \u201cKuusou Mesorogiwi\u201d and fits the visuals pleasingly well. It has this intense, dramatic feel to it which compliments the anime well. Now, \u201cDead END\u201d sounded like trash to me. I\u2019m going to keep it 100, it sounded like they were off key while trying to sing in English. The visuals were cool though. \\n\\n\r\n{Visual/Animation}: For the most part I enjoyed the vibrant colors combined with the dull colors that were displayed throughout the series. The animation was\u2026 eh. It was ok for the most part. Fighting scenes were neatly done. I am not one with the complete knowledge of animation so I just saw it as par animation (nothing impressive, nothing utterly ridiculous either). \\n\\n\r\n{Characters}: Ok, this is where it gets interesting! There\u2019s a cast of 12 contestants 2 of which are the main focus of the story (for the most part). Then there\u2019s 2 other characters but they are used as the overseer\u2019s in this plot. The first contestant is Yukitero Amano (Yukiiiiii) who is an observational and anti social young dude that stole the heart of none other than Yuno Gasai (waifu gone wild). Yuno is the second contestant, who literally protects Yuki from all harm like an obsessive girlfriend should. She pretty much would take care of the dirty work if it meant that Yuki would stay safe. They go through an interesting relationship which appealed to me in this plots context. Then we have the other 10 contestants that (without saying too much) were interesting characters that ranged from considerably \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cbad\u201d people. All of the characters have their own distinct look. Everyone with \u201ctheir own reasons to become the new God\u201d. What I was displeased about was that not every character actually mentioned their reason for winning (even if they did it to just survive). Like, c\u2019mon my guy, tell me why this dudes out here trying to murder someone\u2026 what\u2019s his/her goal for being this omnipotent being? Some were done pretty well, others none at all, and that was a bummer. Then we look at the omnipotent beings themselves: Deus Ex Machina (aka Deus) and Murmur. Murmur has some personality and is quite adorable until the end starts nearing. Deus is simply just a bland character on the verge of death. My only issue with Deus\u2019 personality is that he claimed he had fun watching the battle royale he created but you never see him laugh or giggle when someone gets completely murdered. If you\u2019re enjoying it, at least show it my man. We get a quick look at Yuki\u2019s mom, but\u2026 who cares? She was a filler character to continue the story. She did want Yuki to pipe Yuno so I guess she was cool. For those who care, my favorite characters had to have been the Seventh Diary User and the Ninth Diary User. \\n\\n\r\n{Plot}: Hehe there\u2019s plenty of plot if you know what I\u2019m saying! Especially past the midway mark. The actual plot is split into two parts, one being the general battle royale storyline and the other is the \u201chidden\u201d mystery of the story. The plot isn\u2019t entirely unique but there are many segments which differentiate it from other survival stories. The story did catch me by surprise for the most part. Not in terms of the battle royale but instead the mystery behind it. There are some plot holes which didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t make too much sense to me. For the most part it was a minor inconvenience but it didn\u2019t take away from the beauty of the total project. There is one issue that did bother me with the whole plot and that is because of the arrangements of the fights. Without saying too much, it could\u2019ve been less generic. \\n\\n\r\n{Sound}: The sounds always seemed to match the mood that the anime was trying to portray. There was intense, louder music during fight scenes, smooth instrumental when something was discovered, and eccentric music when it was a happier scene (which rarely happened). Can't really pick out any moment where the music didn\u2019t fit the scene. \\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment}: To make this short and sweet, I really enjoyed Mirai Nikki. I didn\u2019t get completely hooked like I did on anime\u2019s such as: Haikyuu! and Tokyo Ghoul (S1), but it came very close to it. The anime is daring and hectic so it causes excitement every episode while you\u2019re still trying to figure out what\u2019s going to happen in the near future. I would catch myself with my eyes glued to my screen, sitting with my legs bent up like L from Death Note. This was one of the most exciting anime\u2019s that spanned across a span of 26 episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\n{Final thoughts}: This shit was awesome! It has a complex story but a fun one to accompany. Characters were unique and had a certain development throughout the story. Music was doooope. I know the anime might seem overhyped since it is a fan favourite (because of Yuno Gasai) but I do genuinely believe it is a really good anime. Not amazing, not a masterpiece. Simply a really good anime. I\u2019d give it a fresh tomato (Rotten Tomatoes reference) and I\u2019d recommend that you watch it if you\u2019re ever in the mood to watch some wild fights in a battle royale with a pretty alluring story and a bipolar girl with pink hair. \\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed reading my review on Mirai Nikki!\\n",

            "content": "Let me tell you all a little tale about a girl who wanted to save the boy she loved from a game of kill or be killed. 12 go in but only one comes out alive. Sound familiar? Yup, because it has been done before. Behold, Mirai Nikki also known as The Future Diary, The Hunger Games of the anime world. \r\nNow now, I know that is isn't the same as The Hunger Games since a) it came out before The Hunger Games, b) it isn't set in a apocalyptic world with a dome and crazy people with weird hair, and c) if you winthe game you become God and not a infamous person everyone hates. Plus, only one can win. Not two. So let us begin this review with a question, hm?\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily becoming a overused plotline, this anime is twisted together with different themes, styles, and many many plot holes. I became confused fast on what was going on because well...there was no building of the plot. They literally just threw us into the cage with the lion saying \"good luck!\" and away we went with an up and down and up and down plot structure. I got sick fast with the roller coaster movement. Now, why cell phones? I get it, it's the 21st century, but did they really have to use cell phones to create a message of \"this can be you if you continue to stare at your cell phone instead of going outside and doing whatever\"? It's different, but the message of them using it wasn't necessary at the slightest. Plus adding the twist of \"guess what, your cell phone was selected out of a million others to go into a killing battle to the death,\" kind of made me jump back and feel sorry for the characters. The romance part was a little overdone. It was strange the see a woman protecting her man though, its usually the other way around. So that was a nice change for once. But the emotion being used in contrast to everything else didn't fit. And this will be explained in the \"art\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of a style of art I wasn't particularly fond of. Different colour hair, eyes, school girl uniforms, the typical anime art. Like who designed these characters? To fit the story I felt like they could've gone a darker direction with the design of the characters and background. They seemed to bright of a shade. I get they were trying to mix things up and confuse us with a plot twist, but those plot twist still should match what is happening. Still, for a bright coloured anime, they did use the blood and gore well. I was happy to see this anime live up to the rating's reputation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Is it wrong, to love popcorn and tea. Tea. Biscuits, biscuits, fuck this tea.....Steak Fries.\" This is the first thing I hear every time I watch the first OP. *slow clap* great choice in song. Great choice. Yeah...no. The beginning song used a psychotic beat to get us 'hyped' for the episode. Yes, they did well to established this. They used perfect amounts of darkness in the animation and song to lead up to...yeah, nothing what I was expected. Why doesn't these openings match with the episodes! They probably should've put in a less darker opening so they wouldn't lead us into something disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting wasn't all too bad. Even the english dubbed was pretty alright. They did match the character's personality well, even Yuno's VA was very well done. I am impressed! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nYuno...the Queen of the Yandere. I think this character inspired the Yandere video game simulator. Either way this girl has serious mental issues. You can tell from the beginning this girl is messed and at first glance you'll think \"oh she has multiple personality disorder\" but...does she really? She's a big mystery and an overachiever at that. I would feel sorry for the guy who has to date her. Talk about getting no sleep at all. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to contestant number one: Yukiteru Amano! Also known as the guy who got thrown into a cage with a lion thanks to his 'imaginary friends'. More like having schizophrenia. This guy is living on the boarders of reality and imaginary. But still I feel sorry for him being thrown into a battle he probably never wanted to become a part of. \\n\\n\r\nMinene Uryuu: the only character I actually liked in this entire show. You want to know who's the bad ass in this show, it's her. She's probably the only one who shows that yes, this show is gory and dark and will become a living hell. She's not afraid of anything. She's not afraid of death. She's not afraid of killing. She's not afraid of nothing...except loosing. Yes...I think she's the only sane person in the entire anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDecent anime, but yeah...up to you if you want to watch it or not. This was a strange anime for me. But am I going to stop you...probably not. I got bored from this anime...but it was a short one so I just fought my way through it I guess. Everyone has their own opinion on it though. Heck, this is one of my best friend's favourites, and here I am giving it a low ranking. Sorry, but this anime was just...not enough and too much at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a Dead End for this anime. I give it a 47% on the kill scale.",

            "content": "Story-6/10\r\nGasai Yuno: Don't you know? I really, really, really love you to death, Yukkii.\r\nAlthough it takes a while to unravel, the romance in Mirai Nikki ends up being very poignant. Up until the last few episodes, the real story of Gasai Yuno remains somewhat of a mystery. Although this method of using hidden information will keep you curious as to what\u2019s going on, the romance will unfortunately come across as very childish and forced. This very difficult to care about (and very much one sided) \u2018love\u2019 continues for the majority of the anime until finally, the secret of Yuno is revealed. When this happens, allof those issues with the romance are pretty much solved and the final few episodes end up featuring some incredibly powerful and emotional scenes. After seeing Mirai Nikki\u2019s obvious skill in delivering this drama, it just seemed a shame to have such a standard and immature build up to the climax. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the supposed main story of a survival game ends up just being a plot device for the romance. The dramatic story of Yuno and Yukiteru requires very specific conditions. Thus, the main plotline will decide to change radically and suddenly just to fit these conditions. Most of the time, these \u2018plot twists\u2019 have absolutely no reasoning behind them; they just happen. Although this obviously benefits the romance, the survival game itself ultimately becomes a total mess. By the end, even main characters start to defy the laws of physics simply so the ideal circumstances for Yuno and Yukiteru are created. If the main focus was always the romance, was there really any point in having something so complicated to confuse things? \\n\\n\r\nArt-6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Mirai Nikki was passable but rather confusing. The artwork never stood out as one of the strengths of the anime. The backgrounds and city views were pretty standard. The beauty behind any aspect of the show was also weak. Where the artwork really succeeded was with the intense/ dark scenes. There was always this juxtaposition with using an innocent design in a sinister way, and while Yuno herself best epitomises this, certain scenes in the anime were also equally as successful. In terms of character design, I was never sure how serious to take Mirai Nikki. On one hand you have a determined, and mischievous looking terrorist, on the other hand you have an oversized, female Oompa Loompa\u2026 Wat? I never felt decided on how serious to take Mirai Nikki in the first place, but things like that are completely out of place. \\n\\n\r\nSound-9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Mirai Nikki was superb. The show has do deal with a great number of contrasting themes; Yuki may be sitting down with his family one moment and the next, Yuno will be going completely nuts killing everyone. The soundtrack was able to use some really successful OSTs to smoothen this transition. There was also a basic language between the tracks, for example using the same melody but using different instruments to set different moods. Where the sound and art really come into their own is with the OP\u2019s and ending songs, all of which were marvellous. They do a great job of setting the mood in a creative way. Here are a few tracks which best set the mood of Mirai Nikki; \u2018K\u016bs\u014d Mythology\u2019 (the first OP), \u2018Blood teller\u2019, and of course the stunning OST (whose name I cannot find),* just type in* \u2018volume 2- Track 5 Mirai Nikki\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-7/10\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki showed some great potential in terms of characters. The main character, Yuno, was both able to grasp my attention (because of the underlying mystery) and consistently hold it because of her unexpected and completely barmy actions (very much like the show itself). It is always great to see a character that can instantly set you in the mood for that particular show. Other characters like Uryuu Minene also have a strong sense of individuality and were able to entertain through their own decision making that didn\u2019t revolve around benefiting the story.   \\n\\n\r\nWhilst the shows designers clearly had some skill, they rarely used it. The supporting cast was weak. In a survival game with a main character (i.e. the obvious future winner), other characters just seem to exist to develop that main character, then die in an entertaining manner. What was really off-putting was that in Mirai Nikki, even the characters themselves seemed to know this and would do some of the most illogical things just so Yuno/ Yukiteru could benefit. Even Yuki was at it when the story of Yuno needed saving! The rest of the cast ended up being fleshed out by the standard array of stereotypical archetypes which was especially disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki definitely did entertain. There was plenty of drama, action and mystery to satisfy. What I found particularly successful was that each show would both develop the story and provide some light hearted entertainment. As a result, there weren\u2019t any over complicated story explanations, nor was there too much booby touching to frustrate me. Admittedly, the most entertaining aspect of the show was indeed Yuno. It was good fun to just simply watch her mind work and see her in action. The only thing holding back my enjoyment was the fact that I wore my thinking hat very securely on my head. Mirai Nikki, for better or for worse, does require you to put this to the side\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOverall-710\\n\\n\r\nAs much as you will enjoy it, Mirai Nikki has its fair share of flaws. For example the undeniable focus on Yuno, which resulted in the discarding or radical modification of different aspects of the story when needed. Whether I recommend watching Mirai Nikki, I would say yes. Just don\u2019t expect a masterpiece. Go in instead with the expectation of a good ol\u2019 bit of entertainment. \\n",

            "content": "If I were a complete novice to anime and someone introduced me to this show, I would be appalled and mark anime off as nothing more than a gore infested whore house of the art industry, because the show comes equipped with more than a few classic anime cliche's that, when kept apart, are rather appealing, but when thrust together, are a shameful mess on the industry. Mirai Nikki holds serious parallels to Sword Art Online for me: both shows have a wicked concept they are based on, but both are destroyed by pacing and modern anime conventions. In the case of Mirai Nikki, theshounen-y 'villian of the week' feel, disturbing rather than pleasant fan service moments, and a total lack of any character development or compelling theming really drown out the positive aspects of the show. But while someone could watch SAO for their first anime and at the very least come away with the idea of anime as having the ability to be both artistically beautiful and imaginative, walking away from Mirai Nikki would at best leave confusion as to if the Japanese were mentally sane. To those who say Mirai Nikki would never be someones first anime, the insane hype for this show would like to say otherwise. Sure, its not many an otaku's first lover, but coming from personal experience, Mirai Nikki was indeed just about my second. And while it does not reach One Piece level stardom, the cult following this show has attained exists as its sole proprietor, like harpies singing beautiful praises from there corpse infested caverns to those unaware of the term yandere and its implications. \\n\\n\r\nNot at all to say that in any way do I dislike gore, ecchi, severed limbs, the psychological genre, sociopathic protagonists, games of death, or even yandere (or any such dere for that matter). Individually I actually not only can tolerate them but enjoy about everything I just listed. So what could be my issue with Future Diary, an anime chockfull of all of these things and more? It single handedly created its own species of dere for darn's sake! But that is where the line is drawn; you either love Future Diary to death, or like me, you recognize it as a disjointed mess. Herein lies my issue with Future Diary. Somehow, someway, it has become a series that is held up as one of the best things we have to offer to the rest of the world when it comes to animation. Because while the following of SAO has at least come to realize the series is majorly flawed (speaking solely for its first season), judging by the very diverse reviews it receives on this very website, Future Diary still manages to hold a number of 8s, 9s, and 10s within its review section, consistently. And while I'm not saying people can't enjoy whatever they want to enjoy, I'm startled by the amount of people who feel so strongly about this show. Because in my opinion, it's shameful garbage, and here's why:\\n\\n\r\nStrike 1: The synopsis sounds bad-ass, right? Twelve people with diaries on their cell phones that can see into the future use them in order to fight to the death to become the next god. This show sounds immediately up my alley, psychological genre to boot. But a more accurate genre for this is far and away shounen, as instead of moving the focus between characters, chronicling everyone's individual attempts and motivations for becoming god, or any sort of intelligent set-ups and traps made with the use of the Future Diaries, we are instead subject to a whiny, useless protagonist that has nothing going for him besides that fact that, for no reason at all, everyone is going after him. And when I say everyone, I very much mean everyone just stands in a line to wait to get a whack at the first Diary user. Episodes are made up of instances where they introduce a character, said character attempts to kill Yuki, and Yuno does all the dirty work in the process of saving him before the episode is over, without said character having any effect on the entire rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe Future Diaries tend to only be used in a very immediate fashion, ie characters only whip them out when they are about to die, with only one or two actually using their Diaries before they are in a life or death situation, and I can tell you Yuki and Yuno are not those people (unless Yuno is literally attempting to stalk Yuki). Instead the diaries tend to serve much more as plot progression than devices that could potentially change fate, and even their properties and abilities manage to simply fluctuate with whatever issue has arisen for the characters in trouble, keeping a very consistent level of dues ex machina always present that, more than anything, only manages to detract any sense of real threat from the show. I failed to ever worry about the characters of Yuki or Yuno, not only because I already failed to have an emotional connection to them, but also because I never truly wondered about the outcome of the death game. Yuki holds such a very strong main-character immunity that even as weak and whiny as he was, I never worried about him. Yuno would save him, or Akise would save him, or Eye-patch would save him, or someone would kill themselves so he'd live, or the entire rules of the game would shift just in order to give a reason for Yuki to be saved. So Future Diary is not about the Future Diaries, or the entire death game, and wondering who would become god. Future Diary is really just about the characters, and boy-  \\n\\n\r\nStrike 2: You can read a different review if you want to hear about how much a frustratingly weak character Yuki is, but I'm in full agreement that he is the least compelling of any character on the show, and while he does at one point grow out of his baby phase, it comes in the form of such a complete 180 in character that it's even worse than before, because he becomes equally as psycho as Yuno.\\n\\n\r\nAfter about episode 5 you begin to realize a few things. One being that the characters of this show choose to make about the worst, most illogical decisions possible. For example: How come literally everyone immediately goes after Yuki after he lives just one time? Literally no battle is shown that is between someone that does not involve Yuki in some form or fashion. Two: How come, whenever anyone else gets a DEAD END, they just sort of give up, when right from the very beginning it is shown that you can evade any such end? I'm talking specifically about instances like the eye ball guy, who I honestly believed to be a compelling character up to the point ***minor spoilers*** of his killing himself, at which point began the very rapid downhill slide for the show. *spoiler end* Three: How come no one actually reads their Future Diary!? I'm serious that there were at least three different instances where someone would look at their Future Diary, read whatever the last text was, and respond immediately to that, without even checking whatever the rest of the thing said, which many times had already recorded their failure. I watched the show dubbed, so I don't know how it went down subbed, but the text messages were handily translated in English for us as well, and so many times were there in which Yuki woud freak out over something written without pausing for a moment to read the rest of his diary that confirmed how useless whatever he was about to do was. Whether this is a production glitch or something done on purpose is irrelevant; it only manages to make them look like total morons.\\n\\n\r\nThe second is that these characters do not serve as emotional platforms for us to become invested in, but are really simply back-story infused canon-fodder for Yuno to chop to pieces. If you wanted to see something that included multiple characters with ridiculously sad back stories, go watch Angel Beats! or something along those lines, because here, the writers just decided to think of the most messed up as possible scenarios for their characters while not at all addressing what their motives are for the Future Diary in the first place, besides ruling the world. Nearly no character says what they would do if they did come in possession of the Future Diary, and even the ones who do say nothing more involved than world domination. Many characters are straight-up jokes, or stupid stereotypes, like the four year old child, or the oddly rotund day-care worker. What good would come to them for becoming the Master of the Universe? Of course it's a cool concept, but its not like anyone is rooting for them or anything. \\n\\n\r\nOutside the primary diary users exists a number of other static support characters, nearly all in some way related to Yuki, such as his posse of friends who tend to be the only logical persons in the entire show, and his parents, who range from overly relaxed to overtly greedy. The only person I can name to have anything even remotely close to character development would be Minene  (eye-patch), and the only character I honestly enjoyed having screen time for was Akise, since he tended to be the voice of reason that went regularly unheeded by Yuki. If we're all being realistic here, Akise should have been the main character of this show. He is the only person remotely close to deserving the powers of the Future Diary, and who would have used them intelligently. Many issues I had with the overall production of the show would have been lost if he had taken the center stage, even if he fails to have any compelling backstory or motivations either, because he at least would have the ability go never seeing Yuno again if he had the choice. \\n\\n\r\nStrike 3: Really, the entirety of Future Diary is based off of Yuki and Yuno's strenuous relationship, capitalized by the fact there are multiple episodes where all they do is go dress shopping or the entire abduction arc that manages to have nothing to do with the rest of the diary users. When it\u2019s broken down, I do not understand the appeal of Yuno and Yuki together. Yuno is not maybe but totally, fully an insane person, borderline socially impaired in her level of jealously towards anyone who so much as speaks to Yuki, and not once but twice imprisons him against his will. And yet he always comes back, never because he really cares about her or fully trusts her but because Yuki needs Yuno to stay alive. Now, I'm sure if I needed someone to never be more than five feet from me in order to remain with all my body parts, I would probably have to at some point form an emotional bond with them and ultimately may fall in love. But if said person proves to be a hazard to me just as much as any of the possible assailants, than forget protection. And while if she did prove to in the end help more than hinder, than I may have considered them at least tolerable. But in the end ***spoilers*** Yuno attempts to kill Yuki anyway. And what does he do after that? Sacrifices himself in order for her, the true her, to be get a better life, under the impression that second Yuno has a different, more caring nature than the first one who killed her own self. ***spoilers end*** Now, that's a textbook example of a dependent relationship: Assuming that if you stick around for a person, you can fix them and that they have a different side to them that you just have to pull out. Spoiler alert in a different manner: This is an untruth. Life doesn\u2019t work like that. If a person is negatively impacting your life and health, you leave them Yuki. The point is though that Yuki is just as manipulative of Yuno as she is of him, calling her his girlfriend whenever she needs him to kill someone for him / not kill someone for him, and that manipulation leads him to even mixing up needing a person to stay with you for protection as needing this person to stay around because you love them. It\u2019s possible that Yuki even convinces himself he loves her as a survival strategy, but that treading in deeper water than this show deserves. In total, their relationship is wholly unhealthy and manipulative, and the obsession for Redail's happier ending between the two is sickening nearly.\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes: What is this yandere obsession? What? Someone explain it to me. Yes I can understand its significance in School Days because it came out of practically nowhere, but why is Yuno dubbed Yandere Queen? Everyone knew she was mentally unstable and that one of them was going to have to die, so it\u2019s not exactly like that end came out of left field, or any such killings for that matter. Really the show is set up for her to be a yandere, and yet no one comments on shows like Btooom! where the characters there kill for love as well, in equally insane situations. I guess there is some insanity threshold to classify as yandere? I enjoy its 'surprise' qualities, except in Future Diary, it truly was no surprise.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. Honestly, it has some crazy cool twists and build-ups, or at least, twists and build ups that WOULD HAVE been really crazy and cool, if the show wasn\u2019t already burdened with dues ex to the stars and back, to the point nothing could have really come across as a surprise. And then the fact that it took like three whole episodes the complete that ending arc, dragging it on and on for far too long. The ending is one I would have loved had it been nearly any other show, because it shows real thought for the creators and as I said it was just plain cool and at least mildly original. But in the case of Future Diary, it was way too late to be cool any more. It also proved why the whole time all the other Diary users were so wary of Yuno, except how could any of them known that about her if they were not already god? Yet another thing that comes across and incredibly heavy-handed by the creators.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Mirai Nikki is one of those shows that is so bad that it's good. But not good in a way that we all learn from it; no, instead Future Diary is put upon some sort of pedestal the community loves to support for those 'gritty, edgy' shows. But the only thing Future Diary has going for it is the fact that it pulls us in with a stellar idea, and then keeps us around by being shocking and ridiculous just for the hell of it. The fact that this is a popular anime is almost insulting to the community at large, up there with a Human Centipede level grossness that is its own selling factor, but the fact we're all cool with that is hard to digest. I dont want to say that people cant like whatever they want, as for much as I detest Sword Art Online, Im still on good terms with people who love it to death. But this, I would love to see someone defend it's legitimacy as a moving art form, beyond pure 'entertainment' value of seeing the mentally deranged self-destruct everything and everyone around them. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first ever review on this site! Not a great anime to debut though...\r\nI'm a positive person so I'll begin with what I liked.\r\nThe art is decent. There are scenes where you can see some weirdness but on the whole, it's quite good. It's animated well with some really good high frame rate scenes in the last few episodes. Most of the cel-shading is also pretty good and the character of Deus ex Machina is really cool to look at.\r\nThe music is also quite good though there are many times where they just want to bash you over the head with the \"sadness\"or the \"loneliness\" or the \"friends-are-so-damn-important-so-even-if-you-die-we-will-remember-you\" aspects and the music here just feels cheesy. But it's a decent score but nothing noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nNow the bad. And there is a LOT of bad.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the goddamned story. What. The. FUCK.\\n\r\nThe first episode blew me away with the sheer potential this anime possesses and the awesome concept of precognition through something as lowly as a diary. The character of Deus, the stalker Yuno, the meek and reserved Yukki, all were an excellent recipe for a show that could very well turn into and excellent sequence of chases, mind-bending twists and one-upmanship over the other contestants and a true showcase of a potentially epic battle of wits. \\n\\n\r\nThen everything slowly but surely crumbles as meaningless plot twists, useless characters, utterly unbelievable reactions and a pathetic protagonist are mixed and it ends with such an idiotic climax that I was just glad to be over with the whole damn thing. The true twist I really didn't see coming but at that point I was pretty much at my zenith of boredom leading to my reaction being just an \"oh, that happened\" instead of \"OH MY FUCKING GOD WHAAAT\".\\n\\n\r\nThe diaries are incredibly idiotic and never really used as how we'd imagined. Are they used to achieve the owner's ends and successfully trick the others? Not really. What actually kills them is mostly a combination of incredibly dumb luck, bullets, knives etc. It's not the brains and the combination of will and wit that wins, but the brawn impeded by brainlessness. The formula is usually, somehow get to the opponent using the diary, face off with brawn, some touchy-feely shit and something happens to the opponent. IF it was done the first time to build the dumbass protagonist in the first few matches it would have been fine. BUT... this brings me to my next point which is - \\n\\n\r\nThese characters SUCK. Holy crap, they drove me so goddamned MAD.\\n\r\nWhat the FUCK was with Yukki? I mean, this dude NEVER EVER wants to grow up from his obvious weaknesses, his delusions, his inferiority complex, NOTHING. He's been given one of the most powerful weapons and elevated to a god among men with only a handful more who share the dias. Does he take this as an opportunity to grow as a person, learn to fend for himself and kick-ass? NOPE NOT HAPPENING. Forget kicking ass, this guy can barely defend or even think by himself. He continues to be a child till the very end, repeatedly tricked by Yuno into loving her and almost never makes a conscious decision of his own.\\n\r\nAnd Yuno? She was as 2D a character as they come with her decidedly one-point agenda upto the very end. You may try and excuse her constant pining as being that of the yandere character she's supposed to be but this only leads to some VERY stupid decisions and some overtly protective/murderous actions. She NEVER thinks for herself or plans for the future. We are shown that she's awesome with bursts of amazing deduction but these are so unbelievable and interspersed with pure stupidity that we just call bullshit on them after the first few episodes.\\n\r\nThe other contestants are invariably psychopaths that should never have been selected for this position in the first place, forcing us to somehow hope Yukiteru gets the spot in the end (which was an eventuality from the start) so these psychotic fucks don't get the opportunity. Also one of the contestants being allowed in the game was highly suspect given his role and I'll never believe he would be allowed to participate.\\n\r\nThe other characters are equally, if not worse, criminally underdeveloped or utterly useless. I see no point in Kousuke or Mao ever being a \"major\" characters. Akise Aru was also never really fleshed out. Hinata was purely a fan service character.\\n\\n\r\nBut ani, ani, what about romance, fan service, blood and gore and wholesome yandere fun? LOL seriously? If any of these elements were present in decent amounts to tone down the seriousness of the plot the I wouldn't have been this harsh on the anime. Unfortunately, the fan service is sparse, the romance is irritating and the gore is barely there. You get spouts and gushes of blood, a couple of chopped heads, some missing limbs but that's it. Having seen Elfen Lied, this is all very tame and barely stimulating.\\n\\n\r\nA pointless and meandering story, moronic characters and some truly awful pacing with random bits of humour or sentiment suddenly destroying the previous mood wreck a concept with vast potential which let me down considerably. I'm not looking back at this time wasted with any fondness.",

Mirai nikki keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly, it has an outstanding plot that takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride. The emotion between the characters is a masterpiece, and in general it was very well thought out. Every week i have been anticipating the next episode, staying up late just to watch it. Its kept me hooked and interested all the way,and now that its nearly at an end im rather sad that such a great show is going to end. But by jove im enjoying all the loose ends they are tying up, i just hope they don't leave any sort of gaps in the story that leaves you guessing.\\n\r\nI don't foresee a second series, and to be honest that is a good thing. This show will end perfectly at the 26th episode, and you will most likely feel very fulfilled.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that prevents me from giving it an overall 10 is the gore, im not a great fan of it. But im sure most others out there enjoy it, so im just being a little bias there.",

            "content": "This is my first review so no hating, ok? :3 Well a little criticism is fine, but make it constructive.\r\nI've watched many anime, but of all, I found Mirai Nikki the most thrilling. The plot is similar to the Hunger Games, but instead its set in a different time period and darker. The main character here is Amano Yukiteru, a plain student who doesn't like to stand out much, but ends up being caught up in the bloody game, and is one of the few diary owners who are still sane.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe plot, like I said, is the same as the Hunger Games, a classicelimination battle royale plot. The story isn't incredibly fast paced, But there is the big twist that comes along the way. Sure, it may be a game where everyone has to kill each other, but this is also where it splits from Hunger Games. Its not what you think at first. Along the anime, the more diary owners are killed, the more the plot dives deeper into the past life of Yuno, a psychotic but sweet girl who is obsessed with Yukiteru (also known as yandere). The reason why I gave the story a 9/10, though, is because this anime breaks the fourth wall a bit too much, giving some pathetic characters a giant edge over something that normally wouldn't be possible.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? Amazing art. It actually compliments the thrill and psychology in this anime. The art is clear and the character emotions and gestures are shown beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nMusic is good, shows the aura of the anime and goes along with the anime. Yousei Teikoku is my favourite band since their music creates the best feel for this anime. Dead End (second opening) actually shows what happens in the anime if you look at the lyrics. Voice acting is fantastic, especially when acting out as the personality of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is what got me so excited about Mirai Nikki. Yuki's personality is a wimp who before, does not want anything to do with the game, due to the horrors he had witnessed at the beginning. The fact that this anime has a pathetic and weak main character is what makes this anime better, and the fact that later in the anime he ends up putting a proud and confident act is what pushes it better. The side characters are also well developed and there are reasons concerning their actions. Yuno Gasai, the female lead character, is also the main selling point of the anime. Her back story is not as tragic as the Sixth, yet her personality was the result of what happened when she was small. Shes one of the best yanderes I've ever seen, as one moment shes cute and innocent, the next moment she does something completely unpredictable and insane.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved this anime. The thrill of it was what made me watch it without dropping it. Ever since I watched the first episode, I would wonder what happened in the next episode and would want to watch it in school secretly. Mirai Nikki is an anime that was so unexpected that sometimes I would try to predict what would happen next and then it would completely surprise me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you liked Higurashi and Chaos;Head, then I think it would be good giving Mirai Nikki a shot. Sure, not as much horror as Higurashi, but the dark effects and psychological scenes make up for it.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki has a great survival game premise.  The main characters try to kill the other players or avoid being killed by using their diaries to see into the future.  Fortunately this idea never strays off course and we are left with a fun beginning to end watch.  As the game nears the end, we bite into a few treats that were only hinted at before.  The bloody road along with the sometimes irritating romance, concluded with a most satisfactory ending that made the journey all worth it.  From my understanding, the anime followed the manga pretty well, but inthe end, they left out a few pages that would of been nice to see.  Maybe these few pages would of been confusing but once read, they really make the ending that much sweeter.\\n\\n\r\nGreat animation.  The characters and everything in the Nikki world were detailed and brought to life.  The fights were slick and easy to follow.  Nothing looked half-assed.  The fights were bloody and boy was there blood.  The one thing that bothered me about the fights though was when someone got seriously injured and blood was pouring out of the wound, the wound itself was censored.  So, in some cases during this R rated anime, censorship was used.  In reality, I can certainly see why censorship was used, being a shounen and all, but it's one of those points I have to include.  With all the blood and killing shown, censoring something like a knife in the gut seems preposterous.  It was not always, just a few times throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI'll let the opening and endings alone.  They fit the bill but not everyone liked the heaviness of them.  As for the music in between, not much can be said other than it also fit the moments.  When love was in the air, you better believe love music was in the air.  A serious fight brought on serious fighting music.  In no way was the music lacking.\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the characters.  Much can be said about the characters.  I'll start by saying Yukki made the beginning of the anime hell.  The angst was almost unbearable.  For like 17 episodes, he refused to grow a pair. Yuno on the other hand, made the beginning worthwhile with her obsessive psychotic love for Yuki.  Nothing can stop her from protecting Yukki.  All the while nothing can stop Yukki from crying as Yuno fights for him.  Alas, don't be put off, the ending is well worth it.  Watching Yukki develop may be a hair pulling experience, but he matures into the guy we wished for in episode one.  Being a survival game, we not only have our main guys, but the anime takes a step back sometimes to explore the other players realities.  This step is a breathe of fresh air from the angst and love that dwells in each episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I can't stress enough that this anime should be given a chance. At least till like episode 17.  Even before that though it's a great watch.  The premise alone makes the wait for developments interesting.  The fighting and epic background music both succeed in setting the right mood and right pace.  The gore adds to that but usually when there's gore, there's Yukki crying somewhere; where there's Yukki, there's Yuno.  Like I said, persevere, it's character development.  The other players are all pretty great characters and though Yukki and Yuno can be hard to watch sometimes, when the plots a movin', everything becomes exciting.  So give it a chance, maybe you'll see that it was actually a pretty great anime.",

            "content": "Diaries that can predict the future in vastly different ways, a winner takes all survival game, 12 psychopaths competing for the role of god, and a stalker girl that refuses to leave the main character alone. These are the  main themes of Mirai Nikki, and these are also both the show's greatest strengths, and it's greatest weaknesses.\r\nYukiteru Amano is a quiet, 14 year old middle school student who borders on being anti-social. One day, he finds out that the journal he keeps on his cell phone is already filled in for the day, predicting the events that happen around him. He also comes tofind out though that Deus, the being he thought was his imaginery friend, is actually god, and that he has been thrown into a last man standing survival game in which the winner claims the title of the new god. Couple that with the fact that a crazy, murderous stalker who also happens to be a player has fallen in love with him, and you have a general idea of the premise of Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe storyline in Mirai Nikki is one of the best aspects of the show. If you couldn't tell from the description above, Mirai Nikki has a setup that just pulls you in, offering a great premise to get you excited about the events to come. That said, it needs to be understood that this survival game isn't one along the lines of say \"Eden of the East\", where the game is more of a backdrop for a though provoking story. Mirai Nikki's survival game is kill or be killed, no exceptions. The show prefers to just let cool things happen even if they aren't properly explained, which is a blessing and a curse.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, it makes for some truly enjoyable moments, but it does often leave you with the impression that the show just doesn't care if the events make sense, leaving you with the impression it was just rushed or downright ignored. But again, if your willing to just raise your suspension of disbelief and turn your brain off while your watching it, there is a lot of action and cool moments to justfiy watching.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as pacing goes, it moves at a very nice rate, keeping things interesting and ensuring that it never takes to long on one certain thing, keeping you entertained in the process. The ending is also surprisingly interesting, being a bit complex and a bit difficult to wrap your head around at first, but it is quite clever once you figure it out and makes the last 3-4 episodes some of the most enjoyable in the series. That said, you should probably check the last chapter of the manga after finishing the show, as their are about 10 pages or so that were unanimated, and it's definitely worth seeing them as they clear up a few questions.\\n\\n\r\nUltimatley, the story is very enjoyable with a few twists and turns throughout it to keep you engaged. I doens't always take the time it should to explain things to the viewer but with the fast pace and cool moments you'll hardly have time to notice. Ultimately though, the story is brought down the most by it's characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI'll put it bluntly, the characters are probably the worst thing about Mirai Nikki. For a show revolving around 12 people vying for the role of god, the characters must be interesting and engaging in order for the seutp to work. Thankfully, not all the characters are bad. As most of the characters have some form of psychological problem, some of them truly are interesting. Such as a blind man who dresses up like a power ranger acting as an agent of justice, a little boy whose parents fight, and a terrorist who might not be as bad as she first seems to be. The sad thing is, not all the characters are that good, and most of the tones that are good are quickly killed off and never brought up again.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not that all the other characters are bad per se, it's just that despite the show trying to gibe them interesting backstories and trying to make you care, most just come off as boring and you never really care about them. For a show all about a game in which only one will survive, having likeable, interesting characters is a necessity, but Mirai Nikki fails to deliver on this in all but a few cases.\\n\\n\r\nAlso important in defining the characters are each of their future diaries. Each player in the survival game had a diary they keep, and each one fills them in on future events in various different ways. Some are simple, such as telling the user what events happen around him, or another that details what will happen to someone the user is close too. Some of these future diaries get a bit bizarre though, and there's one later in the show that allows other future diaries to be made from it. It's an interesting concept, but it's never explained exactly how this can work, and the show just doesn't seem to care that it makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a few leaps in logic such as that though, the future diaries are a key part of Mirai Nikki, and it's always interesting to find out what diary a certain person has, and how it can be used to help them kill the other players.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst offender as far as characters go is sadly the main man himself, Yukiteru. He whines, complains, and cries all to often, making him just a constant annoyance to the viewer. It's understandable for him to be afraid at first, after all, he's just been thrown into this crazy survival game and now has a crazy murderous woman following him around, but the problem is that he never grows throughout the show. He does have some moments of courageousness, but he never grows from them, despite the fact that after every one it seems like a great chance to develop his character.\\n\\n\r\nThere to pick up the slack though is Yuno, that crazy, murderous stalker I mentioned earlier. Yuno is probably the best character in the show, seeming sweet and innocent, and just when you think she's not so bad, something is revealed about her which takes you back to her true nature of being a crazy, murderous, psycho, and she is one of the few characters to have truly good development. Over the course of the show you will learn more and more about her, making you wonder what her true motives really are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to say about the art and animation in this show. It's certainly not bad or anything, but it's nothing to write home about either. The colors look nice and the character designs are alright, nothing spectacular though. You can tell some shortcuts were taken at certain points, but the animation does get a noticeable bump near the end of the series as most shows do, so it's not so bad. All in all the art in Mirai Nikki is alright, it gets the job done but doens't break any good ground. There is some nicely animated action sequences, so I'll give it that.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nAs with the animation, the sound is so-so. All the background music sets the mood well, and there are a few stand out tracks, but it's not the best soundtrack I've heard. The openings and endings though I though were quite nice, most of them giving some sort of look at the 12 players in the survival game, and they set the mood of the show well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIn terms of pure enjoyment, Mirai Nikki may be one of the most purely enjoyable anime I've seen. It's not deep or thought provoking, but it is a lot of fun to watch and downright entertaining. There are just so many memorable moments in this show that are either really cool, \"epic\", or even a few touching ones. Even if you don't like a lot of things about the show, you'll be hard pressed not to find a multiple moments in the show that bring a smile to your face, as there are quite an abundance of them, particuarly when the show really gets going in it's second half.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAll in all, how much you like Mirai Nikki will be determined by how willing you are to overlook a few cases of things going unexplained and a few plot holes for the sake of high adrenaline, \"awesome\" moments. If your like me than you'll be able to look past some of those flaws and just enjoy it for what it is, which is basically just a fast paced battle royal featuring a cast of psychopaths using diaries that can predict the future to kill each other.A few of these characters being very well done, where as some fall very short.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, as long as you are willing to look past these faults, Mirai Nikki is a very enjoyable expirence with a story that is surprsisngly good and only bogged down by a lack of great characters. I would reccomend this show to anyone who likes a show that doesn't force them to think to hard, and just gives them something enjoyable, adrenaline packed, and with a few twists and turns throughout.\\n\\n\r\nIf the characters had been better than I would have probably given this show a 9, but as they are one of the most important parts of the show and they just aren't as good as they need to be, I had to drop my overall score to an 8.\\n\\n",

If there was mass murder shown or limbs and violent acts happening then I would usually step aside. That kinda stuff just leaves a mark on your day but I noticed some online buddies talking about this and said hey give it a shot. So now I'm telling you. WATCH IT! Trust me it gets intense. I could not wait to watch the next episode every time and they dontmess around. They pretty much dive right in all the time to plot and stories and it feels like your getting dragged around by your hand like poor Yukii was in this show. The charcters are great. I loved them all even the minor ones. The scenes where amazing, the plot and mystery gets you thinking and its just all around good. A little side note is If you like Bakuman, you might recognize a certain little song during some parts of the show. Good stuff. All in all I heavily recommend this show. It is now on my list as \"You know Yuno?\" along with the ToraDora effect and Angel Beats Syndrome. =] Hope you enjoy as much as I did and I await your responses. hahahahah",

The concept is clever and although elements of it have been done before, I feel it did bring something new-ish to the table. I didn't pick the twist until it was almost staring me in the face, but I liked the fact that even though the clues were there, it wasn't bang-on obvious. I felt I had to endure the first 18 episodes to get to the good stuff though.\r\nAnimation and sound is solid too.\r\nOk, so if you like yourcharacters at the opposite ends of the emotional spectrum, then this is for you. And the females, oh the females in this were portrayed horribly. There was hardly any normality. It was either back the psychos or the tragics. Not a fan at all of how they were shown and the men weren't that crash-hot either. The relationship between the two mains is also quite cringeworthy, right up until the last few episodes I reckon. Plus if I have to hear 'Pookie' again, I'll scream.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I think the other main drawback for this series was that it tried too hard to fit a bit of everything in. Romance, comedy, both yaoi and yuri connotations, horror, drama, action, supernatural... It's too much for one series. However, when the action gets going (especially when they pit their diary's unique abilities against each other) it becomes pretty decent to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo for concept, animation and gore... give Mirai Nikki a go. But if you want characters, consistency and something solid to watch... find something else.\\n",

            "content": "Marai Nikki is an effectively frightening, unrestrained, and twistedly dark addition to the psychological thriller anime genre featuring brutally fast paced action, fantastic character arcs, and an intense atmosphere guaranteed to satisfy anyone\u2019s craving for horror.\r\nMarai Nikki provides everything a horror anime fan could ever want including a demented and dark story line, some insane visuals, and tons of gore, which delivers a plethora of intensity from start to finish.  One of the objectives of an exploitation thriller is to always pack in a ton of insanity and haunting visuals to shock or disturb the audience into feeling uneasy consistently throughout each episode.Marai Nikki delivers on that front.  From the beginning it does not hold back immediately thrusting our protagonist Yuki into the horrifying setting where the goal is to use future diaries to kill others in a game to claim God\u2019s throne.  This hook featuring Yuno\u2019s introduction and some quality world building creates massive amounts of energy and anticipation.  The story itself may be nothing new in today's current times, but is elevated in this instance by the over the top intensity in this show that other survival game thrillers generally shy away from.  Around every turn are frequently haunting visuals and a sense of urgency that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat (so binge syndrome is a possibility with this one).  Another reason this show is so infamously insane is due to its demented and depressing tone coupled with many memorable twists and turns.  These elements are well executed and well-paced as they fit into the story line perfectly and are never aggrandized.  Nothing is ever as it seems throughout the anime which plays into the overall fun the series has to offer.  Characters who you think are trustworthy may turn out to be demented and characters that are edgy may tend to be more morally grounded then one would think.  The anime also recognizes its purpose as an over the top brutal exploitation thriller and perceptibly avoids over stylization and dramatization allowing for the horror elements to shine.  These themes and tones palpably come together to create an unpredictable, twisted, and mental experience. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most underrated and less recognized aspects of Marai Nikki is its cast of characters and their brilliantly constructed character arcs.  The main character arcs in this anime focus on Yuno and Yuki\u2019s relationship throughout much of the show (and unless you live under a rock you know everything about that already).  Yuno\u2019s personality of course drives many of the changes we see in Yuki throughout most episodes.  However, I found the most interesting character development in the show to revolve around the side cast.  Much of the time we see many characters commit some of the most horrific acts of evil you could ever imagine.  However, by the end of the story many of these characters become strangely identifiable and even likable to the point where we perceive them as protagonists, which is extremely strange and very interesting.  Creating arcs in which a character can commit the most terrible crimes against humanity and then showing them as someone who you should identify with is not an easy feat and rarely done well if at all.  These spectacularly well-constructed character arcs showcase the writer\u2019s abilities to create many memorable twists and turns but are also relevant to the themes of the show as identifying with these characters despite their atrocities adds to the unsettling tones throughout the show.  The cast is also well balanced in terms of their abilities and personalities.  We have character battles between children, brute type brawlers, strategists, and downright demented psychopaths which keeps the action and suspense diverse throughout the anime.    \\n\\n\r\nLastly the anime\u2019s atmosphere, animation and themes clearly exemplify how an anime does not have to be cleanly animated or overly detailed to have an impact.  The animation, soundtrack, and setting all focus on intense character expressions and action sequences throughout the show.  This allows for the audience to focus on the weight of each movement during these sequences along with the terror on the faces of the characters rather than be distracted by overly detailed animation.  The soundtrack featuring Yousei Teikoku is also a nice touch and successfully adds a lot of excitement to each episode.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of this being said this show is not a complete masterpiece.  It could benefit from having Yuki\u2019s character arc appear earlier in the show as in the beginning he is overly obnoxious at times.  Another point to consider is at its core this is a horror slasher anime so it is of course lacking in depth or meaning.  However, while it is certainly not for the faint of heart Marai Nikki will always be remembered as one of the greats in the horror/psychological anime realm and a must watch for any fan of the genre.\\n\\n\\n",

Before you read any further it'd be good if you knew that this review should not spoil the story any more than the MAL synopsis has.. The best thing about the anime is it's story progression (not the story itself which had a lot of problems for me). I know special attention was given tokeeping the suspense because of it's ability to make going from one episode to another less of a chore.The feeling I got was not that I HAD to check the next episode so that I could eventually find out if I wasted my time even starting the show; instead I felt like I had to know what happened next almost every episode.Besides that there were a lot of problems with this anime like \"why did Yuno care so much about Yuki, that she'd do what she did?\", the unnecessary moments where the female characters were made into fan service despite the good quality of the story which will keep people interested anyways.I think the score in relation to art should be low if they couldn't do any better than that, and for the character development to take the turn it did was a bad choice as well so even though I love how they built up the story I can't say it was as good as I'd like it to have been.",

Mirai Nikki is a thriller in which the characters play their role until the end. 12 characters gain the power to see the future by Deus Ex (the God of Time and Space) through use of their individual diaries. Each diary has its unique advantage as well as its own disadvantage that helps the character survive (or die). The story line isn't why people should watch this Anime. Yuno - the main female plays the best Yandere I have ever seen. Obsessed withthe main Male lead -Yuuki, Yuno protects him until the very end. Yuno is beautiful, smart, and resourceful but when watchers learn what she is really capable of its both scary and fascinating. If you read the Manga then you know that this anime also has a surprise twist at the end.",

It is one of those Unique anime's that you will rarely find, but when you do, you'll have so many urge's to watch it forever!\r\nStory: The story for Mirai Nikki is amazing, For a survival genre of anime, I'm really impressed with the originality that has been set, It has so many twists and turns that will leave you clueless, bombshells that will make your jaw drop & Literally the most unique ending I have EVERseen! It will have you in tears, begging for more!\\n\r\nOverall I rate the story a 10/10 Easily, It is so amazing so It deserves nothing less!\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Mirai Nikki was very well done, you get the nice motion, modern day feel with the new anime's while watching this, the Scenery is amazing as well, especially how well the atmospheric changes occur at the right moment, for instance, an emotional scene would have rain or snow.\\n\r\nThere might be a few scene's that leave you a question or two, but it's really hard to notice and is usually just a distant face or an odd angle, Overall, I rate it an 8/10 :)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for Mirai Nikki is Outstanding, it encourages the experience of feeling like you're actually there! the combat music is one of a kind, it couldn't be better, however, it was the emotional soundtracks that really got me, the are honestly to good to explain, you'll have to watch it and see what I mean :P\\n\r\nOverall, I rate the sound a 9/10 (p.s there may be a few overused sound effects that you will hear in blogs & skits, but it really doesn't affect the experience)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character build in this anime is Flawless, they'll feel so real you'll start to believe they are! It astonishes me how well they developed each character, good or bad, giving them their own unique features that makes them grow into someone you'll be fascinated in! The dark past's and bright future's of everyone make the characters more likeable as well!\\n\r\nOverall, I rate the character's a 10/10 they couldn't have made it better\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have said it before and I will say it again, I LOVED Mirai Nikki, with each episode bringing a new  adventure to the table you'll never be sitting there in boredom! every episode will leave you begging for more because it is so addictive, Overall, I rate the Enjoyment a 9/10 (The only reason why it isn't a 10 is because there is such an emotional part that will make you break down and cry like a baby)\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating is a 9/10! It is absolutely outstanding and is definitely a must watch! I tried to make sure I didn't reveal any spoilers whilst also trying to make it sound approachable, so sorry if this wasn't to helpful :P\\n\r\nOnce again this is my first review, so don't be to harsh!

I have no way to give an honest review of this anime without spoiling so PLEASE...if you have not seen the anime or do not wanna be spoiled do not read past this point. Thank you, now lets get on with the review.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nFinal warning, if you don't want to be spoiled  STOP reading. The Future Diary entail of a game involving 12 users and their cell phones and one over seer Deus Ex Machina to win the throne of god.The game involves the 12 going at it like animals in survival of the fittest. I really love the aspect of this whole anime in general. This plot is simple but yet its not about the game. No the main story is the words \"Maybe one day when we're older.\" This quote only shows when will the day actually come when our dreams and futures unfold and that is what this anime is trying to say. It says you never know whats going to happen until it happens and thats what made the story of this so good. Towards the end of the game is when I had no idea what was right or wrong. The twists of the end game  mind boogled me than any other anime could. If you don't understand any of this, watch the anime, the 10/10 is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nDamn son this anime was sadistically beautiful. No matter how I looked at it they did everything right with how this anime looked. No hiding or anyhting it is clear and beautiful. Simple as that and if you don't understand, watch the anime 10/10 is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nUsually Sound always does good for me but in this anime has one of the best assortment of music. Its generic for an anime to have good music but I don't know the whole line-up made me feel what this anime is all about and if you don't understand, watch the anime, 10/10 is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10//10\\n\r\nThis is what I loved the most about this anime. Hell if there was an option this would get an 11/10. This anime by far had the most unique cast of characters and you know what, I enjoyed them all. I won't talk about all of them but I will only scratch at the ones who got to me the most. Yuno and Yuki. These two had the biggest impact on me while I was watching the anime. Yuki is an average shy and sort of pathetic kid who can be easily manipulated. He has no friends and like a lot of kids with his abnormalities the main cause was his parents divorcing. Out of all the characters you would think he would be the first to die but then comes Yuno. She is a very pretty, smart girl who is obsessed with Yuki. Obsessed probably isn't even a strong enough term to describe how she loves Yuki. She takes matters in her own hands to protect Yuki even if that means keeping him isolated from friends or family. Their relationship seems forced from the start of the anime but over time through the anime Yuki seems to fall for her. Thats what I love how your ot very sure what the status is between them. If anything above does not say 10/10 this section should. The development between every character and relationships throughout must mean something and damn do they not make an amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI downright loved every single piece of this anime. I'm so glad I got the chance to watch this masterpiece. If you haven't seen this anime you NEED to. Trust me it is the best thing you will probably see and if you have seen the anime watch the OVA Redial. The ending is not complete  until you see the OVA as an extra bonus to this series.",

The characters slowly became terrible, save for Yuno. The characters were not believable at all. Yukki feels like a bad Shinji ripoff, but instead of having depth and character like Shinji, he really is just a little bitch. His abnormal tendency to forgive people who were trying to kill him 5 minutes prior is painful. Instead of giving the impression that he's desperate for affection, it just makes him impossible to like. His sudden personalitychange to a terribly cliche, over confident \"shounen jump badass\" made me cringe, and even Yuno was awful in these stages. The direction of the anime seemed childish, like they were trying to be cool by adding action and plot twists. The art wasn't too bad, though it wasn't the best either. The OPs are fairly representative of the quality of the show. The first complemented the series and was actually very good. The second half's OP had such bad engrish i was embarrassed to watch it. Each week after about episode 16 left me disappointed, expecting the great stuff I saw in the earlier episodes that i loved.\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole series i felt like a had been taken advantage of. I realise that lots of people will disagree with this review, claiming Mirai Nikki is \"badass\", but to be fair, lots of people like Naruto. I really am not trying to offend people, other than Naruto fans, but it had to be said.\\n\r\noverall, i would say, if you're looking for anime that feels like shounen jump while being more violent, with sexy Yuno, this might be for you. overall i wouldn't reccomend it",

I like the comedy relief character in the anime almost as much as my first, second, and thirdfavorites.  The comic relief was none other than twelfth because of the whole power rangers ripoff thing he had going on, outstanding.  In order my three favorites diary user were Yukiteru, Yuno, then both Marco and Ai (seventh) all three of these characters were amazing for their own details.  This anime was a very well written story but it of course had it's flaws that could have been prevented without the whole time travel thing.",

            "content": "This review doesn't contain any spoilers.\r\nMirai Nikki (further referred as MN) is a phenomenon in it's own way. I mean, how often do you see an anime, which is better than the manga it adapts? I don't think it would be easy to name at least 3 such titles. Even though \"better\" is extremely subjective in it's own way. I mean, most of the people who watched this probably don't even know it's an adaptation. But this isn't the only reason, you see. I will dive deeper now.\r\nThe story starts rather simple. There is this Yukiteru Amane boy, who enjoys staying isolated from his classmates.Describing himself as \"the spectator\", Yuki writes everything he sees around himself in a diary in his mobile phone. Also, Yuki often talks to his imaginary friend called Deus Ex Machina, or simply Deus sometimes, who also is a god. A slip of a tongue, when Yuki tells him he is bored living that way, leads to see by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nTwenty six episodes of MN took me 2 days to complete, even though I had to attend my university in parallel, so you can say each second of my free time was spent on them. And that is my fastest TV series so far. MN is not fast paced or rushed, but it is just so action filled I could not have stopped after I began. Time? Studies? Pfft, another crazy scene, coming right in!\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I think I began from a wrong end here. The main reason for this anime to become so popular and the thing people who watched this think of first when hearing about it is it's chardesign. Well, not character design in common, but a single character - a pink-haired yandere named Gasai Yuno. By the way, if you don't know what's yandere, you can google it up. Or you can just watch the anime, it's quite obvious by itself. Anyway, Yuno appears almost instantly after the series start and instantly starts kicking in with her bad-assery. She is just so so bad-ass she looks more of a main character than Yuki does. Probably the most widely-known yandere character ever, I bet you already saw Yuno somewhere. Tons of fan art of her everywhere. Just how cool every second of her is, I think, compensates for a completely stupid main character.\\n\\n\r\nOne another thing is how everything fits just in. The sound, the drawings, the story. The best opening I saw so far, also. It's just that action packed. One of my fellows referred to this as to \"one large freak circus\", and this somehow fits great. I mean, there are scenes those similar to those \"strategic\" ones like in Death Note, almost shounen type fights and chases (in the positive meaning of this, of course), touching drama scenes (wow). Even \"just talks\" and those often boring parts when they try to, ugh... \"revelate\", \"expand\" characters looks extremely interesting and fun. And, of course, these SUDDEN STORY TWISTS that you are not prepared for.\\n\\n\r\nAh, by the way, DO NOT read anything about this on the internets. The major spoiler can ruin the whole story, you see. And the story is the main plus of the series.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding the review, MN is not much of an anime, as a virus or a disease of some sort. It infects you and your head, leaving you to think of this one large action scene again and again. And to think of Yuno too. I haven't yes talked to anyone who disliked this, and I talked kind of to a lot of people about anime. Anyways, Mirai Nikki, instant classic and a must watch for everyone.",

As the show continued on, it tried mixing in a lot of things which eventually made the story a complete mess. It felt like they were adding in random shit as it went along and was really nothing but senseless fighting.\r\nYukiteru was a really bad character and got on my nerves a lot. I understand how being in a situation like that would leave someone frightened, but he pretty much let Yuno do his dirty work for the entirety of the show. He was also really stupid.\r\n(spoiler)\r\nWhenhis dad murdered his mom and left him on a building to die, he forgave him for all of it for some stupid cliche childhood promise of looking through a fucking telescope to stare at some stars.\\n\r\n(/spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was average. It wasn't bad, and it wasn't good at the same time. The animation of Deus was quite different from everyone else though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really liked the first theme song. It was a lot better than the second one. The voices kind of matched the characters (especially Yuki for being a huge faggot).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere really wasn't much character development. This is mainly because everyone gets killed of too quickly. Minene and Keigo are the only exceptions to this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show was somewhat enjoyable. I liked Minene. Everything else was honestly for the shits and giggles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThis review is kind of all over the place because I watched this show a long time ago but just now decided to write a review about it.",

The story has a very good pace and it does not slow down at all, which is great because it keeps the audience entertained throughout the 26 episodes.\r\nI especially love this anime partly because I was mesmerized by how the anime is brave and straight forward with the gore without having the audience turning away from the screen. If I compare this anime with Another, I will say that this anime's gory elements is way more entertaining than the ones in Another as inthis anime you are actually thinking along with the characters: \"Die b*tch dieee-!\" rather than \"Oh sh*t another person just die, UMMM....= =\"\\n\\n\r\nI also fell in love with the character developments in Mirai Nikki. Other than the yandere craziness, Gasai Yuno brings the audience to understand that sometimes love can become an illness, and that a person can become evil through motivations that originally evolve from a pure and innocent wish. It's her insecurity of not being able to receive love from her childhood that contributes to her insanity and her obsession with Yukiteru. Like Yagami Light in Death Notes whose arrogance and hunger for power lead him astray from his original goal of creating justice for the world, Gasai Yuno in Mirai Nikki turns her desire for love into something monstrous and uncontrollable... and I will just leave it at that since I don't want to spoil the story for anyone. And if you can follow my odd comparison of Gasai Yuno to Yagami Light still, the most impressive part about this story is that unlike Light who meets destruction in the end, Yuno is actually saved by love, hope, and forgiveness.... Okay. I will shut up now.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, definitely watch this mind-blowing anime! I highly recommend it. & Akise Aru, dayum, gotta love that boy.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nWhat do you think of when you hear the words \"wasted potential\"?\r\nThe most popular answer seems to be Sword Art Online: the story of how a decent action anime descended into the flames of Harem Hell. This is certainly true, but let's save that rant for another day.\r\nToday we talk about Mirai Nikki (The Future Diary)\r\nThis is rant about of brutal betrayal and wasted imagination.\r\nThis is a review of plot holes galore, cheaply written characters, and a shonen/seinen identity crises.\r\nThis is the story of M&M's personal vendetta against Mirai Nikki.\r\n*puts on +2 helmet of smithing*\r\nBring on the hate, my friends. I'm ready.\r\nDISCLAIMER:This rant is not liable for damages to home, property, 18th century pottery, or goldfish due to subsequent fan rampages.\\n\\n\r\nConsult your psychologist before reading.\\n\\n\r\nCONTAINS: PEANUTS, GLUTEN, AND SPOILERS\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's throw in all the cool things and see what sticks!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis was evidently the attitude of the whoever wrote this train wreck of a plot. Sure it's cool. Sure the fight scenes are awesome. But is it good?\\n\\n\r\nNo.\\n\\n\r\nThere was definitely good premise here. I liked the survival game setup and the concept of the future diaries. Unfortunately, the show fails to execute its ideas.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is a classic story of \"style over substance\". It cares far more about how \"cool\" everything is than how the plot actually works.\\n\\n\r\nDue to this, the series is chock-full of plot holes and completely illogical scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nHere are some examples:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 A small child has perfect access to poison gas with no explanation\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Yuno has bodies locked up in a room in her house just rotting on the floor, and the authorities never find them\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Sloppy murders are committed in broad daylight with little to no police involvement\\n\\n\r\nI can deal with a few out-of-the-box plot events, but virtually every part of the plot is highly improbable. None of these events are impossible, but they are unlikely. (I realize that this is a fantasy series, but even fantasies should follow basic storytelling rules). There should never be random, illogical things that appear without an explanation (e.g. there are killer robot dogs that someone just \"made\").\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the worst story problems seem to stem from random, illogical decisions on the part of the characters, just for the sake of convenience. For example, people are complete unfazed when a terrorist bombs the school. If I remember correctly, Yukki's mom never even bothered check up on him about it. I mean, it would have to have been on the news at some point. It seems highly improbable that she wouldn't know or care.\\n\\n\r\nAside from plot holes, there was another element of the storytelling that bothered me: Mirai Nikki has a seinen/shonen identity crises.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime wanted so desperately to be mature and psychological, but it also tried to appeal to younger audiences with wildly misplaced humor. It is super hard to have both of those things, and Mirai Nikki failed to pull it off. It didn't have the strength to pull off the themes it wanted to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely stereotypical and I was deeply disappointed with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Yukki, wasn't terrible, but he was misused. He mostly just served to whine about how crazy everything was. Yukki also does a random 180 in his attitude towards the end which did little to help my perception of him.\\n\\n\r\nYuno, probably one of the most overrated characters in history, was simply there to be a yandere. She fits the stereotype perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was forced and, again, mostly for convenience. For example, Nine, the bad ass terrorist, is quickly reduced to the role of tsundere for the sake of simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast was, for the most part, terribly exaggerated. The villains were way too reminiscent of typical shonen villains: gimmicky and over-the-top. In one episode, there was a man who dressed up as a giant eyeball and hypnotized people into fighting for him, Power Rangers' style.\\n\\n\r\nWhy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is what Mirai Nikki excels at. The op was awesome, and it's still one of my favorite ops today. The action was slick and stylized.\\n\\n\r\nThough it's far from being the goriest anime out there, it could still be a fun watch for gore fans.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki is far from a masterpiece, but there are worse things out there. For this reason, Mirai Nikki receives a score of 3 (almost completely terrible, but with some redeeming qualities).\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Mirai Nikki can be a fun watch if you don't think too much about it. Since I'm a nitpicker, and I HATE poor writing, my enjoyment suffered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you can sit back, relax, and accept it for what it is, you'll love Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you're like me and it's physically impossible to stop analyzing, you'll probably curse this heap of wasted potential forever.",

            "content": "[NOTE: There are minor spoilers in this review]\r\nWhat happens when you take \"The Hunger Games\" and include iPhones?\r\nYou get Mirai Nikki.\r\nMirai Nikki was one of those anime that really had uniqueness. Each character..ehm, I mean diary, was each different and each had a specific trait that matched what each of the diary owners characteristic were. Anyways, Mirai Nikki had so much twists and shock to the point where I was speechless(especially in Episode 23...that shocked me the most.)\r\nMirai Nikki was a really entertaining anime because it felt like I watched \"The Hunger Games\" in Anime version or in Japanese for instance. The concept was interestingand the characters actually had good character development with the main protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The basic concept was basically a survival game to see who would be the next God of Time and Space, set up by the current God of the world. The God chose 12? (hopefully i'm accurate -_-) people to battle it out with their phon...I mean...diaries so they can plan out how to eliminate them. I liked the concept because it would create a lot of twists and suspencefullness, this felt like one of those anime which will hold you on the back of your seats! (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork was pretty good and solid, I really like the gore they added though because it made it look a little realistic. The animation is a little bit funky looking, but I didn't change my mind that it was still enjoyable. (8.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound...it was alright at first, but then it started getting a little down and down, but the sound-track was amazing! I couldn't stop listening to the 2nd Arc Ending! Anyways, the sound was pretty good, could've improved a little more though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character had uniqueness...that's it. But overall, the protagonists and antagonists were each fun and clever. Each of the antagonists had interesting plans to kill each other with their diaries and they all have intelligent in them, that's what I like. From the protagonists however, Yuki was a little lob-sided, but still was a fun character to watch. Yuno however, was just the example of a perfect Yandere! She blew my mind from being a nice, gentle girl to this...idk what to call her...DEVIL! She became a deviled demon...and she was just badass in my opinion. They could've improved the character tbh, but still overall good. (7.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I ENJOYED THIS SERIES SO MUCH! I loved this battle that they had! Made me feel like \"what's gonna happen next?\" \"who's gonna die?\" \"what will happen?\" it made me ask these questions that later on would give me a lot of interesting answers. Just an enjoyable anime overall and you would love it too! (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime: Yes, definite watch, especially if you love Horror, Drama, and Suspence. This is a perfect watch for people because Mirai Nikki was a pretty good series overall and you might enjoy it also!\\n\\n\r\nSimilar Anime: Higurashi, Death Note, Sword Art Online(in the aspect of \"surviving\")\\n\\n\r\nFinal Comments: The anime really hit me, and I was glad that my friends told me to watch it because it was just amazing and I look forward to reading the manga in the future!\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n(Thank you guys for reading my first ever review...i'm not really good at writing reviews, but I gave it a try! Let me know what you think in my profile and I hope you enjoyed this review and you hope for me to post the next one!)",

            "content": "This is one seriously hard anime to review because I feel like I watched 3 different anime. The show has some very serious tone and theme problems, and at no point in time did it feel like this show came into it's own. \r\nThe premise behind this show is a survival game w/ 12 players, all of whom armed with magical fortune telling devices. I'm an absolute sucker for this genre. And this one sounds like it's really set up well. Thoughtful, bloody, and mature... I picked it up hoping for some serious cat and mouse mind games.\r\nUnfortunately, it's a lazy show. I was hopingfor some really cool deductions with the main character trying to find out who owns the Future Diaries, but 99% of the time, the owners just announce themselves to the protagonists. They rarely even go into detail about how these Diary Holders even found the protagonist. Very disappointing. The ending tries to get clever, and it could have been, but that laziness creeps in and they cheat by changing a few key characters and their motivations. Hard to go into detail without spoiling. \\n\\n\r\nWell how about the conflicts? The mind games they set up (some, rather elaborately), are usually trumped with simple violence almost always coming from the always crazy terrifying character Yuno, who possesses the impossible gift of always being able to see through other ppl's schemes. Seriously, it's not that she has an uncanny gift for foiling their enemies plans... she has an IMPOSSIBLE gift. One only attainable through lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe tones shift wildly from super serious cat-and-mouse, to super violent blood fest, to high school romance, to childish cutesy shonen comedy nonsense. There's one scene where a one eyed villian, who in a previous episode bombed a junior high school, get into a super cutesy fight with a super cutesy little girl (who's a god) after she messes up her hair style. At any given time, I have no idea when things are going to take a turn down WTF road. Also, on a side note, I could have definetly dealt with less fan service. Not that this one was aggregious (I'm looking at you No Game No Life). I just love anime, and everytime we have to sit through a high school girl in her panties, we go back 3 steps in the fight of making anime mainstream. It alienates people!\\n\\n\r\nAs for themes? Nothing overarching as I can see it. Maybe something to do with the timidity of the main character holding him back from living a nice life?  \\n\\n\r\nThe ensemble characters are great and varied, and there were definitely a few surprises in them, but unfortunately, the main story is bogged down with an insufferable, whiny mess of a main character. Yukkii does nothing but whine at his allies, they usually fix his mess, and that wouldn't be so bad if he was a side character, but as the protagonist, we're forced to observe this world through his eyes, and his paralyzed inaction makes for some really uncompelling scenes. You get frustrated with him really really quickly. \\n\\n\r\nBUT! After all that negativity I'm still giving this a positive review. Mostly because I just really really love this genre and I'm a sucker. Good characters, cool universe, buttloads of potential... lots of problems though...",

            "content": "When I started watching anime i needed suggestions to get started and the first thing people said to me was Mirai Nikki/Future diary, not knowing what i was getting into I pressed ahead and started watching.\r\nThe story of Mirai Nikki or future diary is a what if story? what if we could change the future? what if our lives were a game and what if our phones were things that kept us alive.\r\nMirai Nikki forces the viewer to watch as characters compete in a survival game, the story can be a little hard to follow and you can lose track of what has happened buteach and every episode leaves you wanting more and more while leaving you in suspense about what could happen to the main characters. but due to how intense the story can get and how easily you can lose your way I've given it a six.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of this show is a high standard and helps brings out a characters personality for example when certain scenes portray the character in a different light i.e obsessive. \\n\\n\r\nThe art helps make you want to back away but all the while gripping you to ensure you will continue watching. for I've given it a ten\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was not as powerful as the art but was still very good and kept you gripped until the very end of the episode, both the opening and ending themes suited the show and i have little complaints on this part. so this i have given it an eight.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, oh my those characters are unforgettable especially Yuno she has her cute side and then her yandere side, each character suits there role but at times in the story character development either didn't happen or happened to quickly. still the characters make up for the fairly written story and for that reason i've given it a nine.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment overall was fantastic and i never once found myself wanting to drop this show as its too good to pass up and lets be honest this show just keep making you want to watch more and more and that's why i love it. \\n\\n\r\nThat combined with the characters and the art and you have a near perfect show but if you don't keep track you easily lose your way as they don't really do recaps but over all a fantastic show that i highly recommend you watch and hare and it remains one of the most known if not one of the greatest anime that i have watched.\\n",

Though Yuki is quite the wimp and not the cool, amazing character like ichigo, naruto, etc., his loyalty and morals are good enough. Yuno's badass personality also makes up for Yuki's. \nPlot-10\nThe plot is pretty creative and so is the whole story line idea. 12 dairies which can predict the future, the last survivor becomming god... what can be better. There's love, friendship, betrayal and everything a good anime has.\nEvery character has their own plot and has their story intertwined into the series.\nArt/Sound-10\nThe Art and Soundis creative/original. Every Character's voice is perfectly matched especially Yuno with her normal and stalker crazy voice. =)\\n\\n\nEnjoyment-11\\n\ncan't even begin. Once i started, i got soo hooked that i rewatched the 3rd and 4th episode 4 times... The storyline is very unpredictable yet amazing.Though, i did finish the manga and it makes you love the series even more because Yuno happens to be not as crazy as you think. Every question (there are many) that you have are all answered in the end, so just be patient. The plot was well thought out.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is one of my favourite animes, it is a gore /romance /drama /action anime .. yeah a lot of stuff.. does it excels at everything? I will explain every point. \r\nStory: 9/10. It may seem \"wtf is this\" at the beginning, because it's really confusing, but i believe that the story has no plot holes and everything gets the right explanation sooner or later. Don\u00b4t worry if it seems boring during the first episodes, because it is a litle boring because it's confuse. Once you get the plot, around the 5th episode, this anime just gets better and better until the end. \r\nThestory is a little bit complex and it may seem stupid .. well if you are of those who criticise everything and just likes slice of life (animes close to reality) well then yes it is stupid. If you are like me, a open mind, you will say \"this is actually cool\".. the plot for me was really creative and original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10. Probably you already heard about Gasai Yuno .. no? Well look in the web for this name and see the pictures xD .. she is just one of the most known characters of all time.. why ? Because she is not a clich\u00ea .. she is totally different from everything that i saw until now .. really a magnificent character .. \\n\\n\\n\r\nShe has everything that a character needs in a gore anime .. i loved the contrast between the good Yuno and the evil one and i think it matches just perfectly with her design (her design can be for a good person or a bad one, she is both good and bad so that's why the design is great) \\n\\n\r\nBesides that, as i said, she is not a clich\u00ea. Her feelings, her actions/reactions are unpredictable, and i just love that! Being incapable of guessing what's gonna happening it's just a nice thing ! She also have a brilliant development, really deep, really detailed, but it is not boring. Usually in a action anime, development is boring .. here .. it is better than the action it self.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso the \"evolution\" of the other main character, Yukiteru is great. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, we can see his evolution, he starts being a pussy and then .. well i can\u00b4t tell you because i would be spoiling but there is an interesting evolution along with the plot development on Yukiteru. There is just one little problem .. during 90% of the show, Yukiteru is a pain in the ass, really anoying.. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Some OST are nice, reasonable. Others are \"meh\" and then we have some nice OST. But i want to talk about the 1st opening. It is just mind blowing. One of the best until now. It just looks so nice when we compare it to the anime .. just fits so well and the music it self is cool. I really loved the opening, and i belive it is well done and matches perfectly with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. The character design is not the best out there. Also the background is not good either, but they are not on the bottom of the line, i found them reasonable, neither good nor bad. In the middle so. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well here our opinions can be extremely different. For those who like drama / horror (which are my favorite types) will find this anime outrageous. Plus we have a nice action and a nice romance. In fact, the romance here is one of the best romances i've ever saw. It just looks so different from the rest, which makes it pretty damn good. But if you like drama/romance without the horror scenes(so a normal slice life) you may not find this anime so good. Personally this anime is pretty original, creative and has great points to look at. So only if you hate horror you will dislike this anime. Moreover, this show has the best plot twist and the best ending that i've ever saw ! I will never forget this end for real !!! It has everything to be a nice ending. It is emotional, it is deep, it is so original, it just looks awesome, really it worth so much watching this show just because of this end. If you like sad endings, this one of them .. but and if you like happy endings? Well guess what this ending is both sad and happy .. just there are no words to describe this ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. I recomend it, it's a great show although it has a slow start, but at the end with that great final you will love both the begining and the ending. I found on this show, the perfect balance between romance/drama and gore, it also have some funny moments and the action is good. So i don\u00b4t know what is missing in this anime ;P",

            "content": "So let me tell you about how good this show is, I literally loved every minute of Mirai Nikki. After I finished it I made everyone I know(who was willing) watch it and then I watched it again just because I could. The best thing about the anime is that it keeps you guessing and basically in suspense up until the very end and at the end after all of the suspense you cry, you cry for years. The mc is extremely annoying but that's because he isn't like usually mc's where they are heroic and ready to battle whatever comes their way, he's morerealistic and how an actual 15 year old would react to the situation he is thrown in. Mirai Nikki is incredibly violent and gruesome at times so I wouldn't recommend it for those who are squeamish. Advice for future viewers; Please for all the is good in this world watch the OVA when you finish the show, it seriously makes the ending to the anime 10x better and not as depressing.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki a spectacular anime to withhold. The anime truly is amazing because the art is really well made. The fact that the characters have so many facial expressions. The main reason is that it kept on making me thinking about what's going to happen next. Every time whatever I think it turns out to be the opposite so it really is kind of mysterious. The characters have a really dynamic personality so there always changing and the anime is usually shown through the eyes of Amano, Yukiteru(the main character). Its also a really good romance anime about how they get closer to each othereven though the main character doesn't like Yuno. Luckily its not one of those anime's where they get together for a impractical reason. If you ever watch the anime give about the first 3 episodes a try. The first episode starts out pretty weak but the second and third just got better and better. The more they improved the more I enjoyed my self. I've had an awesome time watching the 8 episodes. The dub & original are quite good & appealing but I'd prefer you watch sub episodes because its so much better. The story starts off pretty smoothly.\\n",

            "content": "*Warning: This review may contain spoilers and is actually a rant*\r\nMirai Nikki is yet another anime with extremely interesting premise that completely wasted its Potential. It's about 12 people who have to fight against each other until only one is left with help of diaries (usually phones).\r\nI'll start with the easiest things to write. The Animation in this anime seems really weird to me, the character designs are incredibly weird, bold and sometimes the character movement looks ridiculous. The colour palette is full of too bright and shiny colours which ruin the atmosphere (why couldn't they use darker colours?). Both opening and Ending themes byYuusei Teikoku and Faylan are simply very catchy and great songs and I find myself listening to them sometimes even now. The background music and voices are however average at best. (With exception of 5th's voice, which makes me want to punch kittens.)\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters:\\n\r\n-1st, Yukiteru Amano is one of the most hated anime characters in recent anime history and is basically product of recent anime trend of pussy protagonists usually protected by insane girls (e.g. Ganta Igarashi, Shuu Ouma and that Accel World fatass, but the first real one is Shinji Ikari). At first I didn't know why every body hated him (C'mon, he's 14 year old, you would be scareed too!), but the thing is that even though some characters like Jacuzzi Splot are crybabies, they become stronger over time or grow balls when it's needed, but Yukiteru never does! He's always the same stupid pussy who never learns from his mistakes and tries too hard to save everyone and ends up killing lots of people. But that's not the worst thing! What absolutely pissed me off was when his father betrayed him several times and killed his mother and father told him it was for his good and wanted to see the stars with him and Yuki forgave him like nothing happened! WHAT THE ACTUAL F_!:$\u00f4,cK?!?!\\n\r\n-2nd, Yuno Gasai is probably the reason why you're watching this show, she's a psycho girl obsessed with Yuki and a part of the trend of yandere characters, I honestly don't like her because she's absolutely braindead and doesn't think about anything other than Yuukii and killing everybody (and everything) that comes close to him. Lame.\\n\r\n-3rd, Takao Hiyama is absolutely stupid and irrelevant character who dies in the first episode and has incredibly ridiculous outfit.\\n\r\n-4th, Keigo Kurusu is the most important side character of the 1st half of the show, he's a detective with ridiculous hair and incredibly indecisive.\\n\r\n-5th, Reisuke Houjou is one of the most annoying characters I've seen in a while, he's a 5-year old boy who's extremely selfish and he's got access to lethal weapons which even most adults don't.\\n\r\n-6th, Tsubaki Kasugano is just a whiny insane bitch. (Even though it's not really her own fault.)\\n\r\n-7th, Ai Mikami and Marco Ikusaba are a boring girl who throws knives and a douchebag with the stupid haircut.\\n\r\n-8th, Kamado Ueshita is a character with arguably the 2nd most powerful diary and the ugliest character design I've seen in some time. Even though she's powerful, she is irrelevant to story herself and dies absolutely stupid way.\\n\r\n-9th, Minene Uruyuu is the only diary holder that I kind of like for her craziness and liking to blow up stuff, but that doesn't mean much.\\n\r\n-10th, Karyuudo Tsukishima is a crazy man obsessed with dogs (probably some PETA activist?) who dies almost immediately after he is introduced.\\n\r\n-11th, John Balks, the most important character of the 2nd half (is it just me or does he look like a Jew?) who is obsessed with power. Meh.\\n\r\n-12th, Yomotsu Hirasaka is a totally braindead character who is blind and pretends to be a superhero who dies absolutely stupid death even though he knows he would.\\n\r\nOther Characters:\\n\r\n-Deus Ex Machina and Murmur, almighty God of time and space with terrible hairstyle (how come he doesn't know the winner of the game, he could have spared the lives of all the stupid people who senselessly died) and the most annoying loli I've ever seen with some retarded comedy specials.\\n\r\n-Aru Akise,  The only character I really liked, even though he is a Near ripoff and Yaoi fangirls fanservice character, but he's at least kind of smart unlike everybody else.\\n\r\n-Ouji Kousaka, retarded douchebag.\\n\r\n-Hinata Hino, another useless girl.\\n\r\n-Mao Nonosaka. If Akise was fanservioce for yaoi fangirls, this girl was just a stupid fanservice for yuri fanboys\\n\r\n-Kurou Amano, Throw. him. into. FIRE. I so wanted to see this guy die violently.\\n\r\n-Rea Amano, Yuki's mother who obviously doesn't give a damn what her son is doing so she just designs some (eroge?) games. (probably PS3 exclusives)\\n\r\n-Masumi Nishijima, another police officer who's in love with Minene, also useless. (why the hell am i writing about him?)\\n\\n\r\nThe story basically consists of lots of interesting but incredibly lame and extremely anticlimactic twists. (Take the death of the 11th for example.) But there is just something that keeps you watching it even though it makes mostly no sense.\\n\r\nThe thing that makes absolutely no sense is that since 1st killed 3rd everyone is just going after him, which seems really stupid. more \"free for all\" approach would have been welcome. There is also some stupid forced romance.\\n\r\nAnd the conclusion totally reminds me of Madoka Magica because it uses that Deus Ex Machina Time-leaping bullcrap again. As much as I disliked both Eden of the East endings, they were still better than this crap.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Mirai Nikki is dumb fun, it is bad, but if you turn of your brain, you might enjoy this.\\n\r\n*Excuse some typographic mistakes*\\n\\n\r\nOverall: a strong 6.4",

I cried and laughed so many times, it's simultaneously a sad and beautiful Anime.\r\nIf I have anything to say; if you're going to watch this Anime (which you definitely should)watch it till the very end! And after you watched the last episode watch the Redial OVA.\\n\r\nYou'll have a big hole in your heart after watching the ending, but the Redial OVA just fills it up again.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 love this Anime \u2665",

Mirai Nikki is intense every moment of it, it has romance, every character - even the minor ones - have a back story, and it is twisted and demented in a good way. \r\nif you want an anime that will both make you cry, get scared andmake you laugh, this is the perfect anime for you. and also i recommend not looking it up on wikipedia as that is what i did (i know im a dumbass) and i unintentionally read a major spoiler and it pissed me off because all i wanted was to see the episode list! \\n\\n\r\neither way, i give Mirai Nikki a 10/10.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki. A pretty popular anime where the female mc may be more popular than the show itself. It's a love hate anime where you either love it or want to burn it. I so wanted to burn it. Are there spoilers in this review? Maybe.\r\nStory- 4\r\nThe idea of a survival game wasn't really original but it's not really overused. But the idea of having diaries that can tell the future was a bit intriguing. The way the story was executed was fucking poor though. The first mc introduced is Yukiteru Amano (aka Yuki) who is a 2nd year in middle school that has nofriends, but spends his time recording his surroundings in his phone. In his imagination, he talks to Deus Ex Machina, the god of time and space,  and their servant Mur Mur. One day, he finds out that the entries in his phone have already been written. It was the beginning of the day and the entries were about things that were to happen a few minutes or hours later. He uses this as a way to get around school and avoid trouble. That was his future diary. And then, the second mc is introduced. It's Gasai Yuno. You know, the poster girl of Mirai Nikki that apparently everyone loves who has crazy eyes and pink hair with ribbons. She is obsessed with Yukiteru (or as he likes to call him 'Yuki!!') and the viewers find out that she herself has a future diary that's all about what Yukiteru will do every ten minutes--it doesnt matter if she's with/near him or not, she will get entries about him no matter what. She confesses her love for him and after protecting him from a serial murderer who's been targeting Yukiteru, they meet Deus Ex Machina and learn that they are in a survival game with 10 other people where they all have to kill each other in order to gain position as the new god of space and time. Sounds interesting, but as the anime goes on, the whole thing becomes a mess.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\nThere's nothing special about the art, but it was pretty consistent. It wasn't like Kyoto where there were sparkling eyes and cherry blossoms everywhere. Nor was it SHAFT with head tilts every five seconds. It was mediocre, but I do appreciate that the quality didnt go up and down from good to shitty.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThis is the only good thing about the anime. The OPs and EDs are very good and catchy. It really went along with the whole horror, [psychological, thriller theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-1\\n\r\nThe characters were so pathetic. This was the worst part of the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nYukiteru Amano- He is the biggest fuckboy in anime HISTORY probably. That might be going a bit far, but that's how i see. For about 95% of the anime, he is cowering behind Yuno as she does all the dirty work for him. I mean, I know he was a middle schooler who was just placed into a survival game, but can he not cry out every 5 seconds it gave me headaches. He's screaming and crying most of the time, and is gullible as hell. First, you make him weak, and you gotta add gullible too? Too much. The good thing that he was no generic anime hero like Kirito from SAO or Tatsuya from Mahouka, but that's also the bad thing about him. It's as if the writers didn't know about something called a 'realistic character'. It's either they're a fuckboy or a 'flawless' and dull hero. And by realistic character, I mean make them have internal conflicts that they actually SOLVE, and also have them become strong internally and physically without bullshit. His character had no development and even when there was 'development', he acted like a cool 'badass' for 3 episodes and then went back to crying. It was so laughable....welp they tried. But what's even worse is the fact that he's so forgiving. Being a forgiving person is an incredible trait; it helps you grow as a person. But Yukiteru was so forgiving I couldn't believe it. His ability to forgive was only annoying and of course did no good for his character. You could kill his whole family and then say you love him and stab someone for him and then he'd go from hiding in the corner to worshiping you again...that was unbelievable too. His feelings were really confusing too; by the end of the anime, I was questioning all his feelings and choices because I couldn't believe how stupid and weird he was. But they probably made his character this way so that there'd be a purpose to bring in Yuno.\\n\\n\r\nYuno Gasai-  Psychically cute I guess. Total badass who can kill without regret or moment of doubt. That's all she is. A 'yandere'. People said that they only enjoyed the show because of her which was not the case for me. Watching her killing people was only enjoyable if I didn't really like the character, but everything else about Yuno was terrible. She was a 14 year old who dedicated her life to another 14 year old who couldn't even decide what to eat on his own. She was selfish and annoying; she couldn't even let Yuki do what he wanted to do, like have any other friend who wasn't her. She only thought about her own feelings which showed that she wasn't really in love with him--idk what she was but that is not love. I mean, drugging your crush and trying to seduce him in just your undergarments while you make his close classmates watch him be taken advantage of? Totally selfish and unnecessary. What she did to Yuki was not cute at all and everytime she showed up and screamed 'Yuki!!' I cringed and wanted to die. Which was every fucking second. She made me incredibly uncomfortable and I don't care what she did to herself at the end of the series. I still believe that she never loved Yuki and just liked the idea of taken advantage of someone. Gross person. (Oh yeah, her yandere act stopped entertaining me after a few episodes)\\n\\n\r\nSide characters- Only two out of the like 50 side characters were memorable: Uryuu Minene and Akise Aru. Though Uryuu was a pretty chill and cool person, there were some things about her that I never understood. Like becoming friends with the person who took out her left eye. They basically tried to make her into a basic textbook tsundere which I thought was a bit disappointing. She's still one of my faves nonetheless. But Akise Aru was such a good character. He deserved more screen time than anyone. He was clever and mysterious and just such a good character. He wasn't really relatable just like everyone else in the series, but how interesting he was was more than enough to make him likable. Everyone else wasn't really likable or memorable, and although a lot of them had tragic stories in order for them to maybe be memorable, they weren't. One question I had though was why they never focused on Eleven--the creator of the whole future diary idea. He was important as hell, yet he didn't get as much screentime as needed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-4\\n\r\nThe beginning was a bit interesting, but everything became such a mess as it went on. The end was interesting, but it was such bullshit that they had to make an OVA a year later to finally calm everyone down. I still wasn't satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-2\\n\r\nI would never recommend this to someone. I'm not that cruel to do that...even if i hated them. This anime is not worth anyone's time...unless you love yanderes and useless characters and fillers then go ahead and be my guest.\\n",

Future Dairy in my opinion is the anime that could close out the entire anime genre because it is the greatest anime ever made, but with that being said I guess I should explain why I think that. Future dairy is a psychological survival horror anime at its core but weaves together action, suspense and romance as well to bring you this perfect sense of emersion that will have you want to finsh it in one sitting. I love future dairy because of how perfectly paced it is and howyou think you can predict the plot but you cant. Check out my full video review at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0CGHR__pKw",

            "content": "The review becomes short if i don't mention the spoilers. But i must say that this is the worst anime i have ever watched. I saw the name of this anime in most popular list but well looks like I confused the meaning of popularity. Popularity doesn't mean it is good. Just like those few people who are evil & bad but are popular, same goes with Mirai Nikki. When i completed this anime i got so depressed that i had to watch other anime's to feel better. This anime has probably the worst ending ever.\r\nOh & not only the ending is messed up buti say the whole story line. Some people say it has good romantic scenes. I say that nothing is romantic but only rape/nudity/kissing is shown. Yuno & Yuki relationship was one sided only, even half of the episodes passed Yuki called Yuno as \"stalker\" but what Yuno does? Always kiss Yuki in the middle of the danger/fight and Yuki shows no resistance. I mean what the hell is going on? Yuno drugs him, Yuno was getting exposed day by day but Yuki in the end still managed to shows love and what happens in the end? It looks like Yuki had to go to asylum. This shows the character & story is poorly developed. \\n\\n\r\nIt has worst romance, it has worst ending & worst character. To cover this mess up they released an OVA after probably almost an year. To somehow make those people happy who were complaining but sorry it looks like the author was just writing the story without even thinking of the ending.",

            "content": "If you are a person looking for an anime series or to view and to relax, an anime cause you many interesting and unexpected circumstances that you can not expect them to, then Mirai Nikki might be an option very suitable for you. I'm the one who came across this exciting anime series, it was great that I can become a fan of it.\r\nMirai Nikki- A bold new anime to survive and maybe bring a little bit horror under the appearance of Yuno Gasai- a character that I think she is the focus of the film, one person people often call her Queen Yandere Yandereor something like that =))). The story is about a boy whose name is Amano and eleven others, including Juno phones owned by Deux gift called \"future diary\", they along with the diary that how to destroy ten a man left to return to the lord of time instead of Deux. The motifs of this existential anime you may have encountered a lot but with Mirai Nikki, you can see many differences. With a plot development, a normal situation like that, the author has succeeded in revealing emotions like happiness and sadness character or anger, reveals much about the past as well as their main purpose with the pursuit of this war to the end to achieve their own purposes, desires or save loved ones or their friends. Ten or twelve people with personalities and different purposes, they have come together to make up a meaningful fight and give us many profound lessons.\\n\r\nHowever, the characters are not very many external focus and Yuno and Amano, who is considered the number one and number two. Additionally, one might say more about Akise Aru, a character began to appear from the middle part of the film, he's pretty cool and the focus of all attention of the fanboy and fangirl when love with Amano and the Deux created as an observer. Amano - main main, a boy who has a habit of keeping a diary on your phone and record what happens around himself, he is quite lonely and has no friends. During the war, Amano must be a partner to bring you many fail because the season is almost over the film, he showed a face frail and useless, even as tears, indecisive. He very easily deceived and taken advantage of as a puppet, makes much time took away the appeal of the film. But not so that we are not talking about the good side of Amano Yukiteru, since his parents lost by certain intervention in the war, he had a completely different face, strong more, more sly and gradually realized that to survive and achieve their own aspirations, he must accept the sacrifice of others. Contrary to Yuki, Yuno Gasai, viewed as Yuki's lover as well as the most formidable opponents of the war and who cooperate with him, is an intelligent and sensitive person. Yuno had an extremely traumatic past, she was a wealthy family adoptions but they too draconian and forced her into doing what they want, if not locked and a safety cage and day starved or difficulty swallowing food diets. Her life day and night all hell but Yuno does not hate his family. On days like that, she was born and psychological disorders hand down her parents killed accidentally and uncontrollably. Since then, she lost all purpose in life as well as their own dreams until Yuki gave her a belief in the aspirations of the schools surveyed. Since then, she vows to stand by and defend him before Yuki difficulties in life. And Akise Aru, which is just a character created for the purpose Deux observation but he was gradually get emotional and become a real person, beyond the control of the lords of time. And a few other minor characters such as the Friends of Yuki, Akise and Yuno, No. 9 Uryuu Minene or guys under his policeman of No. 4, they appear multiple times and cause unnecessary conflict also such situations and feelings cooperation irony and unexpected but just as easy to attract the attention of you-people who follow the film.\\n\r\nFront image of a action movie is extremely important, investment author quite thoroughly and extremely diverse, characters they bring personality and different characteristics, no two people are alike, each person bears the features, including their diaries, all with bloody action, facial expressions and the context of the battle that Yuno and Yuki experiencing really makes me feel see happy, satisfied and probably you too.\\n\r\nAs for sound, the OP and ED both extremely great, the voice actors are very well reflected his role in evoking the personality of the characters, especially Yuno and Yukiteru.\\n\r\nIn general, overall rating, I can see this is an anime worth watching and it is not too terrible. If as you would expect in a little work slightly bring horror and action but taking supernatural elements as well as special cast the Mirai Nikki is actually a pretty great choice for you. I can guarantee that you will have uttered one sentence: \"Oh it was great!\" for that view.",

            "content": "In my opinion this anime was very good. The moment you hear the intro song you know its a good anime. 'kuusou mesorogiwi' really grabs the watchers attention with its dark sounding song.\r\nSo anyway the plot, the anime is about 13 people in a death game quite similar to the hunger games. Each person has their own future diary what tells the future but each diary is different. To win the game you must be the last survivor and your award is you become the next god of time and space. But if you break your diary then you die.\r\nThe characters are all very differentand we do find out that each one is broken in some way from their past. But our main characters are Yukiteru Amano and Yuno Gasai. These two are both teens who go to the same school and you do find out that Yuno has feeling for Yuki for a long time but she is very obsessed with him. This is why she is by far one of my favorite anime characters she is very cute but is also very violent and after you watch the anime you remember her. But when it comes to Yuki I really did not like his character and the reason for it is hes just a coward. For example he couldn't stick up for himself he always needed Yuno by him side and when he did have the courage to kill someone by the next episode he would go back to his cowardly ways what is very frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the art style, it was good but nothing amazing but  bloody what i did enjoy about it considering there is alot of death involved. The voice acting was also alright but Tomosa Murata who voiced Yuno did an amazing job at catching her crazy where in the dub Yuno didn't sound as good in the sub.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?  Yes its actually one of my favorites each episode you will be wanting more and when it comes to the ending....Wow it blew my mind but here is something to consider when you come nearto finishing the anime pay attention or you wont understand how it ends because its kinda confusing least that's what happened to me. \\n\\n\r\nOver all i'm going to rate the anime a 8/10 stars and say that its a 15 because there is blood and some fan service but anyway thats the end of this review ^__^\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Future Diary (Mirai Nikki) is one hell of a crazy and entertaining ride. But only as long as you don't look at it too closely, because you'll notice many flaws if you do.\r\nCharacters - 7\r\nThe main character, 14 year old Yuki, is such a wimp that he makes Shinji Ikari look manly and heroic by comparison. But he's okay otherwise. I can think of a lot more annoying main characters.\r\nThe real star of the show is Yuki's overly attached girlfriend Yuno. She's smart, resourceful and completely unpredictable. And for some reason, she's madly in love with Yuki (pun intended).\r\nThe main characters and their relationshipdevelop over the course of the show. Yuki gets less wimpy, and Yuno gets... even more insane. There's also a wide variety of interesting and not-so-interesting side characters. Revy from Black Lagoon plays a crazy terrorist bomber and Kaworu from Evangelion plays an amateur detective.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nThe premise of this show is great. 12 players are selected to participate in a battle royale and given various devices that can predict the future. The winner of the game gets to become the GOD OF THE NEW WORLD (read in a dramatic voice of Light Yagami). But the execution of this idea is not that great. While the overarching story is great, there are plot holes galore and the characters are sometimes made to take unbelievably stupid actions in order to advance the plot or prevent the plot from taking an udesirable path. Also, the future-telling diaries are not really used to their full potential.\\n\r\nAs a side note, I feel the need to say that the police in this show are utterly useless. They completely ignore every murder that occurs and sometimes even cooperate with known criminals for their own personal.. wait, maybe this isn't such an unrealistic show after all.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 9\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice (except the mother from the orphanage - what the hell was that?). The animation is good and the action scenes look great. Just a warning (or maybe an incentive): there is a lot of graphic violence and shameless fanservice.\\n\r\nThe music was great and really helped in creating the right atmosphere when it needed to. The first opening was especially awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nIf you can overlook the plot holes and Yuki's constant crying and Yuno yelling 'Yuki!' every 10 seconds, you should be able to enjoy this show, because it has almost every possible ingredient to make it fun and enjoyable to watch: plenty of action, crazy and shocking plot twists, lots of horror and suspense, interesting and non-conventional romance and... you know - Yuno.",

I was excited for the ending but was crushed that such a great show had to end. This review is not meant to spoil any of the story and its purpose is to only convince you to watch this show.\r\nI've seen more than my fair share of bad reviews on Mirai Nikki and they bring up a lot of good points. It has more than its fair share of plotholes, characters do unexpected things that seem to happen unexplained and possibly out of order. But i believe if you look past all these plot holes you get a great show, love story (Sort of) and an amazing character in Yuno. Some endings seem forced but despite all that i fricken loved this show. I loved the story of Yuno and Yukki and i even love all the little thing about the other characters. Sometimes it feels like Yuno is carrying this show on her back but thats okay considering she is one of the most unique characters i have seen in anime and may go down as one of my favorite anime characters of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThis show kept drawing me back in with insane plot twists and i just needed to know what would happen next and most of all what would happen with our main characters relationship. Yes, this anime is full of plot holes but despite all that this was one of the most enjoyable rides i had and i certainly wont forget it. TBH i wish there could be more but there isnt very much else to do with this show. I highly recommend giving Mirai Nikki a try and just forget about whats wrong and focus what is great about this story.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you want a happy after its all over dont forget to watch Mirai Nikki Redial!",

I have seen a LOT of anime throughout my life, and unlike most others, I have to say that this plot is the only one out there. It never ceases to surprise me and I'm always eager to find out what happens next. \r\nThe art is not the type that I am used to, however after a few episodes I fell in love with the quality and art of this anime. \r\nThe sound is nice and clear. Each character's voice portrays each and every character perfectly. \r\nCharacter,FTW!!!, I believe the personality and attitude of each character in Mirrai Nikki is illustrated wonderfully. Yuno's obbsession over Yuuki and Yuuki's cowardness. I love all the characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate this a 10/10 if I could, I would rate it 1,000,000 out of 10. It's truly a masterpiece. I recommend it.",

I felt like I had the same buzz every time I watched an episode. As soon as I finished it, I said to myself that I would never find an anime as good as this one ever again...I ship Yunoand Yukki so much man it's amazing they just fix together so well. The ending was adorable as hell ( I'm referring to the OVA ending) But Overall I loved every second of this anime!!!",

To be given the fact that this anime explores on the relationship between each one and another (you will see soon enough) makes it enjoyable.

            "content": "Mirai Nikki aka Future Diary was my gateway anime. I read the synopsis for this seris and as sure as I was that South Park is the funniest show on television right now just above American Dad and The Simpsons, I was just as sure this is the one and only thing that could,no WILL make me watch more anime. And making pop culture references and mentioning other television shows is the way I write. When I do this I'm in my groove. No big words here or trying to sound smarter than you, I'm just going to tell you why I love this showand  why I think that Future Diary is one hell of a ride. This is only my second review on MAL and the first I think could've been better. I'm don't think I'm going to write another review for a while so I'm going to try my best with this.  Please if you could, let me know one or both of the following:\\n\r\n-What you think of this review by itself\\n\r\n- Is it an improvement over the last review, is it the same or is it worse?\\n\\n\r\nYou see to me, anime was Dragonball Z, Speed Racer, Yu Gi Oh! etc. A bunch of anime for kids that adults could also enjoy. I mean before a few years ago I was pretty ignorant when it came to anime, I  grew older and the biggest mystery to me in life was why I actually worshipped Pokemon.It was childish and as I was well into puberty I thought that maybe there has to be something better Japanese animation has to offer. Don't get me wrong, I like Dragon Ball Z but it didn't get to watch anime. It has its flaws like being really repetitive and having a group characters with constiaption, but I like the mindless fun. That's not to say I can't like other genres of this type of animation.\\n\\n\r\nI still watch shonen anime like Naruto and Bleach, but Future Diary is something special.I saw the subbed version of this show. The show is a combination of action adventure, psychological thriller has bits of comedy, and can be seen as a tragedy for a lot of the characers. The show has amazing character development, a story so engaging it will keep you glued to your television screen, incredible voice acting and much more. I will try to go through what makes this show so incredible one by one and what, if an any, can be improved.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND SETTING(Contains Minor Spoilers):\\n\r\nThe story kicks off with a girl being brutally murdered and a girl trying to revive a boy. This should tell you that this show will have a lot af violence and killing. The story then takes us to present day Japan where a boy named Yukiteru (our protaganist) is shown to be a solitary person. He keeps to himself and has almost no friends. He rather spends his time typing everything he sees into his diary.  His only friend is the imaginary god of space and time Deus Ex Machina who he talks to in his bedroom. One day Yukki sees his diary entris are already written down and everything that happens is written down in his cellphone.Yukki suspects Deus has something to do with this and it turns out Deus is not that imaginary. Deus forces Yuki to take part in a 12 man battle royale fight to the death. The diary of each participant now has the abilty to predict the future each with it's own benifits and weaknesses. The diary must be used by particiapants to kill each other with the winner being Deus' successor as god of space and time. You already have to be itching to see this if you have not already.I thought that it would be a lot like Death Note because of the concept te be a able to predict a future death but this show takes an old idea and makes it its own and Future Diary can even give Death Note a run for it's money. The writing for this series is razor sharp and the show never loses any steam during the 26 episode run. I have to admit that the show only really pulled me in with the second episode . The modern setting makes it accessible and watchable for a lot of people since a bunch of viewers don't like space westerns, period pieces or post apoctolyptic  shows. The show is full of twist and surprises. There is also a romantic subplot which a guy like me, who does not really care for romance enjoyed. Some people think that the ending was abrupt but I thought it was perfect. If you have a problem with it, read the manga or google the ending.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY AND SETTING; 10/10\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art of this show is incredible. Each character has their own look with different facial expressions and details, their own outfits which really looks like something you can buy from any store. The backgrounds and landscapes  are clear, whether it is water or grass. The houses,cars and buildings look amazing,some would say this is just really bright live action objects. Just one example of how beautiful this show is is to look at the sunset. Jim Carrey could not have said it better : B-E-A-UTIFUL. There is some CGI in here which can turn off some viewers, but it actually grew on me. It is just one character and one environment so you don't have to worry if it's not your cup of Pepsi. One more thing, the cellphones, the diaries, it really looks like the animators put real effort into designs and layout.  One of the best art out there.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nAnother highlight if this show is the hypnotic sound. No voice is out of place, villian,good guy, fat lady, fat guy all whose voices fit like \"like a glove\"-Jim Carrey. The sound apart from the story to me is the make or break factor for an anime series. The voice actors convey incredible emotion with just a voice and they obtain what they set out to achieve. If the character should be rooted for, hated, likeable or felt sorry for,this is exactly what happens. Yukki can come off as annoying and whiney but it's all part of the way he matures throughout the series. The instrumentals played throughout the series makes you want to cry if something sad is playing when someone is dying or when something heroic plays you actually get goosebumps. My eyes were watering of excitement when something really badass happened. How good must the music be to make you feel like that. Really Motherloving good! The opening and ending theme songs of Future Diary are are catchy, upbeat, and just plain first-rate. The shows contains two opening songs and two ending songs with my personal favourites being the first ending theme and second opening theme both having a fast tempo and are really feel good songs. The first ending theme sounds like Japanese pop and the second opening is more of rock n roll but both are very good. The other two are not bad either.The first opening sounds like classical mixed with pop and the second ending theme falls more under soft rock. Incredible voice acting, songs that fit the tone of the show perfectly,this really is possibly the show's greatest asset.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nI can't give this part a perfect score because there are like two contestants that you dont get to know as well as the other players and this agitated me because every other contestant gets their chance to shine. However every other character has  great character development with distinct personalities and qualities, there are even characters that are not part of the game that you begin to care for and learn to love. The main character Yukiteru, matures a lot through this show as I stated above. He is a unique main character, because he has his flaws. He doubts himself, and doesn't want to be god at the beginning of the story. He is not a fighter but bit by bit comes to terms with his situation and knows that he is a participant for a reason. Yuno who  is a smoking hot red head teen girl who has strong feelings for Yukiteru, is my favourite character on the show. She would do anything to protect Yukki, and is the most mysterious person in the game. Her actions ,her lack of mercy for other players , her abilities, she really  is a stand out character here.She plays major parts in the twists that occur,in the biginning, middle, end and everything inbetween of the series. Yuno is the the character that makes the story even more thrilling and epic than it already is. There are so many more characters but I'm really scared that if I summarise them it would take away the suspense and mind games that makes up this show.The other 10 contestants first appear as silhouttes when Deus first calls them together to explain the game so you don't know they are.Silouhettes + Mysterious characters=Guy biting nails. I'll just say there are killer and non-killers, lovers,terrorists,cops who all have their own reasons for wanting to be god. So with the exception of about two characters, everyone has a backstory. The non-contestant characters all three dimensional and are all believable. Friends or foes, all people that grab your attention. There is also a lot of moral abiguity because alliances can be formed and then be broken just like that. The acting of the characters, their facial expresions, everything is really good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis was as I said my gateway anime. After I saw this I wanted to learn more about Japan. I want to do Judo,I want to learn Japanese,I want to create a cartoon show similar to anime, and I know who Steve Blum and Akira Kurosawa is. This is that good. Violence,suspense,twists,subtle humour, I love this show and after this I'm going to watch Great Teacher Onizuka and Full Metal Alchemist all thanks to this gem, this piece of art. I'm not overselling this series,it really is incredible and even though I'm a casual fan and have only seen a handful of anime, I recommend this to a person who is a fan of any genre of anime or even if you are not an anime fan and just want to watch a a spectacular tv show.And please don't forget to comment.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10/10",

I am aware that everyone does not think like I do and there will be controversy, but to be fair you should respect my opinion as I am not forcing you to think like I am and this is just a review. Thanks :)\r\nMirai Nikki... I will start of by saying this: amazing character design, fair enough visuals, and a good story, combined with good sounds. You may think that I very well enjoyed this anime.... Well if you did, I am sadto say that you are wrong. You may ask why, and I shall tell you with my heart: I extremely dislike Yuno! Why? Well, because of Yuno, she managed to ruin the plot, character design and my overall enjoyment. I will explain more as I review the rest of the aspects of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory & plot: \\n\r\nPositives: Although the story is not overall original, as it was very much similar to Deadman Wonderland... The plot I may say, was very original and very intriguing as well. Every episode I was very interested to see what would happen next as each episode builds up with the \"juicy stuff\" and the twists and turns in the plot. Therefore, many things were unexpected , as the situation increases, and that is what makes the anime so enjoyable.\\n\r\nNegatives: The negatives actually overshadow the positives and that is because of one reason, for which I will get to. But, I would start of with the episodes near the end of the series; the anime tried very hard to build up the drama in each episode and tried to make it more complex. Although they somewhat achieved this, it also left with many plot holes which simply overshadow the complexity that the makers of the anime where trying to achieve. Also, including near the end, because of the plot holes, the plot simply diverged into two plots being a deathmatch survival game and a Yandere bullcrap thing. Because of the Yandere bullcrap thing, the anime gets ruined with the unnecessary scenes of \"love\" which made me barf. Without the Yandere bullcrap thing, the anime could've advanced in the story with less polt holes and more complexity without having to include unnecessary scenes. Oh yeah did I mention the ending is rubbish? The Yandere crap also helped made the character design fail as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design:\\n\r\nPositives: Mirai Nikki had one of the best character designs of all time, which eventually breaks down during near the end of the series. Characters are all very intriguing with their own backgrounds, morals, and goals. Each character also has their very own \"voice\" and are all very diverse with interesting personalities. Throughout the show, characters also develop more, and change sometimes their views. So, unlike most anime, the characters only become better and better as you learn more about them. The anime, being so that it has a diverse range of characters, it gives the viewer a chance to \"bond\" with a certain character.\\n\r\nnegatives: Throughout the show, being so that all the characters are so different, and some don't get enough scene time, and your favorite character may only last for so long... it is very unfortunate when your favorite character dies, since no one else can replace them.... Next, because the plot diverges into two separate plots, many once was important characters become no longer important as they seem to be discarded without a good end to any of them\\n\r\nwhich makes the only two \"important characters\" currently existing are: Yuno and Yuki. Because of that, all of the feeling and whatnot the other characters had, are now deemed to be nothing. The only relationships that the main character has now, is with Yuno. Where did all the other characters go?! The main character also changes into being a retarded f***! \\n\\n\r\nEverything else was fine enough, and wasn't very interesting to review on, as they are not bad nor too good. Therefore, this brings my call to action... Please, destroy the love relationship between Yuno and Yuki and change it to a friendly one. Although many people think that it drives the plot, there only has to be a slight fixture which everything else can still be the same. If Yuno and Yuki only had a friendly relationship, then the plot can remain fairly the same, only less disgustingly exaggerated, and with way less plot holes which makes the ending better. This can also change the character design; since Yuki and Yuno's relationship isn't that significant anymore, other characters can now be more important and the main character doesn't have to be a snot. I also won't be disgusted with the \"love scenes\" (they are definitely not pretty). Oh yeah, remember that horrible ending I said earlier? Yeah, with the \"love\" being replaced with friendship, the ending would be much better.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Normally I would probably give the anime a 1/10 as I was disgusted and pissed off throughout the anime. But, if the \"love\" can just be friendship, then I will give the anime: 7.12/10",

            "content": "*spoilers* yes, spoilers.\r\nJust hearing the name \"Mirai Nikki\" sends a shiver up my spine, the best way to describe such a show is fucked up. Girls going from cute loli princesses, into evil High-School girls that have nothing better to do than rip each other apart. Put aside the fact that everything is extremely unrealistic and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and you've got \"Mirai Nikki\", another Romantic, Psychological Thriller that's better than twilight.\r\nUsually I set up my reviews in sections, but this time i thought \"Fuck it\". Lets begin.\r\nLets get out the way and just point out that the art and sound art good.Nothing really to review here as it's everyone's separate opinion.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before you continue this review there is a question I've got to ask you. \\n\\n\r\nDo you like to be mindfucked so hard that you don't understand what the fuck is going on?\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered yes to that question, you may as well just start the anime now because that was my initial feeling during the time spent watching.\\n\\n\r\nMirai Nikki, an anime that for some reason I honestly don't understand, I love. The sheer amount of mindfuckery in this anime is enough to make a man explode in confusion and call the police for mental harassment. I never understood how the god of time was his dream and then real and fuck me it made no sense. I also didn't understand how they got the phones in the first place? Whatever, I might just have forgotten. Who gives a shit about the story? We got to see a cute girl go mental and kill shit. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters you may ask? The main guy was a prick, but Yuno made up for him. Yukiteru, or as Yuno commonly referred to him \"Yuki!\" was one of my least favourite characters of anime, ever. Until around the end when he decided to grow a fucking pair, he couldn't do shit for himself and made Yuno do everything. Thank god for that, if he'd tried to do something he would of died, instantaneously leaving a quick end. I found the other characters (1-12) pretty average. Other than Uryuu, nothing special. Uryuu was a good character, i just didn't understand what the fuck happened with her eventually. She went insane again after calming her tits and tried to kill Yuki? If only she had succeeded, what a shame. \\n\\n\r\nHere for the biggest and bulkiest part of the review? The part that everyone scrolls down because they don't have the time and effort to look through? Kick your feet up, sip on that mountain dew and prepare for a long block of text you honestly couldn't be fucked to read.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nWell, as a start I can guess I can say I \"Enjoyed\" Mirai Nikki. The fight's where pretty cool, and some of the characters on their own where even cooler. It had a good idea behind it, i just think it should've been explained better. I also think that they should've used a better main character, for instance one with balls. Though, I thought the whole Yuno protecting Yuki thing was pretty cool, i've still got to mention the fact that it would've been better if Yuki could man the fuck up and do something useful. He was literally just a 100KG Stone that Yuno had to get on her knees and drag along the plot. I loved the art, I thought the dead bodies that Yuno hid looked pretty sick and the characters themselves looked well-drawn. I'm trying not to drag this review along much longer as I wouldn't want to make it painfully long to read, so the best way to put this anime is a better version of guilty crown.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Conclusion: \\n\r\nThis show was pretty satisfying. If you're used to all the rom-com stuff, I'd strap on your seatbelt, put your dick back in your pants, and take this for a ride.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, and for those who wanted scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nLiked mirai nikki? Try mars of destruction.",

            "content": "--WARNING-- (This does contain a few spoilers, because it was hard not to put any in.)  \r\nI told myself I would never write a review for this anime simply because almost everything that I would type out would be negative. Now here I am.\r\n  I feel like I more or less should warn people who were as naive as me. I started this anime with high hopes and perhaps to see something that I had never before seen. While the concept was amazing, I don't feel they took it in the right direction.\r\n  I'm not going to sit here andgive you a run down of the whole anime because you really can look anywhere to find the story. But the bottom line is it was just an utter disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n  I came upon this anime by accident, but the idea of a survival game using cell phones and this fascinating girl known as \"Yuno\" captivated me. The first episode went by in what felt like less than ten minutes and I thought I was going to fall absolutely in love. The episodes when on and I found myself becoming more and more interested, but at about ten that all came crashing down.\\n\\n\r\n  I started to dislike it bit by bit. It began with Amano \"Yuki\" Yukiteru believing he was falling in love with Yuno. I myself couldn't feel pity for her, not with her stalker mentality and psychotic tendancies. He himself said she was crazy in the beginning and that he wouldn't get involved, but somehow or another he was able to completely throw that aside to give himself to her. How..how do you look past something like that?\\n\\n\r\n  Many people apparently do pity Yuki for ending up in the game at all, but I can't. I just can't. He made his bed and he ended up having to lie down in it.\\n\\n\r\n  In the end he turned into this complete brat who was willing to twist the entire world just to be with this insane girl and have his parents back. He even shot his friends who only wanted to help him and make him see what was really going on.\\n\\n\r\n  I will admit I loved characters such as Akise and Minene, but they only got so much screen time. It's honestly sad when you find yourself hating the two main characters in the end and wanting/begging for them to die.\\n\\n\r\n  I didn't get my wish. The final episodes were what made me score this anime the way I am. I found Yuki to be irritating, Yuno to be too obsessive, and parts of this whole thing to be pointless.\\n\\n\r\n  I wish it had gone in a better direction, because this \"love story\" just wasn't worth it.",

After watching Mirai Nikki I have to say its my favorite anime up to date, so you know this is going to be a positive review :)\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is absolutely great !The story Is a psychotic love thriller focusing on the two main characters Yukki and Yuno with tons of great supporting characters, a fast paced plot, a LOT of murder and gore, a plot twist that you'll never see coming, and an ending that'll leave you in tears. There are no filler episodes or any that feel that they didn't serve a purpose, and above all they wereall extremely enjoyable. The only problems that I have with the story which are minor are that at certain points, specifically in between episodes the story can feel disjointed like as if you missed something, and there is one plot hole that I found once I had finished the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe Animation is simply superb, the characters are all nicely animated and crisp and the art style, especially in the Yuno Physco scenes are done perfectly, and Yukki's reaction to them is done great as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nOkay seriously you know an opening theme is good when I, someone who usually always skips over the op of most animes watches it every episode, even in the middle of a 7 episode marathon. The first opening theme is my second favorite opening theme of any anime behind Cowboy Bebop's, it just fits Mirai Nikki so Perfectly. The ending songs of both season are good as well, the only bad thing is the second opening theme is kind of lame.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\n Yukki the main male  lead is pretty much a big wimp which may turn off some people but it worked for the show I think, and his few redeeming moments (and by that i mean when he isn't crying behind Yuno and he actually does something heroic) were amazingly satisfying to say the least. Now the real star of the show is Gasai Yuno, The main female lead. She can go from being the cutest and sweetest girl you've ever seen to being a completely psychotic lunatic then next. Literally there will be points where you'll be like \"Holy crap what a crazy B!*ch!!\" she's whats really gets you to watch more, you'll always be wonder what Yuno's gonna do next. The character development of Yukki is greatly done, and Yuno's back story is just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIf you enjoy action, great characters, a good love story, a jaw dropping plot twist, and don't mind some gore then Mirai Nikki is the show for you! Now do yourself a favor and watch this phenomenal amine!",

            "content": "Future Diary... Well... This anime is very popular for what I think is the wrong reason. If someone told you to watch it, their reasoning for saying so is because they most likely love the character Yuno Gasai. In my opinion, she was a biatch who was obsessed with this one guy.\r\nThe story was pretty good. Kind of reminded me of The Hunger Games because... It was basically the same thing except you're God if you win.  I found this concept to be interesting seeing as to the fact that I never got why anyone would want to be God. (8/10)\r\nThe art is somethingthat I really did like about this show. Just... the way the hair was drawn and the eyes... made it really enjoyable experience. And the way that the blood was drawn... That was very nice. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great to. I for one, watched it in Japanese, and I think the voice actors were very fitting. The music well... I really did like the track this show had to offer. The sad track was very pretty and I often find myself listening to it. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were overall, very interesting. Although I don't get why people would ever like her, Yuno was an interesting character. She is quite... well, insane but for good reason. There were lots of characters, all of them creepy in their own special way. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this show was.... Very good. It had a good amount of gore, sadness, and even it's share of romance. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would rate this show as very good. The whole idea of the show got me thinking how far I would go for someone else.",

It's fairly original and its unique *to my knowledge* however, it does seem to be a little rushed when it comes to certain antagonists. \r\nThe art is decent and it can look rather beautiful at times.\r\nThe opening's for this anime is amazing. It can capture you and get you to sing along and the scenes often have a beautiful soundtrack to match scenes. \r\nThe characters are fairly rounded. They all have unique personalities and each one adds on to the stories plot and has unique interactions.\\n\r\nOverall I believe this is great; however, it does have its flaws.",

            "content": "Mirai Nikki is kind of amazing. Not because it's good, but because it it does so much wrong all at once that it baffles me. Typically, bad or subpar anime only indulge in a few major \"anime tropes\" at a time. Even my ultimate nemesis Sword Art Online (which I still think was a worse experience than this one) does not throw as much shit into its story. Meanwhile, Mirai Nikki seems to have every anime trope in the book, and that too, bad ones. Cliche ones. Embarrassing ones that make anime fans go \"but wait, anime is not just porn!\" Mirai Nikki goes aboveand beyond by having them all. It's an exercise in stupidity. A cacophony of nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nFor that reason alone, I'd say it's worth one (just a single) watch. Lessons can be learned from this shitshow of a trainwreck. You could call Mirai Nikki \"How Not to Make a Good Anime\" because this is one the medium's low points. And yet, this has over an 8 on MAL, is #9 of the most popular anime, and Yuno Gasai is the #1 most favorited female character of all time. Well... there's no accounting for taste. Also, I think my mindset before going into this anime really helped. I knew or at least suspected it was going to be terrible, so my expectations didn't let me down. I don't think I quite consider it a \"so bad it's good\" thing because there's a distinct lack of charm or appeal for me, but it wasn't totally unwatchable either. Aside from a few filler episodes, the pacing is very fast, so I didn't start getting bored until the end. There were some moments that were unintentionally hilarious too, so at least I got a laugh out of it sometimes. I'm sure it would've been really frustrating if I came into it thinking it'd be decent or good, but thankfully I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nNormally at this point in the review, I would be rambling and nitpicking every little thing that bothered me about the anime, but what do I say when literally almost everything is bad? Frankly, I don't even want to go back and think about it anymore than I already have. In fact, it's actually easier if I just named the few things I liked: 1] there's a few voice actors I happen to really like (Akira Ishida, Norio Wakamoto, Tomokazu Seki, Takehito Koyasu), and 2] Aru Akise is pretty much the only decently written and likable character of the cast. That's it. Honestly, I saw this anime because I can't help but watch the really popular stuff to see what the fuss is about. Now that I've ticked it off, I'm officially done. This review is me metaphorically washing my hands of it. \\n\\n\r\n(You know, if the author really wanted to make a story with jiggly boobs, the gang rape of teen girls, and 14 year olds having sex, he could've just made a hentai. I would've respected that far more, just saying.)",

I highly recommend this for thriller nuts and sci-fi lovers out there. I you are not used to gore and blood, you may back out on this one.\r\nSTORY AND PLOT 10/10\r\nThe story is mind boggling. Twist of events will blow you away. The premise was clear and intriguing, and world laws and settings were presented just right.\r\nART 7/10\r\nThe art was good, but not that outstanding.\r\nCHARACTER 6/10\r\nSome characters turned out to be likable. However, in the anime, most characters were not roundcharacters. They did not develop into better characters every episode, instead an abrupt change were imposed in the last episodes of the series. Characters were not presented in more depth, and I could have wished for a clearer presentation of motives, background, and psychology of the characters. Side characters seemed to me as wallflowers.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\nIf you like thrillers, Mirai Nikki has it all.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review for an anime since I believe this one deserves it.\r\nWhen my friends begged me to watch this show I hesitated. I looked at some of the reviews on this site and they were pretty mixed. I decided to watch it anyway and i'm glad I did, here's why.\r\nFirstly, the music. if you've heard the first opening to this show you'll know what i'm talking about. There is some great music in here, although some tracks I couldn't quite latch onto. Especially the second opening, which instead of not skipping like I did while binge watching the first half, didn't wantto sit through. I would've liked it better if they kept the first opening through the whole series, it might be just me though.\\n\\n\r\nNext, art. It's great. although there are a few minor cases of the anime bad cgi disease commonly seen throughout most modern shows. It might be jarring at first, but as the series went on I just grew accustomed to it. Other than the cg, the character designs are (and the food) pretty detailed.\\n\\n\r\nWith characters, it's a mixed bag. Some characters had me actually care about their well being, such as Minene, Nishijima, Akise, and Yuno. Yukki is what makes this a mixed bag. He's just a wuss. He's the type of person who needs people to do things for him, and in my opinion that's not how a main character should be. Despite this I still enjoyed watching what unfolded even if Yukki seemed to hold some things back.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to touch on the story. I personally loved it. The concept of a diary that tells the future sounded like a super cool idea. The story actually made me feel emotions of happiness, sadness, and disgust (people with hemophobia might wanna stay away from this show). Some parts had me at  the edge of my seat and always made me want to go one more episode in. I never felt that the story dragged at any time. Something was always happening.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this sounds a little bare-bones, i'll work hard to try and make better reviews in the future. Thanks for reading!",
