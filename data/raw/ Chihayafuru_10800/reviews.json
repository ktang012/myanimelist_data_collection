            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so bear with me as I try to sort out my thoughts on this wonderful anime.\r\nI almost didn't watch Chihayafuru, and I hadn't even heard of it until it was already a few weeks into the show. As time went on, more and more people were raving about how great it was, how it was going to be the sleeper hit this season, so I finally decided to give it a shot and see if a show about a card game really was THAT exciting. And let me tell you, it is. I am writing this reviewbecause I really, really, really want you to watch Chihayafuru and love it as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is so much more than a card game. To Chihaya, the protagonist of the series, karuta is also about creating a dream for herself, and the bonds she formed with her classmates Arata and Taichi back when she was twelve. Before graduating into middle school and going their separate ways, the three agreed to meet again when they all became Class A players. Arata moved back to Fukui, and even though he was fantastic at karuta (and the one who taught Chihaya!), he eventually quit playing after some unfortunate events. Taichi ends up at the same high school as Chihaya and helps her to form a karuta club, through which we are introduced to more wonderful characters.\\n\\n\r\nI remember someone saying that \"Chihayafuru loves its characters.\" This is certainly true. All of the main characters have grown since the start of the series and seem much more three-dimensional than those of many other shows out there today. Even supporting characters are fleshed out enough to be likable. In fact, there isn't a single character that I dislike. And if you know me, that's really saying something. I love hating on characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Chihayafuru is absolutely stunning. From the characters to the backgrounds, everything is breathtaking. The OST for the series is gorgeous as well, one of the best I've heard in a long time. They all complement each other to create a unique and wonderful tone for the series.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe this still isn't enough to convince you to watch Chihayafuru yet. Even though it doesn't sound like a memory card game can be entertaining, it really is. The karuta matches are some of the most intense scenes throughout, and you'll probably find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat when it's finally over. Karuta isn't simply memorization either. It's about reflexes, and mental stamina, and Chihaya even has extraordinary hearing which sometimes helps her to quickly win cards over from her opponent.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't know how else to put it. The cinematography of this show is amazing. The characters are developed and lovable. The story, while often predictable, is still exciting and endearing. There wasn't a single episode that I didn't enjoy. I breezed through the seventeen currently-aired episodes in just under three days, which I haven't been able to do even for some of the most exciting anime I've seen.  I just couldn't wait to see what happened next! (Also, this show will give you a LOT of feelings. Just wait). I can't believe I waited so long to watch this series. And if you decide to watch it too, believe me, you'll be saying the same thing.",

            "content": "\"What the hell is Katura?\"\r\nOf course, that was my first reaction.\r\nBut then...\r\nWow...\r\nJust wow...\r\nAt first, this anime really didn't catch my interest. It was plain and dry, like trying to shape out the dry clay; but as it went on, I found myself immersed in it. Like a sea of colors vibrantly expanding across an infinite of sky. Yes, even now, fifteen minutes after I finally saw the last episode, I am still numbed by its excellence.\r\n**NO SPOILERS**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory:\r\nIn the beginning, the story seemed boring. Predictable. Like a boat streaming across still water. It was lifeless, and simple. I expected it to be like any other Animewith a swindle of a romance eclipsed by the ever flamboyant facade of a sport or activity.\\n\\n\r\nBut somewhere, as the series progressed, it seemed to evolve. It seamlessly grew to something more, something beyond the natural limits of a story. It wasn't plagued with typical conflicts or unrequited desires, it was like a light that slowly lit itself brighter and brighter, unblocked by the trends of literature and expectation. Barriers that innately shackled a series' potential seemed to fade away, and every climactic moment that the characters felt was somehow shared with the viewer. As if a crescendo of realization would slay you alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was about the sport, Katura. And, you'd think: \"Well, if its just about a sport its not like anything interesting can happen.\" But somehow, it was different. The sport was a sort of catalyst that helped the characters not only develop towards one another, but it opened the door for an entire world that we all seem to forget, as if blinded by the mundane trudge of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe competitive aspect of the game, which yearned for such a demand of stamina seemed to be later eclipsed by the \"true\" virtue hidden within the sport. Yes, what the beginner sees, and the masters forget: The poetry. Such an attribute slowly became the mortar that gave new meaning to each simple issue that arose during the characters' failures.\\n\\n\r\nIt was seamless as we learned with them, through their desperation and hardship; their envy and willpower. The goals kept increasing, and aspirations began to soar, capping only at what the characters truly wanted.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nRomance. Friendship. Deeper revelations. Aspiration oriented. Perseverance through strength. No text box storytelling. Failure.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was interesting. It had primarily bold lines, and definitely took some getting used to. But now that I finished it, I really couldn't imagine this anime any other way.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, since this show is so off on a tangent in the first place, it seemed necessary to break the norm. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that there were moments when I wished that they wouldn't have. The fact of the matter is, the art does well for its purpose, but it seems like it was aimed at a particular niche. I guess it just comes down to personal preference, really. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the art was still phenomenal. Everything down to lighting was near perfect, and facial expressions were particularly pronounced so as to invoke the true feelings of the characters. Bloom, Sparkles, Glitter, Comical Backdrops, and Chibi Moments;  everything seemed in good shape.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it had a realistic feel. Which held tremors to the viewer considering the entire theme could be realistically translated into anything the viewer truly desired.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nThe art was different, but really you shouldn't have any complaints. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAh. Sound.\\n\\n\r\nThis soundtrack is simply awe inspiring. Even now, as I write this review, I have OST 7 \"Main Theme\" on loop. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show was EXTREMELY good. It did very well to convey the emotions that were felt by the characters, and worked seamlessly with the art and choreography to invoke what the moments wished you to feel. To be honest, the music had a voice of its own. As if it was an entire character separate of the cast, watching the show with you, helping you along through the tears.\\n\\n\r\nIt sympathized with you when necessary, and laughed alongside you, guided you along the adventurous moments... It really couldn't have been any better.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this show had 5 frames a second and 1980's art, I would still choke for air at how many times this musical score seems to steal your breath away.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I'll still be listening to this music many decades later. Thank you, Kousuke Yamashita.\\n\\n\r\nIf only I could rate this 20.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nSymphony. Commonly repeating motif. Varied orchestration. Light sounds mixed with heavy ensembles. Stellar composition.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile romance is an aspect of the story, it is merely a development feature. Note that the story is more so directed toward the love of friendship and the game itself than it is towards any romantic moments.\\n\\n\r\nTo start with, each character occupies a niche.\\n\\n\r\nAyase is a beauty, yet it is in vain. The moment she speaks, it is broken by her tomboyish image and personal drive. But its those very traits that reel you in. She is the joyous energy that keeps the group together, and despite her clear superiority in the game, genuinely cares for her friends, and helps aid them in their journey to pursue Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi, Ayase's childhood friend, remains her loyal companion throughout the years. His mental forte is unmatched to most every player the game has ever known; even once reciting every card at random in the entire deck of 100, just because he could. His family is privileged, and he is pressured by his parents to keep at the highest tier in terms of sports and exams. His brains keep him on par with the purists that achieve their status merely due to athletic prowess. He acts as the groups motivator and leader, often amping everyone out of their slumps with \"Just the right words\" to turn them around.\\n\\n\r\nArata represents the reverse side to Taichi, being the poorer, lesser appreciated, segment to the story. As the story progresses, his darker past becomes realized, and he continues to become a shining beacon for Ayase. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a triangle romance between the three of them, but remember, the show does not articulate this enough for this show to be branded as a romance.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are a great many other supporting characters that help aid Ayase on her journey to realize herself through Katura, each having a realistic and effective back story that warps the plot in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nThe characters were diverse, which allowed for the story to be seen through a wide spectrum. Realistic. Believable. Nothing was over exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDid I find this show enjoyable?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in a way I did.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that it was really giving a perspective about achievement I had never really thought about.\\n\\n\r\nTo learn meant failure, to grow stronger meant to feel hardship and to overexert yourself to what phase out the illusions to what you truly desired. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of each episode, with the crescendoing music resounding with each episodic climax, I felt the overwhelming desire to watch the next.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIt was like a ten hour long movie that always kept you drooling for more.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI was stunned by the hype of this show that I nearly skipped over it. And let me tell you, I ALMOST did.\\n\\n\r\nAnd simply for the thought once existing, I regret it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had passed up this show, I really would have missed out on such a masterpiece. I am shamed of myself.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly cant wait to jump into Chihayafuru Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIt was beautiful to the core. Every aspect was heartwrenchingly flawless. If you have any last minute questions before watching this series, feel free to PM me.\\n\r\nI really don't think the world can afford to have people so many that haven't seen Chihayafuru.\\n",

            "content": "Man, Chihayafuru is freaking good.   I wasn\u2019t going to watch this show.  You look at the promo.  It\u2019s a shoujo/josei type joint about some chick who plays Japanese cards or some nonsense. How can that be good?\r\nI know a lot of people mess with those mah jong anime that keep coming out.  I can\u2019t hate but I never know or care about what\u2019s going on in any of that stuff.  \r\nLucky things happened though.  Winter 2012 anime were failing hard so I had to start review crawling.  MAL gave this thing an 8+ so figured I\u2019d giveit a shot.  Normally that\u2019s a bad idea because girl anime tends to have inflated ratings on this site. \\n\\n\r\nExpectations exceeded. This show right here filled me with some serious glee.  I still have no idea what the rules of Karuta are and I still loved the show.  All I managed to discern is that somebody reads a poem in a creepy voice and then you have to snatch up a card real quick.  Apparently that was all that I needed to know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Mostly win. I like that every character is unique.  There hardly any typical characters, except some minor side dudes from that red shirt karuta club.  Actually I\u2019ll contradict myself and say that Chihaya herself is a pretty typical ditzy but hard working female lead character but everyone else is fresh.  My favourite guy of all is Desktomu-kun.  I\u2019m comfortable enough to say that he is actually cute as a grown male character. Welcome to 2012.   Speaking of Desktomu-kun, how come all the side characters in the club were small and funny looking where as the main three characters are all tall and handsome?  It\u2019s like there\u2019s a class system through character design.  I save further analysis of this for the Marxist anime review page. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I said the characters are good that\u2019s not saying  the chracters are deep or anything.  It seems like they all have one personality type, typically only express a couple moods and are all motivated by a single factor. For example, the adorable Kana-chan, can be summed up completely as the girl who likes poetry or a history buff.  Not every anime has to be an exercise in psychoanalysis though.   \\n\\n\r\nThe worst parts of the show are some of the flashbacks and plot devices used to motivate characters are pretty bad though.  Arata\u2019s motivation for quitting karuta is so contrived.  Pisses me off right now just thinking about how little imagination went into that. \\n\\n\r\nTaichi seemed like he was the most multifaceted guy.  He\u2019s sort of an insecure ass but more at least it\u2019s only as far as a real person acts like an ass.  You watch these josei/shoujo anime and the main guy is usually some epic dirtbag dude that could only another dirtbag could relate to.  A good example is the guy in Nodame Cantabile.  I want to punch the trash out of that guy.  You always have these girl anime pitting Dirtbag Dans against Nice Guy Norms but here I don\u2019t really get that.  Taichi actually seems like a nice guy but he can\u2019t help but do some dumb stuff.  Arata is kind of shy but he doesn\u2019t really seem that nice either.  He is actually pretty edgy since he\u2019s supposed to be the Lebron James of speed cards or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the action, which kicks a bunch of ass solely because of the direction and writing.  Like I said before, I still have no idea how karuta works but I definitely felt the suspense in every match.  I\u2019m dying to hear them read the cards out and I don\u2019t know what they mean.  That\u2019s good TV.  The matches are made interesting by focusing on internal mental stuff going on with the players and small details that the reader can understand.  For example, there is a part where a distinction is made between a player with speed and a player who uses rhythm and pacing.  I don\u2019t really need to understand karuta to be able to relate to that. \\n\\n\r\nThematically, you get a lot of the typical stuff here around being in a team and striving for a goal and all that sports anime crap.  I love that sports anime crap.  Makes me feel good as heck.  You also get a little education about Japanese poetry.  That also makes me feel good.  Like I\u2019m not just watching cartoons, I\u2019m getting educated out here.   I would have liked to have seen a little more focus on the outsider nature of the game though.  The whole ordeal with the Empress teacher was supposed to present that aspect of things but that unravelled pretty predictably.  I think more focus on Taichi and Chihaya\u2019s interactions with their parents and the parents\u2019 acceptance or ignorance of karuta would have been nice. \\n\\n\r\nI give this series a 9.  It delivered happiness, that sports anime suspense and some interesting knowledge about a weird sport. I\u2019m dying for a second season.    You know, I have now seen anime about karuta and kendo.  When am I going to get a sumo anime? \\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a sports anime about Karuta. What is Karuta you ask? I had no idea either until I watched this anime. Karuta is a card game based upon Japanese poetry, with a hundred poems as cards so memorization is key. As a reader reads out the first line of the poem, the player's goal is to touch the corresponding card that has the second line of the poem before the opponent. Sounds boring? Well you could not be more wrong. The way Chihayafuru depicts the relationships between the characters and the feelings of those who dedicate their lives to something only to be trumpedby those more talented. If you have ever competed in anything seriously, you will be able to relate.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is similar to many other sports anime. The main character Chihaya Ayase childhood dream is to watch her sister become the number one model. This all changes when she meets a transfer student, Arata Wataya,  that open her eyes to the world of competitive Karuta. Ever since this fated meeting that made her entranced in the world of karuta her dream has been to become the queen (best female karuta player).  From here on out the plot is quite simple, with Chihaya going to karuta societies to improve or tournaments to compete. Finding rivals,mentors and teamates along the way, each with their own influence on Chihaya. Honestly though if you watch Chihayafuru for a riveting plot with many twists and turns, you will be disheartened. Notably due to the slow start of the anime, with a long five episode flashback. Chihayafuru is mainly a character-driven show, which in its own way can produce its own heart-wrenching entertainment equivalent to an amazing plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters really do not disappoint, from the design to their personalities each character has a trait to love. Though Chihaya is a stereotypical tomboy airhead type character with her stereotypical childhood friend,Taichi Mashima, and stereotypical outsider transfer stuident Arata, the way they develop is what differentiates Chihayafuru from the status quo. Each and every character has their own dilemma, which they have to face. Inspiring us not only through their success but also in their own failure. Even the side characters have progress, and are explored throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art style, some might not be too accustomed to the differences in Chihayafuru. I know at first I had a hard time looking at Taichi and Chihaya because of their oddly super long eyelashes, but I grew to appreciate the design. There are some characters that look similar to others but this is primarily with background characters. Overall most of the characters don't look very similar, something I really appreciate in anime nowadays. As for the animation, everything is pretty crisp. Their is not much action to animate but they do a good job with the Karuta scenes, I have only seen problems in one or two episodes, where the frames drop a bit. Hardly noticeable, may even be my computer playing tricks with me. Now onto backgrounds, and other non-character related animation, was pretty good. Not amazing to me (like bakemonogatari background amazing) but still good. I am all for dark colors > light but the bright colors really stand out yet is cohesive with the piece as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nWith the great animations it leads to the Karuta matches actually being quite interesting. One would think that just watching a couple players try to get to a card first would be boring, but they build up suspense and emotion for every match. They do not get too technical about the technique and skill, and instead focus on the character's mindset. Despite the fact that at times this show is very serious, it does have its comedic aspects. Its funny to see how Chihaya go from ditzy in other situations, to being graceful at Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the Sound. The tracks do not vary too much considering the insert songs during the animation. Despite this lack of deviation, these songs were well timed and really highlighted the moments of emotion. In comparison the intro and outro differ greatly yet are just as memorable.  The opening has a more upbeat tempo that makes you want to tap your feet to the rhythm. I imagine the characters drive and love for karuta during the opening. Slowing down the pace with the Outro, it drives the great emotional impact of Chihayafuru. The ending really expresses the character's relationships well. As for the voice acting, nothing really stood out, but nothing was annoying. I do not really have an ear for voice acting so do not quote me on that.\\n\\n\r\nAll together Chihayafuru provides a great experience for the audience, with emotional attachment to the characters and the suspense to see the results. Don't let the fact that the show is about Karuta, and you have no idea what that is (yet) stop you from enjoying it. I believe that Chihayafuru's virtues strongly outweigh any faults that it may have, and highly reccomend it to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "*This review is spoiler free!* \r\nChihayafuru is an anime centered around the sport karuta and follows the story of a young girl named Chihaya as well as the friends and rivals she meets along the way. Before jumping into Chihayafuru you may have never heard of karuta and that really isn't an issue. The anime does a great job of creating a story around this sport that isaccessible to everyone and after only the first few episodes you will understand the sport well.\\n\\n\r\nFor a brief overview of what the sport karuta is about, it\u2019s essentially a sport based around the idea of determining which card out of a set has been randomly selected and then to quickly grab it before your opponent. Each of the cards are poems and at higher levels of play the players should be able to memorize the initial position of each card to be able to take them as soon as they can be identified. Even though Chihayafuru is based on karuta, the sport mainly acts as a platform for the ideas of growing and following your dreams, which are the underlying themes for the majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters learn to realize their dreams through karuta and watching them work hard to reach them is very satisfying. Most of the characters who are introduced are dug deeper into, including the opponents making it so you usually had a bit of sympathy for each character as they faced off. Each character has their own strengths, weaknesses and goals that make the character line up quite diverse and somewhat relatable. Each of the characters end up learning a lot from each other as they travel the same road, in karuta. \\n\\n\r\nThe sport karuta is the driving motor of the anime and watching the passion and determination the characters present in it really helps Chihayafuru capture the charisma a sport anime needs, but the great thing about this is, while it does capture the charisma of a sport anime, it also introduces the beauty and meaning of poetry making the karuta scenes very exciting to watch. These scenes are complimented by smooth and thrilling visuals, as well as sound effects and music, that really engage the viewer. For example, the intriguing sounds of the players skimming their hands over the cards to knock them to the sides or the interesting camera angles used to build suspense as the cards glide through the air. You'll be at the edge of your seat for a lot of the anime, especially during the intense karuta matches.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru has a great selection of music that really help to set the mood and engage the viewer throughout the anime. The background music is of high quality as well as the opening and credits. The music during the opening I've noticed really excites and energizes the viewer before it even begins, it does a great job at setting the atmosphere at the beginning. At the end of the anime, the credits have the opposite effect relaxing the viewer after all the intensity Chihayafuru has to offer. The art style is very appealing featuring a mostly bright and warm colour pallet with a large emphasis on floral patterns. The anime also does well in giving each character very individualistic and easy to identify character designs without making it off-putting. The animation is very smooth and enjoyable for the most part, but in a few episode I did notice a slight drop in the quality. In terms of visuals, this may have been the weakest feature, but I would still consider the animation quality very good so I wouldn't worry about it having a negative or noticeable effect on how you enjoy the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the thing Chihayafuru does best is keeping the viewer interested throughout the 25 episodes. The anime rarely had a boring moment from start to finish and really keeps the viewer wanting more the whole way through. The concept and story of the anime is quite simple but at the same time can be a bit moving and really unexpected. Chihayafuru isn't a one dimensional anime and is actually full of twists and turns while still remaining in essence, simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does have a second season and an ongoing manga series so you shouldn't expect everything to be finalized in the last few episodes, but I can still safely say the ending of the first season was satisfying and you won\u2019t hesitate to watch the next. Overall Chihayafuru was a very well done and exciting anime built around an unexpected sport that surprisingly works wonderfully. There really isn't much to dislike about Chihayafuru and watching it is quite refreshing while still remaining simple and very engaging. To anyone who found anything I mentioned about this anime even the least bit interesting I recommend you don't get put off by the idea of an anime based on a sport you may have ever heard of and give Chihayafuru a try.",

            "content": "To review Chihayafuru is a hard task, to describe how brilliant this little-known anime is, to explain why I like it so much, to tell you why it's such a great anime to watch is very hard, because Chihayafuru is unique, the only word I can describe it is unique. It may seem like your ordinary sports-romance-drama series at first glance, though there is absolutely no series of my knowledge to compare it to properly. \r\nThe way the story is presented, the way the characters interact with each other, the way the atmosphere feels, It's very real and very unique.\r\n= Story (10) = \r\nThe storyis one of the most interesting parts of the anime. I won't describe too much or really anything because if I did it would probably spoil a lot of things. What I will say is that the first couple of episodes, Chihayafuru sets it self in the present and the past, interchanging in various lengths, this unique way of starting off the story is incredibly good at letting the viewer get to know the three main characters, Chihaya, Taichi and Arata, It also allows you to see the way they change over time.\\n\\n\r\n= Character (10) =\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Chihayafuru special are the characters, they're all very likeable and you can at least relate to one. The way you see them develop from little kids into somewhat mature teenagers makes you grow attached to them. The dialogue and the way the characters interact with each other is incredible, just like how people interact in real life.\\n\\n\r\n= Art (9) = \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice. The character designs are great, especially the one's for Chihaya, Taichi, Arata and Nishida since you can see the resemblance between the child and teenage versions of themselves. A great part of Chihayafuru is the art direction, the scenes where they're playing Karuta look amazing.\\n\\n\r\n= Sound (9) =\\n\\n\r\nFor a 25 episode series, Chihayafuru uncommonly uses only one opening theme and one ending theme, which is okay since both songs are really great to listen to. The OST can be repetitive at times, though that doesn't really matter.  \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fantastic, each seiyuu (voice actor) really suits their part. Especially Yoshimasa Hosoya who voices older Arata.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (10) =\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started Chihayafuru, I didn't know what to expect and I was amazed by how much I enjoyed every minute of it, It's amazing how watching two people playing a card game can be so thrilling, the way you can't wait to see what happens next. Not many anime series can do that week in and week out.\\n\\n\r\n= Overall (10) =\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chihayafuru is a masterpiece in it's own right, a series which actually has heart, as corny as that may sound. The characters all have had struggles which are very realistic and relatable, the story is original, something hard to come by in recent anime, the art and sound match the series near-perfectly and the enjoyability of this series is unexpectedly great.  \\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a must-watch and in my opinion the best anime of Fall 2011.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is an under the radar type anime that I'm pretty sure a lot of people simply passed over. After all, it's about a group of high school students playing a card game called Karuta. What is that you ask? Well, to put simply it is a game where you memorize poems on each card try to swipe them up before your opponent as each card is read. I'm sure you really want to watch this right now\r\nOkay, in case that riveting introduction didn't get you pumped for this show you should know that karuta is simply the gateway for everything else. Everything in Chihayafurujust screams passion. You can tell that every character really wants whatever they are aiming for. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is incredible. While it arguably does not have a huge stand out, all of them seem very real and well thought out. You can feel each characters dreams, hopes, and passion in everything they do. Especially Chihaya's and Taichi's. Each character experiences significant growth, and it's especially great how it seems like you're always in their heads it helps you relate to each character.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the connection you'll get with the characters you'll find your emotions going all over the place during episodes. Karuta matches, something that might be incredibly boring under normal circumstances, suddenly become prime time entertainment. If clannad pulled on your heart, and Penquindrum messed with your mind... then Chihayafuru will capture your soul. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware the anime ended in an incomplete state (the manga is still ongoing after all). So if you want a sense of complete closure at the end you'll be disappointed. However, if you can look past this, you'll more likely than not really enjoy this show.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my very first review, and I'm glad to give my first time to this anime...wait what?\r\nI first started watching this because I was bored. I just thought the art was okay (looking at the poster) and so started this five whole days ago. Pretty long time ago huh.\r\nWell then, all jokes aside, let's start the review.\r\nOverall-10: I haven't had such a beautiful anime for as long as I had started watching anime. The mix of the beauty of karuta, enjoyment of life, perfect sound, smart character selection...this anime was a new experience on my part. At first I was worried on whether Iwas going to enjoy this anime, but I decided to watch it, since I had nothing else to do--as a time killer. Who'd have thought that an anime I selected at random was a time mass murderer, and not a simple enjoyment!\\n\r\nWell, then, let's go part by part.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10: Karuta--I have not seen any anime with such a traditional theme before. Even more, this kind of theme is something anime writers avoid because of the lacking interests in people. However, despite that, this anime was able to draw the viewers into it via tackle of current issues. The blend-in of the issues and the main genre, moreover, was unbelievably coherent that I wasn't caring if Karuta was an inexplicably old game. The author did an amazing job of drawing people into the art of karuta. However, the author did not only focus on other \"more immediate issues\" either. The story's pace was steadily growing on the main theme of karuta and by the end of the episode, I was very absorbed into the game of karuta that I had my eyes stuck on the monitor, waiting for the next move. The author's unbelievably clean and beautiful job made chihayafuru not your everyday \"filler anime\" but a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10: As I said before the start of the review, the art is what really drew me into this anime. At a glance of the poster, I couldn't tell the beauty of it, but when I actually saw the anime, I was surprised at the delicacy of the anime. Unlike other anime where \"moeness\" is a great factor, this anime had a very decent body curve and a very \"traditional\" style of art. It did have some points where the face appeared more simplified than usual, intending the moe factor to be a part of the art, but that was really intended for comedy rather than \"cuteness overload\". If, for example, sword art online is cute, chihayafuru is beautiful. It was as if the artist has spent few hours per every 1080 pages.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10: The music was kicked in at an appropriate time and was stopped at appropriate time, building tension and relieving them continuously. The opening and the endings were not just a fun-themed song but also a river-like, flowing type of music. These added to the traditional theme of karuta, adding up to the beauty of the 100 Japanese poems.\\n\r\nHowever, the most notable sound in this anime was the sound of the readers.\\n\r\nReading a poem is very different from reading a poem in 100 poems. They need to be pitched right, stopped right and started right. The poem must not end in a loud pitch--it must fade out like the sun during sunset. The poem must not tremble too much, but it mustn't be in unison either.\\n\r\nIn other words, reading in karuta is harder than playing karuta.\\n\r\nDespite the constant banging of the straw mat, despite the interesting turn of event, despite the heat, the coldness, the itchy feeling, flowing sweat, readers must keep their composure and read the poems the right way. These are very hard to achieve. It's a natural thing that there're not much readers. However, this anime was able to deliver that right pitch through vibrations of ear buds. It was able to connect to the audience few thousand kilometers away. The sound is undoubtedly a masterpiece's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10: Chihaya is a very boyish girl. Her pace is very straightforward yet she's a lovely girl towards her family, especially her sister. She grows as a person as the story goes by, from your average tomboy to a determined adult. The development and the selection of the character was a very smart one, and for that I give 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: Besides the slapstick comedies in between, the anime made me smile in those heart-throbbing moments. If comedy-genre anime is just a pure fun, chihayafuru is a fun in life. We all have downs and ups, but the downs are what makes ups more fun and enjoyable. The ability to deliver such an enjoyment--not a pure comedy, but a natural fun--is an ability the authors spend their entire life for. I give my bow to the wonderful writers of this anime.",

            "content": "As the two seasons present themselves much as a continuous series, with little to set them apart, this review is made and posted for both seasons of the series.\r\nIf there is one word that describes Chihayafuru, it is \"passion\" - indeed, \"Chihaya furu\" means passionate. On the surface there is little that separates it from typical sports anime, from the focus on the team and team spirit to rivalries to tournament story arcs where you're typically served the main characters' opponents' motivations and reasons for participating in this sport. Through tears and joy we follow the main characters' journey through the world of this sport,and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend. As for the sport in question, the series focuses on a rather obscure (at least to a Western audience) card game known as karuta, where one has 25 cards with the first verse of poems on either side of the field, and as a reader reads the second verse of one of those poems, you have to remove the corresponding first-verse card from the playing field. The first to empty their side (25 cards) wins the game. A very coarse explanation but that's the gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it follows many of the traditional recipes for the sports genre, they are pulled off quite well in Chihayafuru, alleviating many of the issues doing so can present. It does in no way lift it off the ground and up to stardom, and if you are not a fan of sports anime to begin with, chances are you won't find Chihayafuru that very interesting. For the sports anime fan however, Chihayafuru offers a loveable and passionate experience, with some twists and differences. I already mentioned \"passion\" as a way to describe the series, and this is one of the aspects that sets it apart. From the at times striking visual and auditory imagery used - it is poetry after all - to the many ways of love for the sport that are presented, Chihayafuru delves deep into a world of passion, and while at times it seems a little too alien or cheesy how much of it the characters have for a single thing, it can also draw the viewer in and afflict them with a desire to do something they love, which is, at heart, what the sports anime genre is all about: Communicating passion and love for something.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that sets Chihayafuru apart is that unlike most sports anime, which are made to appeal more to a shonen audience, it leans more towards the shojo genre, evident in its at times flowery animation and colour palette, and more significantly, in its larger focus on emotion and romance. It forgoes some of the most intense focus other sports series has on the game itself and rather focuses on the inner world of the characters and their emotions - the full spectrum of it, not just the \"I want to win\"/\"This is my motivation!\" portions that you are often limited to. Often you see characters cry significantly, in joy or sadness, in defeat and victory. The series also builds up a solid love triangle between the main characters, without really forcing its and in its treatment, as well as adding these feelings and moments of love to the secondary characters. Of course, with a large cast it's a near-inescapable fact that some side characters are more bland than others, relying mostly on a singular trait or two to provide comic relief or interaction, but for the characters that matter there are for the most part many layers and aspects presented - and developed - in an intriguing manner.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically Chihayafuru is stunning. The soundtrack builds up around the atmosphere very well, from the heart-warming to the bittersweet, from the passionate to the suspenseful. It applies a rich orchestral instrumentation that fits very well with the oft-poetic art and animation. Meticulous attention has been paid to the quality of the card reading, and listening to the voice actors' performance in this regard is absolutely fantastic, especially for the most skilled readers in the series. Visually it frequently applies imagery as befitting of a series focusing on a game of poetry: The voice of a reader like sakura petals, the flow of a match like that of water, the flowery feeling of romance; such feelings are expressed visually and beautifully, though, as can be expected, some come across as more cheesy than others, but for the most part it is a boon rather than a detraction.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all comes to all, Chihayafuru definitely isn't a series for everyone. Karuta can come across as boring, the emotional layer as sappy or over the top to many sports anime fans, and for those who do not have a taste for sports anime in the first place, the story and the series' focus can seem unappealing. To me, personally, the series is a heart-warming and moving story that spreads a lovely feeling of passion, filled with lovely aesthetic value and likeable characters. It very often brings a smile to my face, not necessarily because it is outright funny and makes me laugh, but because it warms me up on the inside. At times cheesy, yes, but far from such a degree it spoils the series. It presents a lovely and different sports anime that quickly has earned a spot as one of my favourite series.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a show that I kind of regret picking up. No, not because it wasn't good or was a pain to watch. On the contrary, it was a very fun 50 episodes (This review includes S2 btw) - filled with many memorable and exciting moments. Unfortunately, it cuts off in the middle of the story, and really, really leaves me wanting for that season 3. That said, it is still a show that I will wholeheartedly recommend due to how special it is, and the fact that it seems somewhat likely that the anime will continue in a couple of years, once there isenough content to adapt.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a show that revolves around two things. The first of these is Karuta, the traditional Japanese card game which is the focus of the show. Upon hearing 'card game', the first thing that pops up will probably be something along the lines of Yugioh or Magic the Gathering, or perhaps something very different like Bridge or Poker. Karuta is a very different beast from what you will expect, being a sport (yes, a sport) that requires excellent memorization, reflexes, stamina, strategy, speed, and above all, hard work and effort to excel in. It is definitely not a simple game that is meant for relaxed play, requiring both physical and mental strength, and each match is intense as hell.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about this show is that it manages to make such a foreign game so compelling. We don't typically associate cards with physical activity, and most will find traditional things from our own cultures boring, let alone something played in an entirely foreign language. Yet, the show succeeds at making it interesting. Despite seeming simplistic at a first glance, the show slowly reveals the true depth of the game. We slowly learn more about the game, learning about the many different approaches to the game, the many interesting quirks it has, and the depth of the strategy involved in every move. Furthermore, the show is always careful to not overload us with information, slowly feeding us with all the little details, allowing us to slowly appreciate the intricacies of the sport without flooding us with too much exposition on the inner workings of the game.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like any truly great sports series, the game itself is often only a vessel to tell a greater story. And this is the second thing that this show revolves around - the characters. It is rare to see a cast more well-developed and more lovable than Chihayafuru's - each of the main characters undergo a tremendous amount of growth throughout this series' run time. At its heart, the show focuses on the triangle of Chihaya, Taichi and Arata, three friends that met at a young age, and became connected by Karuta. The show takes on an interesting choice of spending its first few episodes on how the three met, giving us a view on what they were like as children, before being forced to separate due to various circumstances. This allows us to know plenty about the characters when they were kids, and how their behavior has changed upon growing up. \\n\\n\r\nTaichi, in particular, is one of the most well-written characters in anime to date, and his personal journey throughout the series is a highly emotional one that was great to watch. It would be a mistake to simply classify this show as just another sports show that is full of young energy and passion - and Taichi's arc is a stellar example why. Sure, it has plenty of passion, but what truly makes this show special is how much it makes us care for these characters that we are watching, how much we want them to succeed. Chihayafuru is a very special show that is a blend of many different genres - being a hot-blooded sports shounen at times, and a highly emotional character drama at others. Watching these characters press forward for what they love is a truly heartening experience - and something that I haven't really seen in most other sports shows.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not mean that the rest of the cast is neglected. Beyond the main triangle, the care put into developing the other characters is evident as well, with major and minor characters all given plenty of room to develop. Due to the nature of Karuta as a niche hobby which not many people play, there are many recurring characters, and it is great seeing how they relate to the main cast. Some are friends and others are rivals, but each and every character in this show is never neglected, and each one of them has their own story to tell. It is difficult to dislike any character in this show - and that's definitely a great thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of this show are amazing as well - it is difficult to find a show that is more beautiful than Chihayafuru. The animation is top-notch, and several shots of cards flying look amazing. The soundtrack is truly a stand-out though - both OPs and EDs are perfect fits for the show, and the OST is wonderfully composed, helping to elevate the work to another level.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say the show is outright perfect - it does suffer from some little things at times. The pacing in the second season is a little slow for one, and there are certain annoying aspects (some photographers mainly...). But the biggest flaw is undoubtedly the fact that this show is not complete - and is nowhere close to being finished. The manga itself hasn't been completed yet, and even then there is no guarantee of a third season, though it seems pretty likely considering how well the manga has been selling over in Japan. This is definitely not a short story that will end anytime soon - but rather, a lengthy series that painstakingly details the journey of our characters. Whether this is a flaw or not is up to you - though do stay away (but please do come back in a few years) if you really cannot stand an incomplete story.\\n\\n\r\nStill, despite the fact that this isn't finished, it is still a show that you really should watch. Chihayafuru is in my opinion a highly refreshing and unique experience, and also one which I think that most can enjoy. It might seem boring at first, but do give it a shot - it will all click once the first card flies.",

            "content": "When I think about Madhouse, I think about high-quality realizations of foolproof story concepts involving a somewhat guaranteed economic success. Chihayafuru, a series about a bunch of high-schoolers trying to achieve their dreams in becoming the best of the best in a sports called Karuta, represents a fitting example of this project selection pattern. Chihayafuru is a charming, highly likable and somewhat mind-opening anime providing for a high level of entertainment, in which I found myself immersed very rapidly.\r\nAs you maybe already know, when producing a sports-related series, it often doesn't really matter what kind of sports is chosen as long as the atmosphere worksout well in making you like the sports. Competitive Karuta, as a rather unknown but highly demanding sports, carries this to extremes. By choosing a card game with motoric elements, thus combining mind-related and physical areas of personal development, the foundation was laid for a highly engaging experience to which almost any sportsman can relate in some way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is why Chihayafuru is successful. The new sports that most of the viewers don't know anything about represents a highly mysterious component in the series, compensating for the actually not only highly predictable, but also monotonous story that lacks in innovativeness. I could name several other sports-related series, which are plot-wise structured almost exactly the same as Chihayafuru, but all of them were well received. For a successful sports series, there is no need to incorporate sudden plot-twists and ingeniously convoluted plotlines. All you need is an intense atmosphere, a goal, and some likable and highly ambitious characters going all-out. This is what you find in Chihayafuru as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not only likable, but also unique with only minor overlaps in their personalities. The five main characters are supposed to appeal to the audience, which leads to them turning out somewhat stereotypical. In general, there are two major flaws that cannot be overlooked. First, to enhance the aspect of perceived ambition, the main characters lack authenticity and personality consistency. They regard the same issue very differently from time to time and act highly unnatural, only to promote the story and preventing it from losing focus. Second, they lack depth. Although you find the main characters musing about how to becoming stronger with a high degree of reflection, they seem to not have anything in their minds besides Karuta and their mutual bonds, and that fact makes them appear more as story-driving tools than vivid, holistically conceptualized characters. But this is also the reason why they can be said to fit very well to the simple and straightforward story.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of audio-visual execution, the production quality should have been higher if it was intended to overcome current standards (as of 2012). Ultimately, it turned out to be a well-produced show, and that's it. The opening manages to set the energetic and positive mood extremely well and provides for an outstanding audio-visual fit, whereas the fit of the rather melancholic ending is debatable. The seiyuu were appropriately chosen and don't stand out in a negative way. Remarkable are some of the sound effects used in Chihayafuru, which add to the immersive experience that is created especially during tournaments. The visuals fit the standard but don't give much of an outstanding impression. A positive factor is the high consistency in visual execution and its underlying arts style.\\n\\n\r\nWith Chihayafuru, you get to see an anime that adheres to the norm in sports-related series, but not surprisingly delivers a highly engaging ride through the world of competitive Karuta with a set of ambitious and likable characters. It features a positive and energetic atmosphere and does very well in generating excitement despite the predictability and monotonous nature of its story. Chihayafuru can be recommended for everyone who likes shounen and seinen, shoujo and josei, as well as sports in general.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7.64/10\\n\r\n(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.)\\n",

            "content": "--Preliminary Proposition--\r\n\tChihayafuru is good, astoundingly and courageously good. There is crying almost every episode and yet it still remains utterly utterly good. It has an abundance of Shoujo romanticism yet it is good. The characters are good. The moments are good. The fights are good. The battles fought are good. The entirety of the show I cherish in my heart. Every episode I cherish. Every single interaction I cherish. The jokes, even though not necessarily of highest standard, I cherish. This show I cherish and cherish again. When it comes to this show I have no choice but to be giddy with love and tofight for its reputation. I shall have to fight for Chihayafuru to be placed not just among the best sports animes but as the best sports anime. I shall fight because it is my utter love that drives me, as a writer and an aesthete, to edify what my love consists of; perhaps in the process to teach others how words heavy with love can weigh with significance and how expressing love is the pinnacle of all and every language. Even though my tongue is tied and tangled up in a million knots by love and already I feel the schoolgirl giddiness that comes with trying to describe why exactly I love I must still fight for my love. \u2018Fight\u2019 is appropriate because in the end Chihayafuru is all about fighting; fighting and victory in the name of love. I must love like a girl and fight like a man.\\n\\n\r\n\tBut already I am at a dilemma because I cannot start merely with the standard formal descriptions of the show. I cannot just go into character or art or story; there is no love in the mere description of things. As much as I love this show I also love the medium of writing. I will fight therefore in the form of writing too. Like all writers and critics I want to win; my views need to be heard so that my love can be known. To be known is not enough. I am greedy and I must not just express my love for a single entity but in describing the love I have for this show I must express my love for a greater entity \u2013 that of life itself. I must transcend the critic who writes with mere puppy love and reach those sacred peaks that only full on master wordsmiths can conquer. This then must try to be edifying in the same way Motaigne or Orwell is edifying. Only in showing a love for life can my words bear significance and with these words I will be able to love Chihayafuru in a deeper way than before.\\n\\n\r\n--The Will to Win and the Valor of Winning--\\n\\n\r\n\tThe creed of some is to claim the struggle is worth more than victory. I have much against this if this is taken to heart by those who have never tried to win. This expression can only be understood by those who have been tempered in the flames of trying to win itself; it is a sacred expression that excludes all who have not had the understanding of what victory entails. A child who, because of languor and weakness, does not take on significant burden if in sport or battle and uses this expression to deflect all guilt and doubt as to his own will and strength, that child will only know weakness. Enough of preaching though, I can leave that for the pastors.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe Japanese have deeply understood what it means to be proficient in an art; it is reflected in their manga. I have heard a friend who claimed that \u201cThe Japanese have made works on almost everything\u201d and I am very keen to concur. For the art of cooking and food tasting we have Oishinbo and a plethora of other food mangas. Every sport is bound to have a manga of some sort. The mental sport of Go has the famous Hikaru no Go. The art of extreme mountain climbing has Kokou no Hito. Bartender shows us what cocktailcrafting is all about. The unifying theme within all these works is proficiency, what it means to be proficient in an art one has dedicated life to. Many Sports movies I\u2019ve seen focus on the underdog victory, the relationships between the characters and the supposed \u2018tribulations\u2019 they go through. There is a problem though when the training is lost in montage and the character relationships are given a premium over the sport itself. A sports anime then has that distinct element of being focused around the sport as well as showing the love that goes into appreciating the sport. With Chihayafuru not only is the sport still the focus but the sport dictates all character relationships. The sport and the players stand on equal ground.\\n\\n\r\n\tI cannot adequate explain my love without going into some background information. I was no sportsman but I picked up a competitive activity \u2013 debate. As one club who wasn\u2019t really a reader of current affairs or a thinker of political systems and ethics, also coupled with the fact that I was never a speaker, I was easily and completely and repeatedly trounced by the others in the club who had entered it with previous experience. I proceeded to fight harder than before. I would study current affairs and politics while leaving aside the rest of my studies. I would watch videos upon videos until I improved. Slowly I started to win but then again the rest of the club wasn\u2019t slacking off either so I still lost majority of the sparring rounds. In the first competition I lost three out of four rounds. In the second competition I received the same score. There was a difference though, the first competition I was angry and dejected but for the second I was angry enough to not lose hope beyond the first round and suddenly even though I was losing it became fun. In my third and last competition I won two out of five rounds but I had the most fun of all time. Afterwards I spectated as the other club members, who themselves were tempered in the fires of battle, would go on to trounce some of the top teams in a national competition and almost achieve an underdog victory. Nothing beats the real life stuff \u2013 but Chihayafuru comes close. Afterwards we stepped down from the club in order to study for exams and the leadership was passed to the juniors.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn retrospect I was more like Oe or Komano, staying in the background but still in the action watching anxiously.\\n\\n\r\n--Comparing Works--\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is the section where I aim to bring down all others in my fight for love.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe first I shall bring down is Hikaru no Go. Despite being closest to the realism of Chihayafuru (besides the supernatural element) I cannot credit this much. If we consider the core components of a sports anime the unity of action (as in the tense fighting scene) with spirit (the characters in their quest for victory), Hikaru no Go is extremely balanced in these two areas. Yet I cannot credit Hikaru no Go because of the sole unfortunate reason that Go has too high barriers of understanding. In Chihayafuru the kinetic quality of the sport makes it easier to understand, you memorize then steal. Go, although a respectful and highly intellectual brilliant game requires a certain mastery of the game itself to be able to appreciate fully. Without an in depth knowledge of concepts such as thickness or joseki, the game is lost to a person who just wanders in. The anime doesn\u2019t really flesh out concepts too deeply either but does provide some commentary. Likewise it may be fun to watch a street fighter tournament (like Daigo Umehara\u2019s victory against Justin Wong) but without knowledge of cancels, wake-ups and cross ups, much is lost. Furthermore Hikaru no Go took more than 50 episodes to flesh out what Chihayafuru managed to achieve in 26 episodes. Hikaru no Go is good but I shall only treat it like an acquaintance rather than an infatuation.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe second I shall bring down is Hajime no Ippo. In this case the action is what stands out. The kinesthetic fights are wholeheartedly enjoyable and the action in the ring is thoroughly explained. There is a significant spirit conveyed too in seeing Ippo constantly jumping back into the fray. Its weakness is in the victories. Ippo wins too much. The sweat and tears of victory are undermined by the interference of the author. There is only the kinesthetic but it lacks in heart. Yet there is much to be enjoyed about Hajime no Ippo so I will not condemn it anymore.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe third I shall bring down is Kuroko no Basuke, but really this falls in the same catergory as Hajime no Ippo in that it is more of the action than the spirit. The action triumphs all and nothing is left for the heart.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe fourth I shall bring down is Cross Game. This is an action which I myself find it hard to perform. I have an infatuation with Cross Game because of its vibrant spirit and beautiful characters. Like Romeo who in his despair over Rosaline finds himself overpowered by the intense aura of Juliet though I have no choice but to place Chihayafuru in its rightful place in my heart. Cross Game is a triumph of drama and action, a unity of drama and action. The dramatic flows together with the sports in a perfect blend yet then it does not conform to the spirit of the sports anime; that of overwhelming spirit in the face of adversity. The adversity is a dramatic adversity not an inner adversity. We are more keen to see what becomes of Ko and Aoba rather than seeing Ko conquer his own inadequacies. The romance is a dramatically perfect one yet because of this it cannot be placed on that sports anime pedestal. It vacillates between the two realms and becomes an entity in its own right. Let Ko and Aoba do what they wish! I will continue on to greater battles.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf there is one adversity that Chihayafuru has to overcome that is the grand opus that is Kokou no Hito. It is a triumph of spirit, a Seinen masterpiece of overwhelming heart. It is also an object d\u2019art with its luscious backgrounds and amazingly realist style. It is entirely about a battle with the self. It is a work that could be seen as the pinnacle of human victory. It is a giant, as tall as the peaks conquered within. Why I cannot place it in the same place as Chihayafuru lies is because it is not a work in the same realm. It stands far away on another mountain, another throne in my heart. Kokou no Hito is the friend whom I shall share whiskey with when overcome with despair. Chihayafuru is my infatuation. They are two different entities yet equally as important. If I find my will I will think of Chihayafuru to push me greater, if I lose my will I will seek Kokou no Hito to regain it. If I have neither despair nor willpower and fall into the straits of melancholy, I will heal it in Eden Hall.\\n\\n\r\n--Love Letter--\\n\\n\r\n\tBalanced on the weighing scale of spirit, Chihayafuru is a perfect gem. I would wish that Chihaya be the main shining star of the show but I have to award that to Taichi. The repetitions of failure, the despair over lost time, the thrills, the spirit all belongs to him. He is the pure representation of the symbol of the will; the romantic symbol representing will. Chihaya stands strong in spirit but she is never weighed down in the same way that he is. Her obstacles, in that sense, are of lesser magnitude because she does not grapple with sorrow but single-mindedly fights on. She is an angel but she from her I do not get as much the pangs of human pain as I do from Taichi.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhy I love Chihayafuru is because it shows us that there is still a place for the highly romantic in this world. Once more a lesson on the history of Literature (like you haven\u2019t seen this before if you\u2019re familiar with my review style) dealing with Romanticism. In around the 19th century when faced with the growing significance of industrialization, the human spirit was greatly impoverished. With the rise of the machines progress was prioritized but there was a lack of love for nature and humanity itself. Artists reacted to that by creating a literary and artistic movement where feelings and emotions were placed as paramount to realism and the ultimate ideal was beauty. The picture Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog is a key example of this; the man in it symbolized the triumph of human strength over the sea of uncertainty that was going on at the time. After a whole load of wars though disillusionment became the norm and the romantic ideal faded into the background. Anime, I see now, may be the return of the romantic in another form. Chihayafuru shows us how essential fighting with one\u2019s own soul is in its own innocent Shounenesque way. It is perfect because it shows the will\u2019s triumph over the very realistic obstacles of life. It is really one of the only shows to be able to do this without falling into clich\u00e9 or overtly romantic tones. It does not have to be literary but it is heartfelt and resonates within those who know what fighting is. Some may call it na\u00efve but I call it powerful. Sometimes this kind of power and wide-eyed idealism is needed these days.\\n",

            "content": "I didn't have high expectations when I first read the description of the show. However, I got hooked on the first episode and the rest of the season didn't disappoint.\r\nStory (10/10): Most series fall flat in the storyline for three reasons: 1) An uninteresting beginning discourages viewers from continuing the series. 2) The story line is inconsistent. 3) The story doesn't reveal enough, or it reveals too much. \r\nChihayafuru, however, does it right and in an unexpected way. The story begins with several flashback episodes that help viewers understand and connect with the main characters. The plot itself is expected; after all, the series isabout competitive karuta, so it makes sense that the plot will center around the competitions. The series is consistently good, with good writing and just enough humor to lighten the mood but not too much to make the show look goofy. The most intense scenes in the series will make your heart race, and the sweet scenes will put a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Chihayafuru's art is beautiful and elegant. In a lot of animes, the characters all seem to have a basic face structure (ahem, *Sword Art Online*), thus making them unmemorable. But Chihayafuru's characters don't fall into this category; it's obvious to those who watch that the show's artists spent time on making characters their own persons. The scenery is also very pretty, though typical of most shoujo anime/manga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (20+/10):  This category is where Chihayafuru really excels. It's really enjoyable to see the main cast develop and mature over the course of the series. The writers also used the supporting characters well, and I particularly found Harada Sensei to be one of the best supporting characters in the show.\\n\r\nIf there's a fault with the characters in the show, most people would probably point a finger at the protagonist, Chihaya. At first glance she seems like a cliche--pretty, but not too smart, oblivious to love, and often single-minded. But her interactions with the others makes her likable, and she has depth. She never fails to surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was probably one of the most underrated shows of 2012. Or possibly ever. I couldn't find it on any list of Best Animes of 2012. So this series may be one of those where you either don't understand it, or you love it. It's worth watching to find out.",

            "content": "I know I'm only on the fifth episode but I just have to say that I am loving this anime! Although it isn't labled a slice of life story, I watched it because I think it is one of those true slice of life animes where the story could actually happen. After finding nothing but supernatural type of stories labeled slice of life I was on the prowl for good ordinary slice of life anime. At first I didn't really know what to expect with the Karuta game thing.  I didn't want to sit around watching some game be played in every episode althoughI do love to play games.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what I found was more than just a show about kids playing a poem game but a story about finding your own dreams, finding inspiration in others, and possibly a love story?\\n\\n\r\nSince I began watching Kimi to Boku around the same time I can't help but to compare certain aspects of the shows that are similar such as the use of flashbacks to tell parts of the story. Kimi to Boku can learn a thing or two from the writers of Chihayafuru. Kimi to Boku is saturated with flashbacks that interrupt the present and most of them are irrelevant. In Chihayafuru they used a full flashback to tell the story of how Chihaya, Arata, and Taichi got to the point they are in the present story. It gave us relevant information to the current plot and characters and helps us see who they are as people. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters there isn't a single one I don't like, I like all three of them, of course at one point I didn't like Taichi. However, he grew on me because he is a character with his own flaws just like Arata and Chihaya (I don't want to spoil anything by going into detail) and I hope to see even more development from them.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the main focus of the show is Karuta, they do know how to make it exciting to watch, although at some point you may find yourself eye rolling over the extreme music choices they use to bring out the excitement, but even so I can't blame them for trying. I've never seen nor played the game but I'm sure it isn't nearly as exciting as the show.  I remember watching Hikaru no Go and tried to pick up the game Go but dropped it cause it was boring and full of douchebags (at least on the site I played it at) but like Hikaru no Go it does make me want to check out the game even if it is just a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nBut aside from the game you will see a touching story here between the three main characters and maybe even a bit of a triangle forming between the two boys and the girl.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode five, we have the conflict between the characters who are now teenagers and at first I was a little worried about the Arata character because in the last episode they seemed like they were going the emo route with him. But in this episode, you understand why he was the way he was in the fourth episode (I won't spoil anything) I really did like the way it was handled, I totally understand how Arata feels and I cannot wait for the next episode to come out. \\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nUpdated review after episode 8: I have no choice but to bump this down from 9 to 7 because this show is so boring without Arata. After the whole ordeal with him we are now focused solely on Chihaya and Taichi recruiting members for their club with each episode focused on Chihaya trying to get each person to see how wonderful the game is, of course, even if she drags them down to play, the moment they see it they fall instantly in love with the game. Or have some sort of condition for agreeing to play. These episodes are basically Chihaya running around screaming at people, slamming into walls and doors, and dragging people desk and all into the club room. After a while it gets a bit too much to handle. She hasn't seemed to change much since she was a child, which is NOT a good thing compared to Arata and Taichi who have changed so much. Her character just comes across as stagnant. Hopefully it picks back up.\\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a very unique show in premise but not so much in execution. It centers around a traditional Japanese card game called karuta and the aspirations of a girl named Chihaya set to become the best player in Japan (and therefore the world) alongside her friends.\r\nKaruta is a one-on-one card game in which players must try to touch cards inscribed with poems as the corresponding poems are read faster than their opponent. The game is explained very thoroughly early on, and while the concept may seem rather dull the show does a great job on making it interesting.\r\nChihayafuru opens on a few flashback episodesto set the stage in elementary school as Chihaya learns about and grows a dedication to karuta, all while forming a love triangle with child prodigy Arata and childhood friend Taichi. This love triangle is probably the most interesting character dynamic in the show but sadly it's treated as background decoration due to Arata's overall absence and lack of screen-time. Eventually Chihaya and Taichi form their own team at Mizusawa Highschool with three others who all have some entertaining personalities on their own (the lady-like Oe is a favourite of mine).  \\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite their charm they don't really have much chemistry between each other overall. Everyone develops nicely and you can feel them grow closer as a group, but I can't describe any two characters' relationship any differently than any others'. In season two an additional two players are added to the team, but they are quickly sidelined and don't get much focus at all, which is a shame because they actually had some distinct dynamics with a few of the other characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a group though, the cast does feel like a bunch friends who would genuinely spend their time together, which is something a lot of anime tend to miss. Watching them all grow to love karuta more and more as the series progresses is a spectacle alone. Chihaya herself is a very charismatic character with an unparalleled drive to better herself at the game, and her passion makes her lovable despite her clueless nature. This passion can occasionally steer the show towards melodrama, (never to the point of being overbearing however) but there are some very intriguing inner conflicts within the players. Taichi's constant second-guessing of his worth as a karuta player is as emotionally engaging as it is realistic, and it will surely resonate with many (especially athletes).\\n\\n\\n\r\nMost of the matches (it is a sports anime after-all) revolve around the players' psychology rather than strategies. Since karuta is a game centered around reaction time, if a player feels outclassed, overwhelmed, or simply out of their element, their game will be thrown off considerably. This emphasis on attitude can sometimes get a little repetitive as characters go through nearly identical trains of thought match-after-match but most of the time the individual matches are very entertaining. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the team matches. Because there are five separate games happening simultaneously there is a general lack of focus and tension, which become very tiresome when the games overstay there welcome. And trust me, they do, especially in the second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile they are quite engaging during the show, most games in Chihayafuru are forgettable in the long-term. This is because everyone besides the Mizusawa team is very bland and one-dimensional. There are a few fun standouts like Sudo the sadist but a strong personality can't maintain a conflict on its own. A good antagonist has to challenge the protagonist's physical and mental weakness, and sadly nobody gets the focus to do so aside from Shinobu Wakamiya. She acts as a very good foil for Chihaya to overcome, as the two have similar interests (sharing an obsession with children's merchandise and karuta) but she is much more aggressive and cold and completely outclasses her upon their first meeting.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the two never get a chance to face off on equal ground, as a certain plot-point near the end makes it nearly impossible for Chihaya to play properly. It is a very sour note to end the series on, and while there is a possibility of a season three, Chihayafuru could become another unfinished Madhouse production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of aesthetic there isn't much to talk about. Yes the motions are always fluent but the show's art style is that of a standard josei, which isn't a bad thing but it isn't a good thing either. Some dynamic shots could've really helped make the show stand out. I'm not too keen on the colour palette either, as everything appears to glow, much like the fluorescence of pale skin. There are a few interesting visual metaphors however, much akin to Kaiji but on a less frequent basis. Arata's prowess flooding the area with water is definitely a visual highlight.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe audio department is pretty typical as well. The music is quite underwhelming, and there is one song that almost queues melodrama whenever it plays. On the plus side, Asami Seto did a great job accentuating Chihaya's quirkiness and disoriented personality through her stellar voice acting, and the sound effects are pleasant to the ears as well. The smacks of hands on tatami mats sound thoroughly striking, which really emphasizes how dedicated karuta players are to their craft.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Chihayafuru is a fine watch and while personally I am indifferent to it, there is value to be had. I would recommend Chihayafuru if you would like something simple but unique and don't care about being on the edge of your seat ninety percent of the time. It's clear that the show's target audience is housewives longing for cultural nostalgia, so I suppose garnering the attention of other demographics is almost an achievement of its own. Will it be heralded in ten years as a masterpiece? Likely not, but Chihayafuru is a series that deserves to be completed.\\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru\r\nRoughly 2 years back a female friend of mine urged me to watch a certain anime, but as I was busy in my own shit at the moment, I just took the recommendation, downloaded the series and that's it. Then came along it's second season, I thought - \"Will start it after second season gets complete, maybe\" and yes, I forgot again. 5 days ago, browsing through my collection I stumbled upon this title once again, this time I'm happy I chose to pick it up. Sometime the hype is right.\r\nThe plot is generic, in fact so generic, that this is probably the biggest reasonwhy I felt hesitant to pick it up two times before. But the tags \"Sports\", \"Josei\" kinda piqued my interest. It's been almost 6 days since I fell in love with this series, thinking back now I feel sorry for not picking it up earlier. In layman terms, it's a story about various people coming together and working hard to achieve their respective dreams. Let's see what are the things that makes \"Chihayafuru\" unique among various other titles with similar plots.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGame: - \"Karuta\" - A traditional Japanese card game. This game had been mentioned in some of the other anime, but I always took it as some Japanese version of playing cards, not to mention one can't really think of it as a sport of hard work, mental & physical abilities and passion, much like how we view Football, Baseball, etc. But this anime will make you think twice about that prejudice. Instead of dwelling into the details of karuta, I leave that part for the anime since it does a great job in explaining all the rules and procedures quite well over the episodes. But let's just be clear about few things, karuta is a game that can be played in many ways and each style have it's own set of rules. However, In this anime the karuta we see is \"Competitive karuta\". When you think of a sport, you also think about the players, here the various stages of a player learning and playing the game has been covered quite extensively, let's devise an example from anime -----\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of player levels (not official, but just to make the explanation easier) -\\n\\n\r\n1. Noob class - Beginners who have just started playing the game. It provides a good opportunity for audience to learn the game with them and also to witness their evolution from the start. Ex - Kana.\\n\\n\r\n2. Middle class - They have played and still playing the game from a long time. They are strong but are still inconsistent as players. They serve as a good measuring stick between beginners and very good players. Ex - Taichi.\\n\\n\r\n3. First class - These players have refined their play over years of practice, both shining their skill and talent. Just having one of them in your team gives you mental assurance and having one against gives you the scare. Ex - Chihaya.\\n\\n\r\n4. Monster Class - These players have dedicated their whole life for the game. Their mere presence is enough to intimidate their opponent. They have honed their skill and talent as close to perfection. A match between two such players is something to look out for. Ex - Arata.\\n\\n\r\n5. God Class - Their level of play exists on a different plane of it's own kind. Very few people have managed to reach that level, even among monster class, not many can even dream to reach it. Ex - Queen and Master.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, the viewer is able to briefly understand the players and follow their evolution over time. Also, even among the same class, the individual player's game attitude (offensive/defensive), techniques and fortitude can put one miles ahead than the other. Anime explores each aspect of it very well, as a sports anime it brings out the best of karuta.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- While story can be quoted as the bone structure, characters are the muscles and flesh, more so in series like this. It is also the part where this anime excels the most. First, we have Chihaya, a high school freshman, pretty, tall and the younger sister of a famous model, but she's also an airhead, simple-minded, dumb and weird person - often referred to as \"Beauty in vain\" or \"karuta baka\" (since all her thoughts seems to be centered around karuta only). Even though Chihaya's character comes out as a typical airhead stereotype at first, she has more to her than that. As the story progresses we bear witness of the changes and the events that leads to those changes in Chihaya's personality. Also, regardless of what idiotic things Chihaya does, one can't really help him/herself from feeling admiration towards her passion for the sport. Second, Arata, belongs to a lower middle-class family, average-looking, grandson of the man respected as the \"Eternal Master\" (Master, Title granted to the best male player), in the world of karuta. His love for karuta comes from his grandfather who also taught him how to play as a kid. Arata is an honest, straight-forward and kind person, though he can look extremely scary in the eyes of his opponent. He's the one who introduced Chihaya to the world of kaurta when they were kids and also the one who gave her the dream of becoming the \"Queen\" (Title granted to the best female karuta player in Japan) one day. He moves away shortly after befriending Chihaya and Taichi due to family reasons. Since Arata doesn't get enough screen-time in both the seasons, it's pointless to talk about his character development. Third, Taichi, high school freshman like Chihaya, handsome, first in academics, belongs to a rich family and basically a \"Jack of all trades\" but Taichi doesn't think of himself as privileged. He's also the third member of Chihaya and Arata's team when they played karuta as kids. \"You are a good student and good athlete, so only do things where you know you can win\" - Because of this constant reminder by his mom, Taichi has developed a complex towards things which he isn't good at. This is also one of the reasons why Taichi doesn't like Arata, he thinks he can't beat him no matter how much he practice and that Arata will always be better than him. Ironically, the most brilliant character development also came out in the form of Taichi. He breaks away all the stereotypes over the length of the anime and comes out as the most dynamic personality in the whole series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Dreams:- Arata wants to become the Master, Chihaya wants to become the Queen. Having a dream and then trying hard to achieve it is such a wonderful thing, but then what is Taichi's dream? In the beginning even he didn't knew it himself. He seemed to be playing along because it was fun and later, because he wanted to help out Chihaya in fulfilling her dream, he wanted to support her as a friend and as someone who loves her. But as Arata once said - \"Your dream should be about yourself\", Taichi too begins to realize the meaning of these words through various experiences and people he meets. Also, what's more interesting than watching two people working hard to realize their dreams? It's to witness the voyage of a person who is still having a hard time struggling with his emotions, self-hatred, self-loathing and limitations, in order to search for a dream first, a dream that's only about himself. I have this feeling that Taichi will come out as the dark horse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSide - Characters:- When I said that - \"It is also the part where this anime excels the most\" for character department, that also included my views about side-characters. Chihayafuru has wonderful side-cast. Unique personalities, character designs and their thoughts make them stand out and prevent them from suffering the same fate as many side-characters do in most of the stories. They enjoy, suffer, evolve alongside our main cast in a way that the viewer ends up connecting and be concerned for them. We as viewers starts to feel as if their story is equally important to tell, and undoubtedly it is. For ex - There was this match between two side-characters, and it ended up hogging more limelight than the match of a MC which is taking place simultaneously.\\n\\n\r\nBoth side cast and main cast, they may not necessarily be what people call \"lovable characters\", since you may or may not like some of the things they do, but you'll feel your own emotions resonating with them regardless. That's a very important aspect which all entertainment mediums aspire to attain. Emotional and intellectual involvement is directly proportional to one's enjoyment, though the level of that involvement vary from person to person.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance:- Though the show is mostly focused on players' hard work and passion towards the sport, and the love of friendship, romance among characters has been introduced and explored briefly, but in the background. It doesn't try to take over the story, it's been hinted upon at appropriate places, which in turn, also makes the relationships among characters to come out naturally. It wouldn't be a spoiler to say that there's a love triangle among our MC's and a love polygon (if we also include side-cast). But people who are hoping to see brief amount of romance, I must warn you before hand that it'll not happen. Anime only gives very little (yet strong) moments dedicated towards it. Some people might even find the whole triangle situation to be frustrating, more so if they watch it with only one set of mind and without putting themselves in each character's shoes. It is a josei anime, anything can happen as far as romantic relations are concerned. *coughs in* Nana, Honey and clover *coughs out*. Viewer discretion is advised.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:- \"Chihaya is cute!\", that was my first impression about the series. LOL. Art-wise the show is quite good, the beautiful patterns on hakamas, the level of details that adds up to the charm , use of vibrant colors. Madhouse has done \"one fine job\" with the animation, especially in the games department. The hand movements accompanied by the effect line and after-image blends quite well with the camera angles. Both Art & Animation adds up a lot to the whole passion and tension factor befitting a sports anime. I tried reading the manga till 5th chapter and stopped, it doesn't have the same \"drive\" that anime has because of the wonderful animation. Most likely, I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope for a third season to come, I don't want to read it's manga if i can help it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:- It doesn't stand out but it goes well with the flow of the story. Sound Effects, on the other hand stands out, like they are supposed to, and adds up to the scene as a whole. Chihaya's seiyuu, Asami Seto, has done a good job. Even though she has mostly done supporting roles, I believe she has a nice voice for a main cast. Taichi's seiyuu on the other hand is no no-namer, Mamoru Miyano (Light Yagami, Setsuna F. Seiei, Okabe Rintarou) and undoubtedly, he has done his thing correctly. What was shocking is to learn that Arata's seiyuu is a girl (though I absolutely loved the dialect), Yuka Terasaki.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI've also watched the second season, and if you ends up liking the first season, then you'll definitely like the second one too, since it follows the same exact pattern, just more karuta matches. Chihayafuru in all it's entirety, is a bittersweet experience and I have this very strong feeling that it'll also end on a bittersweet note. Regardless of however the mangaka choose to end the story, it will remain in my memory for a very brief amount of time. Strongly recommending it to all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome memorable quotes:-\\n\\n\r\n1. \"You have to do the things you don\u2019t want to do, before you can do the things you truly want to do.\" - Tsutomu Komano to Ayase Chihaya\\n\\n\r\n2. \"Love is when it isn't fun to be with that person. It's when nothing goes the way you want. When you're not having fun...and yet...You still want to be with her.\" - Mashima Taichi\\n\\n\r\n3. \"I can't cry, not when I haven't put in the time. But it still hurts.\" -Mashima Taichi\\n\\n\r\n4. \"Frustrations will not last forever. Nobody can keep on going without some measure of reward.\" -Harada-sensei\\n\\n\r\n5. \"As long as you have a smile on your face, karuta will always be fun. That's the truth, Captain!\" - Mashima Taichi to Ayase Chihaya\\n\\n\r\n5. \"My grandfather always used to tell me...you don't need game sense to play karuta, you just have to take cards faster than your opponent. It's difficult to achieve a similar level of game sense, but there are many different ways to become faster\" - Wataya Arata. In response, \"Arata...in your world, there's no such thing as a prodigy\" - Mashima Taichi",

            "content": "One more to go, but then again, everybody agrees that the ending would be hanged one since it is certain that there won't be a climatic battle between Chihaya and Arata, however storywise the drama genre did played well with this 25 episode anime and the game and sport genre, well....... on the game genre it did played well, not sure about the sport genre since such genre is more of an overkill than anything else.... Sure, there is a major competition that goes on with the traditional Japanese card game kurata. Then again the game kurata is kind of informative and gives usviewer a glimps as to the said game as well as show us as to how passionate the Japanese about the game. So for the story I'll give a \"Very Good\" number 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you'll look at it there is none of that Moe thing that goes on with the way the characters were drawn, in fact the way that them characters were presented are pretty much decent and there is that elegant thing that goes when the charaters were in a traditional Japanese Hakama. \\n\\n\r\nSound: fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI just simply like the opening theme and Chihaya's child voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharater: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this is more on Chihaya and his kurata team compose of Taichi the club president who's hoplessly have some feelings for her, Tsutomu the club genius, Yuusei the fatso who's as good as Tachi and Japanese customs and poetry expert Kanade. Chihaya you might say is an epitome of a very competitive Japanese kurata player, who seemingly hopes to duke out with Arata but must go to a lot to get to him which I like. Let's go to Taichi and Arata, one started out as somebody you hated then becomes a likeable character upon growing up, while one was once a pityful kid now is somewhat who has to be the antagonist of this anime- in a kind way that is, which adds interest to this part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\n This  maybe one anime that may end up hanged, but then again it is intresting to watch this 25 episode since it is a girl who is the main protagonist instead a boy, the plot may be ordinary but seeing her struggle and fail puts a premium on the overall of this anime. Unless there will be a season 2 we'll never know if this anime will have a climatic ending. There is a possiblity the author plans to squeez everything in one last epsiode, but I'm just guessing, so don't fuss about it.",

            "content": "WARNING: May contain itty-bitty spoilers.  :)  But it won't ruin your judgement on the anime.  I'll be back in a couple more weeks to edit this review as I watch more and more episodes.\r\n    As of October 22nd, 2011, I have only watched three episodes of Chihayafuru, but so far, it has shown amazing promise.  Already I am so emotionally tied to this series that I almost, ALMOST shed some tears.  But boy did my eyes did get watery.\r\n    The story starts out with the protagonist, Chihaya, a beautiful girl.  You quicklylearn Chiyaha isn't quite what you'd expect a beautiful girl to act like - you know, poised, graceful, & calm and collecting and all.  Instead, she's clumsy, boyish, and very innocent.  I think this is what makes you love her so.  Chihaya stands out in both her looks and the way she acts.  I know you guys - and don't deny it - we all hate those popular, mean & pretty girls who don't give you a second look.  But Chihaya is different.  Despite her appearance, she is honest, and does what she believes is right.\\n\\n\r\n    Beginning from the last half of the first episodes to the 3rd episode, we go into Chihaya's past (if I am correct, I believe back into junior high).  She is friends with a boy named Taichi, who seems to have been a big influence in the class.  Anyways, in the class is a quiet boy called Arata.  Chihaya, seeing he is being bullied by Taichi and her classmates, stands up for Arata at the cost of her classmates ignoring her.\\n\\n\r\n    From Arata, she learns the passion and art of karuta.  In case you don't know what karuta is, to put it simply, you must find the card when the line from a poem is being read before your opponent does.  It sounds boring when I try explaining it to you, but you'll get it when you WATCH, WATCH, WATCH (!!) the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY [9]\\n\r\nI would give it a 10, but I need to see a few more episodes before I can confirm this.\\n\\n\r\nART [10]\\n\r\nIn case, I haven't said this yet, the art is AMAZING.  The only fault I find with it is when they're kids (in the flashback), the characters don't look as appealing as they do when they're in high school, thus shadowing on the beauty of the art.  The background scenes are leaning towards average, but the character art is very easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [7]\\n\r\nI haven't paid much attention to the music, but since nothing has stuck out to me, I'll give it a solid 7.  I might come back and edit this section after a couple more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER [9]\\n\r\nThe character development is great.  I think it's amazing how much I've gotten to know each of the characters already.  I look forward to watching them grow in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [9]\\n\r\nTruth be told, maybe 9 isn't really a fair judgement.  It should be a 10. But being a shoujo and romance addict, I have to give it the lower score of 9 because there is almost no, romance so far.  I can see tiny hints of it here and there though, and I'm hoping, hoping very badly that it might blossom into something else altogether as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [8.5]\\n\r\nThis might seem like a low score with all my praise about it up above, but I'm basing all of this on merely THREE episodes.  I have to keep my bar raised high since it is only the beginning and it could all spiral down from this point on as more episodes pass, so for now...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAu revoire,\\n\\n\\n\r\n               a.k.a ANIME&manga Addict -- Julie",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so bear with me as I try to sort out my thoughts on this wonderful anime.\r\nI almost didn't watch Chihayafuru, and I hadn't even heard of it until it was already a few weeks into the show. As time went on, more and more people were raving about how great it was, how it was going to be the sleeper hit this season, so I finally decided to give it a shot and see if a show about a card game really was THAT exciting. And let me tell you, it is. I am writing this reviewbecause I really, really, really want you to watch Chihayafuru and love it as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is so much more than a card game. To Chihaya, the protagonist of the series, karuta is also about creating a dream for herself, and the bonds she formed with her classmates Arata and Taichi back when she was twelve. Before graduating into middle school and going their separate ways, the three agreed to meet again when they all became Class A players. Arata moved back to Fukui, and even though he was fantastic at karuta (and the one who taught Chihaya!), he eventually quit playing after some unfortunate events. Taichi ends up at the same high school as Chihaya and helps her to form a karuta club, through which we are introduced to more wonderful characters.\\n\\n\r\nI remember someone saying that \"Chihayafuru loves its characters.\" This is certainly true. All of the main characters have grown since the start of the series and seem much more three-dimensional than those of many other shows out there today. Even supporting characters are fleshed out enough to be likable. In fact, there isn't a single character that I dislike. And if you know me, that's really saying something. I love hating on characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Chihayafuru is absolutely stunning. From the characters to the backgrounds, everything is breathtaking. The OST for the series is gorgeous as well, one of the best I've heard in a long time. They all complement each other to create a unique and wonderful tone for the series.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe this still isn't enough to convince you to watch Chihayafuru yet. Even though it doesn't sound like a memory card game can be entertaining, it really is. The karuta matches are some of the most intense scenes throughout, and you'll probably find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat when it's finally over. Karuta isn't simply memorization either. It's about reflexes, and mental stamina, and Chihaya even has extraordinary hearing which sometimes helps her to quickly win cards over from her opponent.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't know how else to put it. The cinematography of this show is amazing. The characters are developed and lovable. The story, while often predictable, is still exciting and endearing. There wasn't a single episode that I didn't enjoy. I breezed through the seventeen currently-aired episodes in just under three days, which I haven't been able to do even for some of the most exciting anime I've seen.  I just couldn't wait to see what happened next! (Also, this show will give you a LOT of feelings. Just wait). I can't believe I waited so long to watch this series. And if you decide to watch it too, believe me, you'll be saying the same thing.",

            "content": "\"What the hell is Katura?\"\r\nOf course, that was my first reaction.\r\nBut then...\r\nWow...\r\nJust wow...\r\nAt first, this anime really didn't catch my interest. It was plain and dry, like trying to shape out the dry clay; but as it went on, I found myself immersed in it. Like a sea of colors vibrantly expanding across an infinite of sky. Yes, even now, fifteen minutes after I finally saw the last episode, I am still numbed by its excellence.\r\n**NO SPOILERS**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory:\r\nIn the beginning, the story seemed boring. Predictable. Like a boat streaming across still water. It was lifeless, and simple. I expected it to be like any other Animewith a swindle of a romance eclipsed by the ever flamboyant facade of a sport or activity.\\n\\n\r\nBut somewhere, as the series progressed, it seemed to evolve. It seamlessly grew to something more, something beyond the natural limits of a story. It wasn't plagued with typical conflicts or unrequited desires, it was like a light that slowly lit itself brighter and brighter, unblocked by the trends of literature and expectation. Barriers that innately shackled a series' potential seemed to fade away, and every climactic moment that the characters felt was somehow shared with the viewer. As if a crescendo of realization would slay you alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was about the sport, Katura. And, you'd think: \"Well, if its just about a sport its not like anything interesting can happen.\" But somehow, it was different. The sport was a sort of catalyst that helped the characters not only develop towards one another, but it opened the door for an entire world that we all seem to forget, as if blinded by the mundane trudge of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe competitive aspect of the game, which yearned for such a demand of stamina seemed to be later eclipsed by the \"true\" virtue hidden within the sport. Yes, what the beginner sees, and the masters forget: The poetry. Such an attribute slowly became the mortar that gave new meaning to each simple issue that arose during the characters' failures.\\n\\n\r\nIt was seamless as we learned with them, through their desperation and hardship; their envy and willpower. The goals kept increasing, and aspirations began to soar, capping only at what the characters truly wanted.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nRomance. Friendship. Deeper revelations. Aspiration oriented. Perseverance through strength. No text box storytelling. Failure.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was interesting. It had primarily bold lines, and definitely took some getting used to. But now that I finished it, I really couldn't imagine this anime any other way.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, since this show is so off on a tangent in the first place, it seemed necessary to break the norm. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that there were moments when I wished that they wouldn't have. The fact of the matter is, the art does well for its purpose, but it seems like it was aimed at a particular niche. I guess it just comes down to personal preference, really. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the art was still phenomenal. Everything down to lighting was near perfect, and facial expressions were particularly pronounced so as to invoke the true feelings of the characters. Bloom, Sparkles, Glitter, Comical Backdrops, and Chibi Moments;  everything seemed in good shape.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it had a realistic feel. Which held tremors to the viewer considering the entire theme could be realistically translated into anything the viewer truly desired.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nThe art was different, but really you shouldn't have any complaints. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAh. Sound.\\n\\n\r\nThis soundtrack is simply awe inspiring. Even now, as I write this review, I have OST 7 \"Main Theme\" on loop. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show was EXTREMELY good. It did very well to convey the emotions that were felt by the characters, and worked seamlessly with the art and choreography to invoke what the moments wished you to feel. To be honest, the music had a voice of its own. As if it was an entire character separate of the cast, watching the show with you, helping you along through the tears.\\n\\n\r\nIt sympathized with you when necessary, and laughed alongside you, guided you along the adventurous moments... It really couldn't have been any better.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this show had 5 frames a second and 1980's art, I would still choke for air at how many times this musical score seems to steal your breath away.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I'll still be listening to this music many decades later. Thank you, Kousuke Yamashita.\\n\\n\r\nIf only I could rate this 20.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10.\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nSymphony. Commonly repeating motif. Varied orchestration. Light sounds mixed with heavy ensembles. Stellar composition.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile romance is an aspect of the story, it is merely a development feature. Note that the story is more so directed toward the love of friendship and the game itself than it is towards any romantic moments.\\n\\n\r\nTo start with, each character occupies a niche.\\n\\n\r\nAyase is a beauty, yet it is in vain. The moment she speaks, it is broken by her tomboyish image and personal drive. But its those very traits that reel you in. She is the joyous energy that keeps the group together, and despite her clear superiority in the game, genuinely cares for her friends, and helps aid them in their journey to pursue Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi, Ayase's childhood friend, remains her loyal companion throughout the years. His mental forte is unmatched to most every player the game has ever known; even once reciting every card at random in the entire deck of 100, just because he could. His family is privileged, and he is pressured by his parents to keep at the highest tier in terms of sports and exams. His brains keep him on par with the purists that achieve their status merely due to athletic prowess. He acts as the groups motivator and leader, often amping everyone out of their slumps with \"Just the right words\" to turn them around.\\n\\n\r\nArata represents the reverse side to Taichi, being the poorer, lesser appreciated, segment to the story. As the story progresses, his darker past becomes realized, and he continues to become a shining beacon for Ayase. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a triangle romance between the three of them, but remember, the show does not articulate this enough for this show to be branded as a romance.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are a great many other supporting characters that help aid Ayase on her journey to realize herself through Katura, each having a realistic and effective back story that warps the plot in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nThe characters were diverse, which allowed for the story to be seen through a wide spectrum. Realistic. Believable. Nothing was over exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDid I find this show enjoyable?\\n\\n\r\nWell, in a way I did.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that it was really giving a perspective about achievement I had never really thought about.\\n\\n\r\nTo learn meant failure, to grow stronger meant to feel hardship and to overexert yourself to what phase out the illusions to what you truly desired. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of each episode, with the crescendoing music resounding with each episodic climax, I felt the overwhelming desire to watch the next.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIt was like a ten hour long movie that always kept you drooling for more.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI was stunned by the hype of this show that I nearly skipped over it. And let me tell you, I ALMOST did.\\n\\n\r\nAnd simply for the thought once existing, I regret it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had passed up this show, I really would have missed out on such a masterpiece. I am shamed of myself.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly cant wait to jump into Chihayafuru Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\r\nIt was beautiful to the core. Every aspect was heartwrenchingly flawless. If you have any last minute questions before watching this series, feel free to PM me.\\n\r\nI really don't think the world can afford to have people so many that haven't seen Chihayafuru.\\n",

            "content": "Man, Chihayafuru is freaking good.   I wasn\u2019t going to watch this show.  You look at the promo.  It\u2019s a shoujo/josei type joint about some chick who plays Japanese cards or some nonsense. How can that be good?\r\nI know a lot of people mess with those mah jong anime that keep coming out.  I can\u2019t hate but I never know or care about what\u2019s going on in any of that stuff.  \r\nLucky things happened though.  Winter 2012 anime were failing hard so I had to start review crawling.  MAL gave this thing an 8+ so figured I\u2019d giveit a shot.  Normally that\u2019s a bad idea because girl anime tends to have inflated ratings on this site. \\n\\n\r\nExpectations exceeded. This show right here filled me with some serious glee.  I still have no idea what the rules of Karuta are and I still loved the show.  All I managed to discern is that somebody reads a poem in a creepy voice and then you have to snatch up a card real quick.  Apparently that was all that I needed to know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Mostly win. I like that every character is unique.  There hardly any typical characters, except some minor side dudes from that red shirt karuta club.  Actually I\u2019ll contradict myself and say that Chihaya herself is a pretty typical ditzy but hard working female lead character but everyone else is fresh.  My favourite guy of all is Desktomu-kun.  I\u2019m comfortable enough to say that he is actually cute as a grown male character. Welcome to 2012.   Speaking of Desktomu-kun, how come all the side characters in the club were small and funny looking where as the main three characters are all tall and handsome?  It\u2019s like there\u2019s a class system through character design.  I save further analysis of this for the Marxist anime review page. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I said the characters are good that\u2019s not saying  the chracters are deep or anything.  It seems like they all have one personality type, typically only express a couple moods and are all motivated by a single factor. For example, the adorable Kana-chan, can be summed up completely as the girl who likes poetry or a history buff.  Not every anime has to be an exercise in psychoanalysis though.   \\n\\n\r\nThe worst parts of the show are some of the flashbacks and plot devices used to motivate characters are pretty bad though.  Arata\u2019s motivation for quitting karuta is so contrived.  Pisses me off right now just thinking about how little imagination went into that. \\n\\n\r\nTaichi seemed like he was the most multifaceted guy.  He\u2019s sort of an insecure ass but more at least it\u2019s only as far as a real person acts like an ass.  You watch these josei/shoujo anime and the main guy is usually some epic dirtbag dude that could only another dirtbag could relate to.  A good example is the guy in Nodame Cantabile.  I want to punch the trash out of that guy.  You always have these girl anime pitting Dirtbag Dans against Nice Guy Norms but here I don\u2019t really get that.  Taichi actually seems like a nice guy but he can\u2019t help but do some dumb stuff.  Arata is kind of shy but he doesn\u2019t really seem that nice either.  He is actually pretty edgy since he\u2019s supposed to be the Lebron James of speed cards or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the action, which kicks a bunch of ass solely because of the direction and writing.  Like I said before, I still have no idea how karuta works but I definitely felt the suspense in every match.  I\u2019m dying to hear them read the cards out and I don\u2019t know what they mean.  That\u2019s good TV.  The matches are made interesting by focusing on internal mental stuff going on with the players and small details that the reader can understand.  For example, there is a part where a distinction is made between a player with speed and a player who uses rhythm and pacing.  I don\u2019t really need to understand karuta to be able to relate to that. \\n\\n\r\nThematically, you get a lot of the typical stuff here around being in a team and striving for a goal and all that sports anime crap.  I love that sports anime crap.  Makes me feel good as heck.  You also get a little education about Japanese poetry.  That also makes me feel good.  Like I\u2019m not just watching cartoons, I\u2019m getting educated out here.   I would have liked to have seen a little more focus on the outsider nature of the game though.  The whole ordeal with the Empress teacher was supposed to present that aspect of things but that unravelled pretty predictably.  I think more focus on Taichi and Chihaya\u2019s interactions with their parents and the parents\u2019 acceptance or ignorance of karuta would have been nice. \\n\\n\r\nI give this series a 9.  It delivered happiness, that sports anime suspense and some interesting knowledge about a weird sport. I\u2019m dying for a second season.    You know, I have now seen anime about karuta and kendo.  When am I going to get a sumo anime? \\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a sports anime about Karuta. What is Karuta you ask? I had no idea either until I watched this anime. Karuta is a card game based upon Japanese poetry, with a hundred poems as cards so memorization is key. As a reader reads out the first line of the poem, the player's goal is to touch the corresponding card that has the second line of the poem before the opponent. Sounds boring? Well you could not be more wrong. The way Chihayafuru depicts the relationships between the characters and the feelings of those who dedicate their lives to something only to be trumpedby those more talented. If you have ever competed in anything seriously, you will be able to relate.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is similar to many other sports anime. The main character Chihaya Ayase childhood dream is to watch her sister become the number one model. This all changes when she meets a transfer student, Arata Wataya,  that open her eyes to the world of competitive Karuta. Ever since this fated meeting that made her entranced in the world of karuta her dream has been to become the queen (best female karuta player).  From here on out the plot is quite simple, with Chihaya going to karuta societies to improve or tournaments to compete. Finding rivals,mentors and teamates along the way, each with their own influence on Chihaya. Honestly though if you watch Chihayafuru for a riveting plot with many twists and turns, you will be disheartened. Notably due to the slow start of the anime, with a long five episode flashback. Chihayafuru is mainly a character-driven show, which in its own way can produce its own heart-wrenching entertainment equivalent to an amazing plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters really do not disappoint, from the design to their personalities each character has a trait to love. Though Chihaya is a stereotypical tomboy airhead type character with her stereotypical childhood friend,Taichi Mashima, and stereotypical outsider transfer stuident Arata, the way they develop is what differentiates Chihayafuru from the status quo. Each and every character has their own dilemma, which they have to face. Inspiring us not only through their success but also in their own failure. Even the side characters have progress, and are explored throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art style, some might not be too accustomed to the differences in Chihayafuru. I know at first I had a hard time looking at Taichi and Chihaya because of their oddly super long eyelashes, but I grew to appreciate the design. There are some characters that look similar to others but this is primarily with background characters. Overall most of the characters don't look very similar, something I really appreciate in anime nowadays. As for the animation, everything is pretty crisp. Their is not much action to animate but they do a good job with the Karuta scenes, I have only seen problems in one or two episodes, where the frames drop a bit. Hardly noticeable, may even be my computer playing tricks with me. Now onto backgrounds, and other non-character related animation, was pretty good. Not amazing to me (like bakemonogatari background amazing) but still good. I am all for dark colors > light but the bright colors really stand out yet is cohesive with the piece as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nWith the great animations it leads to the Karuta matches actually being quite interesting. One would think that just watching a couple players try to get to a card first would be boring, but they build up suspense and emotion for every match. They do not get too technical about the technique and skill, and instead focus on the character's mindset. Despite the fact that at times this show is very serious, it does have its comedic aspects. Its funny to see how Chihaya go from ditzy in other situations, to being graceful at Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the Sound. The tracks do not vary too much considering the insert songs during the animation. Despite this lack of deviation, these songs were well timed and really highlighted the moments of emotion. In comparison the intro and outro differ greatly yet are just as memorable.  The opening has a more upbeat tempo that makes you want to tap your feet to the rhythm. I imagine the characters drive and love for karuta during the opening. Slowing down the pace with the Outro, it drives the great emotional impact of Chihayafuru. The ending really expresses the character's relationships well. As for the voice acting, nothing really stood out, but nothing was annoying. I do not really have an ear for voice acting so do not quote me on that.\\n\\n\r\nAll together Chihayafuru provides a great experience for the audience, with emotional attachment to the characters and the suspense to see the results. Don't let the fact that the show is about Karuta, and you have no idea what that is (yet) stop you from enjoying it. I believe that Chihayafuru's virtues strongly outweigh any faults that it may have, and highly reccomend it to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "*This review is spoiler free!* \r\nChihayafuru is an anime centered around the sport karuta and follows the story of a young girl named Chihaya as well as the friends and rivals she meets along the way. Before jumping into Chihayafuru you may have never heard of karuta and that really isn't an issue. The anime does a great job of creating a story around this sport that isaccessible to everyone and after only the first few episodes you will understand the sport well.\\n\\n\r\nFor a brief overview of what the sport karuta is about, it\u2019s essentially a sport based around the idea of determining which card out of a set has been randomly selected and then to quickly grab it before your opponent. Each of the cards are poems and at higher levels of play the players should be able to memorize the initial position of each card to be able to take them as soon as they can be identified. Even though Chihayafuru is based on karuta, the sport mainly acts as a platform for the ideas of growing and following your dreams, which are the underlying themes for the majority of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters learn to realize their dreams through karuta and watching them work hard to reach them is very satisfying. Most of the characters who are introduced are dug deeper into, including the opponents making it so you usually had a bit of sympathy for each character as they faced off. Each character has their own strengths, weaknesses and goals that make the character line up quite diverse and somewhat relatable. Each of the characters end up learning a lot from each other as they travel the same road, in karuta. \\n\\n\r\nThe sport karuta is the driving motor of the anime and watching the passion and determination the characters present in it really helps Chihayafuru capture the charisma a sport anime needs, but the great thing about this is, while it does capture the charisma of a sport anime, it also introduces the beauty and meaning of poetry making the karuta scenes very exciting to watch. These scenes are complimented by smooth and thrilling visuals, as well as sound effects and music, that really engage the viewer. For example, the intriguing sounds of the players skimming their hands over the cards to knock them to the sides or the interesting camera angles used to build suspense as the cards glide through the air. You'll be at the edge of your seat for a lot of the anime, especially during the intense karuta matches.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru has a great selection of music that really help to set the mood and engage the viewer throughout the anime. The background music is of high quality as well as the opening and credits. The music during the opening I've noticed really excites and energizes the viewer before it even begins, it does a great job at setting the atmosphere at the beginning. At the end of the anime, the credits have the opposite effect relaxing the viewer after all the intensity Chihayafuru has to offer. The art style is very appealing featuring a mostly bright and warm colour pallet with a large emphasis on floral patterns. The anime also does well in giving each character very individualistic and easy to identify character designs without making it off-putting. The animation is very smooth and enjoyable for the most part, but in a few episode I did notice a slight drop in the quality. In terms of visuals, this may have been the weakest feature, but I would still consider the animation quality very good so I wouldn't worry about it having a negative or noticeable effect on how you enjoy the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the thing Chihayafuru does best is keeping the viewer interested throughout the 25 episodes. The anime rarely had a boring moment from start to finish and really keeps the viewer wanting more the whole way through. The concept and story of the anime is quite simple but at the same time can be a bit moving and really unexpected. Chihayafuru isn't a one dimensional anime and is actually full of twists and turns while still remaining in essence, simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does have a second season and an ongoing manga series so you shouldn't expect everything to be finalized in the last few episodes, but I can still safely say the ending of the first season was satisfying and you won\u2019t hesitate to watch the next. Overall Chihayafuru was a very well done and exciting anime built around an unexpected sport that surprisingly works wonderfully. There really isn't much to dislike about Chihayafuru and watching it is quite refreshing while still remaining simple and very engaging. To anyone who found anything I mentioned about this anime even the least bit interesting I recommend you don't get put off by the idea of an anime based on a sport you may have ever heard of and give Chihayafuru a try.",

            "content": "To review Chihayafuru is a hard task, to describe how brilliant this little-known anime is, to explain why I like it so much, to tell you why it's such a great anime to watch is very hard, because Chihayafuru is unique, the only word I can describe it is unique. It may seem like your ordinary sports-romance-drama series at first glance, though there is absolutely no series of my knowledge to compare it to properly. \r\nThe way the story is presented, the way the characters interact with each other, the way the atmosphere feels, It's very real and very unique.\r\n= Story (10) = \r\nThe storyis one of the most interesting parts of the anime. I won't describe too much or really anything because if I did it would probably spoil a lot of things. What I will say is that the first couple of episodes, Chihayafuru sets it self in the present and the past, interchanging in various lengths, this unique way of starting off the story is incredibly good at letting the viewer get to know the three main characters, Chihaya, Taichi and Arata, It also allows you to see the way they change over time.\\n\\n\r\n= Character (10) =\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Chihayafuru special are the characters, they're all very likeable and you can at least relate to one. The way you see them develop from little kids into somewhat mature teenagers makes you grow attached to them. The dialogue and the way the characters interact with each other is incredible, just like how people interact in real life.\\n\\n\r\n= Art (9) = \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice. The character designs are great, especially the one's for Chihaya, Taichi, Arata and Nishida since you can see the resemblance between the child and teenage versions of themselves. A great part of Chihayafuru is the art direction, the scenes where they're playing Karuta look amazing.\\n\\n\r\n= Sound (9) =\\n\\n\r\nFor a 25 episode series, Chihayafuru uncommonly uses only one opening theme and one ending theme, which is okay since both songs are really great to listen to. The OST can be repetitive at times, though that doesn't really matter.  \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is fantastic, each seiyuu (voice actor) really suits their part. Especially Yoshimasa Hosoya who voices older Arata.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (10) =\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started Chihayafuru, I didn't know what to expect and I was amazed by how much I enjoyed every minute of it, It's amazing how watching two people playing a card game can be so thrilling, the way you can't wait to see what happens next. Not many anime series can do that week in and week out.\\n\\n\r\n= Overall (10) =\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chihayafuru is a masterpiece in it's own right, a series which actually has heart, as corny as that may sound. The characters all have had struggles which are very realistic and relatable, the story is original, something hard to come by in recent anime, the art and sound match the series near-perfectly and the enjoyability of this series is unexpectedly great.  \\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a must-watch and in my opinion the best anime of Fall 2011.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is an under the radar type anime that I'm pretty sure a lot of people simply passed over. After all, it's about a group of high school students playing a card game called Karuta. What is that you ask? Well, to put simply it is a game where you memorize poems on each card try to swipe them up before your opponent as each card is read. I'm sure you really want to watch this right now\r\nOkay, in case that riveting introduction didn't get you pumped for this show you should know that karuta is simply the gateway for everything else. Everything in Chihayafurujust screams passion. You can tell that every character really wants whatever they are aiming for. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is incredible. While it arguably does not have a huge stand out, all of them seem very real and well thought out. You can feel each characters dreams, hopes, and passion in everything they do. Especially Chihaya's and Taichi's. Each character experiences significant growth, and it's especially great how it seems like you're always in their heads it helps you relate to each character.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the connection you'll get with the characters you'll find your emotions going all over the place during episodes. Karuta matches, something that might be incredibly boring under normal circumstances, suddenly become prime time entertainment. If clannad pulled on your heart, and Penquindrum messed with your mind... then Chihayafuru will capture your soul. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware the anime ended in an incomplete state (the manga is still ongoing after all). So if you want a sense of complete closure at the end you'll be disappointed. However, if you can look past this, you'll more likely than not really enjoy this show.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my very first review, and I'm glad to give my first time to this anime...wait what?\r\nI first started watching this because I was bored. I just thought the art was okay (looking at the poster) and so started this five whole days ago. Pretty long time ago huh.\r\nWell then, all jokes aside, let's start the review.\r\nOverall-10: I haven't had such a beautiful anime for as long as I had started watching anime. The mix of the beauty of karuta, enjoyment of life, perfect sound, smart character selection...this anime was a new experience on my part. At first I was worried on whether Iwas going to enjoy this anime, but I decided to watch it, since I had nothing else to do--as a time killer. Who'd have thought that an anime I selected at random was a time mass murderer, and not a simple enjoyment!\\n\r\nWell, then, let's go part by part.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10: Karuta--I have not seen any anime with such a traditional theme before. Even more, this kind of theme is something anime writers avoid because of the lacking interests in people. However, despite that, this anime was able to draw the viewers into it via tackle of current issues. The blend-in of the issues and the main genre, moreover, was unbelievably coherent that I wasn't caring if Karuta was an inexplicably old game. The author did an amazing job of drawing people into the art of karuta. However, the author did not only focus on other \"more immediate issues\" either. The story's pace was steadily growing on the main theme of karuta and by the end of the episode, I was very absorbed into the game of karuta that I had my eyes stuck on the monitor, waiting for the next move. The author's unbelievably clean and beautiful job made chihayafuru not your everyday \"filler anime\" but a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10: As I said before the start of the review, the art is what really drew me into this anime. At a glance of the poster, I couldn't tell the beauty of it, but when I actually saw the anime, I was surprised at the delicacy of the anime. Unlike other anime where \"moeness\" is a great factor, this anime had a very decent body curve and a very \"traditional\" style of art. It did have some points where the face appeared more simplified than usual, intending the moe factor to be a part of the art, but that was really intended for comedy rather than \"cuteness overload\". If, for example, sword art online is cute, chihayafuru is beautiful. It was as if the artist has spent few hours per every 1080 pages.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10: The music was kicked in at an appropriate time and was stopped at appropriate time, building tension and relieving them continuously. The opening and the endings were not just a fun-themed song but also a river-like, flowing type of music. These added to the traditional theme of karuta, adding up to the beauty of the 100 Japanese poems.\\n\r\nHowever, the most notable sound in this anime was the sound of the readers.\\n\r\nReading a poem is very different from reading a poem in 100 poems. They need to be pitched right, stopped right and started right. The poem must not end in a loud pitch--it must fade out like the sun during sunset. The poem must not tremble too much, but it mustn't be in unison either.\\n\r\nIn other words, reading in karuta is harder than playing karuta.\\n\r\nDespite the constant banging of the straw mat, despite the interesting turn of event, despite the heat, the coldness, the itchy feeling, flowing sweat, readers must keep their composure and read the poems the right way. These are very hard to achieve. It's a natural thing that there're not much readers. However, this anime was able to deliver that right pitch through vibrations of ear buds. It was able to connect to the audience few thousand kilometers away. The sound is undoubtedly a masterpiece's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10: Chihaya is a very boyish girl. Her pace is very straightforward yet she's a lovely girl towards her family, especially her sister. She grows as a person as the story goes by, from your average tomboy to a determined adult. The development and the selection of the character was a very smart one, and for that I give 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: Besides the slapstick comedies in between, the anime made me smile in those heart-throbbing moments. If comedy-genre anime is just a pure fun, chihayafuru is a fun in life. We all have downs and ups, but the downs are what makes ups more fun and enjoyable. The ability to deliver such an enjoyment--not a pure comedy, but a natural fun--is an ability the authors spend their entire life for. I give my bow to the wonderful writers of this anime.",

            "content": "As the two seasons present themselves much as a continuous series, with little to set them apart, this review is made and posted for both seasons of the series.\r\nIf there is one word that describes Chihayafuru, it is \"passion\" - indeed, \"Chihaya furu\" means passionate. On the surface there is little that separates it from typical sports anime, from the focus on the team and team spirit to rivalries to tournament story arcs where you're typically served the main characters' opponents' motivations and reasons for participating in this sport. Through tears and joy we follow the main characters' journey through the world of this sport,and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend. As for the sport in question, the series focuses on a rather obscure (at least to a Western audience) card game known as karuta, where one has 25 cards with the first verse of poems on either side of the field, and as a reader reads the second verse of one of those poems, you have to remove the corresponding first-verse card from the playing field. The first to empty their side (25 cards) wins the game. A very coarse explanation but that's the gist of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it follows many of the traditional recipes for the sports genre, they are pulled off quite well in Chihayafuru, alleviating many of the issues doing so can present. It does in no way lift it off the ground and up to stardom, and if you are not a fan of sports anime to begin with, chances are you won't find Chihayafuru that very interesting. For the sports anime fan however, Chihayafuru offers a loveable and passionate experience, with some twists and differences. I already mentioned \"passion\" as a way to describe the series, and this is one of the aspects that sets it apart. From the at times striking visual and auditory imagery used - it is poetry after all - to the many ways of love for the sport that are presented, Chihayafuru delves deep into a world of passion, and while at times it seems a little too alien or cheesy how much of it the characters have for a single thing, it can also draw the viewer in and afflict them with a desire to do something they love, which is, at heart, what the sports anime genre is all about: Communicating passion and love for something.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that sets Chihayafuru apart is that unlike most sports anime, which are made to appeal more to a shonen audience, it leans more towards the shojo genre, evident in its at times flowery animation and colour palette, and more significantly, in its larger focus on emotion and romance. It forgoes some of the most intense focus other sports series has on the game itself and rather focuses on the inner world of the characters and their emotions - the full spectrum of it, not just the \"I want to win\"/\"This is my motivation!\" portions that you are often limited to. Often you see characters cry significantly, in joy or sadness, in defeat and victory. The series also builds up a solid love triangle between the main characters, without really forcing its and in its treatment, as well as adding these feelings and moments of love to the secondary characters. Of course, with a large cast it's a near-inescapable fact that some side characters are more bland than others, relying mostly on a singular trait or two to provide comic relief or interaction, but for the characters that matter there are for the most part many layers and aspects presented - and developed - in an intriguing manner.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically Chihayafuru is stunning. The soundtrack builds up around the atmosphere very well, from the heart-warming to the bittersweet, from the passionate to the suspenseful. It applies a rich orchestral instrumentation that fits very well with the oft-poetic art and animation. Meticulous attention has been paid to the quality of the card reading, and listening to the voice actors' performance in this regard is absolutely fantastic, especially for the most skilled readers in the series. Visually it frequently applies imagery as befitting of a series focusing on a game of poetry: The voice of a reader like sakura petals, the flow of a match like that of water, the flowery feeling of romance; such feelings are expressed visually and beautifully, though, as can be expected, some come across as more cheesy than others, but for the most part it is a boon rather than a detraction.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all comes to all, Chihayafuru definitely isn't a series for everyone. Karuta can come across as boring, the emotional layer as sappy or over the top to many sports anime fans, and for those who do not have a taste for sports anime in the first place, the story and the series' focus can seem unappealing. To me, personally, the series is a heart-warming and moving story that spreads a lovely feeling of passion, filled with lovely aesthetic value and likeable characters. It very often brings a smile to my face, not necessarily because it is outright funny and makes me laugh, but because it warms me up on the inside. At times cheesy, yes, but far from such a degree it spoils the series. It presents a lovely and different sports anime that quickly has earned a spot as one of my favourite series.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a show that I kind of regret picking up. No, not because it wasn't good or was a pain to watch. On the contrary, it was a very fun 50 episodes (This review includes S2 btw) - filled with many memorable and exciting moments. Unfortunately, it cuts off in the middle of the story, and really, really leaves me wanting for that season 3. That said, it is still a show that I will wholeheartedly recommend due to how special it is, and the fact that it seems somewhat likely that the anime will continue in a couple of years, once there isenough content to adapt.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a show that revolves around two things. The first of these is Karuta, the traditional Japanese card game which is the focus of the show. Upon hearing 'card game', the first thing that pops up will probably be something along the lines of Yugioh or Magic the Gathering, or perhaps something very different like Bridge or Poker. Karuta is a very different beast from what you will expect, being a sport (yes, a sport) that requires excellent memorization, reflexes, stamina, strategy, speed, and above all, hard work and effort to excel in. It is definitely not a simple game that is meant for relaxed play, requiring both physical and mental strength, and each match is intense as hell.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about this show is that it manages to make such a foreign game so compelling. We don't typically associate cards with physical activity, and most will find traditional things from our own cultures boring, let alone something played in an entirely foreign language. Yet, the show succeeds at making it interesting. Despite seeming simplistic at a first glance, the show slowly reveals the true depth of the game. We slowly learn more about the game, learning about the many different approaches to the game, the many interesting quirks it has, and the depth of the strategy involved in every move. Furthermore, the show is always careful to not overload us with information, slowly feeding us with all the little details, allowing us to slowly appreciate the intricacies of the sport without flooding us with too much exposition on the inner workings of the game.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like any truly great sports series, the game itself is often only a vessel to tell a greater story. And this is the second thing that this show revolves around - the characters. It is rare to see a cast more well-developed and more lovable than Chihayafuru's - each of the main characters undergo a tremendous amount of growth throughout this series' run time. At its heart, the show focuses on the triangle of Chihaya, Taichi and Arata, three friends that met at a young age, and became connected by Karuta. The show takes on an interesting choice of spending its first few episodes on how the three met, giving us a view on what they were like as children, before being forced to separate due to various circumstances. This allows us to know plenty about the characters when they were kids, and how their behavior has changed upon growing up. \\n\\n\r\nTaichi, in particular, is one of the most well-written characters in anime to date, and his personal journey throughout the series is a highly emotional one that was great to watch. It would be a mistake to simply classify this show as just another sports show that is full of young energy and passion - and Taichi's arc is a stellar example why. Sure, it has plenty of passion, but what truly makes this show special is how much it makes us care for these characters that we are watching, how much we want them to succeed. Chihayafuru is a very special show that is a blend of many different genres - being a hot-blooded sports shounen at times, and a highly emotional character drama at others. Watching these characters press forward for what they love is a truly heartening experience - and something that I haven't really seen in most other sports shows.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not mean that the rest of the cast is neglected. Beyond the main triangle, the care put into developing the other characters is evident as well, with major and minor characters all given plenty of room to develop. Due to the nature of Karuta as a niche hobby which not many people play, there are many recurring characters, and it is great seeing how they relate to the main cast. Some are friends and others are rivals, but each and every character in this show is never neglected, and each one of them has their own story to tell. It is difficult to dislike any character in this show - and that's definitely a great thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe production values of this show are amazing as well - it is difficult to find a show that is more beautiful than Chihayafuru. The animation is top-notch, and several shots of cards flying look amazing. The soundtrack is truly a stand-out though - both OPs and EDs are perfect fits for the show, and the OST is wonderfully composed, helping to elevate the work to another level.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say the show is outright perfect - it does suffer from some little things at times. The pacing in the second season is a little slow for one, and there are certain annoying aspects (some photographers mainly...). But the biggest flaw is undoubtedly the fact that this show is not complete - and is nowhere close to being finished. The manga itself hasn't been completed yet, and even then there is no guarantee of a third season, though it seems pretty likely considering how well the manga has been selling over in Japan. This is definitely not a short story that will end anytime soon - but rather, a lengthy series that painstakingly details the journey of our characters. Whether this is a flaw or not is up to you - though do stay away (but please do come back in a few years) if you really cannot stand an incomplete story.\\n\\n\r\nStill, despite the fact that this isn't finished, it is still a show that you really should watch. Chihayafuru is in my opinion a highly refreshing and unique experience, and also one which I think that most can enjoy. It might seem boring at first, but do give it a shot - it will all click once the first card flies.",

            "content": "When I think about Madhouse, I think about high-quality realizations of foolproof story concepts involving a somewhat guaranteed economic success. Chihayafuru, a series about a bunch of high-schoolers trying to achieve their dreams in becoming the best of the best in a sports called Karuta, represents a fitting example of this project selection pattern. Chihayafuru is a charming, highly likable and somewhat mind-opening anime providing for a high level of entertainment, in which I found myself immersed very rapidly.\r\nAs you maybe already know, when producing a sports-related series, it often doesn't really matter what kind of sports is chosen as long as the atmosphere worksout well in making you like the sports. Competitive Karuta, as a rather unknown but highly demanding sports, carries this to extremes. By choosing a card game with motoric elements, thus combining mind-related and physical areas of personal development, the foundation was laid for a highly engaging experience to which almost any sportsman can relate in some way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is why Chihayafuru is successful. The new sports that most of the viewers don't know anything about represents a highly mysterious component in the series, compensating for the actually not only highly predictable, but also monotonous story that lacks in innovativeness. I could name several other sports-related series, which are plot-wise structured almost exactly the same as Chihayafuru, but all of them were well received. For a successful sports series, there is no need to incorporate sudden plot-twists and ingeniously convoluted plotlines. All you need is an intense atmosphere, a goal, and some likable and highly ambitious characters going all-out. This is what you find in Chihayafuru as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not only likable, but also unique with only minor overlaps in their personalities. The five main characters are supposed to appeal to the audience, which leads to them turning out somewhat stereotypical. In general, there are two major flaws that cannot be overlooked. First, to enhance the aspect of perceived ambition, the main characters lack authenticity and personality consistency. They regard the same issue very differently from time to time and act highly unnatural, only to promote the story and preventing it from losing focus. Second, they lack depth. Although you find the main characters musing about how to becoming stronger with a high degree of reflection, they seem to not have anything in their minds besides Karuta and their mutual bonds, and that fact makes them appear more as story-driving tools than vivid, holistically conceptualized characters. But this is also the reason why they can be said to fit very well to the simple and straightforward story.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of audio-visual execution, the production quality should have been higher if it was intended to overcome current standards (as of 2012). Ultimately, it turned out to be a well-produced show, and that's it. The opening manages to set the energetic and positive mood extremely well and provides for an outstanding audio-visual fit, whereas the fit of the rather melancholic ending is debatable. The seiyuu were appropriately chosen and don't stand out in a negative way. Remarkable are some of the sound effects used in Chihayafuru, which add to the immersive experience that is created especially during tournaments. The visuals fit the standard but don't give much of an outstanding impression. A positive factor is the high consistency in visual execution and its underlying arts style.\\n\\n\r\nWith Chihayafuru, you get to see an anime that adheres to the norm in sports-related series, but not surprisingly delivers a highly engaging ride through the world of competitive Karuta with a set of ambitious and likable characters. It features a positive and energetic atmosphere and does very well in generating excitement despite the predictability and monotonous nature of its story. Chihayafuru can be recommended for everyone who likes shounen and seinen, shoujo and josei, as well as sports in general.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7.64/10\\n\r\n(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.)\\n",

            "content": "--Preliminary Proposition--\r\n\tChihayafuru is good, astoundingly and courageously good. There is crying almost every episode and yet it still remains utterly utterly good. It has an abundance of Shoujo romanticism yet it is good. The characters are good. The moments are good. The fights are good. The battles fought are good. The entirety of the show I cherish in my heart. Every episode I cherish. Every single interaction I cherish. The jokes, even though not necessarily of highest standard, I cherish. This show I cherish and cherish again. When it comes to this show I have no choice but to be giddy with love and tofight for its reputation. I shall have to fight for Chihayafuru to be placed not just among the best sports animes but as the best sports anime. I shall fight because it is my utter love that drives me, as a writer and an aesthete, to edify what my love consists of; perhaps in the process to teach others how words heavy with love can weigh with significance and how expressing love is the pinnacle of all and every language. Even though my tongue is tied and tangled up in a million knots by love and already I feel the schoolgirl giddiness that comes with trying to describe why exactly I love I must still fight for my love. \u2018Fight\u2019 is appropriate because in the end Chihayafuru is all about fighting; fighting and victory in the name of love. I must love like a girl and fight like a man.\\n\\n\r\n\tBut already I am at a dilemma because I cannot start merely with the standard formal descriptions of the show. I cannot just go into character or art or story; there is no love in the mere description of things. As much as I love this show I also love the medium of writing. I will fight therefore in the form of writing too. Like all writers and critics I want to win; my views need to be heard so that my love can be known. To be known is not enough. I am greedy and I must not just express my love for a single entity but in describing the love I have for this show I must express my love for a greater entity \u2013 that of life itself. I must transcend the critic who writes with mere puppy love and reach those sacred peaks that only full on master wordsmiths can conquer. This then must try to be edifying in the same way Motaigne or Orwell is edifying. Only in showing a love for life can my words bear significance and with these words I will be able to love Chihayafuru in a deeper way than before.\\n\\n\r\n--The Will to Win and the Valor of Winning--\\n\\n\r\n\tThe creed of some is to claim the struggle is worth more than victory. I have much against this if this is taken to heart by those who have never tried to win. This expression can only be understood by those who have been tempered in the flames of trying to win itself; it is a sacred expression that excludes all who have not had the understanding of what victory entails. A child who, because of languor and weakness, does not take on significant burden if in sport or battle and uses this expression to deflect all guilt and doubt as to his own will and strength, that child will only know weakness. Enough of preaching though, I can leave that for the pastors.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe Japanese have deeply understood what it means to be proficient in an art; it is reflected in their manga. I have heard a friend who claimed that \u201cThe Japanese have made works on almost everything\u201d and I am very keen to concur. For the art of cooking and food tasting we have Oishinbo and a plethora of other food mangas. Every sport is bound to have a manga of some sort. The mental sport of Go has the famous Hikaru no Go. The art of extreme mountain climbing has Kokou no Hito. Bartender shows us what cocktailcrafting is all about. The unifying theme within all these works is proficiency, what it means to be proficient in an art one has dedicated life to. Many Sports movies I\u2019ve seen focus on the underdog victory, the relationships between the characters and the supposed \u2018tribulations\u2019 they go through. There is a problem though when the training is lost in montage and the character relationships are given a premium over the sport itself. A sports anime then has that distinct element of being focused around the sport as well as showing the love that goes into appreciating the sport. With Chihayafuru not only is the sport still the focus but the sport dictates all character relationships. The sport and the players stand on equal ground.\\n\\n\r\n\tI cannot adequate explain my love without going into some background information. I was no sportsman but I picked up a competitive activity \u2013 debate. As one club who wasn\u2019t really a reader of current affairs or a thinker of political systems and ethics, also coupled with the fact that I was never a speaker, I was easily and completely and repeatedly trounced by the others in the club who had entered it with previous experience. I proceeded to fight harder than before. I would study current affairs and politics while leaving aside the rest of my studies. I would watch videos upon videos until I improved. Slowly I started to win but then again the rest of the club wasn\u2019t slacking off either so I still lost majority of the sparring rounds. In the first competition I lost three out of four rounds. In the second competition I received the same score. There was a difference though, the first competition I was angry and dejected but for the second I was angry enough to not lose hope beyond the first round and suddenly even though I was losing it became fun. In my third and last competition I won two out of five rounds but I had the most fun of all time. Afterwards I spectated as the other club members, who themselves were tempered in the fires of battle, would go on to trounce some of the top teams in a national competition and almost achieve an underdog victory. Nothing beats the real life stuff \u2013 but Chihayafuru comes close. Afterwards we stepped down from the club in order to study for exams and the leadership was passed to the juniors.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn retrospect I was more like Oe or Komano, staying in the background but still in the action watching anxiously.\\n\\n\r\n--Comparing Works--\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is the section where I aim to bring down all others in my fight for love.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe first I shall bring down is Hikaru no Go. Despite being closest to the realism of Chihayafuru (besides the supernatural element) I cannot credit this much. If we consider the core components of a sports anime the unity of action (as in the tense fighting scene) with spirit (the characters in their quest for victory), Hikaru no Go is extremely balanced in these two areas. Yet I cannot credit Hikaru no Go because of the sole unfortunate reason that Go has too high barriers of understanding. In Chihayafuru the kinetic quality of the sport makes it easier to understand, you memorize then steal. Go, although a respectful and highly intellectual brilliant game requires a certain mastery of the game itself to be able to appreciate fully. Without an in depth knowledge of concepts such as thickness or joseki, the game is lost to a person who just wanders in. The anime doesn\u2019t really flesh out concepts too deeply either but does provide some commentary. Likewise it may be fun to watch a street fighter tournament (like Daigo Umehara\u2019s victory against Justin Wong) but without knowledge of cancels, wake-ups and cross ups, much is lost. Furthermore Hikaru no Go took more than 50 episodes to flesh out what Chihayafuru managed to achieve in 26 episodes. Hikaru no Go is good but I shall only treat it like an acquaintance rather than an infatuation.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe second I shall bring down is Hajime no Ippo. In this case the action is what stands out. The kinesthetic fights are wholeheartedly enjoyable and the action in the ring is thoroughly explained. There is a significant spirit conveyed too in seeing Ippo constantly jumping back into the fray. Its weakness is in the victories. Ippo wins too much. The sweat and tears of victory are undermined by the interference of the author. There is only the kinesthetic but it lacks in heart. Yet there is much to be enjoyed about Hajime no Ippo so I will not condemn it anymore.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe third I shall bring down is Kuroko no Basuke, but really this falls in the same catergory as Hajime no Ippo in that it is more of the action than the spirit. The action triumphs all and nothing is left for the heart.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe fourth I shall bring down is Cross Game. This is an action which I myself find it hard to perform. I have an infatuation with Cross Game because of its vibrant spirit and beautiful characters. Like Romeo who in his despair over Rosaline finds himself overpowered by the intense aura of Juliet though I have no choice but to place Chihayafuru in its rightful place in my heart. Cross Game is a triumph of drama and action, a unity of drama and action. The dramatic flows together with the sports in a perfect blend yet then it does not conform to the spirit of the sports anime; that of overwhelming spirit in the face of adversity. The adversity is a dramatic adversity not an inner adversity. We are more keen to see what becomes of Ko and Aoba rather than seeing Ko conquer his own inadequacies. The romance is a dramatically perfect one yet because of this it cannot be placed on that sports anime pedestal. It vacillates between the two realms and becomes an entity in its own right. Let Ko and Aoba do what they wish! I will continue on to greater battles.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf there is one adversity that Chihayafuru has to overcome that is the grand opus that is Kokou no Hito. It is a triumph of spirit, a Seinen masterpiece of overwhelming heart. It is also an object d\u2019art with its luscious backgrounds and amazingly realist style. It is entirely about a battle with the self. It is a work that could be seen as the pinnacle of human victory. It is a giant, as tall as the peaks conquered within. Why I cannot place it in the same place as Chihayafuru lies is because it is not a work in the same realm. It stands far away on another mountain, another throne in my heart. Kokou no Hito is the friend whom I shall share whiskey with when overcome with despair. Chihayafuru is my infatuation. They are two different entities yet equally as important. If I find my will I will think of Chihayafuru to push me greater, if I lose my will I will seek Kokou no Hito to regain it. If I have neither despair nor willpower and fall into the straits of melancholy, I will heal it in Eden Hall.\\n\\n\r\n--Love Letter--\\n\\n\r\n\tBalanced on the weighing scale of spirit, Chihayafuru is a perfect gem. I would wish that Chihaya be the main shining star of the show but I have to award that to Taichi. The repetitions of failure, the despair over lost time, the thrills, the spirit all belongs to him. He is the pure representation of the symbol of the will; the romantic symbol representing will. Chihaya stands strong in spirit but she is never weighed down in the same way that he is. Her obstacles, in that sense, are of lesser magnitude because she does not grapple with sorrow but single-mindedly fights on. She is an angel but she from her I do not get as much the pangs of human pain as I do from Taichi.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhy I love Chihayafuru is because it shows us that there is still a place for the highly romantic in this world. Once more a lesson on the history of Literature (like you haven\u2019t seen this before if you\u2019re familiar with my review style) dealing with Romanticism. In around the 19th century when faced with the growing significance of industrialization, the human spirit was greatly impoverished. With the rise of the machines progress was prioritized but there was a lack of love for nature and humanity itself. Artists reacted to that by creating a literary and artistic movement where feelings and emotions were placed as paramount to realism and the ultimate ideal was beauty. The picture Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog is a key example of this; the man in it symbolized the triumph of human strength over the sea of uncertainty that was going on at the time. After a whole load of wars though disillusionment became the norm and the romantic ideal faded into the background. Anime, I see now, may be the return of the romantic in another form. Chihayafuru shows us how essential fighting with one\u2019s own soul is in its own innocent Shounenesque way. It is perfect because it shows the will\u2019s triumph over the very realistic obstacles of life. It is really one of the only shows to be able to do this without falling into clich\u00e9 or overtly romantic tones. It does not have to be literary but it is heartfelt and resonates within those who know what fighting is. Some may call it na\u00efve but I call it powerful. Sometimes this kind of power and wide-eyed idealism is needed these days.\\n",

            "content": "I didn't have high expectations when I first read the description of the show. However, I got hooked on the first episode and the rest of the season didn't disappoint.\r\nStory (10/10): Most series fall flat in the storyline for three reasons: 1) An uninteresting beginning discourages viewers from continuing the series. 2) The story line is inconsistent. 3) The story doesn't reveal enough, or it reveals too much. \r\nChihayafuru, however, does it right and in an unexpected way. The story begins with several flashback episodes that help viewers understand and connect with the main characters. The plot itself is expected; after all, the series isabout competitive karuta, so it makes sense that the plot will center around the competitions. The series is consistently good, with good writing and just enough humor to lighten the mood but not too much to make the show look goofy. The most intense scenes in the series will make your heart race, and the sweet scenes will put a smile on your face.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Chihayafuru's art is beautiful and elegant. In a lot of animes, the characters all seem to have a basic face structure (ahem, *Sword Art Online*), thus making them unmemorable. But Chihayafuru's characters don't fall into this category; it's obvious to those who watch that the show's artists spent time on making characters their own persons. The scenery is also very pretty, though typical of most shoujo anime/manga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (20+/10):  This category is where Chihayafuru really excels. It's really enjoyable to see the main cast develop and mature over the course of the series. The writers also used the supporting characters well, and I particularly found Harada Sensei to be one of the best supporting characters in the show.\\n\r\nIf there's a fault with the characters in the show, most people would probably point a finger at the protagonist, Chihaya. At first glance she seems like a cliche--pretty, but not too smart, oblivious to love, and often single-minded. But her interactions with the others makes her likable, and she has depth. She never fails to surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was probably one of the most underrated shows of 2012. Or possibly ever. I couldn't find it on any list of Best Animes of 2012. So this series may be one of those where you either don't understand it, or you love it. It's worth watching to find out.",

            "content": "I know I'm only on the fifth episode but I just have to say that I am loving this anime! Although it isn't labled a slice of life story, I watched it because I think it is one of those true slice of life animes where the story could actually happen. After finding nothing but supernatural type of stories labeled slice of life I was on the prowl for good ordinary slice of life anime. At first I didn't really know what to expect with the Karuta game thing.  I didn't want to sit around watching some game be played in every episode althoughI do love to play games.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what I found was more than just a show about kids playing a poem game but a story about finding your own dreams, finding inspiration in others, and possibly a love story?\\n\\n\r\nSince I began watching Kimi to Boku around the same time I can't help but to compare certain aspects of the shows that are similar such as the use of flashbacks to tell parts of the story. Kimi to Boku can learn a thing or two from the writers of Chihayafuru. Kimi to Boku is saturated with flashbacks that interrupt the present and most of them are irrelevant. In Chihayafuru they used a full flashback to tell the story of how Chihaya, Arata, and Taichi got to the point they are in the present story. It gave us relevant information to the current plot and characters and helps us see who they are as people. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters there isn't a single one I don't like, I like all three of them, of course at one point I didn't like Taichi. However, he grew on me because he is a character with his own flaws just like Arata and Chihaya (I don't want to spoil anything by going into detail) and I hope to see even more development from them.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the main focus of the show is Karuta, they do know how to make it exciting to watch, although at some point you may find yourself eye rolling over the extreme music choices they use to bring out the excitement, but even so I can't blame them for trying. I've never seen nor played the game but I'm sure it isn't nearly as exciting as the show.  I remember watching Hikaru no Go and tried to pick up the game Go but dropped it cause it was boring and full of douchebags (at least on the site I played it at) but like Hikaru no Go it does make me want to check out the game even if it is just a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nBut aside from the game you will see a touching story here between the three main characters and maybe even a bit of a triangle forming between the two boys and the girl.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode five, we have the conflict between the characters who are now teenagers and at first I was a little worried about the Arata character because in the last episode they seemed like they were going the emo route with him. But in this episode, you understand why he was the way he was in the fourth episode (I won't spoil anything) I really did like the way it was handled, I totally understand how Arata feels and I cannot wait for the next episode to come out. \\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nUpdated review after episode 8: I have no choice but to bump this down from 9 to 7 because this show is so boring without Arata. After the whole ordeal with him we are now focused solely on Chihaya and Taichi recruiting members for their club with each episode focused on Chihaya trying to get each person to see how wonderful the game is, of course, even if she drags them down to play, the moment they see it they fall instantly in love with the game. Or have some sort of condition for agreeing to play. These episodes are basically Chihaya running around screaming at people, slamming into walls and doors, and dragging people desk and all into the club room. After a while it gets a bit too much to handle. She hasn't seemed to change much since she was a child, which is NOT a good thing compared to Arata and Taichi who have changed so much. Her character just comes across as stagnant. Hopefully it picks back up.\\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a very unique show in premise but not so much in execution. It centers around a traditional Japanese card game called karuta and the aspirations of a girl named Chihaya set to become the best player in Japan (and therefore the world) alongside her friends.\r\nKaruta is a one-on-one card game in which players must try to touch cards inscribed with poems as the corresponding poems are read faster than their opponent. The game is explained very thoroughly early on, and while the concept may seem rather dull the show does a great job on making it interesting.\r\nChihayafuru opens on a few flashback episodesto set the stage in elementary school as Chihaya learns about and grows a dedication to karuta, all while forming a love triangle with child prodigy Arata and childhood friend Taichi. This love triangle is probably the most interesting character dynamic in the show but sadly it's treated as background decoration due to Arata's overall absence and lack of screen-time. Eventually Chihaya and Taichi form their own team at Mizusawa Highschool with three others who all have some entertaining personalities on their own (the lady-like Oe is a favourite of mine).  \\n\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite their charm they don't really have much chemistry between each other overall. Everyone develops nicely and you can feel them grow closer as a group, but I can't describe any two characters' relationship any differently than any others'. In season two an additional two players are added to the team, but they are quickly sidelined and don't get much focus at all, which is a shame because they actually had some distinct dynamics with a few of the other characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a group though, the cast does feel like a bunch friends who would genuinely spend their time together, which is something a lot of anime tend to miss. Watching them all grow to love karuta more and more as the series progresses is a spectacle alone. Chihaya herself is a very charismatic character with an unparalleled drive to better herself at the game, and her passion makes her lovable despite her clueless nature. This passion can occasionally steer the show towards melodrama, (never to the point of being overbearing however) but there are some very intriguing inner conflicts within the players. Taichi's constant second-guessing of his worth as a karuta player is as emotionally engaging as it is realistic, and it will surely resonate with many (especially athletes).\\n\\n\\n\r\nMost of the matches (it is a sports anime after-all) revolve around the players' psychology rather than strategies. Since karuta is a game centered around reaction time, if a player feels outclassed, overwhelmed, or simply out of their element, their game will be thrown off considerably. This emphasis on attitude can sometimes get a little repetitive as characters go through nearly identical trains of thought match-after-match but most of the time the individual matches are very entertaining. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the team matches. Because there are five separate games happening simultaneously there is a general lack of focus and tension, which become very tiresome when the games overstay there welcome. And trust me, they do, especially in the second season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile they are quite engaging during the show, most games in Chihayafuru are forgettable in the long-term. This is because everyone besides the Mizusawa team is very bland and one-dimensional. There are a few fun standouts like Sudo the sadist but a strong personality can't maintain a conflict on its own. A good antagonist has to challenge the protagonist's physical and mental weakness, and sadly nobody gets the focus to do so aside from Shinobu Wakamiya. She acts as a very good foil for Chihaya to overcome, as the two have similar interests (sharing an obsession with children's merchandise and karuta) but she is much more aggressive and cold and completely outclasses her upon their first meeting.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the two never get a chance to face off on equal ground, as a certain plot-point near the end makes it nearly impossible for Chihaya to play properly. It is a very sour note to end the series on, and while there is a possibility of a season three, Chihayafuru could become another unfinished Madhouse production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of aesthetic there isn't much to talk about. Yes the motions are always fluent but the show's art style is that of a standard josei, which isn't a bad thing but it isn't a good thing either. Some dynamic shots could've really helped make the show stand out. I'm not too keen on the colour palette either, as everything appears to glow, much like the fluorescence of pale skin. There are a few interesting visual metaphors however, much akin to Kaiji but on a less frequent basis. Arata's prowess flooding the area with water is definitely a visual highlight.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe audio department is pretty typical as well. The music is quite underwhelming, and there is one song that almost queues melodrama whenever it plays. On the plus side, Asami Seto did a great job accentuating Chihaya's quirkiness and disoriented personality through her stellar voice acting, and the sound effects are pleasant to the ears as well. The smacks of hands on tatami mats sound thoroughly striking, which really emphasizes how dedicated karuta players are to their craft.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Chihayafuru is a fine watch and while personally I am indifferent to it, there is value to be had. I would recommend Chihayafuru if you would like something simple but unique and don't care about being on the edge of your seat ninety percent of the time. It's clear that the show's target audience is housewives longing for cultural nostalgia, so I suppose garnering the attention of other demographics is almost an achievement of its own. Will it be heralded in ten years as a masterpiece? Likely not, but Chihayafuru is a series that deserves to be completed.\\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru\r\nRoughly 2 years back a female friend of mine urged me to watch a certain anime, but as I was busy in my own shit at the moment, I just took the recommendation, downloaded the series and that's it. Then came along it's second season, I thought - \"Will start it after second season gets complete, maybe\" and yes, I forgot again. 5 days ago, browsing through my collection I stumbled upon this title once again, this time I'm happy I chose to pick it up. Sometime the hype is right.\r\nThe plot is generic, in fact so generic, that this is probably the biggest reasonwhy I felt hesitant to pick it up two times before. But the tags \"Sports\", \"Josei\" kinda piqued my interest. It's been almost 6 days since I fell in love with this series, thinking back now I feel sorry for not picking it up earlier. In layman terms, it's a story about various people coming together and working hard to achieve their respective dreams. Let's see what are the things that makes \"Chihayafuru\" unique among various other titles with similar plots.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGame: - \"Karuta\" - A traditional Japanese card game. This game had been mentioned in some of the other anime, but I always took it as some Japanese version of playing cards, not to mention one can't really think of it as a sport of hard work, mental & physical abilities and passion, much like how we view Football, Baseball, etc. But this anime will make you think twice about that prejudice. Instead of dwelling into the details of karuta, I leave that part for the anime since it does a great job in explaining all the rules and procedures quite well over the episodes. But let's just be clear about few things, karuta is a game that can be played in many ways and each style have it's own set of rules. However, In this anime the karuta we see is \"Competitive karuta\". When you think of a sport, you also think about the players, here the various stages of a player learning and playing the game has been covered quite extensively, let's devise an example from anime -----\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of player levels (not official, but just to make the explanation easier) -\\n\\n\r\n1. Noob class - Beginners who have just started playing the game. It provides a good opportunity for audience to learn the game with them and also to witness their evolution from the start. Ex - Kana.\\n\\n\r\n2. Middle class - They have played and still playing the game from a long time. They are strong but are still inconsistent as players. They serve as a good measuring stick between beginners and very good players. Ex - Taichi.\\n\\n\r\n3. First class - These players have refined their play over years of practice, both shining their skill and talent. Just having one of them in your team gives you mental assurance and having one against gives you the scare. Ex - Chihaya.\\n\\n\r\n4. Monster Class - These players have dedicated their whole life for the game. Their mere presence is enough to intimidate their opponent. They have honed their skill and talent as close to perfection. A match between two such players is something to look out for. Ex - Arata.\\n\\n\r\n5. God Class - Their level of play exists on a different plane of it's own kind. Very few people have managed to reach that level, even among monster class, not many can even dream to reach it. Ex - Queen and Master.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, the viewer is able to briefly understand the players and follow their evolution over time. Also, even among the same class, the individual player's game attitude (offensive/defensive), techniques and fortitude can put one miles ahead than the other. Anime explores each aspect of it very well, as a sports anime it brings out the best of karuta.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:- While story can be quoted as the bone structure, characters are the muscles and flesh, more so in series like this. It is also the part where this anime excels the most. First, we have Chihaya, a high school freshman, pretty, tall and the younger sister of a famous model, but she's also an airhead, simple-minded, dumb and weird person - often referred to as \"Beauty in vain\" or \"karuta baka\" (since all her thoughts seems to be centered around karuta only). Even though Chihaya's character comes out as a typical airhead stereotype at first, she has more to her than that. As the story progresses we bear witness of the changes and the events that leads to those changes in Chihaya's personality. Also, regardless of what idiotic things Chihaya does, one can't really help him/herself from feeling admiration towards her passion for the sport. Second, Arata, belongs to a lower middle-class family, average-looking, grandson of the man respected as the \"Eternal Master\" (Master, Title granted to the best male player), in the world of karuta. His love for karuta comes from his grandfather who also taught him how to play as a kid. Arata is an honest, straight-forward and kind person, though he can look extremely scary in the eyes of his opponent. He's the one who introduced Chihaya to the world of kaurta when they were kids and also the one who gave her the dream of becoming the \"Queen\" (Title granted to the best female karuta player in Japan) one day. He moves away shortly after befriending Chihaya and Taichi due to family reasons. Since Arata doesn't get enough screen-time in both the seasons, it's pointless to talk about his character development. Third, Taichi, high school freshman like Chihaya, handsome, first in academics, belongs to a rich family and basically a \"Jack of all trades\" but Taichi doesn't think of himself as privileged. He's also the third member of Chihaya and Arata's team when they played karuta as kids. \"You are a good student and good athlete, so only do things where you know you can win\" - Because of this constant reminder by his mom, Taichi has developed a complex towards things which he isn't good at. This is also one of the reasons why Taichi doesn't like Arata, he thinks he can't beat him no matter how much he practice and that Arata will always be better than him. Ironically, the most brilliant character development also came out in the form of Taichi. He breaks away all the stereotypes over the length of the anime and comes out as the most dynamic personality in the whole series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Dreams:- Arata wants to become the Master, Chihaya wants to become the Queen. Having a dream and then trying hard to achieve it is such a wonderful thing, but then what is Taichi's dream? In the beginning even he didn't knew it himself. He seemed to be playing along because it was fun and later, because he wanted to help out Chihaya in fulfilling her dream, he wanted to support her as a friend and as someone who loves her. But as Arata once said - \"Your dream should be about yourself\", Taichi too begins to realize the meaning of these words through various experiences and people he meets. Also, what's more interesting than watching two people working hard to realize their dreams? It's to witness the voyage of a person who is still having a hard time struggling with his emotions, self-hatred, self-loathing and limitations, in order to search for a dream first, a dream that's only about himself. I have this feeling that Taichi will come out as the dark horse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSide - Characters:- When I said that - \"It is also the part where this anime excels the most\" for character department, that also included my views about side-characters. Chihayafuru has wonderful side-cast. Unique personalities, character designs and their thoughts make them stand out and prevent them from suffering the same fate as many side-characters do in most of the stories. They enjoy, suffer, evolve alongside our main cast in a way that the viewer ends up connecting and be concerned for them. We as viewers starts to feel as if their story is equally important to tell, and undoubtedly it is. For ex - There was this match between two side-characters, and it ended up hogging more limelight than the match of a MC which is taking place simultaneously.\\n\\n\r\nBoth side cast and main cast, they may not necessarily be what people call \"lovable characters\", since you may or may not like some of the things they do, but you'll feel your own emotions resonating with them regardless. That's a very important aspect which all entertainment mediums aspire to attain. Emotional and intellectual involvement is directly proportional to one's enjoyment, though the level of that involvement vary from person to person.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance:- Though the show is mostly focused on players' hard work and passion towards the sport, and the love of friendship, romance among characters has been introduced and explored briefly, but in the background. It doesn't try to take over the story, it's been hinted upon at appropriate places, which in turn, also makes the relationships among characters to come out naturally. It wouldn't be a spoiler to say that there's a love triangle among our MC's and a love polygon (if we also include side-cast). But people who are hoping to see brief amount of romance, I must warn you before hand that it'll not happen. Anime only gives very little (yet strong) moments dedicated towards it. Some people might even find the whole triangle situation to be frustrating, more so if they watch it with only one set of mind and without putting themselves in each character's shoes. It is a josei anime, anything can happen as far as romantic relations are concerned. *coughs in* Nana, Honey and clover *coughs out*. Viewer discretion is advised.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:- \"Chihaya is cute!\", that was my first impression about the series. LOL. Art-wise the show is quite good, the beautiful patterns on hakamas, the level of details that adds up to the charm , use of vibrant colors. Madhouse has done \"one fine job\" with the animation, especially in the games department. The hand movements accompanied by the effect line and after-image blends quite well with the camera angles. Both Art & Animation adds up a lot to the whole passion and tension factor befitting a sports anime. I tried reading the manga till 5th chapter and stopped, it doesn't have the same \"drive\" that anime has because of the wonderful animation. Most likely, I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope for a third season to come, I don't want to read it's manga if i can help it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:- It doesn't stand out but it goes well with the flow of the story. Sound Effects, on the other hand stands out, like they are supposed to, and adds up to the scene as a whole. Chihaya's seiyuu, Asami Seto, has done a good job. Even though she has mostly done supporting roles, I believe she has a nice voice for a main cast. Taichi's seiyuu on the other hand is no no-namer, Mamoru Miyano (Light Yagami, Setsuna F. Seiei, Okabe Rintarou) and undoubtedly, he has done his thing correctly. What was shocking is to learn that Arata's seiyuu is a girl (though I absolutely loved the dialect), Yuka Terasaki.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI've also watched the second season, and if you ends up liking the first season, then you'll definitely like the second one too, since it follows the same exact pattern, just more karuta matches. Chihayafuru in all it's entirety, is a bittersweet experience and I have this very strong feeling that it'll also end on a bittersweet note. Regardless of however the mangaka choose to end the story, it will remain in my memory for a very brief amount of time. Strongly recommending it to all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome memorable quotes:-\\n\\n\r\n1. \"You have to do the things you don\u2019t want to do, before you can do the things you truly want to do.\" - Tsutomu Komano to Ayase Chihaya\\n\\n\r\n2. \"Love is when it isn't fun to be with that person. It's when nothing goes the way you want. When you're not having fun...and yet...You still want to be with her.\" - Mashima Taichi\\n\\n\r\n3. \"I can't cry, not when I haven't put in the time. But it still hurts.\" -Mashima Taichi\\n\\n\r\n4. \"Frustrations will not last forever. Nobody can keep on going without some measure of reward.\" -Harada-sensei\\n\\n\r\n5. \"As long as you have a smile on your face, karuta will always be fun. That's the truth, Captain!\" - Mashima Taichi to Ayase Chihaya\\n\\n\r\n5. \"My grandfather always used to tell me...you don't need game sense to play karuta, you just have to take cards faster than your opponent. It's difficult to achieve a similar level of game sense, but there are many different ways to become faster\" - Wataya Arata.

            "content": "One more to go, but then again, everybody agrees that the ending would be hanged one since it is certain that there won't be a climatic battle between Chihaya and Arata, however storywise the drama genre did played well with this 25 episode anime and the game and sport genre, well....... on the game genre it did played well, not sure about the sport genre since such genre is more of an overkill than anything else.... Sure, there is a major competition that goes on with the traditional Japanese card game kurata. Then again the game kurata is kind of informative and gives usviewer a glimps as to the said game as well as show us as to how passionate the Japanese about the game. So for the story I'll give a \"Very Good\" number 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you'll look at it there is none of that Moe thing that goes on with the way the characters were drawn, in fact the way that them characters were presented are pretty much decent and there is that elegant thing that goes when the charaters were in a traditional Japanese Hakama. \\n\\n\r\nSound: fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI just simply like the opening theme and Chihaya's child voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharater: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this is more on Chihaya and his kurata team compose of Taichi the club president who's hoplessly have some feelings for her, Tsutomu the club genius, Yuusei the fatso who's as good as Tachi and Japanese customs and poetry expert Kanade. Chihaya you might say is an epitome of a very competitive Japanese kurata player, who seemingly hopes to duke out with Arata but must go to a lot to get to him which I like. Let's go to Taichi and Arata, one started out as somebody you hated then becomes a likeable character upon growing up, while one was once a pityful kid now is somewhat who has to be the antagonist of this anime- in a kind way that is, which adds interest to this part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\n This  maybe one anime that may end up hanged, but then again it is intresting to watch this 25 episode since it is a girl who is the main protagonist instead a boy, the plot may be ordinary but seeing her struggle and fail puts a premium on the overall of this anime. Unless there will be a season 2 we'll never know if this anime will have a climatic ending. There is a possiblity the author plans to squeez everything in one last epsiode, but I'm just guessing, so don't fuss about it.",

            "content": "I was drawn to this anime because it reminded me so much of Hikaru no Go.The game and characters of Chihafuru is so similar to Hikaru no GO.  Chihayafuru is about a game called Karuta. The rules of this game is that the players must memorize the 100 hundred poems- which are written in cards. Setting the cards face down in a certain pattern. When the match starts, the announcer reads a poem verse and the players must knock that card out. The main character Chihaya Ayase who meets Wataya Arata( Karata Master XD)  and is drawn in the world of Karata andwants to get the title of Queen so she can play Karata with Arata. Masami Taichi( friend of Chihaya) also plays Karata. Later in her high school year, she meets her close friend Masami Taichi again and they start a Karata club.  Hikaru no Go fans will  love this show!!!",

            "content": "WARNING: May contain itty-bitty spoilers.  :)  But it won't ruin your judgement on the anime.  I'll be back in a couple more weeks to edit this review as I watch more and more episodes.\r\n    As of October 22nd, 2011, I have only watched three episodes of Chihayafuru, but so far, it has shown amazing promise.  Already I am so emotionally tied to this series that I almost, ALMOST shed some tears.  But boy did my eyes did get watery.\r\n    The story starts out with the protagonist, Chihaya, a beautiful girl.  You quicklylearn Chiyaha isn't quite what you'd expect a beautiful girl to act like - you know, poised, graceful, & calm and collecting and all.  Instead, she's clumsy, boyish, and very innocent.  I think this is what makes you love her so.  Chihaya stands out in both her looks and the way she acts.  I know you guys - and don't deny it - we all hate those popular, mean & pretty girls who don't give you a second look.  But Chihaya is different.  Despite her appearance, she is honest, and does what she believes is right.\\n\\n\r\n    Beginning from the last half of the first episodes to the 3rd episode, we go into Chihaya's past (if I am correct, I believe back into junior high).  She is friends with a boy named Taichi, who seems to have been a big influence in the class.  Anyways, in the class is a quiet boy called Arata.  Chihaya, seeing he is being bullied by Taichi and her classmates, stands up for Arata at the cost of her classmates ignoring her.\\n\\n\r\n    From Arata, she learns the passion and art of karuta.  In case you don't know what karuta is, to put it simply, you must find the card when the line from a poem is being read before your opponent does.  It sounds boring when I try explaining it to you, but you'll get it when you WATCH, WATCH, WATCH (!!) the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY [9]\\n\r\nI would give it a 10, but I need to see a few more episodes before I can confirm this.\\n\\n\r\nART [10]\\n\r\nIn case, I haven't said this yet, the art is AMAZING.  The only fault I find with it is when they're kids (in the flashback), the characters don't look as appealing as they do when they're in high school, thus shadowing on the beauty of the art.  The background scenes are leaning towards average, but the character art is very easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [7]\\n\r\nI haven't paid much attention to the music, but since nothing has stuck out to me, I'll give it a solid 7.  I might come back and edit this section after a couple more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER [9]\\n\r\nThe character development is great.  I think it's amazing how much I've gotten to know each of the characters already.  I look forward to watching them grow in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [9]\\n\r\nTruth be told, maybe 9 isn't really a fair judgement.  It should be a 10. But being a shoujo and romance addict, I have to give it the lower score of 9 because there is almost no, romance so far.  I can see tiny hints of it here and there though, and I'm hoping, hoping very badly that it might blossom into something else altogether as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [8.5]\\n\r\nThis might seem like a low score with all my praise about it up above, but I'm basing all of this on merely THREE episodes.  I have to keep my bar raised high since it is only the beginning and it could all spiral down from this point on as more episodes pass, so for now...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAu revoire,\\n\\n\\n\r\n               a.k.a ANIME&manga Addict -- Julie",

            "content": "Let's be honest: I'm not really a fan of sports anime. Or anything that revolves around sports. More to the point, I'm just not a very competitive person, physically. Give me an essay topic and I'll try my darn hardest to prove I can write better than my opponent. Give me some math questions, and I'll melt my brain from the stress of making sure I don't make a single error. When it comes to brain games, I am a perfectionist. But the moment I felt pressured to be better than my fellow ballet classmates, my inspiration and desire to go further trickled away andvanished. The moment I understood that my tae kwon do classes weren't just for recreation, they were for competing with my other colleagues, I just completely lost interest. It is not my forte, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. That's why I so very much wanted Chihayafuru to prove me wrong \u2013 to show me that sports anime can be just as good and captivating as any other despite my lack of interest in the subject. The show certainly started off with a bang. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Chihaya, is in high school. A meeting with a former elementary school classmate of hers prompts a flashback that extends across several episodes, detailing her previous history with this classmate and, more specifically, the start of Chihaya's passion for an unusual sport \u2013 karuta. Karuta not only requires physical prowess, it also requires you to use your brain, constantly: the basis of the game is the memorization of one hundred poems. Only fifty of these are used in any one game. The cards that are used by the players in karuta contain the second verse of the poem. To put it in a nutshell, a reader recites the first verse of a particular poem. You grab the card that has the second verse of that poem. It sounds simple, and in a way it is, but it takes a lot of training to become good at karuta. \\n\\n\r\nI suppose you can guess why even I wondered if I would want to play karuta \u2013 the mental aspect interested me. Not only that, but I was taken in by the way the anime showcased Chihaya's love for karuta. In addition, I also liked that it touched upon different forms of love for the same hobby and passion: one of Chihaya's high school classmates is a girl named Kanade, who adores karuta, not because she is particularly competitive, but because she likes the poems, and the history and meaning behind each and every one. The variety and carefulness with which the anime presented its theme held my attention. I definitely found myself liking the characters, and by episode eight, I found myself cheering them on. Even the card game matches were exciting. I was nervous, hoping one of the main characters would win, hoping that things would go well.\\n\\n\r\nBut things started going downhill when I realized that, by episode twenty, I knew pretty much nothing about any of the characters. Let\u2019s start off with Chihaya, the titular main character. She is obsessed with karuta. Part of this is arguably because it was the first hobby she actually started to like. As a child, her only dream was to see her older sister become a famous model, but a chance meeting in elementary school with a boy named Arata sparked her passion. Seeing how good Arata was, Chihaya wanted to be as good as him, perhaps even surpass him. Arata himself is a bit of a mixed bag. He is characterized as a stoic young man who has a similar passion for karuta, although he hasn\u2019t been playing as much as he used to due to a tragedy in his family. Taichi is Chihaya\u2019s childhood friend, and in elementary school, he used to bully Arata, but has since then formed a grudging respect for him. Then there is Kanade, a female classmate Chihaya and Taichi meet in high school, along with Nishida. I\u2019ve already mentioned Kanade, and Nishida is an overweight boy who, similar to Chihaya and Arata, has a love for karuta.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut senpai, you told me so much about those characters!\u201d Yes, but did you notice that I didn\u2019t include much of their personality traits? That is because they don\u2019t have a lot. They feel bland and, ultimately, uninteresting, which is a huge problem in an anime that is more character-driven than plot-driven. The anime definitely does not spend much time fleshing out its characters. Some interesting sub-plots that were brought up at first \u2013 such as Chihaya\u2019s awkwardness and inability to talk to her parents about her hobby \u2013 are ultimately cast aside later on as if they never existed. I would have liked to see Chihaya opening up about her passion, especially since she is supposedly so good at karuta and is progressing in all these championships and matches. What do her parents feel about her going on so many trips to play karuta? What about her sister? We\u2019re not privy to any of that. Similarly, we don\u2019t know anything about Taichi or Nishida\u2019s familial life. Arata seems to live on his own, and the only thing we know about Kanade is that her mother supports her, if only because she is present at some of the karuta matches later on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is more, is that the love plot feels artificial. Watching the first episode, you can probably guess pretty quickly that Taichi has a crush on Chihaya. That actually develops a bit throughout the series, since by the last couple episodes, Taichi admits this to himself. Chihaya, on the other hand, has a long-standing crush on Arata. The problem is that there doesn\u2019t seem much of a reason for her to have this crush. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m all for unrequited romances, and to some extent I can sort of understand her idealization of Arata. But, it sort of loses steam when she emails him and texts him, and he never replies. Not even when he actually sees the emails. There is one scene where he asks Taichi to give Chihaya his cell phone number, to which Taichi responds that he should do it himself. But we don\u2019t know anything about what happens after that scene. We don\u2019t know how Chihaya got Arata\u2019s phone number. The scene just sort of ends and progresses on to the next one. To put it simply, Arata shows pretty much zero signs of being interested in Chihaya. In fact, he has a closer relationship with Taichi than anything else. I\u2019m honestly guessing that the second season will reveal that he has a crush on him.\\n\\n\r\nBack to karuta, though, since that is the main shtick of this anime: the matches, at first, are interesting. However, later on, they get rather repetitive and predictable. You could argue that in a game consisting of two players battling one another, there are only two possible outcomes, but you could still make it more interesting. Chihaya is supposed to be a good player, but she is always so amazed and taken aback by her opponents that I wonder where all these good players were. Why were they hiding in the woodwork? Taichi\u2019s matches were overall more interesting than Chihaya, mainly because he tends to keep his cool and focus on the match, unlike the main female protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I take contention with is that Chihaya is in group A, the rank that composes the best players in karuta. We are told early on that it is very difficult to get into group A. Chihaya then gets into group A. She must be a really good player, right? Maybe, but we don\u2019t see much of it. She commits so many faults, makes so many mistakes, and loses so many rank A matches that I find it hard to believe she could even obtain A rank in the first place. Maybe the point is to show that she is talented at karuta. That is fine and dandy, but if you tell me a character is good at karuta and then show them being completely flabbergasted later on, you are not doing a very good job of convincing me that they are worthy of being in the group with the best players. Taichi and Nishida are far more believable A rank material.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the thing I liked the most about Chihayafuru is its focus on different ways you can enjoy karuta, and finding your own reasons to be passionate about it. These aspects are applied to karuta, and other sports by extension, but they certainly don't need to be. They can also apply to a whole lot of other things, such as hobbies, school, and, really, anything else you need or want to focus on. That was something I thought was really interesting, and it was a nice theme throughout the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru\u2019s OST is nothing to really write home about; it\u2019s there, and it works when it needs to, but I didn\u2019t find myself looking up the soundtrack to listen to them again. The opening theme is YOUTHFUL, performed by 99RadioService; like the band name, it\u2019s a serviceable OP, but not completely my cup of tea. I liked the ending theme a lot more \u2013 a song called Soshite Ima by Asami Seto. The seiyuu for the most part do a good job. I couldn\u2019t really discern any voices I liked in particular, although I certainly recognized some of the voice actors and actresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is really where the show shines; Madhouse always does a good job, and Chihayafuru is no exception. The colours are bright, the character designs are very likable, and the animation is fluid. There are occasions where CGI is used, but it is never jarring or distracting, and fits in well for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chihayafuru starts out very well, but ultimately loses steam in the long run. I can\u2019t say whether or not it\u2019s a good sports anime as a whole, since I don\u2019t watch many at all, but I certainly enjoyed it as long as it managed to be engaging for me. In the end, I\u2019m not certain I would recommend it to those who want to try the genre out, so I\u2019ll leave that to people more knowledgeable in other sports-oriented titles. It was good while it lasted and would have definitely benefited from tighter and more consistent storytelling, in my opinion.",

            "content": "In their darkest hour, when everybody else was dead and have become distant memories, 3 normal kids take it upon themselves to play a card game to determine the future of mankind....Or who will bear the right to bone the blond chick before she turns old and ugly.\r\nThis pretty much is what i have to say so bye now...Or not?\r\nYou see Chihayafuru is a very strange case and i don't think that as time passes and i let what i watched sink in even more is gonna help all that much. Let me explain what i'm on about. I finished this anime 6 days ago.As i was watching it i kept some notes to remind myself what my thoughts were cause i'm odd and old and my erections are chemically fueled.. No actually i'm lying but you should have seen the expression on your bloody faces.\\n\\n\r\nErections apart i was confused by how they managed to make an anime about a card game and make it seem like you were watching porn for the first time..Exciting, messy, with animal sounds(if you're into that stuff), with heavy breathing and a bloody white mess to finish it off.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is part of the story and speaking of which i just realised i started this review all wrong and haven't talked about what Chi is all about. Like i said i'm old and i have the attention span of a fetus.\\n\\n\r\nThe story then,is about a girl Ayase Chihaya who spent a chunk of her childhood chasing after her successful sister's dreams,never to have her own. That changes when she meets the four eyed stud by the name of Wataya Arata, who not only is a stud but also finds a perversive satisfaction teaching her the ways of tantric sex...Yeah fucking right,he teaches her about a card game, karuta. And our little Chihaya was entranced. But in order to take the hard journey of pursuing dreams they had to find a 3rd person to join the party.. Mashima Taichi would be known forevermore as the third wheel and a stepping stone to achieve her dream of becoming the world\u2019s best karuta player and jump Arata. After that some shit goes down, they get separated from Arata and enough cause the force of spoiling is strong with this one. Only thing i will say though is that the scenes where they were kids felt very much natural, their dialogues their interactions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you might be wondering-as did i at first-what the hell does this card game have that is so interesting..To achieve the ultimate knowledge you have to resort to Google and find out more about karuta, which is very much unknown to us westerners..I mean i only play some poker from time to time and that's my relationship with card games..Oh and i watched some Yu-gi-oh eps..So not an expert on this one. Anywho, as it turns out, the card game karuta in is nothing like Yu-gi-oh and it's definitely not something that springs to mind easily when talking competitive card games. And as i'm not a fluent lad i will describe it to the best of my ability..Ok, ready?...........Sitting down?...............Ok here it goes...Hit the card with your hand before your opponent does..Sounds simple? Well that's were most people get it wrong..And since i'm not able to fully explain all the workings of the game, you have to watch it to understand what it's all about..That's the magic of coming to learn of something new.\\n\\n\r\nKaruta as card games go, or even sports for that matter, is as fascinating as it is unusual. It's really second to none. From swipe techniques to card layout and prioritisation to mental challenges, it's all there..That said i cannot sit here and tell you that all is well cause you can only go too far with this premise, or at least for me the matches were becoming stale after a while..It's like Chihayafuru found a spot that could sit comfortably and sat there for the rest of the way.\\n\\n\r\nBut Chihayafuru to make up for it also combines this game with some drama and with each characters hopes and desires and it does it in such a simple way that makes this a very easily digestable watch for most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't always work though, as the characters tend to get very emotional and cry over the smallest things possible. And that would be fine and understandable if they lose a match they poured their soul into but crying over a pencil that broke? Ok that didn't happen actually but you get the idea..If not there's a word that will help you out.. Overdramatisation.. And that always rubs me off in a bad way.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are another thing that caught me off guard along with the precise use of music.The animation is colorful and vibrant and the characters are just stunning. The music is comprised of orchestral pieces strategically positioned for maximum attack.\\n\\n\r\nNow to sum it up cause my skeleton is not what it used to be, Chi is a perfect example of anime that doesn't have the need to resort to ridiculously grand plotlines or pseudo-intellectual fanfares to transfer what it wants to the viewer. The cast are as easy to understand and connect with, as are interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many complaints i didn't address and ones that held this anime back. Make no mistake this is a good anime but it's far from spectacular. A jack of all trades and master of some.. Should you watch it? Yeah why not..I mean compared to some overrated anime that come to mind this is by far superior and way more interesting and realistic. Am i talking rubbish? Maybe i'm mentally unstable and i might change my mind in a couple of mins.\\n",

            "content": "The sports genre is a genre that has certain clich\u00e9s that have been repeated again and again to the point that most anime fans unfortunately dismiss it as an overly repetitive, boring genre. I mean, think about it from the perspective of the common anime fan, why the hell would someone watch something that's basically the same thing, just a different sport/series? Also, the sports genre shares some of the same cliches from the shonen genre; the power of friendship overcoming it all, the team ultimately winning in the end, useless female characters who cheer for the main character and a hot-headed protagonist. I cango on and on but I'm pretty sure you get the point.\\n\\n\r\nFuse this with it's second core genre, the josei genre, which is a genre that suffers from various works using excessive melodrama on it's characters in an attempt to raise tension instead of focusing on building up excellent, well-written chemistry and what we ultimately have is a series that's treading on extremely questionable ground. It would take a lot of excellent writing and dedication for a series like this to work out, and most authors would simply give up to popular appeal for the sake of making sales.\\n\\n\r\nI'm proud to say that the creator of this series as well as the production staff behind keeps an excellent level of quality, making this an immensely enjoyable ride starting with:\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Chihayafuru is unfortunately fairly generic on paper. Seriously, think about it for a sec; girl is trying to make her childhood friend(s) play a sport they used to play as kids, which results in the love triangle forming and a drive to succeed and surpass each other and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nYet the story is presented in a refreshing way, as the story is well-paced and fleshed out from the karuta battles to the development of the characters to the amazing slice-of-life moments, which make this series in spite of it's generic premise standing out from the crowd and making watching this an exciting and rich experience, and very few moments in this series feel forced or rushed. The storytelling is craft-fully mastered, as the series never felt like it was info-dumping me or making me feel lost as to what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nSure, the premise and the somewhat slow but absolutely necessary beginning hinder just slightly what would've been a perfect score, but this is definitely a story I can recommend to just about anyone as the appeal is there for everyone regardless of age or gender.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork looks absolutely gorgeous and detailed, which greatly enhances the experience of watching this series as the karuta matches end up getting drawn with more detail and tension. Madhouse have done a terrific job bringing the series to life with amazing visuals that fit the mood of the series and adds even more tension and details to the amazing karuta matches.\\n\\n\r\nI don't care about art and visuals usually to write a bloody essay about it, but very pleasing to the eyes to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is excellently composed, and the tracks never feel out of place and always fit the mood of the show at the right time. The same can be said for the sound effects and the voice acting, as all the voice actors fit their respective roles and no one feels out of place. The sound effects during the karuta matches in particular stood out as being exceptional, and in contrast the slice-of-life moments of the series are filled with calm, soothing music, which help add to the amazing atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nA main flaw however, is that the tracks on their own are not as fun to listen and lack hearing value outside of the series. But these are minor nitpicks to an otherwise excellent soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are all wonderfully developed with excellent personalities and love-able traits which make all of them endearing and hard, if not downright impossible to hate. The side characters and the various rivals the main characters face are far from shallow, as they all possess interesting traits which make all of them interesting and endearing characters with fun and diverse personalities. The characters are all entertaining and I don't think there was a single character that I disliked in any way shape or form, due to the fact that whatever drama this series had was carefully executed and didn't ruin the careful writing and attention to detail that the author put into their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters while well-executed, still fall into certain tropes, which isn't really a problem as I wouldn't have really cared with other series but with a series as well-done as this these flaws are made only more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is an excellent anime that plays along with tropes of the sports and josei genres; unfortunately it doesn't avoid certain tropes that both genres have; however, I still highly recommend it to people due to it being one of the most carefully paced series I've ever watched. Don't ignore this series just because of it's genre classifications, as this series is a fantastic watch that you do not want to miss out on.",

            "content": "First review! \r\nChihayaFuru is the first verse in a poem written as\r\n\"Impassionate gods have never seen the red that is Tatsuta River\" (rough translation) that happens to be one of the hundred poems used in karuta, a japanese card game.\r\nKaruta, like I said, is a Japanese card game. It's tricky and both mind and body should work with rhythm. Yes, it is a sport, though you shouldn't erase the fact that it is poetry (-Kana-chan). Not many understand it, and it's not like it will get any famous in other countries; so if you become the best in Japan, you'll be the best in theworld. \\n\\n\r\nSo here comes a girl who just met her passion and dream to become the best female karuta player--Chihaya Ayase; Pretty yet sometimes an airhead and acts ungraceful. At first she followed the lead of his friend Arata Wataya, after years she realize she should take a shot on being the best along with Taichi Mashima.\\n\\n\r\nTHE REVIEW PROPER:\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is unexpectedly a very nice dose of Romance, Literature, and Sports. I've never encountered an anime that have those wrapped in one, more like filling up my interests. I really like how some cards' meaning are revealed (almost) each episode, mostly glowing with love. Sorry, I'm a literature fa(g)n and I really really admire how the author mixed thrill and romance with poetry well. \\n\\n\r\nIn every tournament, or even just practice featured in the show is exciting, you're dying to know who would win! Their perspiration makes me sweat too, only means that \"this episode's a good show!\". Most of the time. \\n\r\n Let's get going in the other side. The love story.\\n\\n\r\nIn most part at the beginning (child flashback) you could notice it's themed \"Ai no Tame ni\" Eh lol I mean, For Love's sake. -I wouldn't like to spoil the story-\\n\r\nAhh, the blooming love of youth! (why do I sound like a grandma)\\n\r\nIt's really moving, I mean the love plot, sweet and not (so) cliche. \\n\r\n...(I actually feel the jealousy of *toot* if I'm in his shoes sometimes)\\n\\n\r\nThe lesson, or morals.. they're bunch of them! 'Determination; is always present at this type of stories, but it never gets old. 'Find your OWN dream' is what I liked the most. There are many people in this world that are lost, and are in need to find themselves to hold on to something--a goal to achieve; a dream to reach. Oh, I just said the two keywords on the next moral, reaching dreams. It's always significant in one of us. Nah silly, I'm being gay. (wait I'm a girl) \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the techincal(?) part, wtf. \\n\r\nArt: SUPERB! From the smooth background to animation, I can say nothing else. (and yeah the way they draw characters is awesome)\\n\r\nCharacter: What can I say? Chihaya is indeed a nice name! The characters' status, plus the characteristic, together they could be a super group! filling up the flaws of each othaaar. \\n\r\nSound: Appropriate enough.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: HELL YEAH! ...except when the battle gets intense and I dunno what they are doing already.. and taichi's analysis kills me x.x\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor people who have read this, and had their impressions, give this anime a chance, it's really great and cliches are nowhere to be found, it's not 100% love thinggies but romance here is really moving. I have yet to watch the last three episodes but look at me; I'm dying to watch more. \\n\\n\r\nThank you and have a gooood time in Chihayafuru!~\\n",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.\r\nSo my problem with Chihayafuru is that I really couldn't invest any interest in the card game at hand. Let me explain. First of all it isn't a card game, but  instead it is a reaction game. The game is simple to understand. You have some cards, 100 in a deck, which you place in any order you want inyour territory, territory which basically is, quoting Wikipedia, the space in front of the player, 87 cm wide and separated from their opponent's cards by 3 cm. Once a player has no more cards in their territory, they've won. After you've arranged the cards you're given 15 minutes to learn the arbitrary positions you've given them, then the game starts. Each card has written on them a poem that origins from some old japanese poem collection. The players have to basically pick a card each time they hear a poem they recognize. A person will read off a bunch of poems, starting with some not written on the cards themselves to get the players accustomed to the reader's voice. And then they go on and pick what card they hear. There are certain penalties that result in moving cards from your territory to the opponent's and viceversa in case you do something, but I don't really know them and merely read about them, but that's okay, this is pretty much the detail the anime has given on the game >so far<. \\n\\n\r\nSo my problem here is simple. The anime didn't display any strategic part of this game and merely made it seem like a game of match two, where you basically you pick two things that are the same as fast as you can react. From what I've read off about competitive karuta, there are certain penalties if you rush and react too fast and in an unfavorable position, penalties which at least make you have some prior planning of how you're gonna tackle a situation. But the way the anime displays it is merely a reaction game. When I think of a card game I think of one of either two things. A) A game where you basically form a deck strategically to combat certain types of opponents but the results are generally gonna be obvious and luck will be generally minimal, only displaying the complexity of the game itself and your sense of predicting your enemies. B) Different situations that stem off due to different chance of draws where you have to think strategically and have to adapt to the situation at hand and have some sort of in the moment planning to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nNeither are Karuta as displayed in the anime. It is all fast reaction time. And most explanations on the game are there to give a relative, rather than essential, understanding of the situation. Don't get me wrong, the game is displayed accurately and what happens is indeed accurate to competitive karuta. As far as the matches and the actions go, it is accurate. But it is really poorly explained. There are a lot of details that I understood with a very simple explanation upon a google search that the anime just didn't really bother going into explaining properly. As the anime displays it, all you have to do to succeed in Karuta, is react faster than your opponent, always. Which in truth isn't necesarily the case, since you have to know if it's worth risking a penalty if you go for x instead of trying to stay safe. So bottom line, you're gonna watch people reacting as fast as they can without the thought behind what they've done. Which sucks, because you enjoy things all the way more when you can understand what's happening. I mean, even with the penalties and what not, it is still gonna be a game of who reacts faster, but at least show the depth of the game...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if the series does not focus on Karuta the card game, on what does the series focus? On the passion of every character for the game. Which quite frankly it does do well and the story itself is mostly about having the determination to follow up on doing something you enjoy and trying your best to improve and enjoy it with other people. The motivation behind the characters is understandable and even enjoyable to an extent, and that extent is the characters having some reason to cry once every episode... I'm not 100% sure if in the first episode any tear is shed, but I'm really sure in each episode after the first, someone or a multitude of characters will have to cry. And I could accept that if that only happened while they were children (the series will start with a flashback about the main character's childhood) because I mean at that age, you tend to get emotional and what not, but then you have a girl cry while saying \"I like kimono...\" and then you're like fuck off. \\n\\n\r\nAnd although the motivation of the characters is well explained... well... first of all the main characters are a group of 2 boys, 1 girl, one boy, quiet and reserved, the other, brash and outspoken and a girl that is clutzy and somewhat aggresive. Spruce it up with a love triangle and you've already given my enjoyment terminal cancer. Coupled with what I already said about  the whole, cry at least once per episode thing, add in some other things that are spoilers that seem like poor and cliche demotivators to stop someone from doing something they dedicated their life to, obvious right off the start too and... I wasn't gonna enjoy this right from the start, was I? You see the 2 boys, 1 girl group is what I used to call a shounen tri-fecta, so imagine my surprise when I found that in a josei of all things. I'll need a new name for this type of group of characters. At least I ain't misinformed anymore.\\n\\n\r\nI might be a little unfair since the overall setting doesn't have them in a group and as they grew up they... some of them... ok, one of them really considering a spoiler, has changed. But that character's route is also quite obvious from the start too so... For me I don't really have anything left to go on with on the character route. The game doesn't entice me, the story while its theme is interesting and somewhat well executed, it does depends on its characters, which are pretty much the same archetypes I've encountered for years... What do I have left? The art style which I can at best describe as feminine? The sound which is used to complement the characters' I already dislike mood and japanese poems I never really cared for?\\n\\n\r\nTo put it quite frankly, if the roadblocks I have had had set for me aren't really roadblocks for you, you will most likely be able to enjoy this anime. If you don't mind the characters being somewhat cliche and having merely a relative understanding of what's going, the theme of dedication to something you like will only come off as really strong for you. But with all these hurdles I had mentioned I couldn't enjoy this series. If the game does sound somewhat interesting you could give this series a try because that gives it all the more strength to what it's trying to do. However if you dislike tropey characters and the game sounds uninteresting, I don't think you have a lot to go on, frankly, since those are integral parts of the theme. I hope the  game's depth is better explained if you do decide to head deeper than me into it, but the characters themselves are nothing new that you can't predict.",

            "content": "\u201cI hope they will fall in love with karuta. The way we did...\u201d - Ayase Chihaya\r\nAt face value, I don\u2019t think I would have ever watched Chihayafuru. Revolving around a card game, karuta, and being a sports anime, the show naturally checked off two boxes that I try to avoid. Sparked by the novel curiosity of how a foreign sport could be brought to life by animation, I ended up watching the anime. It was one of the best whimsical decisions I\u2019ve made, as my prejudice could not have been any more wrong \u2013 I loved this anime. Chihayafuru is an anime that revolves arounda simple premise that has been explored many times in the sports genre: friendship through sports. The viewer is introduced to Ayase Chihaya and her dream to reunite with her childhood friend, Wataya Arata, through karuta. She attempts to start a club at her high school, Miyuzawa High School, in order to improve her skills for the day she meets Arata again. While the story does not seem very sophisticated and the production values will not steal the show, Chihayafuru truly captures the ideals of the word \u2018sport\u2019 through its themes and diverse cast of characters introduced in the world of karuta.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe more I learn about competitive karuta, the more magical it seems. Gender doesn\u2019t matter. Size doesn\u2019t matter. Intelligence and strength don\u2019t matter. Age doesn\u2019t matter. Every poem sends you back a thousand years. How many sports are capable of such a feat?\u201d - Miyauchi-sensei\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is easy to brush off Chihayafuru as just another sports anime, albeit being centered on some strange card game masquerading as a sport. Karuta is what separates Chihayafuru from the other shows in its genre \u2013 a sport where age, gender, athleticism, and intellectual capacity do not matter. Despite being a mentally and physically taxing game, relying heavily on memory and reflexes, Chihayafuru makes it clear that anyone can be an \u2018athlete\u2019. Unlike many sports anime where muscular high school boys charge up and down the playing court, Chihayafuru is a breath of fresh air. Through the experiences of Chihaya, a rarity as a female protagonist in a sports anime, the viewer will be introduced to a diverse cast of characters. One will be able to watch matches between young and old, male and female, bookish and athletic, and more. Many athletes have been humbled by an older, but fundamentally sound player at their local YMCA or park. Similarly, in Chihayafuru, intellectual players tactically dissect an opponent and mature players use their superior game sense to overcome their adversary. Chihayafuru is a shout-out to all athletes: sports do not discriminate and there is no right or wrong way to play, as each individual can play at their own pace.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s something you can\u2019t know until you\u2019ve tried it. And you still won\u2019t understand after you play. I\u2019ve been playing for 45 years and I still don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve never been able to figure it out. That\u2019s why I keep playing.\u201d - Harada-sensei\\n\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru\u2019s strength lies in its aforementioned diverse cast of characters. Every member of Miyuzawa High School\u2019s karuta club is unique, allowing Chihayafuru to lend various perspectives on the world of sport and why we play them. Sports are a funny thing, as they\u2019re often something that is unwillingly forced onto children by parents. In Chihaya\u2019s case, she begins playing karuta to further her relationship with Arata. Friendships come and go and so do these games that bond us together. Chihaya, however, is ultimately captured by a love for the game and continues to play, even when nobody around her does. That is the beauty of the word \u2018sport\u2019. Everyone has their own situation that leads them to playing, however that often gives way to a deeper connection to the game itself. The other members of Miyuzawa\u2019s karuta club are no different. For example, Taichi initially plays to be close to the girl he has feelings for, but the game quickly becomes an outlet for his desire to overcome his cowardice and to accept himself for who he is. Ultimately, the viewer watches these new players laugh and cry with each triumph and loss, as they experience the highs and lows of karuta. It is often hard to pinpoint a moment where you can say you fell in love with a sport. Love just happens and the charming character development in Chihayafuru captures this perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cInstead of a genius, I would rather have our new member be someone who puts in effort on the mat.\u201d -- Mashima Taichi\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlaying sports is a scary thing. Exposed against an opponent, stepping on to the playing surface is an act of bravery \u2013 an admission of one\u2019s weaknesses and an acceptance of one\u2019s shortcomings. For many players, support is necessary for them to thrive in a sporting environment. Chihayafuru demonstrates this, mostly focusing on the team aspect of karuta. Miyuzawa\u2019s karuta club highlights the importance of leadership, communication, and understanding of teammates, showing that technical skill is not enough to succeed in sports. Harada-sensei says it best: \u201cYou must trust in your teammates while playing by yourself\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, few anime foster such an infectious feeling of solidarity and friendship as Chihayafuru. Each member of Miyuzawa\u2019s karuta club is unique, which allows for moments of compassion and teamwork to truly strike home. A moment of camaraderie between Taichi and Tsutomu is truly poignant in my memory. Tsutomu, who has joined the club in hopes of surpassing Taichi at some discipline, has come to the realization that there is more to karuta than he expected. His teammates crush him in practice and a sense of inferiority sets in. Taichi recognizes this conflict and relates with Komano, telling him that he has no talent for karuta either, yet continues to play through all his losses as winning after putting in blood, sweat, and tears is the greatest satisfaction.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou have to do the things you don\u2019t want to do, before you can do the things you truly want to do.\u201d -Komano Tsutomu\\n\\n\\n\r\nJust like the quote above suggests, the most important thing is to not skip over the fundamentals. To run, you must first be able to walk and Chihayafuru puts in the legwork necessary for its characters to shine. The plot is simplistic, without many plot-twists, yet it elegantly sails through the task of explaining karuta and the culture around karuta. The tempo of Chihayafuru is quick, flowing from game to game, allowing for many characters to be introduced and developed. The matches themselves are masterfully planned out, focusing heavily on both the players\u2019 internal dialogue and game analysis while never compromising the tense and passionate atmosphere of the sport itself. Don\u2019t let this fool you though, there are funny and cute moments to be found in this anime. While there is intermittent melodrama and jarring humour, the result is a captivating, but easy to follow, storyline with characters that are truly loveable.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cA woman must always move with grace, whether you\u2019re wiping a table or drying sheets. Or in the fight of your life.\u201d - Oe Kanade\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production values, Chihayafuru looks fantastic. The animation of the cards flying off the tatami mats is incredibly fluid and the artists do a fantastic job depicting the various backgrounds using soft, bright colours. The animators don\u2019t just bring the karuta gameplay to life, but also the rich culture that characterizes the sport. From the hakama that the Miyuzawa karuta club wear to the visual imagery after a poem is recited, Chihayafuru truly succeeds in evoking a sense that karuta\u2019s history has transcended its time, sending the viewer back a thousand years with every poem. If there is a visual nitpick, then it is the character designs. While there are various unique character models, many have very large eyes and long eyelashes \u2013 potentially a little distracting for some viewers. It should be noted, however, that the anime adaptation looks very much like the manga and deserves praise for capturing the visuals so faithfully.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding sound, Chihayafuru\u2019s voice acting does its job. There aren\u2019t many voices that stand out, but in that way the voice actors have done their jobs \u2013 each voice fits their character. Asami Seto impressed me a lot, bringing out the innocent and headstrong passion that characterizes Chihaya so well. It really made the difference to me personally, as Chihaya is one of the most unique and charismatic female leads in anime. Furthermore, Chihayafuru has one of the best soundtracks I\u2019ve listened to. Starting with the opening theme, YOUTHFUL really captures the situation that Chihaya finds herself in \u2013 chasing after Arata. It is also one of my favourite opening themes out of any anime, being upbeat and catchy. Soshite Ima, the ending theme, similarly echoes Chihaya\u2019s hopes, but isn\u2019t as memorable. The real body of the musical score, however, is the collection of orchestral themes used throughout the anime. The track I enjoyed most was Team Chihayafuru. The song is light and uplifting, with the horns providing that innocent, but impassioned, feel of pursuing one\u2019s dreams. Aside from that track, the other orchestral pieces are able to evoke various emotions in the viewer, further enhancing the critical moments in the storyline.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAs long as we have karuta, we\u2019ll see each other again, won\u2019t we? As long as we keep playing, we\u2019ll see each other again.\u201d - Ayase Chihaya\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chihayafuru holds a special place in my heart. As a sports enthusiast and an athlete, I can\u2019t begin to explain how Chihayafuru is a refreshing anime that truly captures the competitive spirit of the genre. I strongly recommend this anime for, not just all fans of the sports genre, but for viewers who may not have seen much of it. The plot is not unique nor are its production values truly outstanding, but Chihayafuru does, however, provide a memorable cast of characters and a cleanly executed storyline. It is a simple anime, but an engaging one that is easy to become invested in. The second season is equally fantastic and the manga is still running, so now is a good time to get on-board. With the quote above in mind, I personally will keep waiting on Chihayafuru 3 \u2013 this franchise is a gem!",

            "content": "I had been wandering on the Internet to seek for a good anime. The truth is, sadly, anime is now losing its purity and attraction. A lot of shitty shows and fan-service series have been in progress more and more than before. The only improvement of anime in general is the enhanced stunning graphics and animation. Shows such as Guilty Crown, Tari Tari, Toaru Majutsu no Index, Sword Art Online\u2026 are examples of good animations but informative and forgettable scenarios. Fortunately, I have not given up yet on anime, another world within me, and continued on the finding of the next masterpiece.\r\n\u2026.. and I foundChihayafuru\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAh! I had seen the picture of this show before but ignored it due to its lack of attraction. But then I tried the first episode in the boring mood. At the end, I thought deeply: \u201cWhat kind of the show is that? I never know about the weird game called karuta.\u201d But omg, this game is so stunning and addictive even though I attempted to play it by myself using two standard decks of playing cards. However, at some point, I felt just a little bit of lame :)\\n\\n\r\nWhy does Chihaya Ayase and all other members of her club play karuta and spend time on it like it is their most priority in life? What is the point of doing something like benefit them on their future? Naaaaaaaa\u2026. it\u2019s so lame and childish. \u201cNO WAY, I am gonna drop this show and write my first negative review.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhat have I done? What am I even thinking? How can I say that?\u201d At that moment, I just realized that I am identified with all of them at some points.\\n\\n\r\nI was so desperately play piano with all my heart when I was 12 and then quit at the age of 15 due to lack of interest. Arata Wataya, same as me, dropped karuta and deeply regret later on. I don\u2019t know what will happen to me in the future but hey, if any of you ask me that what the most regrettable event in my life up until now, I won\u2019t hesitate to answer : \u201c5 years of my age, 15 to 20, dropped piano playing is the most deadly time in my life. I wish I could turn back time now\u201d Fuckly, give up something deep in our heart will redefine us as human being wandering in despair and regret.\\n\\n\r\nI ignored Ayase and felt lame for her karuta addiction. But wait a minute, I am the same as her: refuse to socialize with people and even delay one university class to spend all pastime alone to make up to that 5 years of no music practice. Same as Chihaya Ayase, I don\u2019t see any point of karuta for her and piano for me helping our future. Simply, karuta for her and piano for me may not be our dream anymore but become an utmost element to keep us enjoy life as human being.\\n\\n\r\nTsutomu Komano, an intelligent boy, ignore all thing like making friend, socializing to only focus on his study. I bet him he knows for sure that he\u2019s pathetic himself about everything except for his studied record. Fortunately, he was saved by other desire and fused with the flow of victory hunting, with the touch the card, with the word of poem\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWe all have rules, dreams, goals for ourselves. Surviving in our life without willpower may break our rules and dreams. As a result, we will become something unknown, we will wander in life with no desired goal. Definitely, we will just suddenly realize and regret  ourselves because in this wide despair of lives, we will encountered our true-selves in others who enjoying their dream.",

Stopped watching after ep6.\r\nThe directing.\r\nThe directing in this anime is awful. \r\nThe pacing is way too quick and everything is way too much dramatized. \r\nIf you take karuta away, all that is left is a bunch of characters that moves when the plot needs to move.\r\nOne of the characters has a very serious reason to have depression, but oh man, the way they handled it was just...brutal. Everything happened so quickly, he cured his depression waytoo quickly. \\n\\n\r\nI can imagine myself liking the source material of this way more, since the pacing would be way slower than how anime handled it.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenario itself has a lots of drama already, so it was quite brutal to see this happening. \\n\\n\r\nIf i will summary my biggest problem with this show; basically it doesn't care about its characters enough. It just says \"karuta is the best thing ever and the people who thinks thats not the case can go away from my life.\" AKA not realistic enough.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love sports anime and wanna see sprots but nothing else, you'll enjoy this.

            "content": "Everybody in life possesses a dream. To obtain this, people push themselves extensively. However, the process of striving to grasp his or her dream is never an easy feat. Due to this fact of reality, people make friends to ease the process. Unfortunately, things change, and friendships become hard to maintain. Nevertheless, the desire for one's dream remains and even merges with the desire of friendship or love. Our dreams cannot exist without our loved ones, but our dreams connect us to our loved ones.\r\nChihayafuru revolves around this and one more element\u2013karuta. Karuta is a Japanese cultural sport regarding poetry. A game consists of 2players. Each draws 25 cards from a pile of 100, each one containing the 2nd verse of a poem. The player is given time to place his or her cards and memorize his/her placement as well as his/her opponent's. The poems are then read one by one and the players must touch the second verse of the poem being read. When taking a card from the opponent's side, the player sends a card of his/her choice. The player that empties his/her side wins. By watching the anime, you will learn that this is a beautiful sport.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story is rather simple yet meaningful. As seen in the introduction of this review, it shows how ambition bridges relationships. Furthermore, the plot is relatable. Ayase Chihaya (the protagonist) and her friends don't always win nor constantly fail. The balance of triumph defeat is something anyone can relate to, in spite of it being about karuta. Moreover, the plot moves at a steady (but not too slow) pace with just a small quantity of fillers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nChihayafuru has beautiful and unique art, particularly for most of the important characters (Chihaya, Taichi, Arata, Shinobu, etc.). However, the other characters have eyes which are duplicates of one another. Nevertheless, the art is still nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening song of Chihayafuru (YOUTHFUL by 99RadioService) is wonderful in all aspects. The closing song (Soshite Ima) isn't as nice as YOUTHFUL, but it definitely suits the show. The karuta poems are also beautifully sung/read, much better than many readers in actual karuta games.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\r\nWhat makes Chihayafuru truly special are its characters. Each one has a story which we can relate to our own lives. Furthermore, the relationships between these characters feel so real that one would literally run across a room screaming over.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nChihayafuru is one of the most enjoyable anime out there. It has hilarious jokes but gets serious when necessary. Cute romantic moments perfect to fangirl over happen often as well. Especially during the suspenseful karuta matches, one would feel desperate to watch nonstop. It is certainly a show that engages the viewer well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a wonderful anime. It is certainly a rare gem that blows one's heart and one's mind away. It is one of the best anime out there.",

The relationships between characters and the characters themselves are some of the sweetest I've seen yet, and I can't wait to get started on the second season to see their personalities develop further.\r\nI started watching this anime on a whim one afternoon, not quite sure what to expect.

Four hours of sleep later, the laptop goes back on and the episode-watching continues.\\n\\n\r\nYou've probably wondered, judging from the summary, just how much enjoyment can be gained from an anime completely centered around some old card game. Let me assure you that there's plenty of enjoyment in store!\\n\\n\r\nFor those who know their anime jargon, I'd describe this anime as having a heavy josei influence (I'm trying to make my mom watch it, grr) with enough relationships and personality to earn a shoujo label.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime worthy of making its way onto your lists!

            "content": "Chihayafuru is, on the surface, a Josei anime about an obscure Japanese card game called Karuta. However, it would be a disservice to the anime to simply describe Chihayafuru in that way to anyone. It is so much more. \r\nMost if not all of those who watch Chihayafuru will have no idea what the heck Karuta is, even Japanese viewers! Yet, Chihayafuru makes it known right from the start that this will not be a roadblock to our enjoyment. In fact, the centralization around a niche game is precisely what makes Chihayafuru so captivating. Through the competitive nature of Karuta and the degree at whichthe characters compete, we as viewers cannot help but become interested. Chihayafuru does a splendid job at portraying Karuta to be just as exciting as, if not more exciting than mainstream sports. It has the one crucial element: its mechanics are easy to understand, but the room for improvement is vast. There truly is more than meets the eye with Karuta (and symbolically, Chihayafuru as an anime). How could a game that has gone completely under your radar, be so profoundly enthralling?\\n\\n\r\nThat very thought is shared throughout every single last character. You don't realize it in the beginning, but your own growing interest in Karuta is mirrored by that of the characters. Chihaya, the heroine, is initially aware that Karuta exists but has never bothered to think of it as more than a casual card game. Then comes Arata, aspiring Meijin (\"Master\") of Karuta. He shows Chihaya, as well as us, just how many tiers there are to Karuta; it truly is no casual game. The better the players, the faster the game is played and the less mistakes are made. It's truly captivating to watch Arata, whose life passion is to become the Meijin, be so super good at something. Chihaya felt the same way from watching him, and upon entering high school, she made it her mission to share her love for Karuta with others, as Arata had done for her.\\n\\n\r\nHer Karuta club did not set sail without bumps. Initially, it was hard to convince even her closest friend Mashima to join the club. However, every time they played, a thought like \"Why is she trying so hard?,\" or \"What's keeping me from beating her?\" would pop into his head. Mashima finally joins the club, seeking the answers to those questions. Perhaps this is Chihayafuru's defining quality. It shows that your interest in something can grow just out of a want to get better at something or be passionate about something. As long as there's something in life that makes you go, it really doesn't matter what it is. Karuta was this spark in Mashima's life; something to which he could devote himself. The subsequent members were just as reluctant to join, to say the least, but like Mashima, could not help but wonder, once they joined, what it was about Karuta that was so exciting.\\n\\n\r\nAs the Karuta club worked together as a team by practicing together and participating in tournaments, we see the core theme of hard work being explored. Nobody gave this incipient team from Miyazawa High School a chance; they did not have enough \"talent.\" Indeed, most of the club members were not Karuta players since childhood; and yet, that's exactly the element that allowed their hard work to truly shine. Working tirelessly every day to perfect their skills, everyone from Ayase down to Kana made great strides. They were even able to upset another high school in a tournament, before losing in a later round. Their first big win in tournament was a defining moment in Chihayafuru; it proved that hard work and dedication can achieve greatness. Life is not about talent. It is about passion. \\n\\n\r\nOne aspect of Chihayafuru that deserves particular mention is its soundtrack. The OSTs cover a wide array of emotion, spanning from triumph to failure, from sadness to ecstasy, from cheerfulness to seriousness. Chihayafuru truly is an emotional ride at times, and the soundtrack does wonders in reciprocating the characters' emotions to us. The opening and ending are done masterfully; every episode is sandwiched by a happy opening and a sad ending. This juxtaposition perhaps represents Karuta itself; though people like Ayase play it because of how fun it is, the game could also bring pain through losing. It is this mix of emotion Karuta possesses, so thoroughly represented by the soundtrack, that is what makes it and Chihayafuru wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to avid watchers of anime, one may be concerned about the \"sports drama\" aspect of the anime. Thankfully, one does not have to worry about this with Chihayafuru. Though cards fly around and actions are sometimes rendered in slow-motion, the most important aspect of the matches are actually done accurately: the players' speed. Seriously, professional Karuta players really DO take cards that quickly (look on YouTube). I was shocked to find that the anime did not dramatize the speed. Knowing that this realistic element of Karuta was portrayed faithfully made Chihayafuru have an authentic feel to it, which makes its messages and themes all the more impactful.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is about developing a passion, perseverance in the face of failure, and the inevitable rewards of hard work. If the thought of Josei and \"some card game called Karuta\" turn you off from watching Chihayafuru, don't let it. You'll be pleasantly surprised; Chihayafuru has a meaningful story to tell, and it does it in a way you didn't even know you would enjoy.  When watching Chihayafuru, you just won't be able to help but smile.",

But my sister, horrified at what I had done, nagged me to watch it to no end until I finally got off my reluctant butt to watch it.\r\nAnd what a lovely surprise I got. \r\nChihayafuru is an incredible anime that I regret not seeing sooner. Especially since I had low expectations coming into it, I was swept off my feet within the first several episodes. \r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story revolves around a girl named Chihaya Ayase, a beautiful tomboywho is obsessed with karuta, a Japanese traditional card game. Through karuta, she makes all sorts of friends and even creates a club, all the while striving to reach her ultimate goal: to become the best female karuta player and receive the title of \"Queen\". Meanwhile, Mashima Taichi and Wataya Arata, Chihaya's two closest childhood friends, struggle with their feelings for her as they play karuta as well. (Yes, there IS some romance. While MyAnimeList does not mark it as such, it is not deprived of romance. So for you rom/com people out there, this is a possibility.)\\n\r\nI'll admit this story is somewhat lackluster at a glance. Heck, I thought this sounded suspiciously like Yu-gi-oh when I read the story. But words cannot do the story justice as the anime delivers its story excellently, with both clean pacing and clear direction. Despite its seemingly lackluster plot, it is enrapturing the whole ride to the end. \\n\r\nDon't be turned off by the fact its about a card game. It's a lot more complex than it sounds, and surprisingly fun to get into. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThis is probably the best part of the anime that I will remember for a long time. There are multiple emotional moments scattered throughout the anime and are surprisingly moving. But Chihayafuru's simply amazing soundtrack is enough to bring me to tears whenever it came on. Whether it be when an intense match was reaching its climax or someone was having an emotional breakdown, the music simply blew me away and every time I could feel tears glaze my eyes. The music is reason enough for someone to watch Chihayafuru. Simply amazing. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nCharacters in the anime were all definitely lovable in their own way. All of them had their good sides, bad sides, and their own unique strategies when playing karuta. Watching each playing style was far more interesting than expected, especially when two completely different playing styles clashed. The protagonists were likable enough, but Chihaya's obliviousness to many people's feelings around her were definitely a frustrating aspect of the anime. Regardless, Chihayafuru does a good job at maintaining interest in the characters even when the focus of the anime shifts away from them in their \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis anime surprised me by becoming one of my new favorites. I regret being so reluctant to watch it based on just its cover photo and a synopsis different from what I was used to. It's really opened my mind and I've started to venture outside my comfort zone. With its amazing, moving soundtrack and surprisingly engaging story, Chihayafuru does what not many anime are able to do: leave a part of itself inside of me. Unfortunately, Chihayfuru is over with its season 2, but I still pray that one day a season 3 will arrive soon. \\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "About a week ago, I'd never even heard of karuta. I imagine that's probably true of a lot of viewers of Chihayafuru. I've noticed lately that (despite being male), I've been really enjoying Josei, and to a lesser extent Shojo, series. I have no idea why, but I find the stories and the characters to be more relatable and real. And that's how I found Chihayafuru, searching for similar anime. It didn't disappoint.\r\nStory - 8/10:\r\nI enjoy the plot of Chihayafuru, and it's probably the weakest element. I mean, at its core this is just another show about some sort of high school competition. Whether it'sHaikyuu! or Shokugeki no Souma or whatever, the stories are all basically the same with different themes/sports/topics. So it really boils down to execution, and Chihayafuru does a really good job of hitting all the right beats. We feel connected to the characters and share their joy or sorrow when they win or lose.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept is pretty simple. Chihaya is obsessed with karuta - a traditional Japanese game involving poetry and speed/skill. She was introduced to the game as a child, and played with her two best friends, Arata and Taichi. Now in high school, she reconnects with Taichi and wants to start a karuta club at school. But karuta isn't very popular - it's old fashioned and slow-paced, not really up to the speed of modern day life. So the first arc revolves around Chihaya and Taichi building a club/team, and then they start competing.\\n\\n\r\nOne big selling point for the story is how good a job it does of explaining and teaching karuta. Most viewers (especially Western viewers) aren't going to know what the hell karuta is at all. So the fact that, after 50 episodes, I'm able to go to Youtube and watch a real life karuta match and understand the rules and a reasonable amount of strategy says a lot. And I know very little Japanese (the language is very important to the game, given that poems are being read). \\n\\n\r\nThe tournament scenes are often a little predictable, with our heroes suffering some defeats, and sometimes emerging victorious. A lot of the usual underdog stuff, which can be compelling if done well - and it mostly is here. Overall, I dock a couple points for the predictability and the sometimes overly drawn out matches. But the story is strong and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI think Madhouse is rapidly becoming my favourite studio. Their art style is little more realistic than many other studios (although I know they're mostly copying the mangaka's style anyway). But the character designs work here, and the care and attention to detail for recreating real life locations is admirable. The karuta scenes themselves are well animated, you really get a feel for the speed and swift movements that make up so much of the game. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI watched Season 1 dubbed and Season 2 subbed, so I got a good feel for both versions. The voice acting was solid in both, especially for the main trio. The soundtrack was very fitting, it had a traditional feel to a lot of the tracks, but also some good inspirational music when needed. What I really enjoyed was the karuta reading itself. The poetry sounds very beautiful when read (really, it's almost like it's being sung more than read), and that was enough to snag a 10 for me. I liked the choice they made in the English dub of leaving the Japanese karuta readings in - there's definitely something mystical about the sound when you have no idea what's being said. I was actually a little put off when watching Season 2 and seeing a lot of the poems subtitled - they lost their magic for me once I understood the words.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI want to preface this by saying that I love Chihaya. She's awesome. Her spirit and tenacity are infectious. And she's adorable and weird and goofy too (she tends to be an airhead about a lot of things, and she falls asleep after her matches and what not). But man, it's getting tiresome to see so many anime where the main characters are just clueless about love. Whether it's some dopey male lead in a harem anime who doesn't notice a half dozen girls throwing themselves at him, or some doe-eyed high school girl who doesn't realize that the hottest guy in the school is in love with her. You're going to get that here, and it can be frustrating to watch at times.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I actually really enjoyed Taichi's character because of it. Chihaya's actions annoyed me on occasion, but it only served to help deepen Taichi's actions and motivations. Taichi comes off like an arrogant little shit as a kid, and it's really interesting to see the maturity he displays as a high schooler. Despite Chihaya being the team's ace, Taichi is definitely their leader.\\n\\n\r\nI also like the way they handled Arata's character. It's clear that Chihaya feels a deep connection to him, but he's absent for most of the first season, just popping up here or there. He's like some distant dream or goal that's just out of reach for her, and it's a big part of what helps drive her. Unfortunately, it means that he doesn't get the kind of screen time that he probably deserves, as he also seems like an interesting character. We just don't get to know him that well.\\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters are handled very nicely in this show. No one seems like they're just filling an archetype (except maybe Porky, the fat kid, but even he plays off type a lot of the time). I really thought they did a good job of making the opponents seem appropriately daunting or intimidating. Whether it's someone like Sudou, who is frightening due to his personality, or someone like the Queen, who is frightening due to her remarkable skill at karuta, adversaries are set up very nicely for Chihaya and her club. \\n\\n\r\nMy only disappointment is that the relationships between the different characters don't develop or manifest quicker than they do. It's not necessary that Chihaya choose Taichi or Arata, but she should at least engage with her feelings instead of being completely ignorant. And there were several pairings of minor characters I would have enjoyed seeing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nI blew through all 50 episodes of this show in under a week, which is fast for me. I felt like any free time I had I was hitting the couch to sneak in an episode or two. And the moment I finished the OVA, I immediately started in on the manga. Anytime I'm interested enough after a show ends to check out the manga or novel and continue the story, that's an easy 9 or 10 in enjoyment from me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10: \\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is an engaging story with likeable, nuanced characters, that highlights a rather niche sport in Japanese culture. You don't have to know or like karuta to enjoy the show. The characters and the plot provide ample motivation to keep watching.",

I am not really into that, but Chihayafuru is an exception.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is well written and very detailed. It's amazing how they made Karuta looked so interesting. There were times when you can't help but cheer for both players knowing how hard they worked but of course only one player can win and for some reason whenever a favorite player lost I can't help but feel sad as if I am the one who lost lol. You can feel the struggle that some playershave and their dedication and love for Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nChihaya is a Karuta freak. She mostly thought of nothing but Karuta. But she is one of those female anime characters that you cannot hate. \\n\\n\r\nTaichi: is someone very insecure because of the way he was brought up. But even so, his devotion to Chihaya and the way he worked hard just to be with her is something really amazing. \\n\\n\r\nArata: Doesn't have much screen time. Although he also had a lot of cute moments. Even though he doesn't have much appearances in anime. Whenever he appear, you know that something is about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the series, the art is not good. The characters looked too shiny -especially Taichi and Chihaya. But as the series continue, it gets better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening song of this anime is really catchy. It has been a long time since I heard a good anime opening song. The sound effects were also good-especially during Karuta matches.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIt was so good that I became an instant fan after watching the first episode and so I ended up reading the manga and the reason why I signed up in MAL.",

            "content": "(10) Story: Chihayafuru isn't like most animes. In fact most people who come across this might just pass it over because its about a group of high school students playing a game called \"Karuta\". But this anime is much more! When I first saw this anime I though well this is different and gave it a shot. Luckily I did because Chihayafuru is now one of my favorite animes. If you love animes with love triangles that will keep you wanting more and seeing what happens, who she'll pick, this anime is the one for you also. Chihaya is a girl up until a pointher dream was for her sister to become the number one beauty in japan. One day she meets this boy, Arata, who teaches her this game called \"Karuta\". I can't give certain details or it might spoil it, i'm just going off of the info for this because if I say anymore I'll explain a few episodes. But believe me, you will not find another anime like this! This anime is one of my favorites and oviously it must be for a reason. I promise you you wouldn't regrett watching. \\n\\n\r\n(10) Art: All the characters are goodly drawn, and that coming from me is good because one of my habits before watching a anime is to see how good the art quality is before I watch it. Well lets face it who wants to watch a anime with crudy characters? No one I'm sure.\\n\\n\r\n(10) Sound: Sounds were good. Eveything exactly how it should be.\\n\\n\r\n(10) Character: The characters are fantastic. Each have their own reason to as why they joined Karuta and the reasons behind them, well you [b]have[/b] to watch :)\\n\\n\r\n(10) Enjoyment: You will without a doubt love this anime. From the very beginning I became hooked. This anime is very interesting and will keep you watching until the very end and even then you'll want more. \\n\\n\r\n(10) Overall: Overall this anime is one of the best i've watched I recommend you add this to your anime list and watch it asap! :)\\n\\n\r\nIf you read to this far then you [i]must[/i] watch it and keep my updated on what you think. Thank you for taking the time to read my review I hope this helped you decide wheather your going to watch Chihayafuru. Believe me when you watch the first episode you wouldn't regret it. :)",

Lets just say I am very happy that I gave this anime a shot.\r\nChihayafuru starts out with a strange premise. The entire story is based around a card game called Karuta. I found Karuta to be very interesting, and I am sure that I never would've heard about the sport if I hadn't watched Chihayafuru. \r\nWhen I first began watching it Chihayafuru, it seemed more Shoujo-like than a sports anime. This does eventually change but it does seem that the target audience is girls. (That is not tosay that guys won't enjoy it.)\\n\\n\r\nStory [9] \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting. There is a love triangle, interesting characters, an original premise and an amazing heroine. What more can you ask for? (lol) Although very good Chihayafuru's story is not perfect. The end leaves you without a feeling of closure. (It leaves perfect room for a second season though.) The love triangle between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata could have definately been fleshed out more, and in the end Chihaya remains as dense as ever to Taichi's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9]\\n\\n\r\nI love the art in Chihayafuru. The characters look amazing and so do\\n\r\nthe backgrounds. The only thing I can complain about here is that Chihaya sometimes looks awkward. (For some reason.)\\n\\n\r\nSound [9]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening of Chihayafuru is amazing, there are great voice actors, and the ending song is also good. There is not much to complain about when it comes to sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9]\\n\\n\r\nChihaya is one of the best female anime characters ever in my opinion. (You really enjoy her character development and personallity.) The rest of the cast is great too! The characters are all so unique, not one of them feels like a cliche! I really enjoyed seeing how over time they all formed bonds together and made a great team. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Chihayafuru the entire time I was watching it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9] \\n\\n\r\nI really hope that people give Chihayafuru a chance. It is really a hidden gem. I am very glad that I chose to watch it.",

Each character had their own unique personality and traits. The emotions portrayed by every character was inspiring and fit the story well. At first i thought that this anime would be full of pretty boys like Taichi in order to please the girl fanbase but I greatly appreciated it when there was a greater emphasis on the characters' personalities than just their looks likeany other cliche fan-service anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The opening was really good , usually I skip openings but when an opening is good I don't skip it because it sets me up and puts me in the mood to watch the anime.(Angel Beats,Attack on Titan,etc)  In addition, the music in the competitive scenes was done well and it made the scenes more intense. \\n\\n\r\nStory:The story is very well written, many scenes have outcomes that you would not expect so this leaves you in a state where you aren't bored after one or two episodes. At first, I thought that Karuta was a sport that was made up just for the sake of this anime, but when I typed it on Youtube I was shocked. The way the athletes played Karuta was just like the anime and it made me even more interested in the anime. In addition , there was zero confusion while watching this anime as the sequencing was perfect and the flow of the anime was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEmotions: This anime brought many emotions that was unexpected. There were many scenes that made me teary. I am a fan of sad anime so these scenes only made the anime more memorable and put this anime in my top ten list. \\n\\n\r\nI Give this anime 10/10 overall.",

Please, what is Karuta? Simply put, a traditional Japanese card game based on Japanese poetry and most comparable to Memory. I'll summarize the historical background for you later. But how to play Karuta? The challenge is to recognize the poems as quickly as possible during the reading and to remove the corresponding play card from the field of play before the opponent can do so. The passionate critic - myself included - wonders whether an anime about simple card game can be entertaining. I assure you, Chihaya's ups and downs in trying to save the Karuta Club, team building and competitions are very entertaining.\\n\r\nThose who are not interested in the historical derivation of the Karuta can skip the text marked with the brackets\\n\\n\r\n[historical excursus]\\n\r\nThe poetry used comes from the so-called Hyakunin-Ishu. Around the year 1235, the famous scholar Fujiwara no Teika was asked by the rich Utsunomiya Renj\u00f4 to choose the one hundred most beautiful poems from the extensive Japanese literature, which Utsunomiya wanted to have written in his new house in calligraphy on the sliding doors. Teika accepted the request and chose a hundred poems which he considered to be the most beautiful. The collection quickly became famous and because it was collected on Ogura Mountain, it was given the name Ogura hyakunin isshu. The collection of poems consists mostly of love poems, but there are also poems depicting the beauty of the seasons or the environment. A small part is dedicated to old stories or customs. Hyakunin Isshu literally means \"a hundred (\u767e) people (\u4eba) a (\u4e00) neck, which is supposed to mean head (\u9996)\" in a figurative sense. The form of poetry in which also the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu of Teika is written is called Waka (\u548c \u6b4c) and is assigned to the Heian period (794-1185). This poetry is divided into Tanka (\u77ed\u6b4c) and Choka (\u9577 \u6b4c) - short and long forms of poetry. The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu is written in Tanka (short poems). A tanka consists of five lines, each with a fixed number of syllables (better: Moren). Over time, the book of poetry developed into the well-known social game Karuta (\u304b \u308b \u305f), which today is a solid traditional part of Japanese culture. The anime refers to the karuta played with Hyakunin Isshu, called Uta-Garuta, which means \"song cards\". In this form, two stacks of 100 cards each are required: one stack contains Yomifuda (\u8aad \u307f \u672d - reading cards) and the other contains Torifuda (\u53d6 \u308a \u672d - card to take away). The Yomifuda contain the whole poem with image and name of the poet and are read in a kind of song. Only the second half of the poem (Shimo-no-ku \u4e0b \u306e \u53e5) is written on the Torifuda and is also written in simplified form, which is why it is best for a good player to memorize the entire collection of poetry.\\n\r\n[End historical excursus]\\n\\n\r\nAll characters in the anime have their own personality. Because each character has its peculiarities, it's fun to watch their interactions and how they develop in person, in the group as well as in regard to opponents.\\n\\n\r\n* Description of the characters may include spoilers, so better do not read before watching the anime.*\\n\\n\r\nAyase Chihaya:\\n\r\nShe is truly magnificent! Her passionate enjoyment of playing is contagious. She is open-minded and honest, and with her enthusiasm, she is sometimes frightening. She has spent most of her life supporting her sister in her modeling career. That changes when she meets Arata Wataya, a talented karuta player, who believes that Chihaya has the potential to become a pro. Chihaya`s new dream, becoming Japan's best karuta player. After reuniting with her childhood friend, Taichi Mashima, she forms the Mizusawa Karuta Club. And that's where the nice difficulties begin.\\n\r\nMashima Taichi:\\n\r\nHe is not only number two, he is interesting. Although he is the classic top student with good grades, he gets a difficult family background and enough internal conflict potential to not seem colorless next to Chihaya.\\n\r\nWatay Arata:\\n\r\nActually, a friendly and decent student, but very reserved because of his initially lower self-confidence. For this reason, he is also overlooked or even shunned by his classmates. Karuta, on the other hand, shows that the young man has a natural talent, a high level of intelligence and enormous abilities. The contrast between his abilities and the way he is generally perceived is a successful representation of the superficiality of modern society.\\n\r\nWakamiya Shinobu:\\n\r\nThe opponents also have a lot to offer, especially Shinobu-chan, a cute girl-monster with a soft and cuddly fashion style but cunning as a fox and she loves not only to beat their opponents, but to completely destroy them. So to say a really sweet little girly Karuta-beast.\\n\r\nSudou Akihito:\\n\r\nHe is a cool badass, who not only puts pressure on opponents without flinching.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler alert end*\\n\\n\r\nThe original illustrations by Suetsugu Yuki can be found in the character design of Hamada Kunihiko. The changes made during the adaptation are noticeable and  in particular concern the reduction of the orientation of the manga to the female audience. The very soft drawings of the Manga have been slightly modified, but their characteristics have been retained. This become obvious at the emotional moments and the accentuation of feelings. This is often underlined by the character style and animation with small but distinct allusions such as falling sakura leaves and soft colours. Especially this slightly feminine charm of the anime, which emphasizes the visuals, makes Chihayafuru extraordinary. The otherwise typical of a sports anime \"We want to win\" receives here a larger and more emotional emphasis.  I really liked that the character designers and animators have found other ways to convey the emotions, so that the individual characters are not only beautiful to look at but also have a personality. The animation also impresses with the implementation of rather inconspicuous, e.g. When Ooe Kanade peered through the windowpanes into the room of the old student council, a Torifuda flies against the window. While the playing card bounces off from the window in slow motion, you can read it in the reflection. I liked the visuals overall, but such little things as described above give a special charm.\\n\\n\r\nThe music arrangements of Yamashita Kosuke are fantastic. The musical background of the scenes is very well chosen and underlines the content and character of a scene. The mixture of symphonic and light, soft orchestral tones not only adds emotional depth to the character,  you can almost feel it yourself. The music takes the viewer by the hand and leads through the emotional world of the characters.\\n\r\nThe OP \"Youthful\" was compound by Ko-ta & Ko-hey and recorded with their band 99RadioService. Classical rock guitars and bass notes as well as a casually slanting voice are pretty cool. The intro suits me just fine and I hear it also always gladly. The title is influenced by the classic western rock sound, not really J-Rock. Nevertheless, the text can convince me again without Anglicism. The animation is good, uses the characters of the anime and presents the elements that will follow.\\n\r\nThe ending \"Soshite Ima\" is sung by Seto Asami, who is also the Seiy\u00fb of Chihaya. Her soft voice and the soulful music are well accompanied by the equally gentle and emotionally quiet animation. Overall, a matching gentle and harmonious musical ending for the anime.\\n\r\nThe choice of the Seiy\u00fb was good and the dialogue-directing too. The voice of Seto Asami as Chihaya was very well chosen in my opinion. The voice is powerful yet feminine and brings the passionate temperament of Chihaya to full development. Also the voice of Harada Hideo spoken by Ishizuka Unshou was very pleasant and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who can ignore the prejudice that it is just a \"card game\" will find a fun and unusual sports anime that is as passionate as it is lovable and with good entertainment value. All in all, when the show grabs you, you`re tied to the TV.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching\\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a series that surprised me with it's loveable cast and a showcasing of how interesting Karuta could actually be. However, what started off as a promising motivational story about sports (I'll define Karuta as a sport after watching this series) and friendship reached it's peak at episode 15 and never really went anywhere for the final 10 episodes.\r\nStory -, it is just a typical sports anime with a dash of romance and friendship on the side. That being said, it is pretty well written, and the Karuta scenes were pretty edge-of-the-seat stuff. But I felt that often, the story wasn't going anywhere, andthe lack of progress can be frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nArt - it is Shojou style. I am personally not a big fan of this style, but I will say that it is definitely above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound - nothing really stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters is where this series shines. Each character has an interesting backstory, quirky traits and each leaves a lasting impression - pretty impressive for the large number of characters introduced throughout the series, including minor characters that the main cast meet at various tournaments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - as I mentioned before, I loved the first 15 or so episodes, but the last 10 were somehow difficult to get through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - This series was fun, and the cast of characters were some of the best I had seen in a while. However, nothing else about this series really stood out for me. That being said, if a second season comes along, I'll definitely follow that too.",

            "content": "This is one of the best animes I\u00b4ve watched lately. It goes about a group of friends that play karuta, a traditional card game, which in turn became a sport in Japan. \r\nThe game isn\u00b4t really called \"Hyakunin Isshu\", as stated in the summary. It\u00b4s called Karuta. There are several types, among them is the \"Uta garuta\", in which the three first verses of a poem are read, and the players must find the card with the last two verses that match the ones read, before the opponent does. The poems are the ones included in a classic poetry anthology called \"Hyakunin Isshu\" (one hundredpoets, one poem each). \\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a story about the pursuit of dreams. Arata, one of the three protagonists, wants to become Karuta Master, the title given to the best player in Japan, because being the best player in Japan is the same as being the best player in the world. I found this line of thought so great! I have the anthology and an \"uta garuta\" set of cards at home. I\u2019m going to learn the poems and become the best player in Argentina, as -most probably- I will only be able to compete against myself. That is what this type of anime generates in me, I suddenly find myself thinking: I want to do that, too!!!! But, going back to what I was saying... Chihaya, in turn, wants to become the Queen, the title given to the best female player. Taichi, the other male protagonist, knows he isn\u00b4t as good as Arata, which gets him frustrated. He has it tough, but -with the constant support of Chihaya- works to become better and surpass his friend.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a love triangle issue among the three, but this is by no means (at least up until the last episode I\u00b4ve watched so far) the most important story line in the anime. The story goes -as I already said- mainly about the pursuit of dreams, and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe game scenes are very exciting. The story is completely different, but for those who have watched Hikaru no Go, the feeling is the same as the one you get watching the Go matches in Hikaru no Go, with less static images, as Chihayafuru is much more recent and the art is much better. Don\u00b4t expect ghosts, spirits, or any fantastic component in this anime... I am only talking about the feeling you get watching the tournament scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, none of them is \"the perfect guy\". Probably, the most \"perfect\" one is Chihaya. But they all make mistakes, learn and grow up as the story goes forward. The most complex one is Taichi, as has already been stated by others, because he seems to be the most conflicted character.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another very interesting character: Kanade Oe. She joins the Karuta Club after the seventh or eighth episode. She is a lover of traditional Japan, and especially traditional clothing and poetry. She brings a poetic dimension to the anime. Karuta players rely on sound and speed. They learn the poems by hard, without giving much thought to their meaning, and learn to pick the cards by hearing just the one or two first syllables of the poems. Kanade often scolds them for their lack of interest in the poetic value of the game, and teaches them the meaning and beauty of the poems. Those who love Japanese poetry, as me, will probably love this character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very realistic. Don\u00b4t expect enormous eyes, hair of strange colors, or anything of the sort. Cherry blossoms, autumn leaves and color are very important, as they are a core component of classic poetry in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love this anime and I feverously recommend watching it. Absolute 10 in all aspects.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is so good, I don't know how to explain it well. \r\nTo start off, I can ensure that this Anime will make you cry more than you think it will. Sometimes they are sad tears, most of the time happy ones. It's not what I was expecting it to be. The entire thing was original, and Im pretty sure I'm not the only who has rewatched it a bunch of times...\r\nOkay, so i'll try my best to review this show~\r\nStory: The story started out with a high school girl who looks like she could easily be a model, but no one is perfect.When she walks, talks, or even moves, she loses her beauty and all thats left is a girl who looks like she needs to calm down a tad. It turns out, she was a \"karuta-baka\" Someone who was addicted to Karuta to the point where they had spent their entire life trying to become the Queen. Well, it turns out there was a reason to it all.\\n\r\nFlashback to elementary school, Chihaya had a bunch of friends. A new kid named Arata comes along, and everyone starts picking on him because he was \"different.\" The bully of the class, Taichi decides to pick on anyone who tries to befriend him. It just so turns out that the person who actually tried to befriend him was Chihaya. Taichi decided to bully her too. Thus everything plays out. Arata introduces karuta to Chihaya, and she falls in love with it with the words, \"If you become number one in Japan, you become number one in the world.\" \\n\r\nAfter a few episodes of flashback, we comeback to high school, and it turns out that Taichi enrolled in her school as well. This is where the tears begin. (If they haven't already... They had for me~) She creates a club, gathers friends, and the battle to the National Tournament begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I like about this sotry is the writer took a sport that wasn't well know at all, and has created something that makes you ant to try out the sport as well. here in Japan, kids are playing karuta, and it turns out we have more that we have ever had, trying the sport out. I find that amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art was really pretty. You would thing that some scenes must have taken ages to draw up, thats how detailed they are. And you get to enjoy those scenes throughout the entire series. Honestly, I really loved the art.\\n\r\nThe music is really pretty, and it is soothing to listen to. I actually put the entire OST into my iPod so I could listen it over and over... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Chihaya is really an interesting character. You want to support her throughout the story, and it is hard to ignore the fact that she is trying to get to the top with a reason... Arata, as far away he might be, she wants to see him again. That is her momentum to keep going and somehow she manages to intrigue others to help her through it... Gotta love all of them... WATCH IT O-O\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved it. I love love loved it /o/\\n\\n\r\nOverall, There was nothing I can say that I hated throughout anywhere in the story. It was fun, it was outstanding, and I couldn't wait for the next season! \\n\\n\r\nP.S. I recommend this anime to those who like animes where the main character is trying to accomplish a goal, and finds a hint of romance along the way.",

The storyline was fresh and different from other animes that revolve around a game or activity. I loved how it focused on Chihaya optimism and ambition, when she is playing Karuta. It made me want to extend my hand into the screen and play Karuta as well :D \r\nThe characters suited the anime amazingly well. Chihaya tomboyish behaviour but yet funny and enjoyable actions brought the story alive and made me keep watching. Also isn't her character beautiful! Ilove just how Yuki Suetsugu illustrated her and the other characters, its very detailed but yet simple. \\n\\n\r\nArata accent made it different and peculiar to listen to. I always had a eager feeling whenever Chihaya tries to contact or about to meet Arata. But then when they meetit is always cut short making me feel disappointed but yet making it more interesting for me to watch on!\\n\\n\r\nI love how Taichi personality when he was a kid completely change when he started playing Karuta again! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Chihayafuru is a exciting and enjoyable anime and manga that keeps you wanting more (SO GLAD they made a second season :3) \\n\r\nThe emotions the characters feel and express make you as the audience feel the same way as them. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to everyone and especially to people who love to watch fresh, friendly and inspriring anime!",

            "content": "A sports anime about an obscure card game based on Japanese poetry... I typically enjoy drama animes but wasn't so sure about this specific one based on the capsule description. It ended up being one of the best drama series I've seen, and my personal favorite sports anime. \r\nChihayafuru has that elusive mix of story, characters and tense sports action that so few get right. And yes, a card game can be a sport, it's definitely a high level of competition, and in the anime world this is a very aggressive, cardio-intensive game which leaves its players drenched in sweat. The sport scenes are extremelywell done and are deeply intertwined with the ongoing development of the characters, which really makes all the difference.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show takes place away from the straw mat, with immense time given to character development. Our protagonist Chihaya is a well-developed character, she has model looks but is known as \"beauty in vain\" for her abrasive personality and lack of interest in being ladylike. Although she might be obnoxious to sit in front of in class, she's quite likeable as a lead character, with ample silliness to keep things amusing but she's a fully fleshed out human being and watching her overcome her flaws is very rewarding. \\n\\n\r\nHer two best friends are Arata, a poverty-stricken, Karuto-obsessed boy, and the hyper-wealthy Taichi who becomes obsessed with Karuto himself. While the focus is definitely on the two boys through the lens of their relationship with Chihaya, they are also strong characters who change a lot as the series progresses, and it's easy to find yourself rooting for one or the other. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a great cast of supporting characters, too many to mention, but for the most part they aren't cliches, and are fun and original additions to the show, great foils and friends to Chihaya as the action goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThis is simply anime drama done right. Its basic plot devices are nothing you haven't seen before, but there is still a lot of originality in the characters and the novel idea of an anime built around this crazy card game very few people outside of Japan had ever heard of. It's all just done so well, this one's a real winner.",

            "content": "Remember when you were a kid and you collected your Pokemon cards?\r\nYou felt it would be fun to attend a competition but within your first match your shocked by the seriousness of competition. \r\nI can\u2019t help myself from keep getting the feeling that Karuta could be the reason why Japanese love card games. \r\nWhen watching this show the main draw was the Karuta itself. \r\nI never even heard about the card game before watching this show.\r\nIt made the show feel unique and kept me engaging in wanting to learn more about Karuta.\r\nMy first process in grading this show was on the issue of the glorificationof the game. Does Chilhayafuru keep Karuta within a realistic spectrum. \\n\r\nI went out and watched a few YouTube videos and the similarity was prevalent. Thus I was expecting a very realistic tone throughout the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nI would say that the tone of the game was reflected in the characters. \\n\r\nWhat was nice about the main two characters were that none of them were \u201cprodigies\u201d. \\n\r\nThere is no question that both had talent with Chihaya\u2019s speed and Mashima\u2019s mind but there wasn\u2019t a magic trump card that caused them to become the best player. \\n\r\nThe growth of the players actually was some of the slowest I\u2019ve seen but it makes perfect sense for the sport. \\n\r\nKaruta takes more repetition than even swinging a baseball bat. \\n\\n\r\nThere of course are prodigies in the show like the current Master and Queen of Karuta but those are more benchmarks for our characters to reach.\\n\r\nThey are the ones that our main characters needed to conquer and have their own distinct trait that is well defined. \\n\r\nThere is also one more prodigy that in the first half of the show was built up as a ghostly figure to our main characters in Arata.\\n\\n\r\nArata is actually one of the things holding this show back from being a 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nNot because he himself is a bad character but because a lot of build-up between him and the other main characters have not been resolved or even invested into completing. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of good side characters to note as well. \\n\r\nDesktomu shows characteristics of being a future coach and Kana shows characteristics of being a future reader.\\n\r\nThis would be a good time to note that I was really digging the amount of strategy in this show, as an INTJ I appreciate this a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe final verdict is this show has a lot of things that I look to in a Masterpiece in a serious show but falls short being a first season.  \\n\r\nThe Ending and Opening were good. I tend to listen to them instead of skipping it. \\n\r\nI do believe that there was too much crying in the show. I feel that a lot of drama shows tend to fall victim to this.\\n\r\nToo many tears can drown the affect that you want to achieve emotionally. \\n\r\nSeason 2 definitely needs to complete a good portion of our plethora of unfinished business to possibly get a 10. \\n",

            "content": "So you're off that sports anime high and are looking puzzled after seeing the preview of Chihayafuru..\r\nKaruta?! What the heck is this, and trust me I was there and I do not regret it..\r\nChihayafuru is about a traditional super Japanese sport called Karuta which our main protagonist Chihaya falls in love with after learning about it from her childhood friend Arata. They separate due to circumstances but wanting to meet Arata again Chihaya trains in order to be good enough to see her friend again. \r\nI was drawn because of the beautiful animation but also the wonderful characters that filled this world of high-school Karuta.It felt like to me the story really focused on the development of characters and their strategies and game plans prior to their games before the execution in game. I loved each characters different motivations for either starting to play Karuta or coming back to the sport. The essence of the whole team is focused on Chihaya and her full-hearted drive and commitment to the game which motivates the team and is really the driving force of the main story line. \\n\\n\r\nYes I have given this series a 10/10, and I will admit it is slow in the beginning to give you the back story of the motivations of the main cast but you have to push through because they are referenced throughout the story and drive the story line along with it.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you enjoy a sports anime with deep characters and a sport with deep hidden complexities and beautiful animation please give it a try :) \\n",

            "content": "Whoa, so Chihayafuru is not the boring anime I thought it would be. I'm not gonna say that it's everyone's cup of tea, but it definitely isn't boring. Honestly, if you're looking for great characters, you need to come to this anime. \r\nI'm gonna start off with my criticisms of this anime. The main criticism I have is that the story isn't paced all that well, in my opinion. I think the focus felt a little split between a character-driven storyline and a competition-driven storyline. Free! is a good example of a sports anime that balances those two aspects well. In Chihayafuru, I felt likeI was being pushed toward one thing and then being pulled away from it. For example, there were a lot of karuta games that felt like they were important to the story (i.e. matches that would be seriously focused on), but many of them were cut short and given a swift end. It felt like getting to the middle of a really tense match and then, two seconds later, hearing \"too bad, she lost\" or whatever. You know? You don't really get to experience the loss or win with the character, you just hear about it later. There are a couple exceptions, but I didn't really like the unbalanced focus of the storyline. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the characters and their relationships to each other were really beautifully done. The story itself wasn't bad since it was supported by these characters, it just could've been paced better. Taichi is probably the most well-written character of the bunch. He's definitely the most dynamic (and he's made it on to my Top Male Characters list). I enjoyed that Taichi could admit things to himself that he wouldn't act on or that he could do something to completely contradict what he wanted. To make such a complex character is very impressive to me, so I really love that Taichi is a part of this story. Chihaya herself wasn't the best main character this story could've had, but I also love that her personality is so consistent. The characters are pretty strong in this anime, is what I'm getting at. You'll end up loving all of them deeply.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are good, as expected of an anime like this. I fully enjoyed watching Chihayafuru, and if I was rating it solely based on enjoyment, it probably would've gotten a 10/10. It's just that there were a few issues in the storytelling that made it a little confusing to watch. I couldn't get as invested in the karuta matches as I wanted to be able to. Obviously, it's fine to make a character-heavy story, but this anime tried to have the best of both, and it kind of fell short. \\n\\n\r\nI'd still really recommend this anime for someone who doesn't mind little things like that. The story truly is something to get inspired by, and I even bought some traditional karuta cards because of it. I think, if nothing else, getting to be a part of this world that not a lot of people know about/partake in is really amazing. This anime deserves all the love it gets, and I can't wait to see what happens next season.",

            "content": "When an anime is so full of pleasant surprises, there's only one word to describe it \u2014 delightful. \r\nSince I first started watching Chihayafuru after finishing Death Note, I honestly wasn't expecting much from it. Sure, it had some good reviews and an interesting premise about some obscure Japanese card game, but I still couldn't see it turning into something  amazing (or even remotely entertaining). \r\nIf anything, I thought I might learn something new about Japanese culture. After all, 15 years of watching anime had already taught me a bit about Japanese food, festivals, traditions, etiquette, and honorifics, so why not learn about cardgames too? \\n\\n\r\nAs I started watching Chihayafuru with this post-Death-Note-depression / let's-watch-anime-for-educational-purposes mindset, I was immediately blown away by how fresh and unexpected everything about this show was. \\n\\n\r\nImmediately, the first word that came into my mind was \"striking\". Although this was mostly related to the art, the story, music, and characters didn't seem too bad either, so I kept watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe stunning art often reminded me of \"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso\", for it was not only beautiful and colorful, but also somewhat realistic (no green / purple hair or pet boars in sight). Although some of the characters have pink or blue-ish hair, the shades are either light or dark enough to make them resemble natural hair colors and therefore seem believable. Their eyes are also very expressive, which makes it difficult not to be completely mesmerized by the show or to ever want to look away from it. As if that wasn't enough, everything was also extremely well animated and again reminded me of the anime mentioned above, for the opening has hiragana subtly flying around in the same way that there were music notes and letters flying around in the opening of Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. Given this beautiful and modern art and animation, I thought that this anime had to be from last year (or from 2 years ago max), and was therefore surprised to discover that it came out almost five years ago. \\n\\n\r\nAnother surprise included hearing Mamoru Miyano come into the picture. Even though he's pretty much in every show I watch these days, I still wasn't expecting him to show up in an anime I had never even heard about before. Although his voice acting definitely made everything better, it wasn't the most important aspect of this show and simply complimented all the other seiyuu who were also very  good. Chihaya's voice in particular was extremely pleasant to listen to and conveyed lots of different emotions without ever feeling fake or sounding annoying. Other seiyuu shined not so much for their voices as they did for their accents, which in this case had to do primarily with the Fukui prefecture  (though characters from other regions also appeared). While I'm obviously no expert when it comes to Japanese accents, I could definitely hear the different intonations these \"regional\" characters used as well as the particles they added at the end of their phrases (e.g. \"ya\" instead of \"wa\", \"ga\", or anything else). \\n\\n\r\nAfter my initial surprise of casting such talented seiyuu for such a seemingly shallow anime, I quickly discovered why they were hired for the job. While one would expect this show to be about a silly card game as well as the usual puppy love and love triangles you normally find in school settings, this anime was far from being so one-dimensional and predictable. From complex personal struggles to dynamic relationships, everything about it was moving and poetic, and, most importantly, in constant movement and evolution. \\n\\n\r\nAs the characters developed and the plot unraveled, there was not only scenic art and captivating eyes to look at, but also lovely voices and background music to listen to. While nothing out of this world, the themes and songs used in Chihayafuru are very fitting and appropriate, hence helping the story progress really well. This makes the anime feel consistently peaceful and relaxing but also intense and dramatic when necessary. Comic relief hasn't been forgotten either, and often appears in the form of chibi faces, character quirks and criticisms, and, of course \u2014 cheesy jokes. \\n\\n\r\nConsequently, Chihaya Furu ends up being a wonderful show all-around and probably one of the most underrated of all time. Whether you want to watch it for the beautiful art, the great voice acting or the novelty/educational aspects involving Karuta, you definitely need to experience the wild ride that this anime is. You may still not know how to play this Japanese card game even after watching 25 episodes revolving around it, but hey, at least you will have seen how fun it can actually be. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: my only problem with Chihayafuru was how the final episode did not offer an ending for the first season but was instead used to set up the premise for the second one. Although I could personally watch every single season of this show over and over again, I understand that some people may not have the time or the desire to do so, so offering some sort of resolution rather than leaving around so many loose ties would have definitely been appreciated. However, since Chihayafuru is neither the first nor the last anime to pull this trick, all is forgiven in the name of an otherwise wonderful show.",

            "content": "Recently, sports anime have become more popular. The times when Hajime no Ippo was the only known sports anime are over and nowadays series such as Haikyuu, Kuroko no Basket or Yowamushi Pedal have an enormous amount of fans. However, even before their boom, sports anime existed. One of them is Chihayafuru, a show about karuta. Karuta is a game about Japanese poetry including aspects such as speed, precision and reaction time. It is widely known in Japan but rather unpopular as a competitive sport.\r\nThis is reflected successfully in Chihayafuru, as it starts out with the protagonist, Chihaya, having trouble finding new members for herkaruta club in high school. This is a theme which occurs quite often in anime, for example Free!, but in contrary to swimming, karuta is an actual unpopular sport, which makes Chihaya's difficulties greatly believable.\\n\\n\r\nNext to Chihaya, there are two male protagonists, Taichi and Arata. At the beginning of the anime, we see the three of them during their childhood years and learn how they got in touch with karuta. In other anime, this aspect is usually covered at a later point in time throughout multiple flashbacks. Chihayafuru's method is unusual but very fitting as it is not just an anime about karuta but also a story about growing up and maturing.\\n\\n\r\nChihaya is a happy girl who wants everyone to be happy. She does not like when someone is bullied and consequently defends Arata, who does not have any friends because he is new in Chihaya's class, and tries to get to know him better. While visiting Arata, she learns that he wants to become the greatest karuta player in Japan. Taichi, a popular boy in the same class as Chihaya and Arata, does not want to accept Chihaya's affection towards Arata and his hobby and, being the stubborn kid he is, starts bullying both of them. Due to several events, the three of them start growing closer and become friends in an absolute heart-warming manner. The anime would already have been great if it had stayed in this time period but, as mentioned above, it decides to do a time skip and we learn how the protagonists are dealing with their lives in their high school years.\\n\\n\r\nChihaya has not changed much since she is still very enthusiastic about karuta. Compared to the other main characters, she has received next to none development. However, this changes during her high school years as she becomes a better karuta player, which affects her personality greatly.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi might be the character who has changed the most during the time skip. He is no longer a spoiled kid but an understanding person who cares about others. Compared to Chihaya, he does not develop as strongly during their high school days but nevertheless has to deal with several problems he can overcome thanks to karuta and his friends he made by playing the game.\\n\\n\r\nArata is a special case since his personality changes due to a stroke of fate. Development might not be the right term to describe what he experienced but his character is quite different to the Arata he was in his childhood years. The anime then presents Arata as a person who has to be able to face his fears and worries and does so magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nNext to the three protagonists, there are several members who participate in Chihaya's karuta club. All of them have distinguishable personalities and different goals, which is reflected in the way they play karuta. They become stronger due to the game and find confidence in what they are doing. Additionally, being a sports anime, there are naturally a lot of opponents the karuta club has to face. Most of them have an interesting backstory or at least entertaining personalities. Some are also recurring characters, which makes them much more important than characters who appear for only one episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically about Chihaya's karuta club and how they attend different tournaments. The matches' outcome is often quite predictable as the anime uses the standard sports anime formula but it is executed quite nicely. Chihayafuru is definitely a character-oriented show and should not be viewed if you want to see a lot of plot twists. Nonetheless, the matches are intense and you start wondering how the episodes end so quickly even though the characters are only staring at some cards.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, one problem with this anime is that it tries to include too many themes. Chihayafuru is a story about competitive karuta, a story about growing up, a story about love, a story about dealing with loss, a story about receiving appreciation from one's family, a story about priorities in life, a story about maintaining friendship. Had it abandoned some of its topics and, in turn, exploited some of them more thoroughly, it might have been beneficial. The anime never fails in implementing its themes but it is too short to convey all of them properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a bit repetitive but still memorable and fitting to the anime's atmosphere. The opening is a perfect introduction to every episode and the ending could not be more fitting. Chihayafuru's art style is similar to that of Ore Monogatari and fits the simple nature of the anime phenomenally. At the same time, it manages to capture the games' intensity fantastically and, consequently, could not have been any better.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I can recommend this anime to basically everyone. Even if you are not interested in regular sports anime, Chihayafuru is worth it thanks to its characters alone. It is not often that there are anime about a such a niche hobby but if there are, they should be done just like Chihayafuru.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru, an anime that revolves around a female highschool student who loves playing a certain game; not a game which is popular or requires a technology like nowadays. Playing a certain game, or most preferably, being obsessed over it, is a persons\u2032 hobby or liking.\r\nMany people have different tastes when it comes to a certain obsession - games, people, foods and etc.\r\nKneeling on a tatami mat for a long period of time, and moving your hands fast as if there\u2032s no tomorrow, encouraging one\u2032s self to win in a match like no other. That\u2032s how a game called \u201cKaruta\u201d works.\r\n- A girl named Chihaya, beganto like Karuta, when one of her classmates taught her how to play it. And that is where it all begin, well, not likely yet. A lot of things happened after that and before that. It\u2032ll be much of a spoiler to summarize the story around here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Chihayafuru (or Chihaya Full) is circling around a Japanese game, which they call Karuta. The game is composed of a cards that has a verses of poems written on them. Our main heroine, Ayase Chihaya, is currently aiming to win and be entitle as the \u201cQueen\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru\u2032s story is can be compared and matched up to our real life. There really isn\u2032t anything unique in the story, but the story can pretty much emphasize a  lot of things throughout the whole series. I barely have seen an anime that has a theme of a Japanese game; like Karuta. For me, it\u2032s quite a new pace for me.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru\u2032s story also has a lot of lessons. They teach us lessons that no other can compare, teaching us how to move forward, to never give up, and fight \u2032till the end. Friendship and cooperation is one of the things that makes a group shine. And the Karuta club has it; it was a bit hard for Chihaya to recruit members, including one of her former rival when she was young.\\n\r\nBut that didn\u2032t stop Chihaya, she was still persistent and eager, to the extent that the person would easily give up (he also got a bit annoyed: if you know who I\u2032m talking about here.)\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru, as I said, teaches us lessons, not only lessons, but also hardships that one might bump on to. Even if there are hardships and challenges, never give up. Chihayafuru shows that, no matter how impossible your dream is, you\u2032ll be able to obtain it if you try and never give up.\\n\\n\r\n- Chihafuru\u2032s art is not that simple, and also not that unique, let\u2032s say that the level is in the \u201cmiddle\u201d. Chihayafuru\u2032s art has some flaws in it, but it\u2032s not that annoying and not that big of a deal. The only thing that has it\u2032s flaws, are the characters eyes.\\n\r\nI consider and take them as odd ones. Don\u2032t know why, but the first time I watched it, the eyes caught my attention. I guess it\u2032s because of the lashes that sticks over their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and settings are great and doesn\u2032t catch that much of an attention; what I mean is, sometimes, some anime has backgrounds that catches more attention than the characters on it. And some of their settings is like not well-drawn.\\n\\n\r\nI would rate Chihayafuru\u2032s art great!\\n\\n\r\n- Chihayafuru\u2032s opening songs, ending songs and also the background musics, are all in all very good, why? I consider the ending theme a little sad; I guess that\u2032s what made me rate the sound 8. It has a little sad and melancholic feeling in to it. I know that the songs theme might be because of hardships and challenges. It greatly fits. Still, the ending theme is great and i kind of liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, on the other hand, is great. Honestly, I really liked the opening song, it had a nice and happy feeling in it. And the singer\u2032s voice is also great; this is just me: but I guess the opening song\u2032s theme is about their friendship, and bonding times; considering them friends and clubmates.\\n\\n\r\n- Chihayafuru has some characters which has a different kinds of personalities in them; tomboyish, persistent, food lover, smart one and a bit of everything mixed to fit in one character. Every character has it\u2032s personality that most likely, what makes them shine. None of the characters is annoying, but you might think of Chihaya as annoying, because she cries a lot; but that\u2032s part of her personality, she becomes persistent and strong-willed after all the hardships, challenges, and loses she had.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2032d say they made quite a mixed nuts in here. The characters who were young in the earlier year in the story, had quite a change. They made the boy-looking one into a beauty, the whatnot one into a bishounen (that\u2032s what I consider him).\\n\\n\r\nI think you\u2032ll like the characters a lot, not just because they\u2032re part of story or whatever, but because they\u2032re the ones who teaches us the everything and anything. And that no obstacle can stop them.\\n\\n\r\n- I\u2032m glad that I picked up Chihayafuru. I got quite hooked in the plot and/or storyline. It was quite unique for me; that a simple game, can make you happy, what\u2032s more? It\u2032s the reason and also your goal of your dream. I hope Chihayafuru can make you strong, even if it\u2032s just an anime. It\u2032s partly like a true story. Encouraging us to reach and fulfill our dream.\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2032m really not into game-themed anime. But the story made me hooked, and makes me want to finish it earlier.\\n\\n\r\nAny kinds of obstacles are nothing but a piece of cake, that\u2032s what Chihayafuru\u2032s story is about (also about Karuta and their dreams together.) :D",

If I can be the best in the world at something, I think it's worth a shot.\" -Ayase Chihaya \r\nChihayafuru is a series that kept me wanting more every time. \r\nStory- 7/10\r\nThe female lead Chihaya is obsessed with an old game called karuta. After her encounter with Arata, (a boy in her elementary school) she becomes enchanted with karuta. The story isn't anything amazing, but the way it is presented is great.The first few episodes start off with flashbacks explaining many things, such as, \"What is karuta?\" and \"Why does she play this game?\" The real appeal of Chihayafuru doesn't lay in the story but in it's characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are what really stand out about Chihayafuru, the characters are all unique and colorful in their own ways. Chihaya with her strange antics and tomboyish mannerisms and her childhood friend Taichi and his over calculating mind. All characters have a problem they have to face and overcome throughout the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation and art were really well done. The animation was fluid and the characters all looked different. The eyelashes that most shoujo anime/manga had were something that I personally never really liked, but the eyelashes here fit really well with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\r\nThe music fit well with the flow and mood every time they were put in. The openings and endings were also pleasant to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\r\nThe show is interesting even when they aren't playing the game and when they are the outcome is usually unpredictable. Every time an episode ended I was eager to jump straight into the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 \\n\r\nChihayafuru is a must watch anime and will leave you wanting more. Luckily the second season is already complete as well and quite satisfying.",

            "content": "In my search for new animes to watch, Chihayafuru turned out to be a light and fresh option after seeing shows as Serial Experiments Lain that required too much concentration and mental analysis. And the truth is I made a good decision. \r\nThe story is simple and even predictable, but emphasizes important values such as friendship, self-improvement and professionalism in such a natural way that allows it to develop different nuances that keeps of being generic. One peculiarity to note is like for example, Ping Pong The Animation, this isn\u2019t a show focusing on the sport, but uses it as a resource to develop thecharacters, something not exactly bad as Karuta reaches a certain grade of prominence which allows us to know about its bases, playing styles and even the meaning behind each poem. The only problem is that the plot structure is like any other sports anime and there isn't a high point in the whole development of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has a unique personality as well as various charms and fears they face along the series which allow them to develop a backstory. The protagonist, Chihaya, may seem too perfect in the first episodes but this dissipates with the passing of the show which makes her credible as person. Moreover, it's remarkable she's the key of the team\u2019s chemistry and without her the things wouldn't be the same. In general terms, the repertoire is solid and varied.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of technical aspects, Chihayafuru has visuals full of vivid colors, well-drawn backgrounds and design character quite accomplished. However, certain distant scenes lose spectacularity. The animation accomplishes its purpose and is efficient transmitting the feeling of tension and agility when the characters play Karuta. The sound effects sound organic, but sometimes can go unnoticed. Both the OP and ED are a bit generic, but they make a good presentation of the show. Of course, the voice actors did an excellent job interpreting each character.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is an inspirational show which is totally enjoyable and if it's true is not stellar in most of its aspects, is nice and worth seeing.\\n",

            "content": "Whenever I'd enter anime which mentions things as \"rivals\", I'd always enter it with caution. Japanese can go a little bit overboard with its concept, and I kind of shrug upon their idea of what the rival is - actually, to be honest, I shrug upon the idea of rival itself. \r\nThat being said, I started watching Chihayafuru solely because of its endless good reviews. I had to reach third/fourth page before I found a review that scored it below 9, and that kind of says something. Unfortunately, I did not see the massive appeal as other reviewers did. \r\nThe story of Chihayafuru is simple- far too simple. It's as basic and as standard and as cliche as any sport/competitive manga/anime are nowadays. If you ever watched Boukman or KnB, it's pretty much that - only with karuta instead of drawing manga and playing basketball. It follows the story of trio (mostly duo), Chihaya, your classic tomboy and airhead, Arata, mysterious, brooding-to-develop guy and Taichi, tomboy's standard, jealous childhood friend. The story itself mostly focuses on Chihaya though, especially in the latter episodes, with occasional moments devoted to Tachi and some of the side characters. \\n\r\nIt's a story about wanting to be the BEST! What I didn't like about the story is that it used the very same cliches found in any similar anime/manga - pumped up beginning, sudden wall, sudden new revelations about the game, sudden new techniques which improve our main character, rivals he/she encounters that teach her things unwillingly but joyfully, the OP characters our main duo/trio is dying to reach ... you get the point. It has everything any other manga/anime of similar genre has. Nothing new - there are no twists, compelling story or some innate depth. The only times where the story shines are the same as any other - when there's a big match, and everyone's on the edge. Nothing new. Mediocre, at best.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound, on the other hand, are wonderful. From the very first episode, I was hooked onto the art; although it was quite shoujo-ish, it wasn't filled solely with hot guys and girls (even Arata isn't that hot), and the surroundings were immensely satisfying to look at. Animation was lacking from time to time, with pictures sliding over one another during \"unimportant\" matches, but it also had its shining moments. Soundtrack had some beautiful compositions, some that were extremely tense and satisfying to listen, and voice actors did a fantastic job on their characters - one of the best I've recently had a chance to witness. \\n\\n\r\nThere where everyone told me I'd find a gem, I didn't. Characters ... oh the characters. I didn't mind having them start off as your basic, over-the-top cliche standards (even the side characters). However, the issue is that they never really change, and, if they do, it wasn't that appealing to me. \\n\r\nI'll start with Chihaya first. Although I always had a \"thing\" for tomboy-ish girls, especially in manga/anime, since they're fun to watch, Chihaya kind of rubbed badly on me. She started getting on my nerves the very first episode, which was never a good sign. I understand a certain level of un-logical events is required for a story to set off, but no one sane would throw away years of friendship for a random stranger. Maybe I'm just thinking too much into it, but that's my opinion. Throughout the episode, we see Chihaya grow - but only in tears of her karuta strength - not in terms of her character. From the very first episode, until the very last, SHE'S EXACTLY THE SAME! And no, there are no facts to prove otherwise. She's still sulking over Arata, is still completely ignorant to Taichi, is still an stupid airhead (beauty in vain), is still shouting and making the same calls she did at the beginning. I understand there's another season, but I'm fairly certain twenty five episodes are quite enough for at least a small amount of character development. \\n\r\nAs for Taichi, he was my favorite character since the episode one. Not that he's the best character, far from it, but I was always fond of the characters like him. Ironically, he gets probably the most development throughout the series, both in terms of character and karuta strength. Taichi is your \"original\" jack of all trades but master of none; he has amazing grades, always at the top of his class (you never see him study though - maybe in 1 or 2 pictures), has a room filled with trophies, is so rich he just has a \"small TV\" in his bedroom,  has a strict mother ... you know the type. However, the growth in his character is noticeable, and, besides Chihaya, he gets the most screen time, often even more than Chihaya. Still, I never liked the cowardice part of him - and I'd like that gone.\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about Arata though. He barely gets any screen time until towards the end. He's your typical best-in-business who got struck by a sudden tragedy and needs his friends to pursue him to do the thing he loves the most in his life (?). Plain and uninteresting character. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Chihayafuru? Relatively so. It has it's moments, especially during the intense karuta matches (Taichi & Porky still the best match). However, besides that, it doesn't have much going for it. It terms of story, it's completely lacking, being as cliche as one could get. With characters, it can be so-so, depending on from which perspective you look at things. However, twenty five episodes seemed far too dragged out without nothing important besides a few growths in rank happening. The good, saving graces are the art and sound, however, I wouldn't recommend it if you're not SOLELY into competitive sports (no matter what it is) and if you didn't like the types of Koruko no Basket, Bakuman etc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chihayafuru, in my humble opinion, is far from deserving its current score. In terms of both, story and characters, which should be the most important aspects in these types of anime (especially the characters), it offers nothing special. It has occasional wry and quirky humor, but even that fades out during the second half.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is the only shoujo sports anime I have ever seen. If you're looking for something in that incredibly narrow category, this is the show for you.\r\nI actually feel like I'm not qualified to speak on the show, since, I'm starting to think that maybe I just don't like sports anime. This show reeled me in with a compelling human story about the 3 most important characters, then it introduces you to more characters, and then it slows down and just sports all over the place for the rest of the show. Once the story became less focused on characters and more focused on thegame, I found the show to be a chore I felt the need to push through because I was so invested in these characters and I needed to see how things would play out. It took me about 5 months off of and on watching, but I'm still pushing, now on season 2. I told myself I was going to be done with the show after one season but I was NOT. The show can be formulaic, it really feels to me like a show that did not need as many episodes as it has, but something keeps pulling me back. Maybe it's an intense personal desire to stay in familiar universes and be surrounded by the same characters, or maybe it's a strong desire for resolution.\\n\r\nThe characters in Chihayafuru are not the most incredible I've ever seen, but they are diverse, and they are all treated with respect and understanding. Regardless of gender. It's unfortunate how anomalous that can be, but it is really nice when it happens. The only thing I maybe found a little bit frustrating was how obvious the shoujo romantic leads are when placed next to the other members of the karuta team. Why are these tall, beautiful, super fit people playing a game with three completely normal looking human beings. I was very concerned that the other characters would end up being treated as space fillers, and not given proper attention. But in actuality, all characters maintain (admittedly) two-dimensionality, while also being given their fair share of attention. It's not completely equal, but the story does make sure to regularly shift focus in the karuta team and show that each character is contributing their own individual skills, and they are so much stronger because they have each other. sports anime. It is also surprisingly frequent that the backstories of opponents is shown. It might even be to an unnecessary degree. I found myself at times being like, okay we get it, everyone has intense personal relationships with the cards and the game and that's what makes them so good at it, sports anime.\\n\r\nThe only other thing I found a bit annoying was that the show WAY overuses the same like 3 tracks of background music, to the extent that they start to lose all emotional weight because they are being used with so many different scenes with so many emotions contained within them. This also, at times, contributed to feelings that some scenes were just far too melodramatic. I wish they would have used the money they spent on the most unnecessary CGI on like, one more song. \\n\r\nI guess this is one of many things I've enjoyed that I'd put under the category of \"not great, but definitely enjoyable.\" I don't know if I properly expressed how important it is to me to engage in media that shows equal respect and kindness to a diverse set of characters, so for that alone, it's worth it. But I also found that the shoujo romance appealed so perfectly to that part of my brain that gets excited by shoujo romance. It sucked me in and now I can't escape, because I am so invested in these characters and I want to watch them all fight to achieve their dreams.",

            "content": "Warning: I have completed the series and my review reflects such, and ties in the final episode. Though I do not outright 'spoil' anything (it's hard to spoil a non-ending) you may want to keep this in mind....\r\nLet me start with the positive: Chihayfuru is BEAUTIFUL. It's visually stunning, and obviously done digitally, though there's no \"out of place CG,\" just a lot of cherry blossoms on everything. There is no significant drop in aesthetic quality throughout the 25 episodes. If you are looking for a \"Sports Anime\" akin to Hikaru No Go, another series dealing with Japanese competitive games that are not 'mainstream popular'among young people in Japan, this is perfect. There's very little 'training' (though there is some) and more strategic studies of multiple kinds. It takes place in a realistic setting (no supernatural, no ghosts, lol) and it's all very believable and realistic in setting, other people perceiving the main characters at school, and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are really one dimensional and stagnant though, and they don't inspire any real concern from me. I would call it a lack of character. The main 3 characters I'd mark as downright bad (3) but the entire cast rounded it up to a higher score, since the truly love the iside characters, though they are largely ignored. \\n\\n\r\nChihaya is horribly boring and has no character, she's just OMG SO PRETTY WHAT A WASTE, they only made her 'pretty' so the entire show could be pretty. If you've seen the opening episodes you see that Chihaya's early life is defined by a lack of thereof: She has no interests, no talents, and no concerns, and her entire family is obsessed with her older sister, who she also supports. (Spoilers: this NEVER REALLY CHANGES except a single episode in which Chihaya's Dad shows that she has a single album of news clippings about Chihaya's Karuta games, in comparison to bookshelves full of ones about her sister and the fact that her parents never show any support to her before OR after this single moment). High School Chihaya's only characteristics are that she is really really pretty but also really obsessed with Karuta and doesn't have any friends (I say High School Chihaya because pre-Karuta  Chihaya has no characteristics at all other than being highly impressionable). Over and over it is stressed how 'beautiful' she is (LOL GET IT HER SISTER IS A MODEL) but this has absolutely ZERO impact on the series, which otherwise would be a normal 'sport club tournament' show along the lines of Hikaru No Go, only now the main character looks really good in a kimono and doesn't have to overcome any prejudices based on her appearance unlike the other, better Karuta players (who are all inevitably depicted as plain or sloppy or fat, for the girls). In fact, by making her beautiful they really take a cop out approach to her character: the same personality applied to an 'average' looking person would not have been as instantly likable by viewers, and would have resulted in bullying and people being outright mean or demeaning in her school life. Chihaya has none of these obstacles other than some guys she doesn't know saying her beauty is wasted on her. In fact, it's almost humorous that Chihaya's looks make much better players feel unsure of themselves despite their being much more competent.\\n\\n\r\nShe does have a slight complex because of her sister at first but all mentions of this inferiority complex are dropped by episode 12 and never mentioned again. \\n\r\nChihaya never learns, her only 'growth' is \"I Want to be stronger!\" like every other sports/competition show. Unlike other shows though, she never uses any of this to grow as a person, to fix her relationships with others, or her family, or her estranged friends who she's so maddeningly incapable at  communicating with that it makes her somewhat annoying and unlikable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is not without likable characters though. Side characters who aren't pretty, like Kanade and Nishida seem to actually have PERSONALITIES (other than being boring and easily impressionable like Chihaya, who has no qualities at all until she starts copying a boy she met once in elementary school) but they NEVER RECEIVE ANY CHARACTER EPISODES other than their brief introduction episodes. Even Tsutumu seems to have more personality than Chihaya, it's simply never explored. These characters have had OBSTACLES placed before them, and I don't just mean tournaments and shit, but actually obstacles in their daily life, and it reflects on them because they are more interesting and developed.Too bad the side characters are little more than furniture to fill out the club, and are treated as such for a while by Chihaya, until they start ranking in matches when she suddenly realizes everyone has potential (at least as someone for her to practice against). The series nears a lull around the midway point, but picks up nearer to the end, the last 10 episodes or so discounting the recap. The glimpses you see of the SIDE CHARACTERS evolving (the mains, Chihaya and Taichi NEVER evolve except the \"I must become stronger!\" mindset which is really one dimensional, they never improve their communication between each other really either) and other aspects of their personality and past (Nishida's in particular as he's the only one with a relevant background) it actually  becomes interesting, and you think there might finally be some conflict and growth, but it's generally all curtailed by the ending of the Master and Queen matches. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ending is pretty average for a 'sports' type story whose original story doesn't have time to be finished within the 25 episode time span (or a 'non-ending' as I would call it since the story is not wrapped up). Not terrible, hopeful for the future, possibly set up for a sequel (which I sort of doubt), though really what I want to see more of are Kanade, Nishida, Tsutomu, or maybe even Arata (who has a really bafflingly unimportant role in reality versus his role in Chihaya's stupid obsessed little head). The final episode does give a little bit of a glimpse of Kanade growing, but it's sort of curtailed by Chihaya immediately disappointing her with the truth. We also see Chihaya studying the actual poems but, well, shouldn't she have done that earlier? I found Kanadae's love of the Japanese language and literature far more compelling and pure hearted than Chihaya's LOL GOTTA WIN GOTTA BE THE QUEEN WAITWHATISTHISGAMEIDONTEVENKNOW.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is by no extent \"Bad\" but it did baffle me to an extent, as I liked some elements but also got bogged down in how little the characters were changing during the otherwise rather boring action of watching them plays (parts of) games you can't truly understand or even see. Generally you watch things like this not because of the game they play (as you never see a game in full, anywhere, that'd be long and boring!) but to see the characters progression and growth. Hikaru No Go is a good example of that, the main character, and even some side characters, grow and change their understanding of the game, and while Hikaru does desire to \"become stronger\" it's a much more complex growth, which changes his personality and how he acts, and meets or surpasses his mentor in new or different ways. The very last scene of Chihayafuru recalls the opening scenes in her high school, cementing the fact that Chihaya's attitude and actions are largely unchanged in her life, she's only become more focused and concentrated while playing games or studying for games, it hasn't seemed to take any effect outside of that, and there is no resolution to her family and inferiority complexes, just as there are no real resolutions to Taichi's issues of inferiority or unrequited feelings that may or may not even exist (but we need some romansu doramu so ppl will watch it, right?!?!!? so they had to imply there were some in the beginning).  I  guess that makes it more realistic, in a way! Since people are not so quick to change in real life. It just didn't feel like it delivered any resolutions at all, or any growth from the 'main' characters.",

            "content": "Chihiyafuru is a josei comedy-drama series focused around a high school girl named Chihiya and her interest in the Japanese card game of karuta as she assembles her own school club devoted to the game and competes in a number of competitions with them. Much like Hikaru no Go did for the Chinese game of Go, Chihiyafuru boosted the popularity of competitive karuta games immensely when the anime aired back in 2011. The series takes its time to explore how Chihiya became acquainted with the game of karuta as the first few episodes of the series are devoted to how she befriended Arata and tookinterest in the game. Several more episodes in the series are used to introduce additional members to Chihiya's newly formed school karuta club, each of whom either being experienced or newcomers to the game. The series shows the gradual developments of the karuta club through their competitions as they learn to improve their skill in the game and get introduced to a number of other karuta players who also get their fleshing out. A plus that I would give Chihiyafuru over Hikaru no Go is that the game of karuta is more accessible for viewers than Go as the game is more focused around memorization and reactions compared to Go's focus being on strategy and tactics, thus making it an easier game for newcomers to adapt to.\\n\\n\r\nI do have a number of issues with this series. Chihiyafuru has a tendency to milk melodrama at a number of points in its run during tense moments in the competitions that Chihiya and her club go through. While such exaggerated emotions may seem appropriate during losses and setbacks experienced by the characters, it does get overblown when milked during the middle of a game and less tense points of the title's story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, my thoughts of Chihiya as the title's lead character are rather underwhelming. While her strong devotion to karuta is an admirable trait, her single-mindedness towards the game borders on obnoxious and there wasn't much else that stuck out for me with her character. Her character didn't seem to grow or develop at all throughout the course of Chihiyafuru as she is still the same energetic and naive tomboy that viewers are introduced to at the start of the series. Compared to the titular male lead of Hikaru no Go whose character gradually matured and his skills in his game of interest improved, I have to question why I should care for Chihiya as a lead character in this series as I cared more for her teammates in the karuta club than I did for her.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not prominently focused on, there were a few points in the series where I found myself questioning the parenting of some of the families for major characters in the series, most notable instance being the neglect Chihiya received from her family as they are more fixated on her older sister's modeling career. In addition, the series ends just as Chihiya's second year in high school starts up and the series continues onward into its second season the following year.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say my thoughts on Chihiyafuru as a whole are mixed and its praise by many seems mostly exaggerated. While it is nice to have another series like Hikaru no Go that delves into another game unique to Eastern cultures and having some solid side characters, the show's dabbling into melodrama and its rather shallow lead character were major bumps in my enjoyment of the series. I'm not sure if I would even want to dabble into the show's second season.",

            "content": "I never knew that a card game like karuta could be a sport. Chihayafuru, an anime about karuta exhibits characteristics of a sports anime, and alongside it, their FLAWS.\r\nThe feeling of REPETITION is a plague that haunts other sports anime series such as Haikyuu, and Kuroko no Basket. Chihayafuru is actually worse than my aforementioned anime in dealing with this factor. After a certain point, all the karuta games in the series just look and feel the same. It just feels like you are watching the same match over and over again.\r\nI found myself skipping through a lot of the scenes in the game asI found them really boring while binge-watching. If I were to watch this anime without skipping a scene, that would be tantamount to me watching ENDLESS EIGHT for an entire season. After a couple of episodes in, I found myself watching 8 to 12 minutes of the anime, and I am sure the average would have been much lower if it wasn't for buffering on my streaming sites.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the characters... I don't really hate much of them but there isn't a character I strikingly like either. Chihaya is the generic \"athlete with talent but no brains\", and Arata is the \"generic role model\", and Taichi the \"childhood friend/loves protagonist\" trope. This show really wasn't a special snowflake some people advertised it to be for me. Having Hikaru no Go (an anime about go, a sport mainly only played in East Asia) as one of my favorites, perhaps my expectations were too high for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut I am surprised that an anime about such seemingly boring topic kept me watching for quite some time. For that reason, I am giving this anime a 6/10. This anime isn't horrible. It's just meh.\\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend this anime to a friend? No.\\n\r\nAnd I recommend to those who are planning to watch this anime to watch this at around 4-8x speed if possible.\\n\\n\r\nSide note: I actually find the voices of the poetry readers annoying.\\n\\n\r\nTL; DR Chihayafuru is repetitive like many other sports anime, and is not the special snowflake.",

            "content": "Why this anime isn't more popular than it currently is is seriously puzzling. Although many have expressed that they found Chihayafuru to have a slow and boring start but pick up its pace as the series moves along, I had a different experience. The starting of this show was spectacular for me, especially the first five episodes because it builds the characters of the show so well and it establishes the plot and the goals really nicely too. And I also hereby award this show the honour of bringing tears to my eyes in the earliest episode (in the 5th ep to be exact xD).The story then begins to renew itself and becomes something else altogether and although there were points in time that the pace was too slow for my liking or the episode was too uneventful, the series was nicely weaved together to present us with the wonderful tale of a girl chasing her dreams. \\n\\n\r\nNow, moving on to Karuta, a card game that is SO MUCH MORE than a card game. It is a sport, it is an art, it is an expression. I really have to credit Chihayafuru for unpacking the meaning behind Karuta so beautifully, because just when you think you know what Karuta is, you're introduced to a new character and you sink into their shoes and see what Karuta means to them, how they play it and what drives them to seek victory. We learn and grow together with Chihaya and the rest of the Karuta club members, and season 1 of this really was an enjoyable journey for me. Another thing I really liked was the animation of the series, because who knew swiping cards could look so darn cool?? The sound for the anime was alright, but not unique or significant enough for me to remember any specific tracks in the ost. \\n\\n\r\nEvery Karuta match is different from the next, the struggles that the characters go through is different, the strategies used are different, the circumstances are different. And just when you think you're able to predict the outcome, something happens and the tables are turned in a matter of seconds. And that's what kept the show so fresh and interesting.",

            "content": "[This review is for the entire Chihayafuru series, not just the first season. Spoiler free]\r\nThis is a story about passion. The word chihayafuru literally means passionate. It's a story about a obscurely niche card game and its society with its 3 main characters Chihaya, Arata, and Taichi who all passionately love the game.\r\nWhat I love about this anime is how it is able to show how much effort and time die-hard Karuta players put into this game and about how a dying society is knitted up together in order to keep the game they love alive. After watching this anime, I've watched a few documentariesabout how real Karuta players live, and unlike most sports anime, this anime is actually realistic about the dilemmas faced by competitive Karuta players such as the amount of time, effort, and money they put into playing this game. And all our main characters face these problems; Chihaya is worried about her future and school because Karuta is the only thing she is good at and in the Karuta world, professional players aren't payed. The antagonist, Shinobu, also faces this dilemma as she is aiming to be the first full time and paid professional Karuta player because Karuta is the only thing she knew since childhood.\\n\\n\r\nAnother amazing thing about this game is how it develops its characters. Each character has a defining personality. A lot of anime antagonists are usually just your casual evil-personified character. But in Chihayafuru, each character(including those antagonists) has an understandable cause, a belief, and a unique playing style which makes you genuinely cheer for them. The way the match is played is also so unpredictable that you just don't know who is going to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, direction, and sound is also critical in how they choreograph this card game. I mean, its a card game, it should be boring. But it is one of, if not the most, entertaining sports anime I've ever watched. The matches keeps you on your toes. The timing of flash sequences, sound, and the tense atmosphere it creates is just spot on. Kudos to Madhouse.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a great sports anime. It gives an amazing perspective of the meaning of passion. It conveys a great message about doing what you love despite the obstacles it presents.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a person who was at first reluctant to watch the first season of chihayafuru, I have come a long way and now i am one of the most obsessed people with this anime. \r\nWhy? \r\n1. the characters and 2. the subtleness of everything in chihayafuru and how the story unfolds so eloquently to viewers, coupled with awesome animation and ost. To those who are still reluctant about starting the series because of its \"karuta focused plot\", just give it a go and you will definitely find a gem of an anime amongst the many mediocre harems and supernatural animes that just all blur together.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 \\n\r\nThe first season of chihayafuru focused a lot more on the different characters and their growth throughout the series. I really enjoyed how interesting karuta can be despite not knowing what the actual game entails or having any clue as to what the rules and customs are. That in itself is a testament to how great the story is, and it's one of those shows that really encourages you to start learning karuta yourself because it looks so fun! The character development was amazing, especially Taichi who at first, i didn't quite like him, but as the story progresses you realise how real he is which really resonates to us average anime viewers. But enough of the characters I'll elaborate about that a bit later. But overall the story is certainly an immensely enjoyable one, and the very very subtle romance in the story really just enhances the chihayafuru experience. On a side note, one thing that i wished there was more of is more romance i guess but i do like how subtle it is so yeah i guess that's just a personal opinion :) \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nAs always, Madhouse delivers amazing animation and the karuta matches are very well done especially how the fluidity of the Shinobu's movements are animated. The animation was very consistent and the art style is one that i favour (i'm a big fan of Suetsugu sensei's works) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe OST was amazing !!!! It really adds to the tension in every karuta match and that feel-good moment would have certainly been not as feel-good without the accompanying OST. I love Morio Asaka he really is the josei master as i am a big NANA fan and he certainly did not fail to appeal to me with his direction (that was a bit off-track :P )\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are AMAZING. I cannot stress enough how amazing all the characters in chihayafuru really are (especially Taichi oh god i love him). Each and every character has their own shining moment and the development throughout the series is one of the best i have seen. Chihaya's passion, Taichi's resilience and determination, Porky's humour, Oe-san's femininity and Desk (don't know how to spell his name) person's motivation. Each and every character adds to the series and not one of them is bland. Even the Empress became likeable ! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nAs you can already tell, I am a big big fan of Chihayafuru and I enjoyed it waaaay too much. I think the above really reflects my passion towards this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nIf you still have any doubts as to whether you will like this anime, then I suggest you watch this anime because those doubts will be immediately erased and it will certainly not disappoint. I understand that this genre isn't for everyone, but i truly believe Chihayafuru has something that everyone can relate and hence enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "~~This is a review of both season 1 and 2~~\r\nAfter many times of straight up ignoring this title due to the concept I finally decided to watch it. It was the kind of impulse decision where you've got a ton of things you want to watch and can't make a decision. Close your eyes, Click a title and proceed to watch. I should do this a lot more. Maybe i'll find other gems like Chihayafuru.\r\nThere's a lot of common misconceptions surrounding Chihayafuru, misconceptions I find myself guilty to believing aswell. To be honest I won't blame myself or others. In hindsight, how can a cardgame about poems be exciting? Mix in a bit of classical Japanese literature and you've got yourself a show many will frown upon the thought of watching. Watching Chihayafuru taught me to go into shows blindly. To not be swayed by common opinions and decide for yourself if you like it. \\n\\n\r\nNow then, onto the review!\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the show briefly; Chihayafuru is about a high school student named Chihaya who fell in love with a certain card game called Karuta when she was younger. She fell in love with it after playing a certain character who'll play a role in the story. Her goal is to become the best Karuta player in Japan and become the so called ''Queen'' which is the title for the best female player. to summarize the game in short; There's 100 poems and each player is given 25 random cards with the second verse of a poem. Players are given time to place their cards on the floor in any way they want. A so called ''Reader'' will read the first verse of a poem and players are supposed to take the second verse to that card. The game is over if one side has no cards left.\\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that side has automatically lost since players are allowed to take cards from both sides.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a lot of things. It's a sports anime with real drama. It's a slice-of-life show with some romance mixed in. It's a show about a game maturing to a sport, and most importantly, It's a show where there's no main character. Every character feels like the protagonist of their own story. Yes technically Chihaya is the main character but the other characters get equal screen time, their own story and problems to deal with in great detail. I feel like it wouldn't do the show justice to call Chihaya the clear main character. I know and like characters like Taichi and Komano equally as much as Chihaya.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a good job setting the tone of the story. It's not overly complex. It's a simple story about a girl aiming to be the best in what she loves most. It's the execution that shines through. We experience the journey of Chihaya as she decides to set up a club, recruit members and in turn we experience the story of those members. There's a few things in the beginning that didn't make a lot of sense. If there's something to fault It would be that the recruiting of members felt forced. It didn't flow very well. The show would randomly introduce us to a character who you can instantly tell will join the club. It made the events leading up to that feel less significant. Outside of that the story is very well paced. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of Chihayafuru is it's characters. I feel like i've gotten to know every single character. We get a lot of insight about their rivals aswell. We find out their struggles, thoughts and goals just as much as our main cast. This is what makes Chihayafuru so good. Many times have I wanted to root for the enemy as much as for our main cast. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I feel like it's unfair to call Chihaya the undisputed main character is because there's loads of interesting character dynamic between our main cast. It's safe to say some characters spend more time with other characters than Chihaya. I feel like this is an important point in shaping them. They aren't all there for Chihaya. They're here for themselves, their own goals and to overcome their own struggles. To make friends in between and grow closer as a group. The way Chihayafuru handles it's characters is extremely comparable to Hunter x Hunter which has some of the finest characters i've ever seen out of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt heart Chihayafuru is as much a drama as it is a sports show. The thing that's so important for a show focused on drama to succeed is making believable characters with believable struggles. Without these two things you can't possible create drama that doesn't feel forced or overdramatized. It came to my surprise how real all the drama felt. To some characters Karuta means absolutely everything. Imagine when you lose a match you knew you could win by only two cards. If I was someone who was extremely passionate about karuta i'm sure I would shed some tears of disappointment and sadness. The feeling of wanting to get stronger but struggling to achieve that is something a lot of us can connect with. Being strong isn't for everyone. In fact, being strong requires determination and this is what the show depicts really well. Characters who are determined and motivated do their absolute best to become stronger and throughout the show we experience the results to that determination. It's a journey you don't want to miss.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru's sound department has done a remarkable job in creating proper background music and using them at the right time. At the same time their usage of NO sound has proven to be very succesful. In a game where hearing is crucial to success the lack of sound in some scenes actually help build tension and help you understand what the players go through right before a verse is read. The opening songs are fun and nice. It isn't anything special but it's the kind of song you'd expect for this kind of show. The ending songs on the other hand are extremely good and I still have both of them on repeat.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is a show you don't want to miss out on. It's just that good. While the beginning may seem like your generic ''let's start a club and recruit members'' what lies beyond that is something truly special. A journey with each character to what they find important and want to achieve. Chihayafuru has given me a feeling I haven't had in a long time. The desire to keep watching, wanting to know what'll happen next and being able to keep watching over our characters as some sort of silent guardian. I'm truly happy I've finally decided to watch and finish the show. As this is a gem you absolutely don't want to miss.\\n",

(And let us not forget about a couple of hotties;) YW)\\n\r\nI found myself enjoying this anime a lot more than I actually  thought I would at first, and I believe most of you will feel the same!

            "content": "It might be a long time ago, when an anime impressed me that badly. \r\nAt the first moment I asked myself why there was a card based anime which is tagged in sports. But I realized fast, that it's more about then just a card game.\r\nKaruta's a traditional japanese card game which refers to hundred poems of Japanese classics. There are individual matches and team matches, the ultimate ambition is about using good hearing, quickness, instincts, strategy, feelings and the connection between the poems/cards and yourself to win the matches and to become better Karuta players. You have to take the cards from the oppositeside faster than your opponent, while they were read and collect it  to win.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru could take you to the world of Karuta and maybe you'll start to love it even more, than you did for an anime. At least it worked for me. The hole anime's outstanding and somehow I'm thinking about to play Karuta somewhere along the way. So I hope you'll enjoy Chihayafuru as much I did it.",

            "content": "Chihayauru is one of the best anime i have ever seen !!!It has a mix of all genre i must say. When i read the description i saw Karuta, a card game. But when my friend told me that it is a very highly rated anime I thought why not to give a try and.....!! It is really awesome anime. \r\nSTORY \r\nThe anime starts with our protagonist Chihaya Ayase, who is an average girl , nothing special really, who has a dream of watching her sister the best model in the world! But when she met a new student named Wataya Arata, a transferred studentfrom Fukui, she realised that it can't be her dream. Wataya ( A karuta genius) introduced her with Karuta (A Japanese traditional card game where when the poem is read you have to find that card before your opponent does). Chihaya realised that playing Karuta is fun and she had the talent for becoming a Queen, a female Karuta Champion. \\n\\n\r\nThey made a team along with Chihaya's childhoood friend Mashima Taichi. But as they went to middle school they got separated somehow! But destiny united Chihaya and Taichi again in high school where Chihaya tries to make a Karuta Club so that she could challenge Arata at the Nationals! But karuta is not liked much by the people of Tokyo! Would she be able to make a Karuta Club ? and would she be able to become a queen????\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the characters are very unique and perfect. Their introduction was very smooth and even the side characters were introduced without disturbing the storyline!\\n\\n\r\nAyase is known as 'Beauty in vain'. She is very beautiful but the moment she speaks, it is broken by her tomboyish image. But its those very traits that reel you in. She is the joyous energy that keeps the group together, and despite her clear superiority in the game, genuinely cares for her friends, and helps aid them in their journey to pursue Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi, Ayase's childhood friend. He is a true friend of Chihaya, is always along with her for her help. His mental forte is unmatched to most every player the game has ever known; even once reciting every card at random in the entire deck of 100, just because he could. His family is privileged, and he is pressured by his parents to keep at the highest tier in terms of sports and exams. His brains keep him on par with the purists that achieve their status merely due to athletic prowess. He acts as the groups motivator and leader, often amping everyone out of their slumps with \"Just the right words\" to turn them around.\\n\\n\r\nArata represents the reverse side to Taichi, being the poorer, lesser appreciated, segment to the story. As the story progresses, his darker past becomes realized, and he continues to become a shining beacon for Ayase. \\n\r\nOthers are Nishida, another talented Karuta player after Arata and Desktomo-kun, a bookworm who finds a route to enjoy and make friends through Karuta and Kana-chan.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIt been a long after when i have seen a such a detailed animation. Every character has been made with pure detail. To be honest although animation is not that important but this anime has a perfects combo of animation character and story i have seen yet! \\n\\n\r\nThe character have perfect body design, face shapes and other details!!! Plus the comical backdrops and chibi moments are just great.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nDid i enjoyed the anime???\\n\r\nYes!! I did. Even after rewatching I had the same fun in watching it as i did for the first time. Even watching Karuta is fun I sometime wonder how fun it would be playing it on a real Tatami Floor. \\n\\n\r\nAnd most IMPORTANT\\n\r\nYou will enjoy to hear those Poems and the meaning behind every poem. Each episode is dedicated to one poem and it has been related so beautifully that my excitation levels were at 100% to watch the next episode!!\\n\r\nThe story has a quick pace so you won't get bored even for a second plus the comical backdrops and jokes keep the mood hilarious all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nI am using this as a separate heading to appreciate the Opening song 'YOUTHFUL' and the ending song 'Soshite Ima'. Guys to be honest its been after some time when i have heard such a beautiful opening!! Along with the singer's voice,  the lyrics are just great!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story has been beautifully woven into the Opening song and ..............I have no words to explain the beauty of this song!!!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nLong and short of it is that Chihayafuru is one of its kind. It's a masterpiece! You would regret if you have not seen this anime yet. It has all the elements in it , it has slice of life, comedy, romance , fun and yes!.......... you would love to see the Karuta tournaments for sure!!! Remarkable poetry and symbolism that will take your breath away. You will fall in love with karuta, that I can promise you. \\n\\n\r\nI can't predict your mood right now but let me gear up your excitation that it also has a season 2 which is even better than this!!!\\n\r\nand yes i forgot mention i give it a 10 in all the categories above!\\n",

            "content": "I rarely watch anime in the Slice-of-life/Sports genres since I don't find them adequately engaging; however Chihayafuru combines both of these in a fashion which makes for an entertaining watch. This review will only be based on the first season.\r\nThe story revolves around karuta, a real-life competitive card game popular in Japan. The protagonist, sixteen-years old Ayase Chihaya and her classmates start a karuta club at their school and participate in various national tournaments, ultimately aiming for the championship titles of Master and Queen. Basically that's the essence of the plot.\r\nHowever what makes this show interesting is the characterization of the protagonists. They are seriousabout the game they play, constantly trying to improve themselves and achieve perfection. The characters frequently get emotional about failures or successes. While such over-enthusiasm about a card game may seem slightly odd, the true beauty of the characters lie in the strength of their friendship and love; which is expressed through their shared passion for karuta. The touch of romance only adds to this delightful blend of adolescent emotions.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the creators must be commended for paying close attention to detail regarding the intricate rules of karuta as well as the detailed depiction of real-life playing venues, like the Omi Jingu shrine. The poetic history of karuta is also explored as well as beautifully interwoven into the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues in the second season, which I am yet to watch. Chihaya and her friends have yet to fulfill all their dreams, but their journey through the world of karuta is still to teach them many valuable lessons, not only about karuta but about life itself.\\n\\n\r\nScore : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRecommended.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've seen both the first and the second season of Chihayafuru and because I couldn't get enough I've also read all the manga I could find. I gotta tell you, it's amazing. My heart starts pounding just thinking about it. I really think you should watch this. \r\nDON'T WORRY, NO SPOILERS (unless you think game rules are spoilers then just skip that)\r\nChihayafuru is about people playing a card game. As many others I thought, well that can't be all that interesting I'm not really into sports or games of any kind, so that aspect didn't really appeal to me. I do like my anime charactersto have spirit, ambition and passion, though and the anime seemed to have those, so I thought I'd give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nI was right that the characters have passion but they have so much more! Chihaya is a good main character, she's impulsive, enthusiastic and passionate but she would be nothing without the rest of them. Every single one of the characters has a different view of Karuta (the card game) and life and a separate role in the anime. Everything feels incredibly balanced and some characters have amazing development. Chihaya more than anyone learns new ways to look at Karuta, her passion every episode. The game itself mesmerizing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nTHE GAME \\n\r\nThe anime is about the card game Karuta, the basic rules of Karuta are that there are a hundred cards, on every card is a traditional poem that was written in Japan over a span of hundreds of years. 50 of those cards are laid out on a playing field, beween two players. All the hundred cards are read in a random order. The person who touches the right card on the field first gets the card, when you take a card from the opponents side you can give them one of yours, when your half of the playing field is empty you win. \\n\r\nIt sounds simple and quite boring but it's NOT. In order to touch the right card quickly, cards get flung of the playing field, people are sweating, thinking and reacting at full speed and crazy-eating chocolate in between these intense games. To really play Karuta at top level you need memorization skills, good hearing and senses, good posture, analytic and strategic skills, precision, strength, speed, perseverance, an emotional connection to the cards and so much more that I'm starting to think it's the most amazing thing in the world, and I've never even played the freaking game. \\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nI'm thinking this is shoujo, but it's not at all your typical romance. The tiny bits of romance that are in the anime made my heart pound like crazy but it is nowhere near the main focus. The story, though centered around Karuta (which you will come to love, I promise) is also about life. There's great emotional dept that I would never have looked for going into this, but that is just there. It's about team work, perseverance, friendship, support, poetry, ambition, sportsmanship, drive, intelligence, happiness and love. Some serious questions are raised about talent vs. hard work that apply to anything, and the characters are just so real that I felt every win and loss. It's also just very fun to watch, I loved everything.\\n\\n\r\nART & MUSIC\\n\r\nSo this always becomes sort of an afterthought in my reviews because the story and characters are so important to me. I thought everything was perfectly fitting, it's also great to see the anime compared to the manga because it's in color you can see the movements and the amazing colors. The voice actors were great and the theme song drags you into the story immediately. You will come to love the soundtrack as with (almost) every anime you've ever loved :)\\n\\n\r\nTASTE MATTERS\\n\r\nSoo I'm afraid that I've been raving so for the sake of being objective I'm going to tell you some things about the anime that you might not love even if I did:\\n\r\n- If you're watching this solely for the romance it's gonna be a long and frustrating ride.\\n\r\n- It is, ultimately about a game and people who love that game. I think I've made a compelling argument about why you should watch it anyway, but they are doing that a lot so if it's not for you or if you think playing a game is an incredible waste of time you might not get their passion. \\n\r\n- Though it is very different from most shoujo I've watched it is set up as one: the flashbacks, the art and the high school club theme are not very new and original, they don't need to be, but if you hate the set up you might not like the anime. \\n\r\n- The characters, though realistically portrayed, are very well balanced for the story. Everyone has a specific role in the group and the story. It is part of what makes the story great but it may feel too convenient and manufactured for some. \\n\\n\r\nDon't judge too quickly though, you might miss something you could have loved!\\n\r\nEven if one of the points mentioned above screams no at you, I'd recommend you try it, because it might have been a no for me and I loved it anyway. So have fun, I hope this was helpful, and thanks for reading the entire thing, haha\\n",

The side characters are all cool. \r\nI particularly like Komano and Taichi because you know they work hard and come up with strategies on how to win. They spend time analysing the situation in a calm manner. In standard anime fashion, they are the worst in their categories. The winners are Chihaya who has been running a single style for the last many years and Arata who just came backfrom a break but he is born genius, so yeah.. ugh. \\n\\n\r\nSo you know, hard work and a cold analytical mind is for losers. Winners are born with innate talent bla, bla.. yawn. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the worst part, the romance aspect of this is just.. eww. Just rename it \"Friendzone! The Anime\" instead. GG Taichi. Its a disservice to call this a love triangle. Fuck Arata srsly.\\n\\n\r\nNot returning for season 2. (Goes into corner and sobs for Taichi)\\n",

            "content": "Before I start my review, I think some people are going to see my scores and go, \"Huh? NANI!?\" Just hear me out.\r\nI will admit that Chihayafuru was really enjoyable. I really did have a great time watching this anime. However, the flaws of this anime were pretty evident and I'm a little harsh when it comes to them. Firstly, let me start off with what I did like.\r\nPositives\r\nCharacters - I loved the characters in this series. From Chihaya's \"all Karuta, all the time\" personality, she's a ditz but we still love her because she's just so nice about it, to Taichi's \"I'm smart andarrogant but despite that, we still feel for his internal struggle to admit his feelings for Chihaya. Even the side characters like Retro-kun and Dr. Harada. There were just so many enjoyable characters  that I can't really pick out a character that I just couldn't stand. Even the grumpy, old teacher was a riot when she warmed up to the karuta club.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Music - The animation was gorgeous. The color palette that they decided to go with in the artwork for this anime was spectacular. The characters looked stunning...at least the ones that were supposed to. I'm sure there aren't many people out there that think Nishida or Retro looked marvelous. Either way, the artwork was great, I loved it. What I loved even more was how the music fit so well. \\n\\n\r\nStory (kinda) - This is touch and go because there were some elements of the story I didn't like. To be more specific, I loved the story revolving around Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata. I loved the romantic/friendships tension between these three. It was your classic love triangle except it didn't suck.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\nPacing - This was the killer to me and why I only gave it a 7 on my overall score even though I gave it 8s and 9s for everything else. The pacing of this anime was WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too slow. There were entire episodes were VERY little was accomplished in the grand scheme of things. Hell, there was a mid-season review episode...WHY?! Why would you have a mid-season review episode for an anime that moves at a snail's pace? Yeah, we sort of know what happened between episodes 1-12...not much has happened in the grand scheme of things for us to forget what happened all the way back in episode 2 or 3. To top it all off, the ending was extremely unsatisfying. Now, I'm the type of person where I don't like long running anime series. Anywhere between 12-26 episodes  is perfect. Going beyond that feels like stretching. This anime? They set it up for a sequel after 25 episodes...and probably another 25 episode season at that. For this anime, that feels too long. \\n\\n\r\nAccomplishments and Storytelling - WARNING, SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE ANIME. I look back and contemplate, what did this series accomplish? Did Chihaya become Queen? No. Did she come close? No. Did she at least improve from midway to final? Actually, no, it felt like she got worse. Well, did Arata become Master at least? No...Well, did he at least come close? No...Um, did he improve? I guess? Considering he quit karuta for a year and a half before being suckered into it again by Chihaya and Taichi, I guess you could say he improved. *sigh* Well, how about the relationships between Chihaya and Taichi or Chihaya and Arata? Did those go anywhere? Nope. This anime \"hinted\" at a potential romantic pairing between either of those two and none of those really happened. Overall, for a 25 episode anime, it just didn't progress much at all. Many of the plot points that were established early on  seemed to have zero progression. It seemed the writers felt as though we should have a closer understanding of some of the competitors in this karuta competition than of the main characters. I'm sorry, but that's poor storytelling. While I'm all for side stories and side characters, when it seems like this anime is making a greater effort to tell their stories than the main characters, we have a problem. END SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI know its a rather funny statement to make, but this anime had a great story with poor storytelling. It HAD a plot to work with and...just didn't work with it. The characters were great, it was nice watching them for 25 episodes but the pacing of the overall story was slow, monotonous, and I caught myself continuously saying \"Are we going to accomplish something yet? We have 5...4...3...2...episodes left and still nothing?!\" Chihayafuru was one of those animes where I will say I'm glad I watched it but felt really disappointed with the overall product.",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review about an anime, but Chihayafuru just deserves it.\r\nThis is about some girl playing a really old Japanese card game, how can this be interesting?, well, it IS interesting. I got to see this series because of the game, it just caught my attention, that's all, but I didn't think I would've enjoyed it this much, and I don't believe how can it be so unpopular right now, since it exceeds on every aspect any Josei or Shoujo always lack of.\r\nAs I'm a boy, I am just not cut to see a Josei or shoujo anime, since I always expectsome bishounen dirtbags going around with some submissive girl who is always cute, but damn no, Chihayafuru is just the perfect example of how a josei or shoujo should be.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9/10): So there's Chihaya, a beautiful girl who loves to play karuta, since she wasn't good on anything before playing it, and now she want to create a club, but encounters some difficulties(since it's an old Japanese game, nobody is really interested to join). The Anime explains well how to play the karuta game, with very refreshing scenes and really digestible animations, also the meaning of some of the poems (each card contains a 1 of 100 poems from 100 Japanese poets) so you can actually understand what's going on on each game.\\n\\n\r\nThe flashbacks and the rest of the story is pretty interesting, sometimes people can get really bored with this stuff, but on this series each flashback can really get you hooked, the story can get pretty intense sometimes, but naturally of course, that's what I really like about Chihayafuru\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt(15/10) The art is simply beautiful, I give it a 15 because I really can't give less, the character's design are really refreshing, the animation is God-tier and the scenery is simply amazing, can't really write more about it because it's  excellent for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound(11/10) This really captivated me, the main theme is extremely beautiful and the rest of the ost is pretty amazing too, the opening gave me the same warm feeling I got from Ano hana, no more to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10): It's a pretty special characteristic of the series, each one is Unique, and has it's own problems and cualities, from the extremely active Chihaya(when it comes to Karuta) to Desktomu and Porky, but each one develops well through the series, sometimes I get irritated with Taichi, but it's ok.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10), If you ask me how much I enjoyed it, you should watch my face in front of the Tv, each game it's really, really intense, and really makes you go and try to play sometime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really liked this anime, everything is just from good to perfect and you might not expect much from it, but then it really really kills you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked or disliked this review, please let me know!",

            "content": "I\u00b4m sorry that this review will get rather long but this time I just want to write that much about this anime ;) \r\nSometimes you stumble across one of those anime which happen to feel different, whether they are good or not is up to you but still they are/feel different.\r\nChihayafuru is one of that kind.\r\nBasically, it\u00b4s a mixture of sport, a little comedy and drama which is not the most common type of anime but definitely not unique either.\r\nTo sum up the whole anime: Chihayafuru is all about \"Karuta\", nothing more, nothing less.\r\nKaruta is a Japanese game using cards with poems written on them.\r\nTowin the game, the player has to win a certain card on the game field which is the appropriate card to a different one (also a poem) which is being read out by a third party.\\n\r\nIf you touch the right card before your opponent does, you win that card.\\n\r\nOnce you manage to clear your field (25 cards for each player) you win the game.\\n\r\nSo basically, it\u00b4s all about memorizing all cards/poems plus the appropriate cards/poems and being faster than your opponent.\\n\r\nThis is a VERY simple way to describe the game, if you watch Chihayafuru you will come to understand that it\u00b4s way more difficult than it might sound up to this point of the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime involves six main characters, the five Karuta club members and a friend of the two founders of the club, who happens to live far away from them and therefore does not appear that often. Nevertheless, he is one of the  important characters, if not the by far most important one.\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the strong points of Chihayafuru because the five members of the Kurata Club are all quite unique in their appearence, behaviour and their way of playing the game, one uses her speed, one pure mathematics and another his memorizing skills.\\n\r\nUsing their different abilities, one can easily see the differences in their style of play which is important for the anime, otherwise it would get boring quickly.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the battles, they happen to be surprisinlgy interesting, one would think that an anime all about sitting on the floor and touching cards has a high risk of becoming monotonous but the battles are really intense and thrilling and as I have already mentioned, the style of play changes with every character of the Karuta club.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good aspect of the anime is it\u00b4s humor, they\u00b4re not frequent enough to call Chihayafuru a comedy anime and they are not breath taking or jaw dropping but the gags are enough to reduce the tensed atmosphere which is omnipresent because of the high aims of the Karuta club.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also well done.\\n\r\nUnlike some shounen anime (just for the shit storm, lets\u00b4s mention SAO at this point), there are many setbacks and defeats for the Karuta Club, so we\u00b4re not bound to watch Chihaya and her friends, being totally overpowered, blasting their way to the top of the world tree... uhm national championship.\\n\r\nFurthermore, unlike even more shounen (take a look at DBZ), the better players never seem to outrun the inferior ones, we actually get to see a lot of progression, even the screentime is allocated nicely, although two of the five members can\u00b4t do shit against the three good ones.\\n\r\nSo no Yamcha, no Chiaotzu but equally shared focus.\\n\r\nThat\u00b4s why I said this anime is somewhat different, of course, there are more facts like how the school settings stereotypes are completely ignored and how the strongest player of the club has the biggest flaws, problems and the smallest understanding of the whole game.\\n\r\nThese things made Chihayafuru feel some kind of unique to me and I cherish that.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are debatable aspects of Chihayafuru as well, the anime explains a lot of techniques and rules which can feel tedious, though it\u00b4s important to understand the game which makes up the whole anime.\\n\r\nI can understand if poeple stop watching tha anime due to the seemingly endless talks about one syllable, two syllable and dead cards, positioning techniques and movement patterns.\\n\r\nLike I said, tedious but necessary, necessary but tedious. \\n\r\nAlso, if you expect the anime to involve anything else than Karuta, you\u00b4re bound to be disappointed, of course, there are some other aspects like love but they are almost crushed in an instant.\\n\r\nOne scene from Chihayafuru sums it up:\\n\r\n* Cell phone rings* \"Sorry, it\u00b4s my girlfriend... hey there... mhm ... mhm... yeah, let\u00b4s break up.\" \"Wait, did you just break up with your girlfriend?!\" \"So what, let\u00b4s play some FUCKING KARUTA !!!\"\\n\r\nI know that this is totally taken out of the context but it still does um up the overall attitude towards anything that is not Karuta.\\n\r\nI know there is some stuff going on behind the scenes, especially one character does a lot of thinking, and they sometimes think about things like love and so on but nothing really happens.\\n\\n\r\nTo come to an end, Chihayafuru is a surprisingly interesting anime about an old card game with intense battles and loveable characters.\\n\r\nIn spite of that, there is nothing else than Karuta in this anime, so if you can\u00b4t bring yourself to like this game, you may not enjoy Chihayafuru very much.\\n\r\nTry to at least give it a shot, I had A LOT of fun with this anime.\\n\\n\r\n+\\n\r\n Characters, Equality among the Characters, Intense Battles, Humor, Opening (!!!)\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n A lot of theory, Nothing else than Karuta\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But as it often goes, first 3 episodes are crucial and either you get hooked or youare off the hook. For me, it was the first one. I kinda like those casual animes where the main protagonist do not end up saving the whole world in the process (although once in a while, those are good to watch too) and this one is a perfect example how to make sport anime.\\n\\n\r\n Each match does not take more than one or one and a half episode, which in comparison with like Kurokos basketball is really really short (like really, one basketball match that takes up to 5 episodes or something like that...), here it is sometimes settled in 12 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development cannot be discussed here without spoilers, so all I can tell that you can see progress with each of the protagonist from the beginning to the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs the music goes, nothing memorable here, sometimes I even forgot that there is some music playing in the background. I tried to watch into and outro more than once, but still I always ended up skipping it (nothing beats Spice and Wolf...)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Chihayafuru is one of those sports animes which can captivate you even if you do not know anything about the sport, because the struggles of the main heroes captivate you that you can evend spend all day long watching this series.",

            "content": "I had this anime in my hard drive for a while, but I just never got around to watching it until this week. I kept postponing watching it, yet when I finally and actually started watching it, I was hooked. I finished two seasons in less than 4 days. I couldn't believe it myself. I had no idea what Karuta was. Usually when I get hooked on animes, I still take breaks from them, like 1-2 days. This anime I wasted no time at all. It was rather slow paced during intense matches, but I think that is what got me hooked to it. Ijust needed to know what happens next. I was often frustrated and sometimes the outcomes were predictable, but some reason it was still interesting. If you are wishing for a romance filled anime, look else where. This anime will frustrate romantics. You'll find yourself rooting for Ayase to be in love with Taichi one minute, then Arata the next. It's super frustrating, but that is also probably the main reason why I want to keep watching it and couldn't stop. I am also planning to read the manga. I give it a 9 overall, even though I did enjoy it so much because I was frustrated and decided to be stubborn with this anime. As a sport anime in general, it has all the elements you would ever want to see in what a real sports team should be. Each character brought their unique styles of Karuta into their team plays and it was interesting to see how each member took into account all the other member's hard work, love, and dedication into their own Karuta and made it extra special. It made the anime extra enjoyable and kept me on the edge of my seat every time.",

Like the majority of the viewers of this show, when I started watching it I didn't have a clue what karuta was about, but that didn't mind once I watched it, I became a karuta fan.\r\nThe story is very amazing from the start, at first they show you why Chihaya loves karuta and how does she bond the with other characters through karuta. What makes this show so exciting is how they manage to get you excited it intothe matches, the atmosphere around the games is so good because that even though you are not there and don't know anything about karuta, you feel anxious by the plays they make, the cards that are read, the outcomes, and when the music comes into the scene you get goose bumps. The pace of the story is well conducted it does not rush neither is too slow, its perfect, it's not the typical history where the main character win everything at the first try but i will not say more to avoid spoilers\\n\\n\r\nthe main and supporting characters are all interesting, it has a real amazing antagonist the mighty karuta queen Wakamiya Shinobu :)  \\n\\n\r\nThe development of the characters along the series is great you really will get hooked by them, and you will find Chihaya pretty captivating, she is really cheerful, i mean she is always happy,she is also a bit clumsy and yeah sure she only talks about karuta but let's face it, she manage to take you the karuta dark side with a smile xDD The story does not only centers in the main character, all of the characters are well developed and they contribute to make a exciting story.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound play a huge roll in the series, not only they make a great work into the music but also they accomplish to show the importance of the words, if you have seen the show or heard poetry reading you get what i say and if you don't, don't worry, you will understand me better when you watch it. You will learn about poems while the shows go on, so if you like poetry like me you have yet another reason to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nalso If you are like me, and give the director and studio some importance you should noticed that this series was directed by morio asaka, he is responsible for works like chobbits, Sakura cardcaptor ore monogatari and more, the studio is one called madhouse they are not that good(yeah right) xD so i don't need to tell more, this is not a beginners work, so don't feel insecure to watch it, and jump right at it\\n\\n\r\nLike i said at the beginning i can't really express how amazing was for me to watch this show,you will laugh, cry, feel disappointed, get excited and get inspired by this story. Chihayafuru is one of the best shows i have seen is that helps, so don't doubt even for a second and join the Karuta club. \\n",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a rare gem among all sports anime I have watched. More so, it significantly mixes a lot of overarching themes that genuinely tell a simple story in a refreshing manner. \r\nThe story in Chihayafuru somehow materialize a typical straightforward sports anime plot. In doing so, I can see strings of development among the characters as they try to engage in pursuing the classic beauty of the traditional Japanese game called Karuta. While Karuta is not necessarily considered as a formal sport, it follows that the pursuit to professionalism is exactly the main point of the series. \r\nThe main characters are very interesting inthis story. As such can be considered because a big influence of the series is the relationship triangle that forms between the three main characters. Yes, a relationship triangle. Not a love triangle. I considered it as such because it can be depicted that the main conflict of the series is the interaction of our main characters as they fall in love with Karuta. This is profoundly expressed by the help of flashback moments in the past. \\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, It can't be denied that there are some sweet and cute moments that are shared together with our main characters which definitely makes you continue moving on the the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I like about Chihayafuru is that it gives me a chance to appreciate the entirety of Karuta. Its literary composition and classical nature gives a solemn beauty that makes me feel serene yet inexplicably intense. \\n\\n\r\nWith this, I can say that the enduring tale of Karuta, the endearing artful characters, and the warm realistic story line threads together a beautiful tale about the pursuit of excellence while traversing along the path of connecting with people. \\n\\n\r\nAll told, It's a good watch. \\n\\n\r\nFor a note, Chihayafuru is meant to have a second season. So, don't expect the completion of the conflict in the matter by the end of the series. Nevertheless, its still a good ending. Moreover,  one will feel rewarded if they continue on to the second season.",

            "content": "\"Karuta isn't very popular in other countries. But because of that, if you became the best player in Japan, you'll be the best in the world.\" \r\nChihayafuru it is a sports anime, ok. But that's it? For me, it was so much more than that... At first, my expectations were really low because I don't like sports anime (better, I didn't like sports anime) but this anime changed my mind. Even though, I still don't consider it as a sports anime because, for me, Karuta is more than a sport... it's poetry. And then you may ask? Karuta, what's that? I can say that itis the most brilliant \"sport\" that I know of and that's the main topic of this anime: \"As long as we have karuta, we'll see each other again, won't we? As long as we keep playing, we'll see each other again.\" \\n\r\nKaruta is a card game based upon Japanese poetry, with a hundred poems as cards so memorization is key. The poetry is from the knowledgable book of poetry, or better, a book of hundred feeling placed into words by people of diferent 'worlds'. As such, in this anime you will see the greatness of the poetry and how the characters learn with it. \\n\\n\r\nThat's why I say that Chihayafuru is so much more than a sports anime. At least, for me it was. It shows us the greatness of love and dreams, the permission to cry and fight for what we want. Every character is so deeply different but, at the same time, is touched by the poetry. Like Oe Kanade said, Poetry can transcend any barrier. This anime also relates the struggles the characters have to achieve their goal. Even their goals could be different they find in Karuta the way of getting there. They connect and they get strong by playing along with karuta and by being passionate about that. \\n\r\nThis anime also has a fresh story of love. It's presented to us, the viewers, a love triangle but it is not overrated. It is told along with the main story and that's what makes it brilliant and tolerable. You feel the presence of that love problems but it is treated so gently that makes you with 'that' right feeling. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters presented are not boring or even overrated. Each one of them are unique in terms of personality and even in the looks. Chihaya is the main character and she's gorgeaus (actually for me it's hard to put a some characters as the 'main' because everyone of them have their place and spotlight). However, it is the others characters that shine, in my opinion. Specially Taichi and Oe. In a few word and quoting some parts of the anime, I'll describe them. I was not expecting that Taichi would turn into such a deep and complex character. At first, seems that 'random shoujo perfect guy' but I am glad that he turned out so much more than that. \\n\\n\r\n\"Love is when it isn't fun to be with that person. It's when nothing goes the way you want. When you're not having fun...and yet,,, You still want to be with her.\"\\n\\n\r\nOe Kanade it is, indeed, my favourite character in this anime. Even though she's 'secundary', she is really something in the entire anime. She is so deep and has kind of a magic aura, yes! a poetry aura. She's the one who extol and praise poetry. She makes us the characters and us see and feel how beautiful the words can be if spelled/wroted with the heart.\\n\\n\r\n\"We share the same feelings that they did in the past. However, Hundred Poets is an anthology of poetry. Their poems are still known a thousand years later, because they expressed their feelings and techniques\"//\"It's not difficult to compose poetry. You just have to translate your feelings into meter.\"\\n\\n\r\nAlong with that, the art style really delivers in the backgrounds and in the design of the characters. You actually can notice who is it, thank god.\\n\r\nThe animation it is pretty good too and makes the karuta matches really interesting and beautiful. The soundtrack is not perfect but it works in the right moments. \\n\\n\r\nSo... let's go the objective rates! \\n\r\nStory: 9 \\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime and, as such, it has a special place in my 'kokoro'. You will experience a wave of emotions because, inevitably, you will get attached to the characters. Don't be stopped because it is a sports game... It is so much more than that so give it a try! \u201cI hope they will fall in love with karuta. The way we did\u2026\u201d",

            "content": "A review from a recent anime i watched i'm planning on watching s2 so might as well do a review for s1 and to tell you the truth i thought this was gonna be some garbage even though its from madhouse studios after watching it i couldn't be more wrong it's absolutely great.\r\nStory- Read the synopsis for the story but in short it is a game and sport's anime with drama and other things from the beginning it honestly seemed like a romance but it wasnt. The MC is a female named chihaya she basically becomes friends with a guy named Arata who she warmsup to and he shows his love for karuta which is a japanese card game based on poetry and it turns into her passion and she becomes crazed about it. To cut this off, They all go their seprate ways and their future truly begins.\\n\\n\r\nOMG will i tell ya it was a really awesome story there is so much i want to write but i don't wanna spoil. From the story you get at least 2 really great things. One just because you're good doesn't mean you are a pro and it shows true determination and will and the desire to reach your goal but sometimes you just aren't at that point and you need to keep trying. Just a really awesome story you need to watch it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Madhouse had their hands on this so me telling you its good wouldn't give it enough justice the art is really great and as for the animation goes definitely really good from the vibrant colours to the sweat art style and animation to the kimono's and traditional Japanese wear i cannot tell you how much i liked it, It was really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Amazing soundtrack definitely goes perfect with the dramatic and thrilling moments when 2 characters are playing a super intense match up of karuta the opening is really damn good and the ending is quite decent as well the impact of the players as they slam the cards the voice acting and basically every minor thing and major thing just go hand in hand to making something just sound good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- You get quite a bit of characters many minor but add to the story and the major ones you see throughout the show, Chihaya is the MC beautiful,passionate,motivated,emotional everything about her fits as a MC and it fits perfect for this anime having a childhood friend who introduces you to something new and continuing with that new thing as your passion just really good, Tachi chihaya's childhood friend at first he comes off as a major jealous,rude and a bully really but as the story goes on you learn why he is kind of like that early on and he later on becomes a really cool dedicated person after giving up on playing serious karuta tries to catch up to the other mc, Arata is that other mc, Quiet and distant at first you learn his story from the anime as well he also gives up on karuta and gets his passion back and starts from scratch after being the best karuta youth in japan as a child, Kanade who later on comes in loves japanese poetry and was fascinated by karuta because the game told poetry she is new and basically she becomes a student while she is mentored by Chihaya and tachi which is a really nice addition as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- In the shortest way possible the series is amazing i don't really watch sport's anime but this has given me a new look on sports anime and i think i might give that category in anime a watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 it is a really deserving series for this score not much else i could tell you, Romance was the reason i wanted to watch this but their is very little or not at all just tiny hints but im glad it took the non romantic route, Just a really good anime that i really enjoyed this is NOT A BIASED REVIEW BTW i just happened to really enjoy this way more than i thought.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\r\nIf you have gotten to this point and have actually read the review give it a vote helpful/ not helpful much appreciated also if you could give some feedback on the review it would be greatly appreciated this is only to make the reviews better.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Note: This is a review of Season 1 and some aspects of Season 2 of Chihayafuru*\r\nPassion. Determination. Conviction. Those ideas can carry the human spirit to great distances. But sometimes, just having those in your mind are not enough. You also need talent. As someone who has competed in sporting and music competitions, I know firsthand how it feels when you carry passion for the thing you're doing but compared to someone who is talented, you will never be the best. Indeed, it can dampen your spirits but at the end of the day, it's always a great feeling to know that you gave ityour best shot.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is an anime that explores those ideas. It is a story about (competitive) Karuta, a Japanese card game. The rules are pretty simple: the players listen to the card read by a reader and attempt to be the quickest to capture that card on the mat. The first player who clears their side of the mat wins the game. Although it sounds simple, participants must be able to memorize all (or mostly all) 100 poems used in Karuta. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a beautiful girl (who we learn her name is Chihaya) putting up a poster in her high school (Mizusawa High School) advertising the competitive Karuta Club. However, her beauty is not supported by her manners as she frequently acts like a tomboy. While sitting on the grass one day, Chihaya meets her childhood friend, Taichi, who is attending the same school as her. They mull over about the days when she, Taichi, and one other friend, Arata, were playing Karuta together and participating in team tournaments together. The world seemed rosy to Chihaya until Arata had to move away. As a result, the dream team was disbanded and the boys started forgetting about Karuta. However, Chihaya continued to pursue her dream as being the Queen of Karuta. Seeing her passion for the game, Taichi decides to pick it up again and that brings us back to the scene at the first episode of the anime: Chihaya putting up a poster advertising the competitive Karuta Club. The first season of Chihayafuru is mostly about Taichi and Chihaya building the team to 5 players. The second season highlights how each player on the Karuta Team realizes their inner potential and displays it on the competitive stage.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Chihayafuru really engaging is that there are multiple lenses you can use to appreciate the story. It is a story about growth, about teams, about passion, and about determination. There are so many elements that give Chihayafuru its flare that my review cannot do it justice. So I will only touch on the aspects that popped out for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in season one is paced very well. It captures the passion that the players have for the game. However, the anime reveals that passion for the game comes in many different forms, aside from passionately playing it. Ooe, a girl who joins the club, is passionate about the poems in Karuta. For each card, she sees a different shade of emotion and she uses those meanings to guide her to victory on the mat. Komano (or lovingly called Desktomu) is interested in analyzing player patterns and the statistical side of Karuta and he uses his niche to help his teammates play smarter and realize the strengths and weaknesses of their game. Karuta is more than a game of speed and memorization. It is a game where everyone can find a thing they can like about it. \\n\\n\r\nBeing an anime about a competitive event, it does fall trap to the endless monologues during games. It gets even more excessive in season 2 as the story starts providing endless backstories for each team and for each player. Although we get an opportunity to understand the other players, it got to the point that even the anime made fun of itself for providing a flashback for a minor group of characters. This sort of writing puts the story back a few steps as you start pleading the anime to finish the match as soon as possible so we can see more Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a romantic storyline in the anime. If you are seeking an anime with lots of moments where characters are confessing their feelings for each other, Chihayafuru does not do that. The anime portrays romance as a driving force that pushes our characters towards their goal. Though as the audience, we can see that the romance is heavily implied. Hence, the sprinkled romance provides the spice to the show but is not one of the foundational tastes. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are only 3 main and many more supporting characters, there are no useless characters to the anime. I can almost describe the cast as an actual team where everyone is doing something to help the progression of the story. Despite the great chemistry between all the characters, the main characters are still in the spotlight. They are Taichi, Chihaya, and Arata. \\n\r\nTaichi is your typical high school heart throb. He's smart, handsome, and everything else a girl sees in her ideal boy. He is pretty good at Karuta but being around brilliant Karuta players, he doubts his playing ability. He also has this thing for Chihaya but, without spoiling too much, let's say that like how he sees his Karuta ability, he needs to have more confidence in himself.\\n\r\nArata is another heart throb in his own way. Armed with his glasses and snake-like reflexes, he snatches cards off the mat like they are his prey. He's a Karuta prodigy but he is also Chihaya's first teacher. So, he becomes immortalized in Chihaya's mind as a Karuta deity. Despite being a top player, he is not at all arrogant. In fact, neither Taichi nor Arata are.  They are both humble men who are passionate about their sport.  \\n\r\nChihaya is the story's central figure. Aptly nicknamed \"a beauty in vain,\" Chihaya sports the beautiful looks but doesn't have the \"female charms\" to make her the Queen of her high school. However, her charm comes from her passion for Karuta and her relentless pursuit of perfection. She defines the word obsessed because Karuta is food and water for her. It also helps that she has a knack for Karuta but still lacks the final touches to make her the best in the game. \\n\\n\r\nAll three characters develop very well by the end of two seasons. However, out of the two male MCs, Taichi develops the most as he is given the most screen time. He develops from being a boy who has almost given up on Karuta, to playing it but doubting his playing abilities, and finally to being able to recognize that he can play his style of Karuta as successfully as any of the top players. On the romantic frontier, as a child he saw Arata and Chihaya as his friends but once he gets into high school and starts the Karuta Club with Chihaya, his feelings towards Chihaya change. What makes him a complex character in this respect is that he realizes how Chihaya sees Arata and he must struggle to decide how he can convey his feelings for her while still being friends with Arata. Arata becomes his rival not only on the playing mat, but also in the war of love.\\n\r\nDue to the fact that he has limited screen time, Arata is not shown much development. However, he does overcome his reason for not playing Karuta and once he picks it up, he excels at it. The main struggle that he faces while playing Karuta is that he only plays individually and the only time he ever played as a team was with Taichi and Chihaya. He is the character who questions what is the purpose of a team, and how is playing as a team different compared to playing individually?\\n\r\nChihaya's development is focused on how she develops as a player, moving from form to form and realizing her unique abilities that can help her win matches. Throughout both seasons, she experiences many losses and as a viewer, it gets frustrating to see our favourite female lead lose matches but as a character, she grows from those experiences to become a great player. Another interesting aspect of her development centers on how she sees Arata. Being her first teacher, she respects him but gradually, her respect grows into admiration and possibly into worshipping Arata as a God. The anime begs the question: what sort of love does she have for Arata? It is a fact that she adores him as a friend but is it to the level of romantic love?  Her image of Arata is very complex and the anime leaves it to the audience to decide how they want her to see Arata. \\n\\n\r\nThe main supporting characters are those involved in Mizusawa's Karuta Club: Ooe, Komano (Desktomu), and Nishida (Porky). These characters do not get much development as they primarily serve as guides who help point Chihaya and Taichi in the right direction. As mentioned earlier, Ooe is passionate about the poems and Komano is a Karuta stats guru. They help show that Karuta is more than a game of memorization and swiftness. I could not see what Nishida brought to the story other than being the other good Karuta player in the club. \\n\r\nIn the second season, the club adds two additional members named Sumire, and Tsukuba. Sumire joins Karuta for the mere reason of getting closer to Taichi. As a result, if you have not recognized that Taichi has the hots for Chihaya, Sumire points it out for you. Tsukuba is in the story for comedic purposes as he makes his signature creepy face when playing games. The character juggling in the second season starts to get out of hand as the anime treats any character who has a line as a supporting or even as a main character. There are just too many backstories to tell that I want to say to the anime that it's alright if we don't know Player #5's onion-cutting tale of their path to success because they will not appear again. \\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the art in Chihayafuru is fabulous. Madhouse did a fantastic job of drawing all the characters to reasonable proportions. Chihaya is drawn very beautifully and makes her stand out as the female MC. Taichi is also well done in that he has realistic body proportions rather than the outrageous arm and leg lengths seen in typical shoujo anime. The colouring is also fantastic. Madhouse used very luscious colours especially when it came to the background scenery and the kimonos. The hand motions of the Karuta players were also drawn very realistically and it is evident that the studio did their research on how Karuta players move in game. Chihayafuru is definitely one of my favourite anime when it comes to the art department.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also well done. The OST of seasons 1 leans on strings and brass, giving it a very grand atmosphere to the show. However, it does get repetitive after hearing the themes over and over again. The OP and ED of the first season were also very good. The OP is upbeat with a soft voice leading us to the episode while the ED had that ancient and classy mood to it. Second season's OST started to become unnoticeable but the OP and ED did not drop in quality at all. \\n\r\nThe voice actors also did a fantastic job. Taichi is voiced by Miyano Mamoru who also did our favourite mad scientist Okabe Rintarou from Steins;Gate and he did not disappoint at all (but no evil laugh this time). Chihaya is voiced by the lovely Seto Asami who also did Matsuyuki from AnoHana and also the ED for both seasons of Chihayafuru. She portrayed  Chihaya very well, capturing her quirky, erratic, but yet very passionate personality. Arata is voiced by Yuka Terasaki who did a very good male voice, capturing Arata's soft nature.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chihayafuru is a very good anime. If you are looking for a romantic tale with a sports backdrop, you may be in for a disappointment. You may also feel underwhelmed if you are going into Chihayafuru thinking it's a \"certified fresh\" story. However, if you are into a good tale, with very good artwork, and don't mind learning some Karuta and Japanese poetry at the same time, definitely give Chihayafuru a shot!\\n\r\nIn the first few episodes of the first season, I was inclined to give it a 10/10 due to the great storytelling but the anime began to slow down and lacked the \"pop\" it had at the beginning. Because of the high bar that season 1 set, season 2 felt slightly underwhelming (primarily because of the flashbacks) but nevertheless still told a great charming tale. I would give season 1 a 9/10 and season 2 an 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my rather long review! Chihayafuru is a very good story and I would love to hear your opinions about it!! Are you a Team Taichi or Team Arata fan? Has the anime gotten you into Karuta (not me yet but I would love to play an English version of it using English poems)?",

            "content": "Let's start with the fact that I am not interested in sports anime. I always thought that they will be boring for me. Yep, I am so prejudiced.\r\nBut this didn't prevent me from starting Chihayafuru - I was curious about it, because it had a really good score. So, I said let's beat the stereotype and give it a chance. Here are the results of my venturesome operation.\r\nStory : 5\r\nThe anime follows the story of a team of kids and how they got into Karuta - a card game that demands good memory and agility skills. It depicts their passion and development as the yearspass, as long as the bonds that form between them, because of their common enthusiasm towards the game.\\n\\n\r\nWell, as I lack interest over such a subject, I didn't find it particularly appealing. Neither original to be frank.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 5\\n\r\nThe art was mediocre, I found it rather outdated as it reminded me the art of late '90s. The eyes were a little freaky with the pupils painted deep into the iris. They tried to make them look more realistic, but the result was creepy.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\nIt was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. The themes fit nicely, but nothing excited me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nMost people were likeable and consistent, although there was much of character development throughout the series. It simulated nicely the coming-of-age part of the cast. The supporting characters were given special attention, too, as they grew to like Karuta and know themselves better through it. Helping each other understand themselves and their playing style was interesting, too.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I couldn't relate to was their enthusiasm. Ok that's natural. But I found their emotional outbursts exaggerated. I almost laughed when they were shouting and crying expressing their fondness of each other or Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5\\n\r\nI enjoyed about the 1/4 of all the episodes - it consisted mostly of Karuta contests. I liked observing their thoughts while they played and I got a little anxious over who would win, too. That was nice. But the first 12 episodes were too melodramatic for me and no formal failure was displayed so I was losing interest. Then it got interesting for maybe 6 episodes and then it got boring again. I am a little cautious of giving 2nd season the chance to change my opinion. \\n\\n",

There's not too much flashbacks, romance, action, fights, comedy, etc. It's just so well done. \r\nWell, to begin, I had to make a review for it. If I could have 10 favourite ( yes \"ou\" as I'm Canadian ._. ) animes, it would definitely be one of those! \r\nThe story revolves around a group of 3 friends playing a game which I had never heard of it! kara... something. Anyways, they all sort of have the same goal. Not sure if the description says so but I mightas well not say it. Well, as seeing the picture you can see it's mainly about that game and it makes it so different from other animes. You get a bit of Japanese history too. I think I always give 10 when I can truly enjoy it and can't wait for next episode. There are all the basic elements in this anime; you know such as romance, let's call it action as I'm not sure of any other word to describe it xD, suspense (not the scary type), comedy. etc. AAH I'm not sure if i can explain myself clearly but just WATCH IT! i'm sure you'll enjoy it unless you are like a complete rock T_T\\n\\n\r\nThe story explains everything there is to know. Every flashback covers so. The art is good, character development is so too, and enjoyment is absolutely BUENO n__n I truly don't want to say much as to go into detail because I want to keep all my reviews FREE FROM SPOILERS. Yeah I also haven't done many reviews so no expert here. But as you can see, many reviews here praise the anime well (8-9/10) \\n\r\nJust give it a try, you'll get hook up right at the first episode. The develop of the story is excellent as it tries to keep the whole anime interesting and it delivers! *-* \\n\\n\r\nAdios :3\\n\r\nPS: watch season 2!",

My favorite thing about this anime is watching the art of Karuta unfold in front of me.\r\nMy second favorite thing about this anime is watching the characters' passion for karuta grow. It's an inspiring story about following your dreams, and it's not cliche at all, despite that being one of the most cliche tropes in story-telling. \r\nThere's a hint of a love triangle, but it doesn't dominate the story. The story is about one girl excelling at what she loves. Chihayafuru is an outstanding, endearing, and heartwarmingwork of art.",

Here's why.\r\nAlthough the art isn't the most amazing part of this anime, this passion driven story which focuses on themes such as friendship, team spirit, and coming of age, really spoke to me. The characters are well thought out and developed, and I truly felt like I got to know them through their aspirations, background, and relationships.\r\nThe Chihaya-Taichi-Arata love triangle is possibly the most frustrating part of the story, but I enjoyed watching something that focused on other themes rather than exclusively focusing on a love triangle. By watching Chihayafuru, you'll learn about karuta,the Hyakunin Isshu and other elements of classical Japan. If you enjoy sport-centered anime, you'll also probably like this story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly recommend this anime to almost everyone, especially if you want something to unwind and relate to. I highly enjoyed the nostalgia of being and supporting highschool friends, as well the excitement around karuta tournaments (you'll probably end up watching the real thing after the anime!). Highly recommend.\\n\\n",

Kick back and relax folks as I bring you a short n sweet spoiler free review of Chihayafuru.  Ill shuffle first....\r\nStory: 9\r\nWe follow our main characters Chihaya and Taichi as they recruit members for their newly established high school karuta club.  In making new friends and the support of old companions Chihaya and the club have made their first steps to becoming the best high school in competitive karuta.  This anime is bloody gorgeous handsdown.  The dialogue used between friends really gives you a sense of belief that these teenagers are in the springtime of their youth.  Watching the karuta matches play out was invigorating.  Don't know what karuta is? best to watch it and find out urself like many others did including me lol, more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nWord Rating:  Yep put away my yugioh deck!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe anime artwork is nice and pleasant to the eye.  The character design   \\n\r\nis crisp and great to look at.  Some of the characters actually have lips which is good to see.  You can watch in 1080p but I watched it in 720p resolution and thought it was fine.\\n\\n\r\nWord Rating:  Yep naked Greek statue........? umm\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\\n\r\nA pleasant musical experience with excellent delivery brings a certain ambiance to the anime also showing connotations of fun, laughter, love, and youth. Kousuke Yamashita does a superb job at showing this through his music and also targeting specific scenes with musical accompaniment adding extra effect.\\n\\n\r\nWord Rating:   Yep chuck on Beats by Dre\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime and a must watch, an overflow of fun, laughter, and good times.  This genre is josei but men will enjoy this anime just as much as the ladies or perhaps even more, you never know.  Time to pick up on my karuta skills, sore arm guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nPeace out ZEUS! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Yet the charactersare really of a mixed bag. I found almost all characters in some way interesting, all having their own issues, yet the main female protagonist feels for me empty. She is supposed to be at least 16 I think, but for me she has the personality of a child, all other characters are more developed than her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo in general this anime is nice to watch, it is not that good as hikaru no go, or kaleidostar, but still interesting to watch.",

            "content": "I have never liked sports mangas or animes. I consider them very unattractive. However, in highly paradoxical contrast, I love those little-known address, or related to games that are not part of that particular standard canon circumstances sports games. Such is the case of Chihayafuru. the anime that owns this review.\r\nThis Josei serie tells the story of a girl named Chihaya Ayase, a beautiful woman who is only beautiful in appearance, as usually spoil things when he speaks or moves. Since childhood, he has had as main dream to see his older sister turned into the most prolific japanese model. However, after tripping over aguy (Wataya), she will begin to enter the competitive world of Karuta, a card game consisting store and grab letters placed in a field, which have poems belonging to the compilation of 100 poems. The game ends capturing Chihaya to the point that it becomes an obsessive player, reaching to change their \"dream\" when he realized that he must do something for her and not for others, plaining the goal, with the help and support of his own student club, to become the best Karuta player.\\n\\n\r\nIn my experience, Josei is one of the most particular anime genres for me.  I must admit; but as I said about Shouwa Genroku, the sleeves or dramatic animes have captured me lately. Chihayafuru has an entertaining plot, with the nuances that characterize the genre, but without falling into circumstances what make decay they are proposing. The story achieved through execution, turn something as simple as a traditional japanese card game in a whole immersive experience that, during the first 25 episodes of its first season, will take us without problem by a narrative dynamics of drama, romance, slice of life and aggressive Karuta competition. Even without knowing the rules of the game, the manga makes you stoke your curiosity, and the brutal encounters, full of a excelent dynamism, makes the unforgettable experience that makes you want to go to the next episode eager to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of drama, the series presents us early a love triangle between Chihaya, Taichi and Wataya, but develops very slowly, because it is not the focus of the series. This aspect, at least for me, it is welcome, therefore, although the approach between old friends who now confront indirectly by the same girl, is by far interesting, at least from the point of view of the series, something that is truth is that focusing on this issue would eventually be a distractor element rather than argumentally attractive. However, it is no lie that sooner or later, this dilemma will form a substantial part of the plot. The characters are extremely attractive, all have their touch, their spark, their quality that makes them entertaining and endearing. It is easy to empathize with them, because they are focused and developed, each with its own perspective in demonstrating its commitment to the competitive card game.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not remarkable, but at least the atmosphere meets anime, getting into their history and charismatic characters. if I have to emphasize negatives, now, I might mention that, sometimes, the story becomes somewhat focused on an unnecessary element, which is the desire of perseverance. Something similar happens in series like Bakuman. While the point of the argument is that the protagonist is exceeded every time he lose or something like that, the truth is that the message is not effective when the plot rubs you in the face every five minutes. It is very similar to YU-GI-OH and constant sermon about friendship. At the beginning it is nice if you mean well, but after a while, exhausted by leaps and bounds.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, despite the things concerning the sentimentality of personal achievement, Chihayafuru has elements that make it and absorbing, entertaining, and especially enjoyed worth every drop of sweat. Karuta encounters are formidable, charismatic characters, great animation, the history is pleasant, simple and easy to follow; but envelope. You want to see what happens in the next episode without losing a single second, and that, frankly, is the work of a good writer, a good mangaka and a good animation studio. It has their details, yeah, but damn, the virtues are, for far, most remarkable.",

What sets it apart is the beauty of the animation, the emotional intelligence of the story, and the game of Karuta itself.\r\nAs a lover and writer of poetry, I was immediately captured by the idea of Karuta. Each character has their own approach to the game andit is thouroughly explored. I relate most to the character Kanade becuase her drive comes from love of the cards and poems themselves. \\n\r\nI can't say enough good things about the anime so I wont even try.

            "content": "No Spoilers.\r\nThis is arguably the best sports anime I've ever seen.  I'm not much of a fan of sports anime, but this one really sunk its teeth into me right from the start.\r\nThis anime has no central strong point, but rather has a number of strong points which help to hold it together.  The characters are, for the most part, very well-written and relatable, with varied interpersonal dynamics reflective of their levels of knowledge of one another.  This is coupled with an aesthetic appeal which is rich and soundly supported by both visual and auditory quality.  The poems create a naturalmethod of Finally, the plotline, while simple, actually moves forward at a decent pace.  This is not a circular plotline, and the characters actually progressing is a welcome change of pace from other anime where nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\nThis was an anime I was considering giving a 9, but went with an 8, for the following reasons.  Two of the characters are particularly less-developed and seem somewhat shallow, one almost comedically written compared to the gravitas of the show.  Arata seems very vacant next to the other characters.  Also, more could have been done with the plot, which was the weakest of the strong pillars of this anime.  Finally, occasionally there has been episode instances of episode discontinuity, albeit extremely minor.  For these reasons, I couldn't give it a 9.  But it's still miles ahead of any other sports anime I've ever seen, and was a wonderful experience.  I'm highly anticipating seasons 2 and 3.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this anime to anyone who likes well-developed characters in sports anime, highly-aesthetic anime, or who just really likes Japanese poetry.",

            "content": "About Karuta- Karuta is a traditional Japanese game introduced by the Portuguese in the mid 16th century. In Karuta consists of three parts: the reader, a player, and the player's opponent.  When the reader reads the second line of thee poem and reads a green-looking card, the player must reach out for the card that is currently being read before his/her opponent. This may sound boring and dull however, this anime promotes Karuta and makes it appealing to others. \r\n    (Does not contain spoiler)\r\nStory- The story is quite simple and easy to understand. As it progresses, the main character just seemsto get more motivated into Karuta and seems to add more objectives with her new teammates. However, as more and more episodes started to appear, it started sparkling. There is jealousy, envy,love, and dominance spread throughout this series. It engulfs the atmosphere, giving it a special spice to the anime. In this series, the  special atmosphere and interaction between the player and opponent, uplifts this series more than it could appear to just have. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The art style of this anime is well thought out. It depicts the characters actions and motivation very well. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound track of this anime intensifies each situation given in the anime. As joyful as it has to sound, it screams a soundtrack of happiness. As terrifying and anxious the situation depicts, a scream of horror is heard. Just simply amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-  The characters in this series play a very important role in each situation. The characters have their own unique personality that enlighten their background story or what led them to what they had become. They develop and give an impression of the audience that each and almost every character in this anime is a round but not flat character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This was exactly like a roller coaster. It started slow and slowly began to move faster. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- This anime isn't only about wining and being a champion, it is the feeling that is spread of joy after that win. Not to mention, the love triangle and plot twists. Just simply great. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I know what you feel the first time you watched \"Chihayafuru\", sofor those who are looking forward to watch this, allow me explain it a little for those who are reading this review. Don't worry, this is a non-spoiler territory  as it only explains the rules of Karuta depicted on this anime (for a review, you can skip ahead):\r\nCompetitive Karuta or simply Karuta is a game from Japan that are compose of two opponents in one tatami mat. Each should comply under the rules set by the All Japan Karuta Association. There, players must put 25 cards out of 50 in the mat thatwere randomly selected from s total of 100 cards. Then, players must place it face-up wharever they want in a 87 cm wide and separated from their opponent's cards by 3 cm. Afterwards, players had a chance to memorize the cards or practice their strikes in 15 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThen, the reader starts the game by reciting an introductory poem, that given poem is not part of the game itself, it's more like a \"Ready, Set...\" phase of a match. Here's the transcript of the \"Ready, set...\" phase of Karuta:\\n\\n\r\n\"Naniwa Bay, now the flower blooms, but for winter. Here comes spring, now the flower blooms.\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter the reader reading it aloud, the reader now reads the first part of the poem, which is now the \"...GO!\" phase or the start of the game itself. The game of Karuta is unique as it uses your auditory senses and mental memorization with a mix of speed and agility to win this game. So, for example, if you hear \"Roses are Red...\" then you have to find the matching card of the given poem, which is \"violets are blue.\" If you touched the given card on your opponent's turf, remove it from play and give one card to your opponent's turf. You touched the wrong card, however, you get one card from the opponent instead. You can also defend the \"violets are blue\" card as well, when it was already recited, you can now remove the card from play. If both of the player's hands touched the given card, whoever card was set on the player's ground gets it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first player to get rid of all the cards in their territory wins.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, now that it's already out of the way. Let's talk about the anime itself. (LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\n\r\n\"Chihayafuru\" is a Sports game which was surprisingly... developed by Madhouse. Known for their brutal animes like, Stitch! (screams in fear), The Girl Who Leapt Thru Time (screams in fangirl), and... DEATH NOTE (screams in a traditional Death Note orchestra theme). Yep, the Studio who are responsible for their metal songs, mindgames and heart attacks, are also responsible for their light, well-written love story with a horrible cliffhanger... until Season 2 announced and released.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was executed great from Start to finish as it tells about the story of Chihaya Ayase, a \"Beauty in Vain\" who is die-hard fan of Karuta thanks to her potential love-interest and the one who introduces her to the game, Wataya Arata alongside Taichi Mashima. Arata appoints Chihaya back when they were a kid to become a queen thanks to her skills, Taichi was a brat still, telling Taichi that he is a loner, and bullying him both verbally and Physically. But, they work together as a team as they fight in a Team Karuta match in a nearby Karuta Society. Quite frankly, they detailed the main backstory real great as it covers first four of the 25 episodes of the main story. And this ain't a filler, no doubt! It's freaking fantastic and the game really hooks me up until the end of the game. The story also has a well-balanced Romance, Sports, Slice-of-Life  and Comedy. But what I really do not like the most is how it was ended. As it was released last 2013, I understand how fans are wanting to see more of Chihayafuru, some animes out there tend to end an anime in just one season enough. So cutting to that really, REALLY makes me want to see Chihayafuru more. But, since I'm late for the party, I've watched it this 2019 as I heard that the Season 3 is in the works. So, I gave it a try after watching some of the episodes before in our local Animax channel around 2014. At first, I don't really understand how the specifics works in this game, all I can see is just swiping cards and that was it. But as I watched the following episodes, all I can say is... Holy s***! That was good! But the cliffhanger is really a big nutcracker to me... I understand those who did waited for 3 years until the announcement of Season 2. But not me, though. Hahaha... :)\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is TOO BRIGHT, I had to adjust the brightness of our TV. I mean, jeebuz. But yeah, it's colorful indeed. But the brightness drawn in this game, especially when the competition or tournament arc came around, the insides really kind of messed it up for me, though. But the characters drawn here really characterize who they are. From a bland personality of Yumi Yamamoto to a beautiful girl like Chihaya. You get my point when it comes to the male counterparts... \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the character development, was achieved here also as well! I can't say more... :)\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound, hahaha... The opening song, YOUTHFUL by 99RadioService, really puts you on the edge of the seat and it is one of my favorite songs in an anime I've downloaded legally! I can't count how much I've repeated it and I don't skip them on the OP either. :) The Ending song, Soshite Ima by Asami Seto, was emotional too... That really balances on how the story has to offer for every following episodes. The cheerful song of YOUTHFUL represents the school life and describes the slice-of-life genre itself when comes to the tune while the melancholic tune represents the hint of what it is to come, mostly, hints about Chihaya wants to be with Arata. About a song depicts on no matter where is the lover is, she wants to know that she needs him and wants to meet him if they had a chance. The Voice Actors, is great too! I have no complaints. And the OST, the background musics on every episodes is, no doubt, one of the best composed songs I've ever seen that will definitely get you on the edge of your seats, especially when they are now playing Karuta.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... despite this anime was focusing on girl demographic. I, for one, as a male demographic who likes a more competitive sports anime, fantasies, comedy and loves Slice-of-life anime, really sets my expectations to this anime what other anime has to offer. But the Karuta represents here was a bit rushed though, I really hope they do it longer for about two episodes and describe more about the sports itself, especially those who are not familiarized in this very unique sport from Japan. It might easily be missed, sure. But, I for one, wants to watch it more about the sport itself. I really do hope it would be better like this one, or even higher on Season 2 and it's upcoming sequel. :)\\n\\n\r\nSo, I'll give this anime... A GODDAMN 9/10!!! RECOMMENDABLE!!!",

            "content": "I never expect a simple game like karuta can be so interesting in this anime.\r\n==============================================\r\nNOT JUST ANOTHER SPORT ANIME\r\n==============================================\r\nYes, it is like a sport. I compare this anime to another sport anime like chess, volley, badminton, soccer, etc.\r\nIt is just memorizing placement of your cards, memorizing enemy cards, hearing poems, and place your hand on top of the correct card. Simple as that!\r\nBut, this is different.\r\nPreviously I thought \"Ah, this is just another sport anime. If you win, you get prize and happiness. If you lose, you just train harder. If you face stronger opponent, you have to keep your spirit and never give up....It might be so boringgggg. I can guess all of the plot\"... \\n\\n\r\nBut this is different!!\\n\\n\r\n1. The karuta shown here is deep\\n\r\nNot only memorizing, but also mental, concentration, hearing, placement, luck, team work strategy is discussed in this anime. It is so good to know that a simple game like this can have so many strategy inside.\\n\r\n2. The main character is good\\n\r\nBut, the characters here is a good characters. She learn from her mistake. Learn to treat people, learn to be a better person, learn to empathy, learn to love, learn to give thank you and sorry. Watching this is like you watch a slice of life and learn how to be a better person with karuta as a link.\\n\r\n3. wrapped in a comedy-romance.\\n\r\nThere is a love-triangle inside the show, and It make the watchers curious about who will end up with who.\\n\r\n4. fast paced. It is different with another sport anime like baseball, soccer, boxing, basketball, etc which every competition might take 5 episodes or more and it is draggy. Here, 1 competition perhaps only 10 minutes (except the final match, maybe longer)..\\n\r\n5. the art is good, even though it is more like a shoujo anime rather than shonen.\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nTHE BAD PART\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nNot really have a bad part. Sometimes, I don't care about winning or losing in this match, so for me. There is too many inside thinking like \"I have to concentrate\", \"I still can do it\". The competition seems too long and dragging sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\n==============================================\\n\r\nSo, I recommend you to watch this anime if you like a romance-comedy-sport drama. If you consider this anime as romance anime, it is also okay, because the romance is top notch! If you consider this as sport anime, this is also okay, because the sport thing here is top notch.",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is satisfying to watch. It is an anime that anyone can easily relate to. Although not everyone may have experience playing karuta, almost everyone can relate to the experience of victory and loss, of playing with a team and sticking to them, of having a dream and reaching for it, despite it may sometimes be out of grasp. Chihayafuru is not merely about the karuta, but rather, the journey of the characters as they reach for their dreams. It just so happened that their dreams involved karuta.\r\nThe storytelling is simply fantastic. As previously mentioned, the karuta is a major part of the story, butChihayafuru manages to use karuta not to alienate its viewers with an unfamiliar game, or to use the game itself to drive the story. Rather, karuta is used to drive the characters, and the characters drive the story. Karuta pushes the characters together. This is wonderfully executed \u2013 the way karuta fits in the story never seems forced or unnatural. Parallels are naturally created between karuta and everyday life, and this was used to the maximum advantage of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot may be predictable at first, later in the series I have found myself asking myself, \u201cwho would win this fight?\u201d The winner is not always predictable, and that I believe makes the story better. Well-rounded characters are important, and Chihayafuru has plenty. This is also a factor which keeps Chihayafuru realistic, and not out-of-reach, which made it all the more easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nWin and loss are two things that everyone experiences in life \u2013 and in Chihayafuru, the characters win and lose as well. I have found them easily relatable in feeling the crushing pain of loss and the joyous gladness of victory. I have related to their struggle to achieve their dreams, despite whatever barrier may lie in their way. I have experience the way that a sport can bring people together, and I have felt happy whenever their team was cooperating. And most of all, I have related to the way the characters grow, and become more mature throughout the series, as they grow up to face the challenges they must overcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects work together to tie the story and characters together into a beautiful package. The art is fitting to story, light when it needs to poke fun at the characters, and realistic when it needs to be felt. The sound is wonderful for setting the tone, and the use of traditional instruments make it a perfect fit for Chihayafuru. Good art must be able to both draw attention to its beauty and relinquish attention to the content. Chihayafuru\u2019s art style and sound does both \u2013 it draws attention to its beauty when needed, but the art and sound do not distract from the story, but add to it.\\n\\n\r\nChihayafuru is very satisfying to watch \u2013 anyone can relate to the joy of victory and the loss of defeat, whether it\u2019s from a card game or not. Watching the characters grow and interact is extremely enjoyable to see. Overall, Chihayafuru is an excellent piece of work, and I believe that many people will enjoy the series for its well-written story and easily relatable characters.",

The determination shown by the characters for this one sport makes it feel like the effort put into something really matters. The feeling of striving to succeed and the hurt in losing, this is something everyone can relate too... I had never hear of Karuta before however if the show were to have been base on any other sport I think it would be a little lost. Even though Karuta seems to be a game played with an opponent, you still geta sense of teamwork. They help each other grow stronger by using their strengths and knowledge which is why I find it so interesting. I liked that the characters stay consistent yet still manage to improve. I hope to see another season... maybe some more romance",

It's difficult to discover anime with a realistic, not absurd story (seriously how many anime do we need a year about a guy with his pick from a loli to abig busted dope) This one definitely gives me a calm enjoyment which makes me wonder what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show speaks for itself, it's some of the most pleasing I've seen in years so I won't comment on it. \\n\\n\r\nThis story started out wonderfully explaining back story all the way back to their childhood with a few episode flashback, which was neither too long or too short in my opinion. Now the story delves deeper into revealing characters, themselves, dreams, and ambitions. I can only hope to discover more anime like that doesn't make me skeptical of every single plot development. Here's to hoping. \\n\\n",

At early, im sure i never imagined that i would had enjoyed this anime so much, at earlier i can only see poor anime art, horrible chara design, but as i keep continue to watch, really its story makeup for all of it, its really nice.\r\nThese are the reasons why its story is a top notch:\r\n1. Its not exaggeratedat all for considered sport anime, not just other out there with godlike shot, tiger shot, ping pong ball, etc\\n\r\n2. Its really very realistic, the protagonist and her team often lose and we can see their progress to get better and overcome their weakness. Hello, this is not anime with godlike char who always win 100% without any defect\\n\r\n3. Its story so detail and tightly packed, no jumping and easy to follow\\n\r\n4. Telling about karuta? this anime is the best, i think im getting to like karuta now after i wathed this anime even im not japanese and know nothing of karuta!!Passion of karuta, meaning of each card, every tech, strategy nicely pictured here\\n\r\n5. So deep character story depth and their relationship\\n\\n\r\nArt => 6\\n\r\nWell its the weakness, so sad to see that this anime have very poor art, its almost the same like manga art but animated, thats all, so many defect like char not proportional, etc\\n\\n\r\nSound => 7\\n\r\nWell i can say that this is so so, op ed have deep meaning but not too pleasant to hear, backsound got some nice one if i might add and good enough\\n\\n\r\nCharacter => 7\\n\r\nAs told earlier, poor chara design art and not satisfying to see but as explained earlier too, its nicely backup by strong chara depth story, soo good enough\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment => 8\\n\r\nWell, i can say even there are many minus aspect, i cant lie that i really enjoyed watching and follow this anime from the start till the end because of its magnificent story stated above\\n\\n\r\nOverall => 8\\n\r\nGood good simply good\\n\\n\r\nO yea, i read some info that this anime is actually an official Japan government program to raise popularity of karuta in Japan itself because in this modern era karuta gradually drowning and vanished. So nice one from Japan Government and Go Karuta!!",

This anime is great, I very much want a third season and while the pacing can be a bit schizophrenic the experience is still unlike anything else I have seen. This is a suspense lovers dream!

She's not the best student.  She's not graceful.  And she's a bit of a tomboy. She also love the game kurata in which you must snatch a card that has the correct line of a recited poem before your opponent.  She decides to start a club with an unlikely group of people including her old grade school pal, Taichi, who slowly begins to fall for her.  Her hopeis to one day play another old friend, Arata, who taught her the game.  \\n\\n\r\nI loved the animation. It was \"soft,\" but fit the dreamlike state and mindset of the lead character, Chihaya, and her ability to pull people in. The writing is very good. The characters were written with great care and chemistry which was expressed exceptionally well by the seiyu. The only problem with Chihaya Furu is that it feels too short.",

            "content": "I started watching this back when I was first getting into anime and it didn't hold my interest so I swore off it for some time, but I started it again on a whim and I absolutely do not regret it.\r\nStory 9/10: When I think about the plot progression after having finished watching the anime, it's pretty much like any other generic sports anime, but while watching it, it didn't feel like that at all, and I was completely able to let go of any expectations of where the plot would go, so much so that it really surprised me at times. \r\nArt 10/10: Thereason I dropped it at first was actually the art, because I'm not a huge fan of this kind of art style (something similar can be seen in A Place Further Than The Universe which I also have a hard time looking at) but once I spent more than half an episode watching it I grew really attached to it. There are some character designs I don't particularly like, but other than that, both the art and the animation are top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: One of my favourite things about this anime is its music. Although none of the songs were as memorable as I would've liked them to be, the music overall was very fitting for the story and was actually what made me become emotional at times during the anime. The voice acting is also pretty much perfect, memorable performances including everyone who voiced the main cast and the seiyuu's who voiced the card-readers. Just great stuff overall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Of course, as a quite slow-paced sports anime, Chihayafuru is mostly focused on its characters, but it does that so well. From the very beginning the main and the side characters are firmly established, from their personalities to the role they are to play as the story unfolds. While watching I often caught myself pausing at the oddest moments and thinking about just how far the characters have come since the beginning, which is something I rarely do. There's also the fact that I went from pretty much despising Taichi in the first episodes to him being my favourite character now o_o\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Ok I wasn't 100% into it all throughout, I even considered dropping it at about episode 8 because some new characters showed up and I have a really hard time getting to love new characters, but this show is too good not to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Though I have some issues with it, it is definitely one of my favourite sports anime, and I'm forever saddened by its lack of popularity.",

            "content": "This is my first review....\r\nAnyways, Chihayafuru ended today March 27th 2012, and since this was the last day it aired, I have a pretty decent idea of how I feel about this anime. But first let me back up...\r\nChihayafuru is #17 of the Karuta cards and you will remember this throughout the whole storyline as it is mentioned a lot and of course the main character is called Chihaya. I love poetry but I had never thought that a manga/anime like this existed or that I would ever watch it. I would classify this anime as a slice of life, but it's not just that.It's very unique and unbelievably enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 8 because the ending wasn't that great and everyone knew that it wasn't going to end how you wanted to because 25 episodes is just too short. The beginning was very confusing and at first you just wanted to get to the point. As you progress you realize the first couple of episodes were important. The whole point of Chihayafuru was the game of karuta. The story mostly focuses on the main characters trying to move up a rank or becoming the Master or Queen. For all of the things that go on revolving karuta it is very good. I also gave the story an 8 because I wished something happened between Taichi, Chihaya and Arata. I know this wasn't a romance anime but I was really wishing for a bit more interaction with those three together. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. The animators did a very good job because the characters seemed lifelike. They weren't 3-D but they weren't like anime from the 90's either. When the karuta cards were concerned the art looked even more amazing. They were soft and really made you think about the meanings behind each card. Especially when Kana was explaining the meanings, the art seemed to emphasize a lot of what she was saying. It provided as a beautiful subcharacter in some way. Overall, I loved the art it was bold, soft, and beautiful all in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nSound-  9/10 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song was perfect. It wasn't overly peppy and not completely slow-paced either. Whoever sang it was amazing because their voice conveyed the enthusiasm and the energy that the whole anime released. But it also conveyed the softness making you relish in the game itself. It was perfect.  The ending theme was done well too. The melodious background and the slow pace really did a great job bringing everything to a full circle.\\n\r\nThe sound did a good job trasitioning you in and out of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7/10 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that were mainly on focus was Chihaya, Taichi and Arata. Then Chihaya and Taichi's karuta club which configured of Desktomukun, Porky, and Kana. \\n\r\nChihaya was done very well. Her passion and love for karuta made you love the game too. And her determination kept you inspired. You cried when she did and you laughed when she laughed. She was a character with a lot of depth. \\n\r\nTaichi was a character that you grew to love. You didn't really liike him at first but once you understood his life, his circumstance, his love, you began to sympathize with him. Even though he had no chance he still tried and does keep trying to persevere. You cheered for him and you really wanted him to do something.\\n\r\nArata, I truly wished I saw more of. He came in the very beginning and his compassion touched your heart. You pitied and were let down when he stopped doing what he loved for a little while and you jumped for joy when he came back again. As much as you loved him too, you never got to see him much, you didn't experience much of his perspective at all. \\n\r\nEven though I loved Chihaya, the lack of Taichi and Arata's depth really prevented me in giving the character a 9 or 10. There was some character development. I think those two characters would've been fine if there were more episodes but at the end you were still confused about where they stood. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nFor a plot so different and so educational in some ways, I enjoyed it. It was really fun watching and I loved learning about the game that the characters loved so much. I really wished I could play the game by the end. I waited for every episode and am really saddened that it's over. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nEven though I gave enjoyment a 9, the characters and story could have been in more depth. I just didn't like how it ended and I really wished there was a second season to watch right away. There were too many unanswered questions. Don't get my wrong, I loved the anime, it's just there were some things I was really passionate about in this anime and to end it like that with no announcement of a second season really irritated me. That saying, if you want a fun anime, that you get something out of, have characters that you learn to love, than PLEASE PLEASE watch this anime. If you're looking for something like Haruhi, Ouran, Sailor Moon, Bleach, Fairy Tail, Code Geass then this isn't your anime. But ANYONE will LOVE this anime. IF THERE IS A SECOND SEASON I WILL 100% SEE IT! It's that GOOD, it's UNIQUE, and it's SPECIAL. \\n\\n\r\nHope I helped!",

            "content": "Chihayafuru is a sporty anime about playing a game called Tetris.\r\n\u2026Yeah, not really, but it could be, considering how boring the actual karuta thingamaboo is to watch. Just like watching someone play Tetris. I\u2019m guessing it is way more interesting to actually be the one playing karuta. If you actually understand enough Japanese and have wicked memorization skills. \r\nStory:\r\nUnstoppable girl finds the meaning of her life in playing karuta, drags along others in her quest to be the best in Japan. Too many games and too few slice of life moments ensue. \r\nThe story is sneaky as hell: it builds around the Tetris\u2026er, karuta matchesand peppers them with a few choice moments between these charming characters that keep you coming back. Even the matches themselves have enough variety and surprises to keep up your interest, no small feat for such a boring sport. Yet, the things you most want to see never actually happen. And I\u2019m not talking about who won the damn Tetris\u2026er, karuta finals! This show finishes and the story is left incomplete. Nothing of import is resolved apart from the characters getting some insight in their gameplay. Reportedly low sales guarantee no second season so you are left with a massive case of something that sounds a lot like bluebells. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nChihaya is a socially clueless girl who follows her passion about karuta (ok, the Tetris joke grew old, I admit it) with admirable determination and balks at nothing. More of this sort of character please, and enough with the softspoken Yamato Nadeshiko shrinking violets in anime who faint when a boy so much as looks their way. Anyhoo, Chihaya is great fun to watch and her sheer energy is enough to power the Enterprise. She is the catalyst and glue for all the characters around her, they orbit her like planets around a bright star. \\n\r\nTaichi is one of Chihaya\u2019s childhood friends and is the one who goes through most of the changes during the course of this show. He is so used to easily getting to be first place he now has to deal with rejection issues and the prospect of failure where it matters the most. He\u2019s also one part of the (love) triangle that will always be out of your reach (unless you read the manga, I suppose. I know I will just to know what the hell happened next)\\n\r\nArata is the other childhood friend, the one who got Chihaya hooked on karuta. He gets annoyingly little screentime compared to how much you want to see his story unfold. He has to deal with tons of guilt and find his drive again after an unfortunate event in his life. How he plays against the other two parts of the triangle is very well written. There is always a subtle balance between all of them with Arata being the pivoting point. \\n\r\nClub members: every sport anime needs club members and here we have quite a group of three. Each and every one of them brings something different to the game approach. From the artistic appreciation to the mathematical calculation to the persistent experience, the three of them open new paths to Chihaya as she moves towards her goals. \\n\r\nRivals: each and every rival is unique and brings their own challenges and eye-openers for our girl Chihaya and her team. Generic? There is no generic in here, dudebro. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\nMadhouse. They invested a lot in motion fluidity, creative shots and sequences to keep the matches interesting. Not so much in details or eyepopping backgrounds, which is okay because this is not the kind of anime that needs it. Very nice character designs too\u2014finally, people that look their age and not 5 years old. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt has a small set of repeating energetic tracks that evoked traditional Japanese sounds but had a modern touch and a symphonic, lofty, uplifting overtone. Well, that\u2019s what it sounded to me, I could be wrong. \\n\r\nOP: Nothing stellar but full of energy and spark with a jolly jpop tune. \\n\r\nED: the cheapest of cheap CG background shots with a slideshow and an obligatory ballad. Didn\u2019t really need a fancy ED so there you go.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nAfter much thought, I decided to keep this and rewatch it at a later time when I\u2019ve forgotten what went on in the karuta matches. I might even skip forward to the juicy slice of life parts entirely. I would recommend it to all slice of life fans and people who like watching people play Tetris. \\n",

I was looking for a heart warming, feel good series when I found this one. It seemed cool, but I was unsure if I would like it. The art looked pretty cool, so I pushed myself to give it a try.......and I fell in love. Personally, I hate shows that are still airing, but I loved this one so much that I really did not mind the weekly wait for each episode.\r\nChihayafuru will suck you in and keep you on the edge ofyour seat. The characters are great, and the story is just as good. The one thing I loved about the story is that it wasn't as cliche as I thought it would be. It was a realistic sports anime. In the real world, no matter how much you prepare or how much you desperately want to win, there will be some bad luck, good luck, wins, loses, regrets, and learned lessons that you will inevitably encounter, and this show has it all. I fully recommend this series for just about anyone. It's a really easy show to enjoy, so don't be scared to give it a try ;D",

            "content": "I was sort of badgered into starting _Chihayafuru_ - even though I had seen many people praise it as underrated and better than expected, the premise just seems so stupid. After 2 episodes... I'm not impressed (coloring aside), but I think I'm starting to understand _Chihayafuru_: it's a deconstruction of sports anime by applying all the standard tropes to a game manifestly not worth the time of any but little kids, subversively suggesting that more adult sports like baseball are the same!\r\nAlright, but seriously, recently seeing some more laudatory reviews of _Chihayafuru_ and season 2 reminds me that I didn't really sum up my impressions.\r\nAsI previously said, I liked the music well before I watched the show and will be looking for the second season's OST; I also liked the vivid use of colors (the translucent maple brownish-red has long been a favorite color of mine). On the production level, there's little to complain about even if it wasn't as lavish as the previous anime I watched like _Hyouka_.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do I dislike it? Let's start with what seems to be praised most, the characters. They're 'vivid' and 'real'. I disagree.\\n\\n\r\n- Chihaya is your stock oblivious enthusiast, obsessed with her _id\u00e9e fixe _ and devoid of social graces; making your standard male maniac a female is just a gender switch and making her beautiful is the usual eye candy & pandering to viewers & allowing for cheap jokes. Same reason all the 'otaku' female characters in other anime like _Genshiken_ or _Lucky Star_ are beautiful or at least cute. A few shoujo inflections like crying *every damn episode* doesn't change that she's basically your shonen lead: \"fighting enemies and growing and making friends and becoming the best there is, yay\"!\\n\r\n- Taichi is the golden boy driven by his parents and a silent admirer (or coward, if that's how you roll) - like appears in almost every shoujo manga ever, nothing real or vital or new there.\\n\r\n- Porky is... genial. That's the best I can say. Let's face it, he doesn't get a whole lot of characterization other than that. And eating a lot.\\n\r\n- Desktomu: stereotypical bookworm, shading into 'awesome by analysis' (if he ever becomes awesome, anyway). I suspect if I were to read the manga, he'd never become anything but Chihaya's sidekick/geek-guru.\\n\r\n- Kana: actually, Kana is probably the most interesting of them. She doesn't redeem all the others, though.\\n\r\n- Yamamoto Yumi: I want to throw in an honorary mention of the former Queen. Of all the characters, she was perhaps the most interesting and amusing. But her quasi-fourth-wall-breaking may work for one only if one is already half-checked-out of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo much for the characters. What about the meat of the show, karuta? Here my previous comments remain accurate: karuta is an awful game, it has no depth, it devolves into reflexes, it destroys appreciation for the original poems per Kana, and I feel little but sorrow/pity/contempt for anyone who pursues it seriously. The final master match in the anime, if remotely accurate about such high-level play, demonstrates the shallowness and degeneracy of the game when pushed to the extreme: the master wins through nothing but hearing and honed reflexes. That is not a game, that is a poorly administered psychometric test of hand-eye coordination.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I could never watch your standard baseball anime either because I would find it unspeakably boring. Which raises a question for me: I watched a fair bit of _Hikaru no Go_ and ultimately came away unimpressed, concluding that the Go aspects had taken over and unbalanced and sucked the life out of the characters and plot, so much as I enjoy Go and playing Go, I considered the anime a failure.\\n\\n\r\nGo is the diametric opposite of karuta, relying on no luck, no randomness, pure skill and pattern recognition, and has tremendous depth. So why did I pan both _Chihayafuru_ and _Hikaru no Go_? I think it's because there's a Golden Mean with regard to what we might call 'didactic' content. If the subject matter is too simplistic, then after a few episodes, the subject is exhausted and one descends into repetition, weariness, apathy, disgust, and self-parody (it is disturbingly easy to imagine a _Chihayafuru_ which started with a slightly fantasy setting, like _Dragon Ball_ and eventually powers up shonen-style like _DBZ_ with secret poems, lightspeed swings, time-traveling players...). While if it's too complex, then after a reasonable progression in protagonist skills, they may leave behind all but the most dedicated viewer and also discover that in order to present a remotely thorough primer on the topic, they've failed to cover all the other aspects a great anime needs.\\n\\n\r\nSo for comparison, we might use _Thermae Romae_, _Moshidora_, and _Moyashimon_. Each has 'didactic' content that the protagonists are learning and using (bath construction, American management theory, microbiology & food science), but which I enjoyed without necessarily criticizing it for shallowness or esotericness. What steered them between Scylla & Charybdis? The obvious trait they share is that they are *short*: 1-cours or less. Their depth is indeed shallow (you wouldn't learn very much about bacteria or fermentation from _Moyashimon_), but this isn't a problem because they aren't locked into one particular bacteria eg. and also because they aren't that long; so their shallowness doesn't wear out its welcome and they also fit in all the other ingredients of good anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor a final comparison: I keep waffling about whether to consider _Chihayafuru_ something of a shoujo/shonen fusion rather than josei. Where would your popular shonen anime like _Naruto_ fit into my 'didactic' scheme above? It fits into the golden mean, actually, I think. This is because the magic and chakra and spell and combat material is all completely made up at the author's convenience, while other series like _Chihayafuru_ can take only limited liberties with the truth; so _Naruto_ can wax intricate about 'bloodline limits' and 'chakra points', but the author can stop the moment he's invented his necessary plot device or deus ex machina, and so can stroll through Scylla & Charybdis as he pleases. He doesn't have to worry that he's gotten too wonkish because he can just ignore anything he previously said or retcon it, and if the plot needs a break, he can through in some technobabble.\\n\\n\r\nSo your standard unrealistic shonen can be a lot like _Star Trek_, where the scriptwriters didn't think of any plausible extrapolations of technology or be consistent with known laws of physics, but just wrote the script by inserting the word \"technology\" anywhere they needed some technobabble: \"Mr Spock, can we technology the technology?\" \"Captain, the technology won't go that high because the technology will break!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis 'soft SF' is in contrast to 'hard SF', which does spend much effort extrapolating known technologies and remaining consistent with known physics or at least speculative physics - the most extreme example being Greg Egan's _Clockwork Rocket_ set in an alternate universe where Egan (who has degrees in, IIRC, math) has worked out the novel physics of his setting and shows his characters discovering and exploiting the relevant equations.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll notice that Egan is not a household name like _Star Trek_; in particular, _Clockwork Rocket_ is a pretty boring story for anyone who doesn't follow the math or the physics.\\n\\n\r\nThis illustrates the problem of 'didactic' anime or fiction (which we could generalize to 'educational games'): adding additional requirements to a work frequently leads to a reduction of one of the original requirements. Tradeoffs exist. 'A & B",

            "content": "(I already wrote this review last year, just so you know. I just wasn't able to post it back then.)\r\nNormally, I don\u2019t engage myself in these Josei types of animes and mangas. I mean, come on. Who would be interested in the story of a high school tomboy who plays an old Japanese card game for fun? So, what got me into it? It all started when I was watching an AMV (Animated Music Video) of Chihayafuru made by one of my favorite video-editors. I was enticed by the animation at first sight, so I looked at the synopsis.\r\n\u201cChihayafuru\u201d is about a typical high schoolgirl who doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do in life. Her name is Chihaya Ayase. She has always wanted to see her sister, Chitose, become the number one supermodel of Japan. Her perspective in life changed when she met Arata Wataya, her male classmate in Elementary who is superbly talented in the old Japanese card game called \u201cKaruta\u201d, which is based on Japanese poetry. He was able to convince her that a dream must concern oneself and that it\u2019s something that she has to work hard for, as well. Thus, Chihaya discovered her passion in Karuta and felt the resolve to become the best female player in the country \u2013 and perhaps, even in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t really interested in the story. I usually don\u2019t get hyped with slice of life shows because they tend to be too predictable and unexciting. When I looked at several reviews about this anime, a lot of people were raving about how great it was and that it was, by far, the best slice of life anime. So, I managed to give it a shot and see if a show about a card game was really THAT endearing. And I have to tell you; it exceeded my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is more than just about a card game. In order for you to achieve a dream, you can\u2019t always rely on your talent and strength alone. What\u2019s the point of having a skill when you\u2019re not putting in a lot of sweat? You have to keep on honing that skill no matter how good you think you are. I was able to see this in the characters, especially Chihaya. It may seem like her only motivation is to be able to meet Arata again, but as time progressed, she\u2019s not really doing it for him and herself.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing I absolutely love about this show, it would be the character development. The characters are unique in their own ways, and they have grown to be more three-dimensional over the course of the series. I have to admit; each character somehow mirrors the typical high school students nowadays and seemed fleshed out enough for you to be able to relate to them. Although they can be too exaggerated at times, they seem so real and human.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me, my favorite character would be Chihaya Ayase, not because she\u2019s the main protagonist of the story or the most beautiful anime character I\u2019ve seen yet. Although she may seem dense, there\u2019s just something about her that makes her really admirable, from her ebullience and passion to her sheer determination to achieve her goals. She\u2019s more than just a \u201ctomboy trapped in a supermodel\u2019s body\u201d. Because of her, I learned to appreciate competing against strong opponents. In order for you to improve a particular skill, you need to step up your game by learning from the people who are better than you. She isn\u2019t someone who quits when the going gets tough.\\n\\n\r\nArata Wataya, the one who taught Chihaya how to play karuta, is a likeable character as well. He didn\u2019t receive that much screen time in the series, and he had to go back to Fukui, his hometown, for some unforeseen circumstances. He may have a somewhat dark personality, but that\u2019s just what makes him stand out from the rest of the characters. I can even relate to him and what he is going through, especially when he was a kid. If I were in his shoes, I would feel the same way as he did when I would lose someone dear to me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character that I absolutely admire would be Taichi Mashima, Chihaya\u2019s childhood friend and the president of the Karuta club in their high school. Other than his leadership skills and strategic abilities, he has shown to be someone who doesn\u2019t run away and never takes short cuts. He may be rather insecure and have this inferiority complex, but he seems down-to-earth. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how else to put this. As for the action, I can feel the intensity and suspense in every karuta match. In fact, I somehow enjoyed watching these matches more than the \u201cflyin\u2019 punching, head-banging, kicking butts\u201d type of fight scenes you see in most action animes. I love the animation, and the OST was in tune to the mood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI admit that it has its bad points, too. It somehow failed to have a solid plot and almost seemed like it was only a chain of events. But overall, Chihayafuru has landed a spot on the list of my favorite animes.",

They are likeable, real, often annoying (just like real people) and endearing. . .ceaselessly endearing. \r\nThe writing rivets the viewer and the animation never makes you notice that it is animation. It's only at the end of each episode, as one comesdown from the high of the pleasure of watching it, that you realize, \"Hey! It's animation!\"\\n\r\nIt MUST have another season. Or 3. Or 10. What a show!",

            "content": "The problem with shows about sports, board games, card games, etc. is that a good portion of the time they don't explain the game. Karuta is a well known game in Japan, but while I found that although this show expects you to know SOMEthing about karuta, it is still easy for foreigners (foreign to both the game and the customs) to watch. On the same token, it doesn't dumb things down for the viewer.\r\nART: The cards are almost always 3D and it IS intrusive to viewing. For instance, there's this scene where Kana is standing in front of a sliding glass door and Chihayasmacks a card which goes flying through the air and smacks the door right in front of Kana's face. The difference in animation is so obvious it's detracting. \\n\\n\r\nEvery scene is covered in a Gaussian blur, making it seem like one long dream sequence. This might get annoying except that the characters are illustrated in such a gorgeous, soft, shoujo way that it's enjoyable. In particular, their eyes are lovely. Additionally, the 3D cards might have annoyed me but I adored the hakama patterns. In some shows where patterns on clothing are animated they don't move with the folds of the clothing or the way the characters move. In Chihayafuru however they took the time to animate intricate patterns, which I, as a viewer, appreciate. I can only imagine the time this took to animate since they wear hakama so often.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I don't know what it's called, but I love the cadence with which the readers read poetry. It made me fell all cultured and stuff to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Ok, naive girls annoy me. But Chihaya's personality quirks are so funny that I found it easy to overlook: for instance she falls asleep immediately after every match (right on the tatami mats), she can take criticism and learn from it, and she's so over the top innocent that in a gag episode where she is asked who she would date (obviously trying to pull a answer between Arata and Taichi), Chihaya answers immediately with: Kana-chan.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:  My big problem with the plot in general is that Arata tells Chihaya she needs to have her own dream, not her sister's, and she basically steals HIS dream for no deep, discernible reason. Also, the show should have focused a lot more on Chihaya's family's relationships between her and her sister. I hope they address that more in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nHowever! This show honestly made me interested in karuta. There's so many translations and this show definitely does a great job with new takes on translations. The way they show Chihaya's innocent love for her friends and the game is great, too. One scene she sees a long lost friend that she wasn't expecting to see and it's just beautifully done, poetry in itself.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: The show manages to be sweet, serious, and competitive. There are also nice moments in which Kana explains the poetry in illustrative ways. Or Desktomu explains his mathematical analysis of Chihaya's playing. These scenes make the show more interesting to watch instead of just one karuta match after another. And the humor in this show is so cute. Although the only thing this show has in common with K-on is the struggling after school group theme, they remind me of each other in innocence and humor.",

Watching this anime I found myself being enveloped in the beauty of the characters passion for karuta an old Japanese game. I would find myself crying tears of joy when the characters won and tears of frustration when they lost. I found myself squealing at the romantic parts and found myself grinning seeing the characters devotion to this peculiar game. Chihaya, one of the main characters is one of the most interesting female characters I have come across watching anime. She isn't your typical stereotypical female. Even if she won a karuta match she wouldalways try to get better to improve. I fell in love with Chihayafuru but I  mostly fell in love with the passion that all these lovely characters had for Karuta.",

The moment I entered this series I knew the thing had me going already. There's romance in which I absolutely love. Chihayfuru has taught me to love Competition and Karuta. \r\nLet me explain, The basic idea of any Karuta game is to be able to quickly determine which card out of an array of cards is required and then to grab the card before it is grabbed by an opponent. It requires memoryand skill. \\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the opponents and Chihaya's favorite fictional character, daddy bear. I wished there was a third season so I could find out what happens to the romance stirring. It left me at a clift hanger. I generally love it when the guy has this one sided-love. It's amusing to watch their happening. I love it even more that Chihaya is clueless. Yep, that concludes my review. Hope I watch anime's like these again. I wonder what my next one might be.. hmm Special A? Nah, I've already watched that.",

            "content": "Who knew that a show about a card game would turn out to be so great?  I'm not talking about those fantasy shows either, with characters summoning creatures and other magical things from cards to duke it out with other characters or beings.  There is no magic or supernatural occurrences in Chihayafuru, yet the show finds a way to present the card game kurata as an intense form of entertainment.  In addition to the various card tournaments, this series contains elements of comedy, drama, and romance, all of which I found well done and enjoyable.  However, when I think back onChihayafuru, there were 3 things that stood out to me after watching this show: the art is beautiful, the music is fantastic, and characters are all well developed and very likeable, especially the main character Chihaya.  Her nerdy personality is humorous and endearing, especially when combined with the fact that she is gorgeous.  In fact, I personally think Chihaya is one of, if not the prettiest girl in all of anime.  The show doesn't have a definite ending, but this is a non-issue since the second season is due to air this winter.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not an action buff, you owe it to yourself to watch Chihayafuru.  Though listed as a josei and having all the appearances of a chick-flick, I think most anyone regardless of gender will find this series exceptional and greatly entertaining.  I give Chihayafuru a 9/10 (Outstanding) and a high recommendation.",

I'd say yes.\r\nStory: 9 - Chihaya Ayase is a tomboyish girl who's always played Karuta since her childhood ever since Arata Waraya introdued her to this 'sports' game. Now in highschool, Ayase still holds the same passion and creates a karuta club. From then on, the story focuses on her and her friends/comrades as they progress and develop their skills as well as their relationships. I found the story quite interesting as it revealed a diffferent aspect of something which I before thought was only a mere childish card game though that's not thecase here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - The art was a quite important aspect as we needed to see the hand movements quite closely and as I thought I wasn't disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - The sound has a quite youthful yet traditional feeling which made this a reliable support as it stays true to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 - The characters were done well as they were contrasted,bonded and united in a nice manner as they still developed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 - I enjoyed this series a lot as it manages to take itself seriously and display potential which is a great thing.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Hanasaku Iroha, Hikaru no Go, Saki, Bakuman, Bamboo Blade, Akagi, Shion no Ou and One Outs will like this series as their is a similarity in the character's tension/theme/goals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, I liked this series quite a lot and I find understated despite being worth much more. This series is suitable for any audience and will be especially liked by people who like sports/battle/Game/shounen anime.",
