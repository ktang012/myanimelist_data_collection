            "content": "Casshern Sins is not for everyone. The show pretty much moves at one pace, and that pace is \u2019slow\u2019. There is a lot of silence, introspection, and philosophical dialog. Ordinarily, this would make one assume the show is pretentious (especially since it has a lot of similarities to Texhnolyze), but it really isn\u2019t. Casshern has a very simple plot, very simple dialog, and is easy to understand, so people looking for a mind-blower won\u2019t find it here. The plot and messages of Casshern Sins are much more along the lines of Kino\u2019s Journey or Mushi-shi. However, just like action fans will be turned off bythe slow pace, fans of more quiet, contemplative anime might be turned off by the fact that there is at least one fight scene per episode and they can at times be lengthy. So the niche here is kind of small, requiring that you like a good variety of styles. I happen to fall into that niche.\\n\\n\r\nLike most good shows, Casshern is amazing in a number of areas and wouldn\u2019t be the same without any of them. The soundtrack, voice acting, animation, directing, fights, dialog, art - everything aligns just right to create a show that is just about perfect for what it is. I\u2019ll be getting into detail on that now.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins has a very powerful and gripping soundtrack composed by Kaoru Wada (Princess Tutu, Tekkaman Blade, To Heart). The songs are all symphonic, ranging from minimalist and pretty to towering and sinister. The loud songs are very intensely dramatic and dark to the point that some (like the first track Sins) sound outright evil. (Interestingly, that song sounds like the symphonic version of an Opeth song.) The calmer songs are usually very airy and often acoustic-guitar driven. They definitely evoke images of Casshern\u2019s world where you\u2019ve heard them in the background. While either type is great, I prefer the calm songs if only because the more dramatic ones would go better with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something very mysterious but also very charming about these calmer songs. They bring a sense of wonder mixed with familiarity. It\u2019s a sense like seeing something totally new, but so enthralling that it feels like home. The ultimate song that captures this feeling is \u2018Memory Past\u2019 which is the song that usually played whenever Casshern met someone new and learned their story. The closest real musical comparison I have for this OST is the music in Phendrana Drifts in Metroid Prime which has always been some of my favorite composition. In the context of the series, all of the songs work superbly well to add ten extra layers of tone onto the already tone-tacular series. The music is notable straight from episode 1, which I guess it\u2019d have to be to make me go and find the OST.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the OST, there has been a Best Theme Collection from this series. The show has one opening theme (Aoi Hana by color bottle) and 3 endings (Reason by KANA, Aoi Kage by Otoya Kichiemon, and Hikari to Kage by Kuno Shinji), the second of which is only used for one episode. The best theme collection has the op and main eds in TV size, several instrumental versions of Aoi Kage, two original tracks by Wada Kaoru, two important vocal insert songs from te series (Sky and A Path by Nami Miyahara who voices Lyuze), and finally, both the original Tatakae! Casshan! theme and a new, heavy version of the song by Otoya Kichiemon.\\n\\n\r\nI personally didn\u2019t care much for the 2 main eds, but I found myself completely unable to skip the op for even one episode. It is easily one of my favorite opening songs in a while. Aoi Kage and the modern Tatakae! Casshan! are both awesome because they manage to play heavy metal acoustics. Anything that can do that is automatically awesome. The old-school Tatakae! Casshan! is the ultimate great touch for lovers of old-school tatsunoko songs. However, great as that all is, Sky and A Path were the real reasons I was interested in this release. These songs made episode 8 of the show amazing and reappear at many great moments later in the show. Both are extemely pretty and wonderful, and Nami Miyahara\u2019s English is excellent (evidently she studied English in Australia).\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth making the statement that Casshern Sins has some of the coolest sound effects ever. The effects during fights are visceral, intense, and completely full of impact. Care was taken to make the sound effects just right and give every hit that needed extra edge. I\u2019m thinking that they made a lot of the effects in the studio, seeing as there were very organic sounds of like pots breaking or the creak of metal. It\u2019s pretty rare I think these days for so much craft to go into sound effects in anime, so it\u2019s pretty notable when it does.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, this show amassed a royal fuckton of talent. Being as there were so many minor characters, a lot of voices were required, and Madhouse didn\u2019t skip out on giving every single character a standout voice. For starters, Casshern himself is voiced by Tohru Furuya (certainly most notable as freaking Amuro Ray, as well as Tuxedo Mask, Pegasus Seiya, and Yamcha) which is a very interesting performance. The voice of Casshern is certainly unique, sounding strong but never stern, and in pain but never really weak. The voice adds a lot of mystery to the character, sounding  like the robot he is, who doens\u2019t quite understand emotion even though he seems to feel it. The best part though is his wails in agony which are used frequently when Casshern\u2019s body self-repairs. That dude\u2019s wails are frightening.\\n\\n\r\nNami Miyahara plays Lyuze with the perfect mixture of resolve, confusion, rage, and love. Like Casshern, hers is a very distinct voice. Yuko Minaguchi (Videl - Dragonball, Yawara, Akiko - Kanon) does a completely superb job as Ringo. She should be cast as every single little kid in anime. I\u2019ve never heard a kid voice that managed to sound young and yet in no way annoying. Best kid voice ever. \u2018Cho\u2018 reprises his role as every old man in anime, lol. Akiko Yajime (Diva - Blood+, Shin-chan, Relena Peacecraft, Kuu - Haibane - damn that\u2019s range) brings her mysterious voice to Luna which tricks you with it\u2019s very regal sound until you start to see another side\u2026 well that\u2019s a spoiler. Kenji Utsumi (Shenlong - DBZ, Zodd - Berserk, Lt. Armstrong - FMA) is Braiking Boss who he played in the old version of the show as well, bringing a nostalgia factor.\\n\\n\r\nToshiyuki Morikawa (Who is in everything. His list is totally nuts.) is awesome as Dio. He plays the perfect rival character. His voice has a darkness to it, but not like an evil bad-dude, more like a man driven by dark purposes but full of resolve, which Dio is. Mami Koyama (Lunch - Dragonball - yes, most of the cast worked on Dragonball, Balalaika - Black Lagoon) brings the thunder as Leda who is convincingly evil and conceited, but also has an inner emotional side. Some of my favorite minor character performances include Mami Koyama\u2019s second roll as Lizbell in episode 7 (which is interestng because Koyama is Tohru Furuya\u2019s ex-wife, which when you think about it makes certain scenes very awkward), Tomoko Akiya whose performance as Sophita is borderline creepy and very fun, and Taeka Kawata who plays Nico, the little girl whose brain has been fried.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is animated by Madhouse. The dudes who brought you (alphabetically) Black Lagoon, Boogiepop Phantom, Death Note, Dennou Coil, Gunslinger Girl, Nana, everything Satoshi Kon, Texhnolyze, Trigun, and X, just to name a few. If you\u2019ve seen none of those, I\u2019ll just say it - they have incredibly high production quality and have been around forever. To give you an idea of how high their budget is, the first half of Casshern Sins aired simultaneously with three other Madhouse shows, the second half with one, all of which had unfaltering high-quality animation throughout. There is pretty much no other studio who can do something like that. So it really comes as no surprise when I say that Casshern Sins has incredibly beautiful animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe most instantly and consistently notable thing about Casshern\u2019s art is the luscious backgrounds. The background art is almost incomparably beautiful - almost. Probably only one show matches up to it, it being Mushi-shi, which is why it\u2019s no surprise that Yoshihiko Umakoshi was the art director and character designer for both series (a dual job he\u2019s done for Zipang, Street Fighter Alpha, and Boys Over Flowers, none of which I\u2019ve seen. He also did it for Air Master which doesn\u2019t matter because that show is fugly, probably thanks to budget.) I\u2019ve actually watched an interview with this guy on one of the Mushi-shi DVDs and while he is very boring to listen to, I do remember him saying that he was a perfectionist and would always stress that there be boatloads of detail in the backgrounds, which I guess he\u2019s still up to.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern\u2019s art is almost always barren, lifeless, and cold. The world of Casshern faces ruin (basically, apocalypse) and so there is little life to be found. The landscape is jagged and covered in large mountains, hills, valleys, craters, and deserts of sand and snow. Remnants of civilization can be found, some cold cities have buildings that still tower while others have fallen apart and buildings have become decrepit husks. Some places have become so dry and ruined that the ground has actually crystallized and cracks under every step. Occasionally, though, there are places of lush, brimming life to be found. Secret gardens surviving in caves or wellsprings and oceans. There is definitely a sense of mystery to the world that you can find anything if you look around enough. And, as a character in one episode teaches Casshern, every place in this world is beautiful. As a big fan of dystopic art, I found myself completely enraptured in these wastelands as much as I was mystified by the lush outcropping of life in unexpected places.\\n\\n\r\nUmakoshi\u2019s character designs are drop-dead gorgeous. It takes skills to make a masked superhero with a big red C on his chest and ornamental horns on his helmet fit into a dark, somber setting. But, somehow, he\u2019s done it. Casshern looks like a badass but also looks like he fits into the setting. He is supposed to be a beautiful person, and it\u2019s certainly visible in his design. All of the characters are very tall and lanky, almost like CLAMP designs, but have an added sharpness to them and are actually consistent. I can easily call them some of the best character designs I\u2019ve seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most impressive, though, is that a definitive 70s style remains ingrained into the designs. Every one has absurdly big hair and their facial features are very old-school. However, these elements have been perfectly crafted so that the designs still look modern and not ridiculous as they often do when new shows try to use old style. The robots especially represent the old school with their very basic designs, but they have a bloodthirstiness about their designs that makes it unsurprising when they are killing machines. Overall, I\u2019d say my favorite designs from the series were definitely Lyuze and Luna.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, since this is Madhouse, there are also plenty of exemplary animation techniques. Unfortunately, ANN doesn\u2019t have any animators listed, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s (director of Gurren Lagann and animator of all those wacky scenes in shows like FLCL, Mahoromatic, and even FullMetal Alchemist) name ended up on that list since his trademark over-the-top and hyperactive style is used in many of the fights. The show features a lot of \u2018sketchy lines\u2018 and badass shadow effects. The fight scenes often contain mind-blowing animation tricks that will make people who notice these things cream a huge load.\\n\\n\r\nDirecting\\n\\n\r\nI think that series director and storyboarder Shigeyasu Yamauchi probably had the biggest impact on the way this series turned out. As you can see on his ANN page, he directed a bunch of the Dragon Ball/Z and Saint Seiya movies and had involvement with their main series (and going by their ANN pages, he would have had experience with nearly all of this show\u2019s seiyuu during those times). The experience with those series can be seen heavily in the fight scenes. When Casshern and Dio fight, nearly every strike rockets someone into a wall which explodes just as the other fighter shoots at them like a bullet for the next blow. There are several scenes where the ground around Dio craters under the sheer fluctuation of his power. Yamauchi definitely wanted to bring the scope and intensity of a DBZ fight to this series, which is something I personally have always wanted to see done in a serious anime. It is made a thousand times better by the huge budget of the show which allows the fights to look amazing, cool, and fluid.\\n\\n\r\nYamauchi definitely has a great sense of dramatic cinematography. Every shot is carefully composed to look as cool as possible, with characters nearly always in some kind of dramatic pose and the light hitting them just right. This is taken to an almost hilarious extent in some of Casshern\u2019s fights against robot armies because he will literally attack them by kind of jumping at them, striking an epic pose, and somehow causing them to explode. Lighting is impeccable and the use of color is very important. Most of the show has a sort of blue and grey hue to it, but when other colors appear they are striking and noticeable against the backdrop of blue. Overall, I think Yamauchi just does a splendid job and probably had a lot of fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Theme\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot in Casshern Sins is so simple that I could detail the whole thing thoroughly in a small paragraph (but I won\u2019t for spoilers\u2019 sake.) The show\u2019s focus is more on the themes that drive the series and the characters representing or interacting with those themes. That said, while the plot is simple, it is very well-presented and interesting, making it a great driving force for the action and themes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the show\u2019s themes relate directly to the conflict between life and death. The dark, barren world of Casshern is on it\u2019s way to ruin and death is ever-present. Every person is directly grappling with death and the end of the world, and those who don\u2019t die just from the ruin usually die at the hands of other robots, especially if they try to attack Casshern. There are few characters who survive their own episode, much less the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Casshern, who is immortal, learns in his travels through the dying world is how death effects different people (usually robots). Most of the world desperately clings to life. The strong robots fight and kill each other constantly to steal each other\u2019s parts and try to prolong their lives. The weak search for any means of survival, clinging to little hopes or loosing to despair. Some merely accept the ruin as pleasantly as they can, but more often than not they will turn from this mindset at the slightest sight of hope - namely, the supposed immortality that one will gain if they devour Casshern.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not everyone is desperately clinging to life. Casshern encounters some robots and humans who aspire to something without the fear of death. Some teach him that the world is beautiful even in ruin, that there is hope in the world, or that they can live forever in the things that they leave behind. Casshern\u2019s conflict becomes whether or not eternal life is justified or death necessary. He is torn between the sadness of death and the liveliness brought out by it\u2019s presence.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of each episode are interesting and deep, sometimes moving, and more so as they culminate into the over-arching theme. Casshern, as a stark contrast to the world around him that he desperately tries to understand, makes for the perfect receptacle to these themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins features surprisingly complex main characters in light of it\u2019s simplistic plot and usually episodic nature. Casshern himself starts off as basically a blank slate with no memories and only knowledge as far as he learns from others. As he experiences the world, he has to weigh his experiences against each other to figure out his own beliefs. His character is kept interesting by the conflicting ideas he develops in relation to those experiences.\\n\\n\r\nLyuze\u2019s conflict is between her desire to kill Casshern because of him ruining the world, effectively killing her sister, and her growing care for him and changing perception of the world. Casshern\u2019s first companion, Friender, has some pretty great development considering that he is a robot dog who cannot speak. Friender\u2019s emotions are represented through actions, and in those actions we see how he slowly transitions from hating Casshern to trusting him and eventually both protecting him and keeping him under control.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling, the villains, Leda and Dio, have their own interesting development. Dio has dreamed of nothing but killing Casshern, while Leda is using dio to try and make the world her own. Each of them is thoroughly explored and developed. Luna, Oji, and Braiking Boss are also great characters with a lot of development, but those are spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a whole plethora of minor characters, most of whom appear just for one episode. Every one of these characters feels alive - they don\u2019t merely expunge their beliefs onto Casshern, but show him the way that they live (or, of course, die) through their actions. Characters come in all variety of personality, shape, and size. (inside joke) Casshern could be said to have the best pseudo-harem since Ginko from Musi-shi.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is episodic much in the same sense as Cowboy Bebop. The chains of episodic parts are broken up by plot-related episodes, the major characters get their own introspective episodes, and the last group of episodes form the conclusion. There were a couple of less-than-amazing episodes (I remember finding 15 and 16 a bit boring and 21 is kind of ill-done but the next episode justifies it) but otherwise, every episode was great.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the plot episodes were superb, especially whenever Casshern and Dio fought, which was always quite epic. Besides the wonderful climactic episodes, I pretty much had 4 favorites. Episode 7, where a woman in a high tower teaches Casshern about the beauty of this ruined world - Episode 8, where a woman wants to spread hope through her song - Episode 12, where a man tries to paint his city his color so that the world will remember him - and Episode 18, and excellent cuckoo nest episode into Lyuze\u2019s psyche.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in the beginning, Casshern Sins is definitely not for everyone. If you like all kinds of anime regardless of genre and are easily interested in something without it having to be fast-paced, Casshern may be for you. If you\u2019ve always wished that the philosophical plots of pretentious anime would mix with the good fun and awesome fights of shounen action, Casshern may be for you. However, if slowness leaves you bored or action leaves you disinterested, you\u2019ll want to stay away. For me, the show was everything I could have wanted and filled a niche that I\u2019ve long waited for an anime to fill.",

            "content": "I started watching this anime, giving it a starting 6/10. I was up to a 9/10 within the first 7 episodes. Does that say something?\r\nI am pleased to say that it says a lot. Casshern Sins is what looks like the most original anime of the Spring 2008 lineup, and while it may be sad, it is truly amazing to watch. (This review will update as the series goes on, if all goes well ;D)\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nCasshern does not know if he is a man, robot, or neither. In a world of destruction, where humans are rarely found and the last of the robots rust, Casshernwanders, trying to discover his true self. If you exclude the amnesia cliche, the story is very original and engaging. You feel Casshern's emotions, you feel that somehow he has changed throughout his unknown ordeal, and you feel his sadness and frustration at his inability to control his primal instincts. As he wanders, he encounters many new things, all of which get him closer to discovering the truth of his world. The pace is somewhat slow in the beginning, but it gets quicker and stays generally understandable.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Casshern Sins truly shines. The animation is amazing to watch, it's fluid, smooth, and elegant. The battle scenes are works of art, and it seems like the animation staff is always excited to draw new panels instead of reusing the old ones again and again. The landscapes look fabulous, and draw the viewer deeper into the sadness and depression in Casshern. Everything is drawn and animated beautifully; this series is almost a must see just for the animation. The best part is that 11 episodes into the anime, the animation crew still has not cut any slack on this wonderful series.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe theme song is pretty good, the ending is also above average. Nothing super superb here, but the music is engaging enough to draw you into the anime and feel the emotions of the characters. The ED is a &quot;hopeful&quot; song, one that leaves you with the right emotion instead of destroying the ending mood with a happy go lucky ero ero ending... just what we don't need. Luckily Casshern Sins doesn't do this, and the background music is above average as well. Nothing super special here, but its definitely not bad.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCasshern is somewhat cliche in his amnesia-but-wanting-to-do-good act, but it definitely works well for this anime. The characers around him are very unique as well, and all of them have some sadness that they share with Casshern and different ambitions. The way the characters interact is very realistic, and there's not so many characters that you start getting confused. Casshern Sins does a good job of introducing the characters and letting you get to know them well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPromising series from what I have seen so far. I definitely reccomend checking Casshern Sins out if you're looking for something unique. It is a somewhat depressing anime at times, but it is meant to be saddening, so make sure that you watch something lighthearted afterwards. Unless you absolutely love the plot and characters, in which case I've done my job well :)  I suggest you give this one a shot; you may find something you really like.",

            "content": "What would you do if you couldn't change your fate? Would you grasp at any slither of hope that presents itself, even if that hope required you to hurt someone else? Or would you accept your fate? Just letting it pass over you? This is one of the many questions that Casshern Sins asks. \"What is the answer\" you might wonder? Well, let us sit down together and discuss it shall we.\r\nCasshern Sins is a remarkable feat, in that it somehow captures every single, minute detail of the human spirit. It achieves this by starting from the very basics and quickly developing on the basicsas the series moves on.\\n\r\n One thing that really took me in, is how Casshern Sins truly captured my fear of death. It achieved this through an odd but clever display of writing, by showing us that even the machines that we make will some day fall into decline as rusting scrap metal.\\n\\n\r\n I for one like to identify myself through the materials that I collect and make, and even this review right here is constructing another aspect of myself. Casshern Sins asks, what is the point of all this? I believe the materials that remain after my death will serve as a reminder of my existence, but nothing can escape the harsh reality of time and a millenium from now, it is an almost inescapable fact that those materials that I had so carefully constructed, so thoughtfully made, will just vanish. It is quite frightening and puts true emphasis on the word death.\\n\\n\r\n Things change however, a chance of hope comes along. An ideal that preserves life, immortality.\\n\r\n Many religious affiliations pervade Casshern Sins series. God from the perspective of Catholicism promises a chance of eternal life, I make this comparison as Sins as a robot stands as a metaphor for this deity, a promise for immortality. Building on that concept, the precious beautiful skin of his body only serves to emphasize the prize of such a trait, but being immortal comes at a price. A price that one may not expect. As time wears on, one discovers an infinite sea of potentials, this quest to transcend the boundaries between being just a simple robot engineered to destroy, to becoming 'human', not physically but consciously has begun, but once this has been achieved. Who is left to bear witness it? Even though this concept and theme is not exactly original, it must be said that Casshern Sins is particularly noteworthy on how it manages to effectively show this journey of emotional discovery in every excruciatingly painful detail.\\n\\n\r\n Watching this show reminded me of Paulo Coelho's quote \"It is the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary\" and it is the simple things in life that Casshern Sins detaches from and allows us to witness as realistically as possible; both the efforts and dramas to recapture these important and sometimes trivial things, but it is these aspects that only elevate the potency of Sins journey. Even when the helping hand of a loyal friend may seem far away, capturing that relatable and simple essence of loneliness has rarely ever made such a profound impact.\\n\\n\r\n A negative aspect to the story can largely be centered on the extremely pessimistic nature of the series and it can arguably fall into the category of angsty melodrama rather than insightful, and many of the concepts that are brought up through the entire series can come across as completely redundant by the series conclusion simply because of the handling. One scene that I wanted to bring up in particular is a scene where a robot finally submits to her desire of wanting to be immortal after reflecting for an entire episode that she wants to die naturally. Whilst it was certainly a powerful scene at the time, thinking back on it, the series only seems to want to be as depressing as possible. Whilst this isn't always a bad thing, it comes across as forced, and lacks a level of fluidity.\\n\\n\r\n However, with those observations out of the way, it still can't be dismissed that the overall series has very solid writing and is riveting in how it plays out. Never failing to provide a delicate balance of answers to the many questions that the series asks.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of Casshern Sins' characters are truly integral to the story that the show is telling, and because of the theme heavy story in respect with the series episodic nature. It is only inevitable that many new characters are constantly introduced in order to represent another aspect of a philosophical question/s that the series imposes. A lot of the characters become representations for the themes of mostly hope and despair, but entangles within many varying levels of regret, remorse, guilt, jealousy, occasional romantic struggle and sometimes optimism.\\n\\n\r\n Considering the series episodic nature, a large majority of the episodes do an absolutely splendid job of building characters in such a short time and it is a truly commendable aspect because at times I was almost pushed to tears in some of the more powerful episodes. Saying that, I will have to discredit some of the episodes for having an inconsistent quality, this inconsistency is mostly due to the characters that are being presented, but for the most part the character development is well above average and occasionally phenomenal but these cases are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\n I can only appreciate the characters so far though, because as I said previously there is a varying level of quality in the development of many of the characters, another problem I had with the characters is that many of them have very similar intentions  throughout the entire series, it can get a little repetitive at times. Adding onto that; some characters only seemed to be placed there to plunge Sins into a more intense state of guilt and regret. Even though this can be perceived as a problem. The fact remains that this can be ignored to an extent because these characters show that this the series is remaining true to the premise that it has given and does not cop-out, even at the moments when the series becomes unbearable.\\n\\n\r\n Many of the motivations for the characters are understandable, as a dying breed of life suffering from an incurable disease; I imagine it would only be natural for someone to carry out desperate measures when they have been pushed to their breaking point. This is one theme that Casshern Sins portrays better than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe series artwork does nothing but do what it sets out to do, abysmal and ruined, wrapped up in an unusual mixture of bluish-greyish brownish textures that builds the apocalyptic landscape with powerful ease.\\n\\n\r\n The series takes time to build on its own sorrow in order to emphasize some lovely landscapes that capture the quintessential and brooding style that is reminiscent of an Edward Hoppers painting, two that come to mind are \"The Lighthouse at Two Lights\", and \"Screaming Monkey Drive In\", pleasant to look at but cringing with a landscape of heart-ache and desperation.\\n\\n\r\n Much of the animation is carefully designed. One noticeable moment was a touch of rust painted below the eye-line of a robot. The moment was heart-breaking and is something that took me by absolute surprise. Rust is deterioration and its symbolic connotation within this scene was used to its utmost potential.\\n\\n\r\n I always look forward to bear witness to the fascinating ideas of art that series from Madhouse Animation studios have to offer and Casshern Sins is a beautiful edition to the collection that is sure to become an influence in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed about the OST was the consistently monotonous style across the board. Which certainly works in the series favor, but a couple of tracks stood out for me: the first one being \"Roamer\" as it captured the image of one man, simply standing a-top a hill graced in a red sunset, contemplating as to where his feet will take him next, it's a classic pose and one that holds much weight.\\n\\n\r\n The second one was \"Memory Past\", I'm not entirely sure what it was about this track but it just pushed a button in me. It was like I was floating in a sea of water feeling the waves softly carrying me. An interesting perspective to say the least, but I couldn't help picturing myself as a robot resting in the sand of the shallows feeling the water brush over me. It was a vivid moment, and a beautifully foolish one, it is simply a moment of passing time awaiting the day of no-return.\\n\\n\r\n At the time of watching this series. I think I was in the exact state of mind that was required to enjoy Casshern Sins and I finished it up in a marathon sitting. I tend to love a nice happy show as much as the next fellow but my thirst for drama can be over-bearing at times and Casshern Sins knew how to keep me glued to the couch. I was engaged with every detail that was playing out before me and every bit of terror, every moment of blissful decadence only served to invoke a greater emotional response from me. Those special moments of heart-ache scattered throughout, only serves my interest as keeping Casshern Sins as a worthy investment of my time for years to come.\\n\\n\r\n From what has been discussed I believe that Casshern Sins is a fantastic work, capturing every rigid emotion of the human spirit and melding every element so effectively. Constantly serving as a reminder to the breadth of questions that have been brought up and sought after in this series. Deep, often beautiful questions that serves as a recipe for sympathy and empathy towards all its characters as you bear witness to there destruction.\\n\\n\r\n I find it difficult to recommend this series mostly due to its overbearingly negative nature, and time has shown that not many people like pessimistic series. Nevertheless, for all of those out there who can withstand or perhaps immerse themselves in Casshern Sins battlefield of depression, they will surely find solace in the beauty of its melancholy.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "Spoilers Ahoy!\r\nCasshern&hellip; a series reboot of the original Shinzou Ningen Casshern back in 1973. Of all the new shows this season, I think this one is my favorite. Lets talk production values, people. I really enjoyed the OP and ED, I think they fit very well, and they have a nice melody. Music overall was certainly a strong point of the show. The BGM really fit well into the scenarios presented, and I think that they sound lovely as well. The animation is fluid, almost seamless, which goes along well with the simplistic character art and gorgeous post-apocalyptic backgrounds. The voices are another strong point.Personally, I had a fangasm when I discovered with glee that Utsumi Kenji was reprising his role as Braiking Boss. I don&rsquo;t think anyone else could have voiced him better than the original guy. The voice of Casshern was good too, and you can see the talent of Furuya Tooru. My only gripe in the entire show is Ringo. That little girl is kind of messed up looking. To quote Tenka Seiha, she looks like she&rsquo;s going to devour Casshern. You can really see the connections to the old series. The robot designs are the same, but the coloring is gone, rusted and corroded due to the ruin. They are as cruel and heartless as they were in the first version too.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m really enjoying the plot. A fanboy like myself has been coming up with so many conspiracy theories about the plot, and links to the old show back in the 70&rsquo;s. Hell, I typed a three-page bullet list on my theories. Leave me a comment if you&rsquo;re interested. So Casshern wakes up from a hundred year slumber with no memories. All we know is that he killed Luna, and the Ruin (the apocalypse) was triggered by this event. Humans are now few and far between, being slowly killed by the poisonous air from the Ruin and Ringo even comments that she has not seen one. The robots don&rsquo;t fair any better. The poisonous air is corroding and killing them along with the humans. Casshern kills a bunch of robots that think that they can end the Ruin and become immortal if they devour him. A strange woman appears, and notes the patheticness of the robots, then vanishes. We see that Casshern is wounded as well, and he screams. An old man, Oji, realizes that Casshern has awakened, and Braiking Boss tells him it is so. Casshern later meets a little girl robot named Ringo, and she comments that he is as pretty as a human. (In the original series, Casshern was originally a human who turned himself into a cyborg to combat the robot menace.) Ringo says she&rsquo;s broken, Casshern says she&rsquo;s not, Ringo gives him a shell and runs off. Casshern has a few flashbacks of when he killed Luna, and this causes him to freak out every so often. (These flashbacks helped fuel my theories too). Casshern, the super-hearing sexy devil that he is, hears her shells drop as she is attacked by a robot, and rushes to help her. He carries her to safety, then turns into badass mode. Glowing green-blue eyes, and combat ready. He brutally destroys the robot in retaliation for hurting Ringo, but in return, he makes Ringo afraid of him. Oji carries her off, voicing his disappointment in Casshern (which was one of my conspiracy flags, comment on my profile if interested.) The enigmatic female that showed up earlier and notes how brutal Casshern is, and that he disgusts her. He is the cause of the Ruin, and that is all she needs to know to hate him enough to want to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I&rsquo;m in love with this show. The production value is incredible, the story is intriguing, and it made me, a fanboy, come up with theories of conspiracy with renewed vigor. I highly recommend this series to fans of the original show, superhero fans, fans of a dark story, and anyone in general. My overall score is 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nProduction done by Madhouse. Airs on Wednesday. Subs by Shinsen.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to an experimental anime like this, it\u2019s quite difficult to give a conventional score. Even more so, Casshern Sins tends to polarize the audience into two groups: either calling it a work of art or being bored as hell by it. \r\nHere\u2019s a good test whether you may or may not like it. \r\nAre you an anime fan one who: \r\nA) Tolerates a continuously oppressively grim atmosphere and a snail-paced plot? \r\nB) Forgives gaping plot holes for the sake of appreciating the heavy symbolism and existentialism?\r\nC) Is fine with an acrobatic fist-fight for every single episode?\r\nD) Doesn\u2019t mind sparse dialogue, one-note andmelodramatic characters, and numerous silent introspections?\\n\r\nE) All of the above\\n\\n\r\nIf you picked choice E, the chances are in your favor and you may like this style over substance anime. \\n\\n\r\n**No Spoilers really.  And I\u2019ll be vague in the analysis as for the most part, you should be the one doing that. Keep in mind, that it can be a depressing anime. **\\n\\n\\n\r\nConcepts, Character, Story-\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have much of a plot but has some unique and interesting concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half starts episodically, featuring heavily on the surrounding bleak world. Our main protagonist, Casshern, wanders around the barren wasteland and sees how the various humans and robots react towards this post-apocalyptic event that he caused. Suffering from amnesia, he intends to find answers in his placement for this world. Meanwhile, the second half starts explaining the mysteries of what occurs. But it never gets fully resolved and makes gigantic jumps in the narrative. There were sudden shifts in characterization and in the end, becomes incredibly ambiguous. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the cast of characters, \u201cnaturally wooden\u201d would be the best way to describe them. \\n\\n\r\nThe main quintet of Casshern, Lyuze, Ringo, Ouji and Friender appear one-note and simple to evaluate. Their dialogue is sparse, often calling each other\u2019s name many times or simply staying silent the entire time in an artistic way. Also, Casshern may seem also too melodramatic at first, but very slowly develops because of the other characters. The antagonists and robots (if I can even call them antagonists) have simple motives but gets confusing as it changes pace in the second half and stumbles itself near the end. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of their flat characterization, they give out further meaning towards this post-apocalyptic world in a crucial, yet subtle way. However, for Casshern Sins, it becomes a double-edged sword as non-recurring secondary characters of each episode suffer from redundancy. There are no surprises from seeing what may occur to them (it\u2019s quite predictable and repetitive), but taken upon further necessary examination, they provide some heavy symbolism that manages to be new in its own right episodically. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, it depicts a metaphorical setting that not many anime generally would take. There are lengths for ambiguity for it and different interpretations on what they may mean. However, most of the themes are rooted in existentialism and the meaning of life.  \\n\r\nGranted, despite its slow pacing and episodic format, I had to binge watch this over the course of 3 days as I\u2019ll end up forgetting the impact of the setting and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art/Animation-\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, Kaoru Wada made it seem like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for his InuYasha\u2019s OST. Seriously, I could replace some of the tracks and it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. However, it does well to bring out the bleak aspects of the atmosphere and manages to blend into the ambiance. The opening \u201cAoi Hana\u201d by Color Bottle has a catchy sound that I like but doesn\u2019t fit well overall. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, \u201cA Path\u201d sung by Nami Miyahara has some pretty good English pronunciations (even more so with the English version by Caitlin Glass) and bears weight to the overall themes to the anime. It\u2019s very emotionally moving, but it noticeably gets repeated a couple times, though.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for both English and Japanese carry out their part when necessary and manages to project the character's angst for catharsis. One thing that I may have overlooked would be the sound effects. The visceral crunches of the iron clad robots and the most minor of movements such as rustling fabric embellish the complexion of its environment even when dialogue remains tacit. And there are occasions of a show-and-don't-tell presentation.   \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes visually, it does well for it. It\u2019s Madhouse what do you expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe brown rusting of the robots gives a good contrast to the azure sky. The details are quite beautiful to gaze especially since not much else is going on. The specks of dust and other particles splinter into the air on many occasions and it's very aesthetically pleasing especially with the flora that sometimes gets presented.\\n\\n\r\nChildlike character designs are juxtaposed towards its more depressing background. The contours are bold and sleek but details are quite simple. The animation features very solid figures with hand-to-hand combat, although I can\u2019t help but easily see the numerous repetitions of each scene. I distinctly remember certain fights and robots being re-used. Because of these repetitions, it makes it feel even more monotonous. It's a bit unique though as choreographed scenes quickly pan to the smaller details of the area rather than focusing on the characters, having that elegant flair. \\n\\n\r\nWhile certainly not the most high-budgeted and most amazing animation, its presentation and style is what makes work well for the atmosphere and the anime as a whole. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10 (first 15 episodes) \\n\r\n       7/10 (latter part) \\n\r\n       5/10(ending)\\n\\n\r\nWhat made me enjoy this anime would be its world. The pacing is intentionally slow and not hamfisted with details, allowing for some thought-provoking ideas on existentialism to leak through. It establishes that ambiance and truly makes it a post-apocalyptic world. Because of this, even if I found many scenes to be melodramatic and not relatable, it manages to get me emotionally that some other anime can\u2019t pull off. \\n\\n\r\nIt takes the conventional heroism where the main character is OP, and there are continuous strings of fights for a sense of justice. However, it subverts it as the fights are never thrilling, mostly everyone (including the antagonists) are victims of the decaying society, and the meaning to continue to pursue a goal is grimly lost as one mindlessly wanders around the world, knowing that he is different and must be alone as he loses everyone around him.\\n\\n\r\nOnce it starts trying to unravel its mystery, my focus shifted towards that and I was expecting some sort of large revelation that would solve everything. But it doesn\u2019t. Near the end, the pacing speeds up, makes a large shift in unresolved details, and fizzles out in the end. \\n\\n\r\nIf I would make an analogy, it\u2019s kind of like Ouji\u2019s dilapidated jeep. It works well slowly, but when it puts the pedal to the metal and makes a large U-turn, the rusted parts start crumbling away because of the Ruin. At least there is still some meaning for that ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- a mid-high 7/10 (Good, not average)\\n\\n\r\nThe flaws are apparent such as its monotonous pacing and unrealistic characters. If taken at face-value, this anime will be a terrible chore. This anime is not the most accessible as it doesn\u2019t cater the audience\u2019s general accustomed tastes. However, its quality is mostly based on the eye of the beholder through individual experience and appreciation for analyzing. If read in-between the lines in its atmospheric presentation, it will be a unique experience that few ever dwell upon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I thought I would really like Casshern Sins, but this was a letdown of epic proportions. My original impression was that the Casshern character would be a modern day Kenshiro of Fist of the North Star, or something akin to it; a lone wolf hero trekking across the devastated wasteland to fulfill his purpose/clear his name/discover who he is. Any one of these would've been nice, but intsead of taking a plot synopsis as simple as this anime produces and making something good out of it, it fails to deliver on any conceivable level that would be considered quality entertainment. \r\n Now this storymoves slow, I mean VERY slow, and this is the first noticable flaw of Casshern Sins. This is supposed to serve as dramatic build up, but the schitck wears thin after five episodes, and establishes nothing outside of what the audience already knows. The trick to telling a competent story is to offer mood and then deliver the plot, from there you move on to climax, as opposed to the 12 episode circle jerk the first DVD boxset provides. Calling it a story gives it too much credit, because it implys that anything thats taking place is going to lead somewhere. Humpty Dumpty has more plot cohesion then Casshern Sins because even this nursery rhyme managed to tell a decent plot offering a character (the Egg), the situation (a wall he wanted to sit on), the predicament (he fell), and a conclusion (he died). In Casshern, we get the egg beating up a bunch of rotten eggs and other eggs talking.\\n\r\n There's lots of dialouge, but I lost interest in anything ANY of these characters had to say by episode nine.\\n\r\n Which is Cassherns' other problem: Bland as hell, one demonsional lead characters. Casshern himself is a six page rant in itself, so I'll just summarize the point of my angst in regards to this character and others written like him: I HATE AMNESIA-STRICKEN ANIME LEADS! This is a cliche that's been done to death and I am sick of seeing every other title being bogged down by a main character with a gimmick thats been used to death by Hannah-Barbera in the sixties. Writing a character that doesn't remember anything excuses the author of having to make their hero develop in a chronological sense with the rest of the stroy because everything has to grind to a halt until he says, \"OH YEAH, now I remember!\" It's insipid and five out of every ten shows is almost guaranteed to use this stunt. As for Lyuze, she's even more worthless than Casshern himself. Her grief against him seems simple enough, but becomes insufferable as time goes on. How do have complex emotions about a guy who allegedly destroyed your past that borders outside genocidal rage?! It's ricidulousluy stupid character writing and diving into her psyche only shows just how egotistical and self-deluded this writing staff really was into thinking they were creating a philosophical masterpiece. The villians Leda and Dio add nothing at all besides generic obstacles who, from what I could piece together, fail as antagonists, and Ringo's only driven purpose is to chew up as much scenery as possible before the Ruin hits. The characters in this show are episodic.\\n\r\n The animation is impressive at first, but gets hammered into your brain with as many cluttered, over-choreographed fight scenes as any given episode of Bleach, and the fights are just as meaningless. If this show isn't talking your ear off, it's showing Casshern laying waste to every rejected Mega Man robot master fans submitted in to be put into a video game and nobody can lay a hand on him! This guy no-sells damage worse than John Cena!!\\n\r\nIN CLOSING: Not since RaXephon have I made it all the way through an anime that could've been promising if it had direction, likable characters, and wasn't so pretentious and long-winded in it's own bullcrap writing. Characters talk, dialogue goes nowhere, then they fight and fight and fight, then stop for more talking. Intrigue was lost halfway through and the climax was God-awful. I'm sorely disappointed that I spent money on this. I'm gonna go turn myself into a robot bell.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3\\n\r\nART: 5\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPROS: English dub isn't bad\\n\r\nCONS: Lackadasical writing, boring characters, repetitive BGM, everything else",

            "content": "Erected from the pillars that once cradled human civilization, the Robotic Empire reached its pinnacle under the iron-clad rule of Braiking Boss and the grace of the Sun that was called Moon. Then came the Ruin, and with it the end of those fabled days. Once thought immortal, the empire, its structures and citizens, and even nature itself into rust and decay and death. A landscape dotted with the deceased and dying, attributed to the sins of one machine... Casshern.\r\nDirected by Shingeyasu Yamauchi, scripted by Reiko Yoshida and Yasuko Kobayashi, and produced by Madhouse, whose resume includes the popular Death Note, the recent Chihayafuru, thesomber Gunslinger Girl, and the short Death Billiards, Casshern Sins is a reboot of earlier Casshern franchises, Shinzou Nigen Casshern and Casshern: Robot Hunter. The old-school character design by Yoshihiko Umakoshi is meant to be a tribute to those earlier eras of Casshern and anime itself. This new reincarnation, however, takes more similarities in substance from, say, the Rebuild of Evangelion than the Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica Movies in that they both seek to tell their own separate tales. However, unlike the Rebuild of Evangelion, a copy and paste of personality and drive of its earlier counterpart, Neon Genesis Evangelion, this show hosts vastly dissimilar character backstories and motivations. Now, as grave his deed may be of killing Luna and, consequently, unleashing the Ruin, the Casshern the audience follows at the show's opening, as opposed to the Casshern of flashbacks, has no recollection of his deed nor much knowledge of the consequences of the devastation aside for the obvious absence of life from organisms and machines alike, hounded by hordes of robotic thugs wishing to consume his flesh so they can live forever, or so the rumor goes (a fallacious conclusion due to Casshern somehow gaining immortal himself) and Lyuze, a robot in the likeness of a woman, that seeks vengeance for his supposed crimes. Yes, robots are defined, in part, by gender. It's not for guttural reasons for once, mind you. \\n\\n\r\nConsider the philosophical classification of being and personhood. Being refers to concrete qualities such as a blood vessel or a wired transistor, whereas personhood refers to more abstract qualities, yet qualities the majority of us can't deny doesn't exist, such as emotion, reason, and free will. Now, put aside any preconceived notions of mechanical agents save their hardware and understand that the robots in this setting are both beings and persons, much as humans typically are. Factoring the fact that a robot can exist indefinitely and coupling it with the effects of the Ruin, these elements are a conceptual build for this question: how would one react when suddenly confronted with the reality of mortality? It's something humanity has long since acknowledged, but robot-kind? What we have here isn't mainly sci-fi or action. People looking for primarily one or the other will be disappointed. Instead, we have life's meaning. If you're not interested in topics pertaining to existentialism, as too many people are unfortunately, then you might want to pass this show by. If you are, then, by all means... read on.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern and ourselves ignorant of the Ruin, its effects on all persons, places, and things it encompasses, we learn about this destitute world's people as well as the world itself bit by bit through his eyes, his encounters. Each of these encounters follow an episodic format: the inhabitants of the hospice, the man who coughs blood, the angel of ruin, the maker of bells, the singer, the artist, etc. Some romantic, others tragic, still others enigmatic, but most... inspiring, and soon a theme takes shape. A matter of living vs. existing. Our female warrior confronts the same internal conflict in Episode 20, complete with a host of surreal spatterings. Kudos to Madhouse, or rather, some studio other than Shaft, for putting the effort to experiment, to challenge the bounds of what constitutes a meaningful visual experience. The more conventional visuals are excellent as well. The devastation of the Ruin and the traces of life in plants and people in between, already striking to the eye, become more poignantly bleak and beautiful in juxtaposition than they would otherwise. The same can be said of peoples' that have given in or carry on in the face of death and the way they carry themselves, whether on the move or in a fight, from clunky and cluttered, to impassioned and empowered.\\n\\n\r\nWith shows of episodic natures, specially ones that have more to do with observation than action, they can afford to take a few more liberties than would otherwise be acceptable. However, the conveniences have piled up in Casshern Sins to a point where they are too noticeable to ignore, particularly the frequency and timing of generic mobs assaulting Casshern and whatever company he keeps for generic reasons: misery loves company, and desperation begets savagery. It's not that these reasons aren't worthy for illustration, but they lose their impact when they become cliches. It gets tiring when the show has to resort to them to make a point. Devoid of much in the way of substantial variance, the fighting and imagery can get fatiguing, even if they aren't merely for the fighting and imagery's sake. I can only look at flowers and Casshern going apeshit on metallic husks for so long until I have to shout \u201cI get it already!\u201d to get rid of the frustration. The recurring cast too, for that matter. Then there are just moments where both feel out of place, particularly towards the end. Speaking of endings, the show decided to forgo episodic beginning at the half-way mark and finish plot-driven, namely, discovering how to end the Ruin. Unfortunately, plot-driven narratives permit far less wiggle room and require more solid development, and the content of before hadn't done much of a good trying to map out the developments of this overarching plot. The result toward the end were that certain mysteries from before were completely neglected and others after were suggested but forgotten or too ambiguous to really appreciate. New material is rammed in, scattered throughout, and resolved without enough time for it to settle and concentrate. Some developments occur that even within episodic paradigm are hard even for me to swallow, not to mention certain themes are just stabbed over and over like a mentally battle-scarred greenhorn trying to make sure his bloated, putrid husk of an enemy adversary is dead with his equally odorous bayonet. The time the show took toward overemphasize would be better served trying to address more pressing issues. And finally, the resolution that Casshern ultimately decides to act on, one of arrogance, is one that, given his journey and my convictions, leaves a foul taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetics for the OP \u201cAoi Hana\u201d or \u201cBlue Flower\u201d by Color Bottle is mainly composed of a sequence of pictures of Casshern and Lyuze doing aloof poses. However, combined with the acute climb in musical intensity from rest, the images take a transitional quality, blurring the seams of stagnancy into motion, a blurred barrier between still artwork and animation frames, blurs of vocals. The music itself is comprised of a freewheelings of the drum set, electric guitar, and male vocals. They give off this air of freedom in how each of these parts, summed together, can so effortlessly careen in speed, volume, and dynamic. The OP and EDs have lyrics fitting for the subject of the show, but while the OP appears to mimic fits of passion, the EDs take on more subdued, reflective tones. That, of course doesn't diminish the enjoyment I got from either. The EDs for Episodes 1-12 and 14-23 are \u201cReason,\u201d by K\u2227N\u2227 and \u201cHikari to Kage,\u201d or \u201cLight Like a Shadow,\u201d by Shinji Kuno respectively. Both are pleasant, the former, upbeat and uplifting, the latter, dreamy and drifting. Episode 13 has a separate ED entitled \u201cAoi Kage.\u201d While the rest of the OST excels in helping establish a tonally appropriate mood for each scene that it is present in, a noteworthy mention goes to the OST, \u201cA Path,\u201d by Nami Miyahara in the sub and Caitlin Glass in the dub. Sung by the main episodic one-shot character Janice in Episode 8, the number recurs throughout the series. If there's one factor that may lead one to watch the dub over the sub, it's that the English voice actor on this particular piece does a better job than her Japanese Seiy\u016b counterpart. In addition to being fluent in the language that the lyrics for the OST was written in, namely, English, Glass just conveys more passion, more power, more consistency, more expression, more flourish into the words. In Episode 8, she works with the motions of her character as Janice has her moment on stage, whereas Miyahara work feels, comparatively, distant and disconnected.\\n\\n\r\nThough distasteful the ending may have been received by me personally, I'm grateful toward the show and all its moments throughout its beginning three fourths worth of content, splayed out in those many encounters, those many moments, for taking on such a bold and contemplative topic in such an inventive and imaginative way.\\n\\n\r\nI give Casshern Sins an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "To describe this anime in one word is simple: depressing. Casshern Sins follows Casshern--a character who doesn't know whether he is human or robot--in a dystopic world that is, quite literally, the end of the world. I don't mean it's some Armageddon-like atmosphere where some supernatural force is destroying everything; in this setting, the world is just dying. It is a barren wasteland where even robots, who are supposed to be immortal, experience death.\r\nOf the nine episodes that I have seen so far, each episode follows a pattern: Casshern is wandering through his seemingly endless journey when he meets a new character. This new character,just like every other being in that world, is suffering in some form from the ruin. But while this pattern detracts from the overall plot of the story (I don't need to provide it, you can read it yourself), it adds new perspectives. It goes to show how one worldwide trauma can separately affect different lives. It adds a new personal tale each episode that serves to constantly remind and torment Casshern of his sin. This increases his need for redemption and his need for finding the answers. One definitely cannot say by the end of this anime that Casshern receives no development.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are some recurring characters--particularly Lyuze, Ringo, and Oji--and their consistent interaction with Casshern is realistic, not to mention it provides some development for them as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery is horribly lovely. There could honestly be no better way of drawing such a bleak setting than with the animation style that is used in this anime. There's just a quality to the art that makes this anime its own; an art that is both beautiful and upsetting. And the music, while repetitive, is fitting. I only gave Sound a 5 because of its lack of diversity, not because it doesn't work. (Of course, I could just be tone deaf and unable to decipher distinct soundbites.)\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone asked for my opinion of this anime, I would definitely recommend it. But I must also warn anyone who tries to watch it to keep a good couple years' supply of antidepressants handy, whether or not you're prone to manic depression.",

            "content": "Story:  The story is a very thought-provoking and great examination of the value of truly living your life, as opposed to passing through it aimlessly.  It is about an apparently immortal robot named Casshern, who after killing a woman named Luna, creates the Ruin, a plague that causes the world to die.  All life has withered away, and any survivors are on the brink of insanity as they are surrounded by death.  His journey to discover his identity and role in this new world causes the robots he comes into contact with to realize the value of our existances and theirthoughts on life itself.  It is a very engrossing, thought-provoking story for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The drawing style is very minimalist, but is works incredibly in the context of the world of ruin.  Everything is very angular and colors are usually very muted.  It helps to establish the world of Casshern as one that is both unique and memorable.  This carries over into the fight scenes as well, where the fast movements really compliment the sharpness of the drawings to create a very visually exciting and energetic sense of combat.  The art style really helps to bring all the themes of this universe and the intensity of combat into full fruition.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The music is very fitting.  It's mostly sinister, ominous tones used to bring out the dread of the world at hand.  However, many tracks bring out the small shimmers of hope Casshern and his friends encounter in a world governed by death.  It is these tracks that really stand out to me personally as great compositional scores and pieces that really bring the main themes of the show to light.  \"A Path\" stands out as one of the best songs in anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  All characters in this anime are fully-fleshed out and are all very important in the grand scheme of things.  The character of Casshern is a great lead.  Yes, his amnesia is a little generic in anime in general, but it never becomes a problem and serves to re-enforce the themes presented.  Ringo is a great kid character, never annoying but still very childish.  She also serves as a great motivator for everyone, always inspiring them to search for a better tomorrow even as the odds are stacked against them.  Lyuze, Ohji, and Friender all serve as great lead characters that all contribute equally to the story at large.  The villians are real showstoppers as well.  Dio and Leda are a great duo that are full realized and make very worthy adversaries to Casshern's team.  Braking Boss as well is a great sideline villian.  He is a master manipulator that always gets other people to do his work for him.  \\n\\n\r\nCasshern SINS is a fantastic anime series that deserves your attention.  The depressing atmosphere may turn off some people, and in the first half of the show its basically all one shot stories, but that's OK.  Everyone else who sticks around will get not only an outstanding action anime, but an outstanding action anime that makes the characters and you the viewer think at the same time.  It is truly a remarkable and unique show for the current generation of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score, 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "People who lose their memories of the past are almost always dying to get those back. They feel empty inside, as if something was taken out of them. Something irreplaceable... Is Casshern the same? \r\nI think that this question kept running through the studio director's mind as he decided to take up an old project that was long lost and created its new version - Casshern SINS. The series is a 24-ep-long philosophic discussion on the sense of human nature and its everlasting need for self-improvement. Paradoxically though, there are very few humans in this distorted world. The entities who appear to be more humaneare... decaying and rusting robots... \\n\\n\r\nThe story keeps dwelling on the subject of coming of age and dying as well, as almost every robot out there is about to perish because the world has lost its only flower - Luna. And this aspect is staggering too. Every episode presents a different story with a different characters. Of course some stories intertwine to create a whole plot line, but mostly you will have to get used to one story-one ep form of the show. It remains that way till the very end. You'll also have to get used to a very slow pace. Noone is rushing nothing here. There are moments of complete silence (that is if you don't have a proper hi-fi and a blu-rau version) or a muttering sound of the wind rustling with the rocks, the sand and the water ocassionally. There are almost no plants in Casshern's world. Only rust, rocks and the remains of human civilization. This picture may sometimes get depressing, but there's not one thing in this show that would suggest that it should be different. But going back to the story, which is the main protagonist here...\\n\r\nAs the show progresses many truths about the world are revealed. Some are universal and old-school viewers would get to those since episode one, and some are... impossible to comprehend at first. But once you reach the final episode most of those are cleared. And even in this distorted world, there is a place for family warmth and love. These two transcendental aspects of our nature will have their toll on Casshern, as he changes from ruthless and calm destruction machine into... a human, who no longer needs his past, and no longer needs Luna.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply brilliant. Throughout the whole series you won't find a single persona that is boring or useless. Every single one of them is relevant to Casshern's journey towards the light. Every single one of them is a part of this world and adds up to the whole image. Despite all this, Casshern is alone. He may have a cybernetic dog called 'Friender' but it still does not account for a companion, although the dog seems to be more intelligent than its master at times. Likewise with the story, Casshern earns the trust of the two most important people he has met on his journey - the robot-girl I mentioned above - Ringo, and another robot-girl who seeks revenge on Casshern -  Lyuze. You can easily guess now, who his family is...\\n\\n\r\nI think I'll just pass through the video and audio aspect. Although both important, they had little influence on me, as the story kept me interested more and more. Of course, in an anime of this level those are splendid. The animation is perfect and smooth, and Casshern's bloody battles are impressive. The same goes for the audio part. If you have a good quality release and a hi-fi you can hear a lot more than you may think. The score is beautiful on the other hand, and I really loved the op and ed sequences. \\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up. Casshern SINS is not an anime for everyone. Those looking for pure action and quick pace will quickly get bored and tossed away, despite the very good quality of art and music. Those longing for heart breaking experience and great story will love it all the way through, and those looking for a title to shed some tears on... it's for you as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm partially all those types mentioned, and I sincerely loved it. More than most other titles in 2008...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cHumans are always contradictions.\u201d\r\nEarly in Casshern Sins, a character makes this observation. It wasn't lost on me that Casshern Sins is full of seeming contradictions itself; the series features fast action and snail's-pace plot development, \u201coldschool\u201d character designs presented with new technology, extreme violence and quiet speculation, and a tone that wavers schizophrenically between \u201cuplifting\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d The end result is something unique enough to merit a cautious recommendation.\r\nCasshern Sins centers around the titular Casshern\u2014a character who wakes up on a barren futuristic world knowing nothing of his past. The only thing he seems to remember is how to brutally kill others; he only knowshis own name because it's what his enemies scream as they attempt to kill him. The world is ravaged by The Ruin, a plague that slowly destroys robots and humans alike. Casshern quickly learns that in the distant past he was responsible for killing Luna, a life-giving savior. Her death caused The Ruin. Burdened by this knowledge, Casshern attempts to navigate the unknown world while gradually learning more about his past, and the sins that he cannot remember.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a strong one, with many intricacies that are revealed as time passes. Two stories are actually being told at once; one of the present and, indirectly, one of the past. The parallels between them drive the series forward with the feeling of a classic tragedy. \u201cComplete amnesia\u201d is a plot device that seems to be very popular nowadays, but this series manages to present a pretty original spin on it. It's not used for cheap emotional content. Instead, it's an integral part of establishing the plot. It allows other characters to show Casshern just what he did wrong, but since the explanation is actually a necessary one to get Casshern on the right track, it doesn't feel like needless exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, Casshern Sins doesn't seem to be about sin/atonement (as the title suggests) but, rather, about life and death. Specifically, whether or not immortality would really be \u201cworth it,\u201d so to speak. In this world, robots and humans have been equalized by The Ruin\u2014robots were once immortal, but now certain death lies on the horizon for both races, and how each party reacts to the looming threat is an integral part of the show. Some fight The Ruin, gratefully embracing any semblance of hope, while others give up entirely and await their end in silence. The series poignantly debates whether it's better to live in a calm eternity, like a placid lake, or to live a short but fulfilling life before succumbing to death, like a fire burning in the night. \\n\\n\r\nNow, while I was a fan of the story and themes, it's tough not to be put off by the pacing of the show. For the first half of its running time Casshern Sins is episodic, meaning that each episode tells a self-contained story that's connected only loosely\u2014if at all\u2014to the overarching plot. The problem with most of these episodes was that, while they connect well to the repeated ideas of life and death, most of them lack any connection to the central storyline. Sometimes it feels like the series is just buying time, and to be honest, there are points where these episodes do drag a little bit. I wouldn't say they're \u201cfiller\u201d episodes, but some of them do merit the question: \u201cDid this really need to be here?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIn fairness, Casshern Sins does find its stride around episode 13, when the series switches to a continuous story thread that puts more focus on major plot points. But whether or not you can wait it out until then to see the pacing pick up is a different story. Even after that point, it's still a pretty slow-moving show, with many, many exchanges of dialogue, but the change from \u201cgut-wrenchingly slow\u201d to \u201cslow but deliberate\u201d is noticeable and welcoming once you get there.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the characters in Casshern Sins, it's necessary to know that the show features two different \u201csets\u201d of characters: Episodic characters, who exist only in the context of one episode, and the main cast, who persist throughout the show. The episodic characters are generally well-written and given a lot of emotional appeal, but they suffer from the same problem I described above; that is, they connect to the show's themes, but not its story, and therefore some of them can end up feeling a little unnecessary. The main cast, on the other hand, features several memorable characters that get fully fleshed out as the series progresses. Casshern is the central figure for most character development. Whether Casshern is to be hated or sympathized with is a running argument throughout the show, and you can tell a lot about a character based on which side they take. As Casshern grows to learn more about his past and present, and develop thoughts of his own, this creates a sort of ripple effect in which the other characters change along with him. The central cast are all given appropriate backstories that are revealed at strategic points in the show, adding a sense of depth and believability to their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals...man, I really need to stop reviewing Madhouse shows, because they're always great looking. Casshern Sins features extremely detailed background art that turns the world of robots and humans into a beautiful dystopia of vast deserts, barren mountains, and shining seas. When there is an oasis in the middle of this hellish world\u2014a spot of pink and blue flowers, perhaps\u2014it looks even more gorgeous by contrast. The art seems to echo the show's themes; everything that's still alive seems to be encircled by the empty land, besieged by death from every direction. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the character designs in Casshern Sins are decidedly more \u201coldschool\u201d than what most of us are probably used to. Most of the characters have sharper, thinner, more angular bodies than what's common nowadays, and in truly classic style, everyone seems to have ridiculously massive and spiky hair in every color of the rainbow. All gentle mockery aside, these designs look great; I always welcome a unique departure from the norm. Casshern himself seems almost iconic, a spot of white and red in a world that's completely black and brown.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say that Casshern Sins also has some great action sequences, which are lovingly animated. Casshern is an elegant killing machine who seems to almost dance while he's fighting, bringing a strange sort of beautiful brutality to the table. He pirouettes and spins, all while violently dismembering his opponents, splitting them in half, or ripping out pieces of their inner workings with his bare hands. The scenes of action are well-choreographed, a real treat to watch, and there's no shortage of them in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins also shines in the sound department, where a beautiful orchestral soundtrack is used to great effect. Most of the songs feature string and wind instruments as the lead sounds, with an occasional chanted or choir element of background vocals. Despite the high quality of the soundtrack in general, I took some slight issues with two songs that occasionally play in the show: They have English lyrics, and pretty hammy ones, at that. While the singer (Nami Miyahara, who also voices a main character) has a great voice and puts in an admirable effort, she still sings with a noticeable Japanese accent. This, combined with the cheesiness of the lyrics, means that these songs will probably not have the intended effect on an audience of native English speakers. This is a relatively small complaint, and since English speakers were (obviously) not the originally intended audience of the show, it's really not anyone's fault, but it's there nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins has a lot going for it\u2014it boasts a great plot, mature themes, memorable characters, refreshing art, and a top-notch soundtrack. When it comes right down to it, I'd say that the only thing holding Casshern Sins back from true greatness is its pacing; it's the biggest flaw in an otherwise excellent series. Whether or not you're capable of enjoying this series is completely up to how patient you are. If you're the type that doesn't like to wait, and wants a story that's always in high gear, watching this would be a nightmare. But those with a high degree of tolerance for things that are slow to develop might find Casshern Sins to be well worth their time.\\n",

            "content": "In a nutshell, I think that Casshern Sins is a terrible anime. I might\u2019ve given it a slightly higher rating, say, a 2 or even a whopping 3 instead of 1 like I am giving it now, if only I haven\u2019t picked it up because after watching Ergo Proxy I read on Reddit that \u201cErgo Proxy is just a pale shadow of Casshern Sins\u201d. I loved Ergo Proxy to bits, so naturally I just had to have a look at something that was potentially even better. This, however, made me compare the two series at every turn, be it consciously or subconsciously, and it wasnever in Casshern Sins favor. So, I went in with reasonably high expectations, and what I have encountered has disappointed me so badly that my overall impression of Casshern Sins ended up being even grimmer than it could\u2019ve been. That being said, I am certain that if I had gone in blind, I would still hate it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the plot tells us a story of a not-quite-robot-not-quite-human named Casshern who mopes his way through the wastelands of a planet where once a mighty robot civilization now falling prey to Ruin has flourished, or so we\u2019re told, at least, but I somehow doubt the civilization had been that advanced. We only get to see a handful of small towns, one (one!) spare parts factory, a church, and the rest is, well, desert, copious amounts of flower fields (I swear, there are more flower fields than there are towns, but of course there are, everyone knows flowers are essential to robot well-being, right?), desert, lake, plains, sea, some more desert, caves, some gigantic microphone-shaped constructions of unknown origin and purpose protruding from the sand in the, oh, did I mention there\u2019s deserts? No, there\u2019s no roads or any infrastructure whatsoever, except maybe, uh, some pools or hot springs or whatever, which again, everybody know robots can\u2019t live without, like flowers. Oh, and there\u2019s a hidden experimental laboratory tucked away somewhere, too, but it\u2019s the humans\u2019, not the robots\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nYes, there\u2019s apparently humans, too, although you only ever see, like three of them over the course of the entire series and they\u2019re all minor background characters. They have created robots, and the apparent root cause of all conflict in the series \u2013 Luna, an, uh, immortal frog-faced girl with twin blue ponytails that provided life eternal for man and robot alike, until Casshern came along and somehow managed to do her in despite her stated immunity to death, thereby attaining immortality himself and unleashing  the mysterious plague called Ruin upon the world. What it does, as we\u2019re told and shown, is that it makes robots rust and start to break down gradually, resulting in their eventual death and dissolution into dust. All tools are apparently subject to this too, for some reason. In episode two we\u2019re told that replacing rusted parts doesn\u2019t work, but it doesn\u2019t preclude robots from still trying to do that in a bid to save their life. Just, y\u2019know, not in a rational way of \u201cmass-producing spare parts so we could change them as soon as they start showing signs of wear\u201d (the only factory we see is in perfect working order, so it\u2019s certainly not out of realm of possibilities). Instead, those who can, choose to hunt smaller and weaker robots to take them apart for their innards. As in, in one instance, a large, classic box-shaped giant robot with a flail or a morning star for an arm picks up a tiny robot identical to a human child in all respects, cackling triumphantly, and gleefully tells us he\u2019s going to get so many good parts from this body still relatively untainted by Ruin. Are you fucking dumb, Robot-Man?! There\u2019s no way ANY of her parts will fit you. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that was a major source of my unending frustration with this anime \u2013 NOTHING adds up. The world is an entirely illogical mishmash of half-baked apocalypse-themed ideas no one ever bothered to think through. The details of it end up contradicting each other ultimately, and that\u2019s where the details are given at all. I have mentioned above that humans are a part of the world in Casshern Sins, but nothing is ever explained about them, not their relationship with robots after they have created them (we only know that the robot king hated them, and that \u201cbad\u201d robot goons will kill them on sight, but the why of it is left out), not where they reside and what they are doing now, not how the Ruin affects them, if it at all does (seems to imply it does, fails to explain how), nor, most importantly, what the difference between the robots and people even is, despite this seemingly being a plot point. \\n\\n\r\nRobots in Cassern Sins behave exactly like people would. They fall in love, the feel anger, joy, sadness, despair, they cry (one character remarks to the other with disdain \u201cYou\u2019re crying?! Like a human?!\u201d only to do that herself a few episodes later), they dream of becoming famous singers, they bleed, they can go for a swim, they sleep and rest, they breathe, they take pills, they have families, baby robots grow up into adult robots and grow old\u2026 About the only thing they haven\u2019t explicitly shown them doing is eating, but neither do we get a sense of what energy source if not food keeps them functioning. No sockets or landlines, no batteries, no tanking stations, no solar panels\u2026 Why bother making most of the characters robots at all, if their being robots doesn\u2019t add anything to the story? They could\u2019ve just as well been humans that have attained near-eternal life through advanced medical technology (as the humans in Casshern Sins apparently have!) and not a single thing would have changed.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the world falls apart (literally, too, har-har), the motivation and the backstories of everyone involved crumble to dust right with it. Recurring characters are static and one-dimensional, and minor characters all blend together to form two blurry blobs: the bad guys that have to hurt others just because they happen to see them, cue our protagonist flying in to save the day and utterly destroying them in a bland fighting scene without any real stakes, and the, er, I suppose, good guys, that are trying to live to the fullest despite the world around them having gone to shit, or something. Just, the ways they do it are often absurd \u2013 there\u2019s a guy who paints the whole town bluish white, even the tallest buildings somehow, despite him being in a wheelchair and needing help to go up a flight of stairs, a woman that tries to knock out a robot who\u2019s just passing by and strikes her fancy with aroma candles to try and make him a part of a bell (don\u2019t even ask), a girl who likes to beat others up and fight, but somehow she\u2019s admirable unlike the bad guys because, I guess, she looks pretty and asks before she goes impaling robots on her sword? The only decent episodic character was the human from episode three, at least he brought some much-needed levity and exposition into the dreary mess Casshern Sins calls its plot. Just as well that he died very promptly. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character oozes angst like Ikari Shinji on steroids. From episode one it\u2019s obvious that none of what\u2019s happening is really his fault, but still he spends all of his screen time (and most of viewers\u2019 time along with it)being emo about it. His preferred method of conversation is staring at people dumbly, moaning about his suffering and repeating the last few words his conversation partner said in a questioning tone. There\u2019s also a robot dog, the only one we see in the series, whose relevance to the story is a mystery shrouded in an enigma, but it\u2019s there in almost every episode anyway. Then there\u2019s a girl who starts out hating Casshern\u2019s guts and wanting to exact revenge on him, and then ends up falling in love with him out of the blue over the course of two bizarre episodes dedicated solely to the topic. No, they\u2019re not about their interactions \u2013 their interactions are minimal at that point. It\u2019s a peek inside her \u201cinner world\u201d, and boy is it weird as heck! You could say that this is the character with most development, but since all that development is shat into existence out of nothing, it doesn\u2019t really count. Or maybe her falling in love with the protagonist was inevitable \u2013 because this could\u2019ve just as well been a harem with how many women fawn over Casshern, cling to him and call him beautiful. Just because. Also, we have an annoying child, whose primary function is to a) laugh like an idiot, pluck flowers and marvel at how pretty things are so that we know how innocent and beautiful her heart is and b) run away and get lost. At one point, she also serves to get the gang\u2019s hands on an important gimmick that turns out to be a MacGuffin, forgotten about in the very next episode and ultimately serving nothing. Oh, and there\u2019s also her guardian and apparently, gasp, the creator of Casshern (which is never explored at all), whose sole purpose is to rant about how precious the robot girl in question is to him and drive a truck around to take her places. Places where she can stumble upon Casshern, so we can listen to how she repeats his name over and over and watch her gift him seashells or something. The antagonists are similarly one-note: Mr. \u201cI-need-to-kick-Casshern\u2019s-ass-with-my-two-feet-because-he-humuliated-me\u201d and Ms. \u201cMaleficent-who-wants-to-get-knocked-up\u201d. I won\u2019t even touch upon Braiking Boss and Luna, because that fail is of truly epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nMany here praise Casshern Sins for its visuals and sound. I won\u2019t deny it, the crisp lines and stark, bright contrasting colors make this series easy on the eye, and the animation is fluid and dynamic. There is of course this weird fetish that the art director has with drops of water, flower fields and pieces of robots affected by Ruin chipping off and scattering into dust, and while it admittedly looks great, it\u2019s repetitive to the point of obsession. It smack of an attempt to appear deep and meaningful through visual means without anything of substance backing it up. The black-and-white video footage insert in one episode is another example of that visual pretentiousness. Also, I, and this is due my personal taste, absolutely loathe the character design. It\u2019s so overwhelmingly 70\u2019s? 80\u2019s? There\u2019s very little variety in facial features \u2013 we have ugly classical \u201cbucket of bolts\u201d robots, humanoid-type robots with distinct half-oval eyes and single vertical line on their faces, and Casshern-style sleek and pretty robots indistinguishable from, say, humans. The only exceptions to the rule would be Ringo\u2019s guardian Ohji, Braiking Boss and maybe that short dude from the church in episode two. Casshern, Dio and Leda\u2019s design with their regenerating bodysuits and Gundam-esque horns made me giggle. Especially Casshern with the blatantly Superman-like \u201cC\u201d on his chest. Also, the trio seems to have a pair of weapons hanging from their hips purely for decoration as Leda is the only one to actually use them. Why do the rest bother with them again? And Luna\u2026 well, she just looks as if someone stuck a frog\u2019s head in a blue wig and a bicycle helmet on a loli body. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, honestly, it made me laugh at the most inappropriate moments. Sometimes, the characters would talk, and then this incredible sappy melody would start blasting full-force, and instead of moving me to tears the scene would make me gag because of its blatant grab for my heartstrings. I\u2019m familiar with Kaoru Wada\u2019s work through anime like 3x3 Eyes and InuYasha, and the similarities between those OSTs and Casshern\u2019s are striking to the point of the man plagiarizing his own work. I swear there was this one track that was a dead-on ripoff of his own Sango\u2019s Theme for InuYasha. Where that sort of music worked for a simplistic and a bit na\u00efve shonen anime, it fails to deliver in a postapocalyptic series with philosophical aspirations. It sounds pretty, sure, but it\u2019s completely at odds with the world and the story it tries to convey. It doesn\u2019t add to it, it detracts from it. The voice acting is unimpressive, particularly in the leads. I suppose that Casshern\u2019s VA does an adequate job of conveying what a sad little boy the protagonist is, but he also manages to make him sound like he\u2019s got a developmental disorder, and his \u201chowls of pure agony\u201d, groans and grunts sounded very unnatural. Lyuze\u2019s VA made her character have all the emotional range of a toaster oven. Ringo sounded whiny, bratty and annoying, good job picturing a child, I guess? The rest were passable. I\u2019d say Braiking Boss\u2019 and Luna\u2019s VAs hit the mark with their acting, but that didn\u2019t save their characters from poor writing, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen reviews claiming that all lore omissions, plotholes and worldbuilding problems are actually non-issues because this anime is not supposed to be a consistent, fleshed out sci-fi story, but more of a philosophical\\psychological exploration of sorts, particularly of the issues pertaining to death and life in the face of immortality and unavoidable doom. I don\u2019t know where people saw depth, or metaphors, or anything like that, because the series is about as subtle as Casshern\u2019s fist in a random robot\u2019s chest. Already in episode one (or was it episode two? they do blend together so) the main message of Casshern Sins is established \u2013 \u201cthere is no true life without death, precisely because of the prospect of perishing one must strive to live as full a life as possible\u201d. Roll credits, I guess, because all that follows is a disjointed series of mind-numbingly repetitive vignettes that serve to illustrate this particular point with plots so similar they seem cloned. There\u2019s also an overarching plotline that comes to the forefront in the latter half of the series, but it doesn\u2019t bring any satisfying answers about the world or the characters, and the message stays exactly the same. I swear, this could\u2019ve been one or two-episode OVA and it would\u2019ve been sufficient to tell this story, if you wring it out to rid it of endless landscape shots, intense face close-ups, characters standing or walking in silence and meandering pointless dialogue that doesn\u2019t shy away from repeating the exact same phrases several times in a row in the exact same wording. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Casshern Sins is a hollow, artificial, pretentious attempt at making a puddle look like an ocean. If you\u2019re 13, like the idea of robots and have never happened to ponder your own mortality, give this a whirl, and maybe you\u2019ll like it despite its agonizingly slow pacing. Also worth a try if you like to poke fun at logical fallacies, plotholes and poorly written dialogue. For the rest, it would be an exercise in frustration.",

            "content": "This series is very... depressing.  It is not like the Casshern series that people expect, but in it's own right is well made.  The first thing I would like to mention is that the artwork and music is superb.  Watching anime, and then watching Casshern Sins is like going from a child's artwork to architectural blueprints/designs.  The animation, art, and colors are very crisp and clean.  Half the time, I was busy enjoying the artwork and the animations.  Casshern is like looking at a work of art.\r\nDespite that, the story at first was very depressing and slow.  Afterwatching the series through a few more times, I found it to be a lot more entertaining and has a much more deeper meaning than what I originally thought.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development shines in this series.  One can see the growth of the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I would not mind seeing is a prequel to the series, just to see what the world was like before the ruin and the different stories of the characters that you meet throughout the series.\\n\r\nOf course, if a prequel was made, I can see it being a lot more faster paced and more action oriented due to the period of time in the story, and the ideas that took place at that time (in the anime)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable series.  Probably not what people expect, but with the right mindset, can be a great series.",

            "content": "Are you sick of monotonous anime? It\u2019s time to change up the pace and travel along with Casshern as he discovers his sins that doomed the world. Sounds interesting right?\r\nCasshern Sins, a philosophical anime about Casshern has caused The Ruin to occur. Before such event, the world was full of sentient robots who were immortal. Ruin causes rust until they wither away leaving them to only contemplate death. But rumors have been spreading of someone named Casshern to be the answer to immortality when killed. As the opening states: \u201cHey why are we born? Hey why did we meet?\u201d Casshern struggles to comprehend why heexists and remembers nothing of his feared past. As robots hunt him down, Casshern travels to learn the truth.\\n\\n\r\nOne day as I was going through an anime slouch, I decided to browse around to see if I was missing any interesting shows. That\u2019s when I stumbled upon Casshern Sins. At first, looking at reviews I was skeptical at first that it would be basically wordless, have odd fighting, and have a slow pace. But personally I can debunk all of these claims and state that Casshern Sins demolished any of my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the first claim that Casshern Sins has little dialogue. From the very start it begins with dialogue, and even in fights there is usually plenty of inner thoughts and conversations occurring. The only time where I see this criticism \u201ccorrect\u201d is when it is silent still shots or when Casshern is traveling alone in deep thought. Which develops the mood and presents how desolate and lifeless everything around Casshern is. But this tone shifts throughout the anime as Casshern finds friends creating more dialogue and character interactions. It is a mystery of why anyone would think that Casshern Sins is too silent.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onward to the final one I want to tackle is odd fighting and I\u2019ll keep it brief. The choreography of the fighting feels very floaty, like the characters glide to enemy to enemy. This makes Casshern Sins fighting something to get adjusted to. I personally didn\u2019t have a problem with it, if anything it was a surge of something new for me. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts on common complaints/ why people don\u2019t give Casshern Sins a chance, is that I understand that this kind of show is not for everyone. Whether that comes with pace, realistic fighting, or any other reason. But Casshern Sins is definitely the kind of show to watch till the end regardless to get the full experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cReal\u201d Start Of My Review~\\n\\n\r\nWhen it is time to pull up the first episode of an anime what do you want to see? Most likely one would want to see good character introductions, art, animation, sound, and most importantly a good hook. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins intro scene is personally my favorite anime hook of all time. If you do not want any episode 1 spoilers, skip the next paragraph. Ok, so in 8 seconds Casshern Sins instantly confused, intrigued, hyped, and surprised me all at once. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts off with Casshern dropping his hand on the ground as it then cuts to a girl. She states, \u201cYou are?\u201d Flashing back to Casshern he introduces himself. Then zooming into his soulless face he saids with determination, \u201cLuna, I will kill you.\u201d With this information alone many questions arise. With a bombshell of a scene like this as the first scene in the show, it becomes enourmous later on in the show. But also works perfect as a hook. In the beginning of each episode, 8 more second add onto the original until it all starts to fall into place. With this, Casshern\u2019s backstory unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nIf I discuss anymore of the show it will ruin your experience. As each character has their own fantastic arc and others have mind boggling plot twists. What I love about this show is how every character feels unique, even the side characters all bring something special. Depending on the character, they all have different connections to Casshern. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is top notch even if it was made in 2008. It is produced by Madhouse, which is always a nice plus most the time. I love the style of the art too, it fits well with the setting of a barren wasteland being devoured by The Ruin with soulless robots desperately searching for any salvation. Same can be said for the animation. Each fight is really smooth and full of style. Especially since the fighting by itself is like extreme acrobats. Madhouse made acrobatics look epic.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts are about enjoyment. As one can tell by my score, I loved learning about the mysteries of Casshern and the dramatic tension of whether or not he will learn from his sins. All major complaints I ever had about the anime were cleared up as the anime progressed, meaning I just did not have the available details.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins made me inspired and existential all in one. Having realistic developing character arcs, an interesting environment/ premise, phenomenal hook, killer opening, smooth animation, stylistic art, a thought provoking message, and much more. I truly cannot praise it anymore! If you are looking for a different experience with philosophical messages, Casshern Sins is a must watch. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nOveral: 9 \\n\\n\r\nI would easily recommend this to anybody.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will admit that my opinion of \"Casshern: Sins\" is somewhat biased by the fact that I watched and enjoyed the original 1973 anime \"Shinzou Ningen  (Neo Human) Casshern\" first.  Because of that I became more than a bit pissed off when I realized that \"Sins\" had absolutely _nothing_ to do with \"Shinzou Ningen.\"  \r\n\"Sins\" is touted as a \"remake\" of the original series, but that's a fallacy.  What it actually is, is a story so utterly disparate from the original that the use of familiar names and faces seems to have been the result of a combination of laziness onthe part of the designers and a desire to boost the initial viewership by feeding off of a pre-existing fandom.  The characters who \"return\" in \"Sins\" are not at all like the ones they were cloned from - in Luna's case there is no similarity whatsoever, which is a shame, because Luna was my favorite character in \"Shinzou Ningen.\" \\n\\n\r\nEven when I cooled down and resolved to evaluate \"Sins\" on its own merits, rather than comparing it to \"Shinzou Ningen,\" it still came up lacking.  It seems as though the creators got together to come up with a collection of evocative images and scenes, and then strung them all together with a flimsy, poorly developed plot cluttered with ill-fitting elements.  The anime is rife with trite symbolism, and does its level best to constantly hammer you with angst, without bothering to be remotely subtle in the execution of it.\\n\\n\r\nActually, there's a fundamental lack of subtlety on most levels of this story's execution; where it's most damaging though is that as the story progresses it becomes overwhelmingly preachy; and that, more than anything else, I could have done without.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I can't exactly call it a _bad_ anime, I think anyone who likes this style of story will probably find it reasonably entertaining, and the art and animation _are_ beautiful, but if you're looking for a great anime, this isn't it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a pity though; I would have loved to see what a faithful rendering of \"Shinzou Ningen Casshern\" would have looked like executed with modern storytelling aesthetics.",

            "content": "Story\r\nDespite being a remake to a kitschy 70\u2019s anime \u201cclassic,\u201dCasshern Sins begins promisingly. In the first few episodes, the creators lay out a post-apocalyptic setting that manages to feel both unabashedly retro and grimly bleak at the same time. The resulting mix of camp and angst is weirdly intriguing, especially when the solid supporting characters and mysterious titular protagonist are factored in.\r\nSadly, Casshern Sins fails to live up to its initial promise due to its unfocused overarching narrative. Rather than develop any core theme in the early to middle stages, the series meanders among flavor-of-the-week plots and half-hearted attempts at a main story. After countlessthematically tangential episodes, the anime barely has room to resolve its main plotline and is forced to squeeze a half-hearted conclusion into the final few episodes. The final episodes seem to assert that death is needed to make life worth living. However, the distracted narrative and conflicting themes beforehand causes this moralizing to feel hollow and unconvincing by the time the creators decide to tack it to the end. At the end of the series, Casshern Sins doesn\u2019t feel like it was ever actually about anything, and this is perhaps its greatest flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s plot is further diluted by lame fight scenes that lack context or relevance. In many occasions, a group of mooks will simply appear in the middle of an episode to suicidally impale themselves on Casshern\u2019s foot. These scenes appear to have been inserted to please the action junkies, but the problem is that Casshern Sins tries to be something more than just another shounen action show. By mixing mindless action with serious science-fiction, the anime fails to appeal to fans of either.\\n\\n\r\nStill, in spite of all these weaknesses, the series is not without merit. Casshern Sins\u2019 main strengths lie not in the actual meat of the plot, but in the assorted one-shot episodes that pepper the overarching narrative. While they disrupt the flow of the actual story, many of the disjointed plotlines are well-written enough to be entertaining in their own right. Granted, not all of the self-contained stories are good, but others are genuinely compelling. This alone prevents Sins\u2019 story from being an outright failure.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Casshern Sins has an excellent idea of what it wants to look like, if not what it wants to be about. Put simply, the style of the series' dystopian setting is wonderful.Casshern Sins uses carefully chosen color schemes and crisp animation all to great effect, and the final visual package is one of the most impressive I've seen this year. A particularly impressive aspect of the visual package is the dramatic use of light in just about every scene. It's not Makoto Shinkai obsessive, but the shadows drawn across the hero's face do a lot to darken the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting as a whole is uneven. The protagonist\u2019s seiyuu is so hideously terrible that I genuinely wondered if he was trying to sound wooden on purpose, while some of the supporting roles turn in excellent work. On the other hand, the background music is almost universally excellent. The music grimly underscores the anime\u2019s bleak mood without ever becoming a distraction. The soundtrack\u2019s one flaw is its frequent repetition, but this never becomes too much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the haphazard plot and the hamfisted ending, the creators botch the characterization on nearly every major player in the show. Casshern himself is the most egregious example; his deadpan voice acting, terrible dialogue and unconvincing development combine to form one of the most ineffective protagonists that I've ever seen. Dio and Leda, the two main villains, are almost as bad; not only are their motivations left woefully unexplained, they're just flat-out boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, some of the supporting characters fare better; Lluyze in particular is a welcome exception to the bad characterization. Casshern Sins dedicates an entire episode to dissecting her psyche in a weird and decidedly Freudian fashion, and the result is arguably the highlight of the show. Sadly, she is a comparatively minor character and simply can't carry the show on her own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed myself as I was watching and in particular liked the one-shot episodes, which at times evoke the amazing work done in Kino's Journey. However, the turgid overarching narrative, the bad characters and the incompetent ending make me wonder if these scattered episodes were enough to make the series actually worth my time.",

            "content": "Super Heroes by now are a standard part of our lives, being adapted into thousands of films already, we are used to incredibly powerful men and women walking around in weird skintight clothes that are supposed to be their trademark. It has almost been done to death in western media and I myself am not a huge fan of those franchises either, with a few exceptions. In Anime though, while we have quite some superheroes, it is not nearly as much as in the western media and only few of them really rose to popularity in the Otaku Culture. Today I will Review an Animethat is rather unknown to the masses, while still not disappointing in most parts. Casshern Sins is a Spin Off of the original Shinzou Ningen Casshern, which aired in 1974, meaning this show was goddamn old. It aired in 2009 and tells the story of an Alternative Universe.\\n\\n\r\nStory: In this Alternative Universe, the world is almost only inhabited by Robots and the humans that once created those, became rare. This world is shown in a post apocalyptic state, where all the robots, which couldn't die due to them getting old earlier, now slowly ruin away. This Ruin heavily resembles rust and seems to work the same way as infirmity for humans. Here lives our main protagonist called Casshern. He is a robot that is immortal, immediately heals every time he is wounded and cannot decay like all the others Robots. There also are a lot of rumors around him, that if a robot would devour him, he would get the immortality that is Casshern's. Our protagonist though, doesn't know what happened to him and has no idea why he is immortal and where the Ruin comes from.\\n\r\nThere actually is not a lot more to say about the plot, as it is rather simple and going deeper into it would result into spoilers. The thing that stands out though, is not the plot itself, but the Setting it is presented in. One thing has to be said though, being that this show is slow! For almost the whole show it moves forward so slow, at points it even gets a little boring. It actually takes the show 12 episodes before it gets a little faster, before it actually goes back into slow-motion mode again and decides that the fast pacing is something it doesn't like, before only getting a little faster in the final episodes. This is something that many people might find to be a problem with this show and something that turns away many. I myself didn't have any problems with that though and actually thought it fit the world rather well, but that is just preference and I can totally see why people might not like that.\\n\r\n6.7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: For the majority of the show, it moves forward in a \"Character of the Week\"-Style and only goes away from it if it gets to a climax, which happens rarely due to the slow pacing. Every single episode, the show introduces a new Robot or Human, lets them interact with the main characters that are currently present, before either letting them stay, leaving them alone, or killing them off. It's a concept that quite some shows often use in a similar way, being the \"monster of the week\"-concept. A really popular Anime for this is the Mecha Deconstruction \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", which introduces one enemy per episode and let's the three main characters kill them off at the end, before it goes into the actual main plot later on. Casshern Sins does the same thing with it's supporting cast. The thing that most shows that use this concept intend to do is get depth added to their own characters. Casshern Sins does this while also getting a little more into the Setting every single episode and every single episode that is used for a Supporting character in the end helps our main character realize the thing that the whole show wants to tell us, being that without death, life would not be livable\\n\r\nThis concept is executed in such a good way, that every single episode we get a new character, that for the most time doesn't even show up anymore at all, that is either really likeable or just amazingly well written. Unfortunately this can not be said about all the main characters. More than once, I had the feeling that the supporting cast would be overshadowing the main characters by far. We do get development for every single one and a lot of depth of course, especially to Casshern, but all this doesn't help me to sympathize with the characters more and I feel like they were way to boring for the most part to actually make for a good cast. Leaving us with an amazing Supporting cast, while the main cast didn't succeed in convincing me of them being really interesting.\\n\r\n7.6\\n\\n\r\n\ufeffArt: The Art in Casshern Sins is, to leave it simple, amazing! It's another show where Studio Madhouse doesn't disappoint in just being awesome. The fighting scenes, which exist at least once per episode, look really good and are completely fluent. The coloring is for the most part beautiful and fits the dark atmosphere really well, while still featuring a lot of colors. The Characters Designs though, are something that I had my problems with, with it being really old school, since the characters were designed in 1974 already for the most part, which is not a style that I really like. That again is only preference and doesn't really matter for the overall enjoyment but rather is something that I didn't like myself.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack of Casshern Sins is something that I didn't realize during the first few episode, but that grew on me really fast. It mostly consists of really quite pieces, using a lot of guitar. It is used perfectly for the most part and one of the few songs in the Soundtrack that I actually didn't like was the only one that was not the opening or ending, was the only one using lyrics. The Openings and Endings though, were something that is in contrast to the OST itself actually...rather annoying. While the first Ending song was okay, I could stand neither the first Opening, which was plain annoying to me and the second ending, which I actually didn't watch a lot. \\n\r\n8.3/10\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is a show that is not for all people, featuring a pacing that is a lot slower than the pacing of most, but if you happen to like more than a few genres and are able to take things that are a little different from the usual shows, it definitely is worth checking out.\\n\r\nNow as I calculated all 5 scores that I have given (Story, Characters, Art, Sound and my personal Enjoyment), I give Casshern Sins a 7.96/10 as a show that\u00a0 pleased me, but not as much as others did! It currently is available for legal Streaming on FUNimations web page, if you happen to live in a country where you have access to that particular Stream (Other than me '-.-). It also has been licensed by FUNimation if you happen to live in America, and by Manga for the Europeans.\\n\r\nWith that I hope I could help you and I'll see you next time!\\n",

            "content": "I'm usually the guy who digs melancholic & sad shows with a deeper meaning but Casshern Sins was pretty much of a drag for me to sit through. It ponders very heavily on it's apocalyptic decay of the world mood while handling reasonable character choices and a consistent story as optional. \r\nThe first half of the show is kind of a journey for the protagonist in search of his memories. On this journey he encounters new characters in each episode and we learn about their backstory and the state of the world. The writers try to give every episode / character his own theme, butsince they are all bound to the decay there is little actual variation in the stories told. So this episodic character telling barely anything new makes the whole show feel like having 7 actual episodes and 17 fillers. \\n\\n\r\nWhen they finally get to resolve the main story in the last third of the show, huge plot holes / logic issues begin to shine (e.g. there is the big idea, that a life without death has no real meaning but they don't distinguish between a healthy life/death cycle and a whole world going extinct). Also some major questions will never be answered. The final conclusion is fine but far away from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this show was definitely the cool & unique art style in combination with the melancholic sound design. Also the obligatory fights in each episodes where nicely animated (except the mostly generic enemy designs) but given their hopeless tone, they weren't exactly fun to look at. All in all i would have probably enjoyed this show more in a 12 episode frame.",

ANd ever more better until I was obsessed, until I finished the whole show in three days. \r\nCasshern Sins is like nothing I've ever watched (and belive me I've watched tons) It's unique in every way.

It's not very hard to understand and yet has a lot of depth and meaning. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it is dome completely beautifully. The animimation is truely beautiful.

            "content": "Casshern Sins the anime embodiment of style. The animation and sound direction/quality are best of anything I've ever seen. Everything from the color pallet, contrast, angles, pacing, just everything is absolutely astounding. Not only does the animation do exactly what the plot wants it to do, but it goes out of its way to stand on its own as breathtaking. Most trailers are cut very awkwardly so they wouldn't be the best reference for something like this. If you watch the first episode or first couple minutes you'll understand what I mean. \r\nSo then, is Casshern Sins all style and no substance? Short answer isno. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins stands out to me primarily for its ability to swiftly shift focus from theme to theme. By that, I mean that the plot itself is able to morph into whatever the characters need it to be. At the beginning, it appears that the plot is everything. It is presented as this huge mystery and that the main character's sole goal for the series is to uncover it. The only reason it sets off this way is as a means of exposition for Casshern. Once that is no longer needed, the plot slowly dissolves the mystery to the point that it's not even important by like episode 16. There's also a great many things that go unanswered in the series, some extremely important and interesting things. However, they go unresolved simply because they are not required to tell the story the creator wanted to tell. For example, at the beginning, they show you three main characters. The anime tells you that they are not human, and not machine either, and that they were created for a certain purpose. The anime never tells you what they are, how they were created, or why they were created. Many people would naturally assume this is a bad thing and that it makes the anime bad, but that is not the case. It was just never important enough for the characters to find out. They ended with much bigger personal and interpersonal conflicts. Not to mention one of the themes of the anime is about forgiveness and letting go of the past. It'd be hypocritical for the anime to then spend a great deal of time and effort explaining the characters' past, wouldn't it? \\n\\n\r\nI told you everything that Casshern Sins is NOT about, so then what is it actually about? Casshern Sins, like the title suggest, is about coming to peace with one's sins. However, it also delves deeply into other themes, kind of dependent on which character we're talking about. Each character has some internal struggle or conflict that is unique to that character. This idea is aided by the fact that a little over half of the anime is entirely episodic. We got to meet a new character and its conflicts every episode. My personal favorite character from the series was Braiking Boss. He is very similar, yet arguably more complex, to Yoshii from Texhnolyze. So instead of spoiling this anime here, I'll talk about Yoshii and what made him interesting. Yoshii was in a pseudo-utopian world, where humanity had reached its evolutionary peak. He decided that the world was too peaceful, that life in that world was no life at all. He then started causing chaos, death, and destruction, simply to see how humanity would react. \\n\\n\r\nEnding thoughts:\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is spectacular. The only thing it did that I didn't like was simplify the plot. Like I said, it was done with great purpose, but I personally prefer things with a little more complexity, especially for this kind of anime. I think it could've done a lot more with the its universe. Evangelion only had 2 more episodes (counting End of Evangelion as episodes 25 and 26) and that was immensely more complex, giving it a great deal of creative freedom. I'm not going to harp down on an anime for not being Evangelion, but simplifying the plot is what brought the score down so much. Regardless, it has my highest recommendation for people who do not mind slow paced storytelling. For all philosophy aficionados.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is not for everyone. The show pretty much moves at one pace, and that pace is \u2019slow\u2019. There is a lot of silence, introspection, and philosophical dialog. Ordinarily, this would make one assume the show is pretentious (especially since it has a lot of similarities to Texhnolyze), but it really isn\u2019t. Casshern has a very simple plot, very simple dialog, and is easy to understand, so people looking for a mind-blower won\u2019t find it here. The plot and messages of Casshern Sins are much more along the lines of Kino\u2019s Journey or Mushi-shi. However, just like action fans will be turned off bythe slow pace, fans of more quiet, contemplative anime might be turned off by the fact that there is at least one fight scene per episode and they can at times be lengthy. So the niche here is kind of small, requiring that you like a good variety of styles. I happen to fall into that niche.\\n\\n\r\nLike most good shows, Casshern is amazing in a number of areas and wouldn\u2019t be the same without any of them. The soundtrack, voice acting, animation, directing, fights, dialog, art - everything aligns just right to create a show that is just about perfect for what it is. I\u2019ll be getting into detail on that now.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins has a very powerful and gripping soundtrack composed by Kaoru Wada (Princess Tutu, Tekkaman Blade, To Heart). The songs are all symphonic, ranging from minimalist and pretty to towering and sinister. The loud songs are very intensely dramatic and dark to the point that some (like the first track Sins) sound outright evil. (Interestingly, that song sounds like the symphonic version of an Opeth song.) The calmer songs are usually very airy and often acoustic-guitar driven. They definitely evoke images of Casshern\u2019s world where you\u2019ve heard them in the background. While either type is great, I prefer the calm songs if only because the more dramatic ones would go better with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere is something very mysterious but also very charming about these calmer songs. They bring a sense of wonder mixed with familiarity. It\u2019s a sense like seeing something totally new, but so enthralling that it feels like home. The ultimate song that captures this feeling is \u2018Memory Past\u2019 which is the song that usually played whenever Casshern met someone new and learned their story. The closest real musical comparison I have for this OST is the music in Phendrana Drifts in Metroid Prime which has always been some of my favorite composition. In the context of the series, all of the songs work superbly well to add ten extra layers of tone onto the already tone-tacular series. The music is notable straight from episode 1, which I guess it\u2019d have to be to make me go and find the OST.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the OST, there has been a Best Theme Collection from this series. The show has one opening theme (Aoi Hana by color bottle) and 3 endings (Reason by KANA, Aoi Kage by Otoya Kichiemon, and Hikari to Kage by Kuno Shinji), the second of which is only used for one episode. The best theme collection has the op and main eds in TV size, several instrumental versions of Aoi Kage, two original tracks by Wada Kaoru, two important vocal insert songs from te series (Sky and A Path by Nami Miyahara who voices Lyuze), and finally, both the original Tatakae! Casshan! theme and a new, heavy version of the song by Otoya Kichiemon.\\n\\n\r\nI personally didn\u2019t care much for the 2 main eds, but I found myself completely unable to skip the op for even one episode. It is easily one of my favorite opening songs in a while. Aoi Kage and the modern Tatakae! Casshan! are both awesome because they manage to play heavy metal acoustics. Anything that can do that is automatically awesome. The old-school Tatakae! Casshan! is the ultimate great touch for lovers of old-school tatsunoko songs. However, great as that all is, Sky and A Path were the real reasons I was interested in this release. These songs made episode 8 of the show amazing and reappear at many great moments later in the show. Both are extemely pretty and wonderful, and Nami Miyahara\u2019s English is excellent (evidently she studied English in Australia).\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth making the statement that Casshern Sins has some of the coolest sound effects ever. The effects during fights are visceral, intense, and completely full of impact. Care was taken to make the sound effects just right and give every hit that needed extra edge. I\u2019m thinking that they made a lot of the effects in the studio, seeing as there were very organic sounds of like pots breaking or the creak of metal. It\u2019s pretty rare I think these days for so much craft to go into sound effects in anime, so it\u2019s pretty notable when it does.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, this show amassed a royal fuckton of talent. Being as there were so many minor characters, a lot of voices were required, and Madhouse didn\u2019t skip out on giving every single character a standout voice. For starters, Casshern himself is voiced by Tohru Furuya (certainly most notable as freaking Amuro Ray, as well as Tuxedo Mask, Pegasus Seiya, and Yamcha) which is a very interesting performance. The voice of Casshern is certainly unique, sounding strong but never stern, and in pain but never really weak. The voice adds a lot of mystery to the character, sounding  like the robot he is, who doens\u2019t quite understand emotion even though he seems to feel it. The best part though is his wails in agony which are used frequently when Casshern\u2019s body self-repairs. That dude\u2019s wails are frightening.\\n\\n\r\nNami Miyahara plays Lyuze with the perfect mixture of resolve, confusion, rage, and love. Like Casshern, hers is a very distinct voice. Yuko Minaguchi (Videl - Dragonball, Yawara, Akiko - Kanon) does a completely superb job as Ringo. She should be cast as every single little kid in anime. I\u2019ve never heard a kid voice that managed to sound young and yet in no way annoying. Best kid voice ever. \u2018Cho\u2018 reprises his role as every old man in anime, lol. Akiko Yajime (Diva - Blood+, Shin-chan, Relena Peacecraft, Kuu - Haibane - damn that\u2019s range) brings her mysterious voice to Luna which tricks you with it\u2019s very regal sound until you start to see another side\u2026 well that\u2019s a spoiler. Kenji Utsumi (Shenlong - DBZ, Zodd - Berserk, Lt. Armstrong - FMA) is Braiking Boss who he played in the old version of the show as well, bringing a nostalgia factor.\\n\\n\r\nToshiyuki Morikawa (Who is in everything. His list is totally nuts.) is awesome as Dio. He plays the perfect rival character. His voice has a darkness to it, but not like an evil bad-dude, more like a man driven by dark purposes but full of resolve, which Dio is. Mami Koyama (Lunch - Dragonball - yes, most of the cast worked on Dragonball, Balalaika - Black Lagoon) brings the thunder as Leda who is convincingly evil and conceited, but also has an inner emotional side. Some of my favorite minor character performances include Mami Koyama\u2019s second roll as Lizbell in episode 7 (which is interestng because Koyama is Tohru Furuya\u2019s ex-wife, which when you think about it makes certain scenes very awkward), Tomoko Akiya whose performance as Sophita is borderline creepy and very fun, and Taeka Kawata who plays Nico, the little girl whose brain has been fried.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is animated by Madhouse. The dudes who brought you (alphabetically) Black Lagoon, Boogiepop Phantom, Death Note, Dennou Coil, Gunslinger Girl, Nana, everything Satoshi Kon, Texhnolyze, Trigun, and X, just to name a few. If you\u2019ve seen none of those, I\u2019ll just say it - they have incredibly high production quality and have been around forever. To give you an idea of how high their budget is, the first half of Casshern Sins aired simultaneously with three other Madhouse shows, the second half with one, all of which had unfaltering high-quality animation throughout. There is pretty much no other studio who can do something like that. So it really comes as no surprise when I say that Casshern Sins has incredibly beautiful animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe most instantly and consistently notable thing about Casshern\u2019s art is the luscious backgrounds. The background art is almost incomparably beautiful - almost. Probably only one show matches up to it, it being Mushi-shi, which is why it\u2019s no surprise that Yoshihiko Umakoshi was the art director and character designer for both series (a dual job he\u2019s done for Zipang, Street Fighter Alpha, and Boys Over Flowers, none of which I\u2019ve seen. He also did it for Air Master which doesn\u2019t matter because that show is fugly, probably thanks to budget.) I\u2019ve actually watched an interview with this guy on one of the Mushi-shi DVDs and while he is very boring to listen to, I do remember him saying that he was a perfectionist and would always stress that there be boatloads of detail in the backgrounds, which I guess he\u2019s still up to.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern\u2019s art is almost always barren, lifeless, and cold. The world of Casshern faces ruin (basically, apocalypse) and so there is little life to be found. The landscape is jagged and covered in large mountains, hills, valleys, craters, and deserts of sand and snow. Remnants of civilization can be found, some cold cities have buildings that still tower while others have fallen apart and buildings have become decrepit husks. Some places have become so dry and ruined that the ground has actually crystallized and cracks under every step. Occasionally, though, there are places of lush, brimming life to be found. Secret gardens surviving in caves or wellsprings and oceans. There is definitely a sense of mystery to the world that you can find anything if you look around enough. And, as a character in one episode teaches Casshern, every place in this world is beautiful. As a big fan of dystopic art, I found myself completely enraptured in these wastelands as much as I was mystified by the lush outcropping of life in unexpected places.\\n\\n\r\nUmakoshi\u2019s character designs are drop-dead gorgeous. It takes skills to make a masked superhero with a big red C on his chest and ornamental horns on his helmet fit into a dark, somber setting. But, somehow, he\u2019s done it. Casshern looks like a badass but also looks like he fits into the setting. He is supposed to be a beautiful person, and it\u2019s certainly visible in his design. All of the characters are very tall and lanky, almost like CLAMP designs, but have an added sharpness to them and are actually consistent. I can easily call them some of the best character designs I\u2019ve seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most impressive, though, is that a definitive 70s style remains ingrained into the designs. Every one has absurdly big hair and their facial features are very old-school. However, these elements have been perfectly crafted so that the designs still look modern and not ridiculous as they often do when new shows try to use old style. The robots especially represent the old school with their very basic designs, but they have a bloodthirstiness about their designs that makes it unsurprising when they are killing machines. Overall, I\u2019d say my favorite designs from the series were definitely Lyuze and Luna.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, since this is Madhouse, there are also plenty of exemplary animation techniques. Unfortunately, ANN doesn\u2019t have any animators listed, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s (director of Gurren Lagann and animator of all those wacky scenes in shows like FLCL, Mahoromatic, and even FullMetal Alchemist) name ended up on that list since his trademark over-the-top and hyperactive style is used in many of the fights. The show features a lot of \u2018sketchy lines\u2018 and badass shadow effects. The fight scenes often contain mind-blowing animation tricks that will make people who notice these things cream a huge load.\\n\\n\r\nDirecting\\n\\n\r\nI think that series director and storyboarder Shigeyasu Yamauchi probably had the biggest impact on the way this series turned out. As you can see on his ANN page, he directed a bunch of the Dragon Ball/Z and Saint Seiya movies and had involvement with their main series (and going by their ANN pages, he would have had experience with nearly all of this show\u2019s seiyuu during those times). The experience with those series can be seen heavily in the fight scenes. When Casshern and Dio fight, nearly every strike rockets someone into a wall which explodes just as the other fighter shoots at them like a bullet for the next blow. There are several scenes where the ground around Dio craters under the sheer fluctuation of his power. Yamauchi definitely wanted to bring the scope and intensity of a DBZ fight to this series, which is something I personally have always wanted to see done in a serious anime. It is made a thousand times better by the huge budget of the show which allows the fights to look amazing, cool, and fluid.\\n\\n\r\nYamauchi definitely has a great sense of dramatic cinematography. Every shot is carefully composed to look as cool as possible, with characters nearly always in some kind of dramatic pose and the light hitting them just right. This is taken to an almost hilarious extent in some of Casshern\u2019s fights against robot armies because he will literally attack them by kind of jumping at them, striking an epic pose, and somehow causing them to explode. Lighting is impeccable and the use of color is very important. Most of the show has a sort of blue and grey hue to it, but when other colors appear they are striking and noticeable against the backdrop of blue. Overall, I think Yamauchi just does a splendid job and probably had a lot of fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Theme\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot in Casshern Sins is so simple that I could detail the whole thing thoroughly in a small paragraph (but I won\u2019t for spoilers\u2019 sake.) The show\u2019s focus is more on the themes that drive the series and the characters representing or interacting with those themes. That said, while the plot is simple, it is very well-presented and interesting, making it a great driving force for the action and themes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the show\u2019s themes relate directly to the conflict between life and death. The dark, barren world of Casshern is on it\u2019s way to ruin and death is ever-present. Every person is directly grappling with death and the end of the world, and those who don\u2019t die just from the ruin usually die at the hands of other robots, especially if they try to attack Casshern. There are few characters who survive their own episode, much less the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Casshern, who is immortal, learns in his travels through the dying world is how death effects different people (usually robots). Most of the world desperately clings to life. The strong robots fight and kill each other constantly to steal each other\u2019s parts and try to prolong their lives. The weak search for any means of survival, clinging to little hopes or loosing to despair. Some merely accept the ruin as pleasantly as they can, but more often than not they will turn from this mindset at the slightest sight of hope - namely, the supposed immortality that one will gain if they devour Casshern.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not everyone is desperately clinging to life. Casshern encounters some robots and humans who aspire to something without the fear of death. Some teach him that the world is beautiful even in ruin, that there is hope in the world, or that they can live forever in the things that they leave behind. Casshern\u2019s conflict becomes whether or not eternal life is justified or death necessary. He is torn between the sadness of death and the liveliness brought out by it\u2019s presence.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of each episode are interesting and deep, sometimes moving, and more so as they culminate into the over-arching theme. Casshern, as a stark contrast to the world around him that he desperately tries to understand, makes for the perfect receptacle to these themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins features surprisingly complex main characters in light of it\u2019s simplistic plot and usually episodic nature. Casshern himself starts off as basically a blank slate with no memories and only knowledge as far as he learns from others. As he experiences the world, he has to weigh his experiences against each other to figure out his own beliefs. His character is kept interesting by the conflicting ideas he develops in relation to those experiences.\\n\\n\r\nLyuze\u2019s conflict is between her desire to kill Casshern because of him ruining the world, effectively killing her sister, and her growing care for him and changing perception of the world. Casshern\u2019s first companion, Friender, has some pretty great development considering that he is a robot dog who cannot speak. Friender\u2019s emotions are represented through actions, and in those actions we see how he slowly transitions from hating Casshern to trusting him and eventually both protecting him and keeping him under control.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling, the villains, Leda and Dio, have their own interesting development. Dio has dreamed of nothing but killing Casshern, while Leda is using dio to try and make the world her own. Each of them is thoroughly explored and developed. Luna, Oji, and Braiking Boss are also great characters with a lot of development, but those are spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a whole plethora of minor characters, most of whom appear just for one episode. Every one of these characters feels alive - they don\u2019t merely expunge their beliefs onto Casshern, but show him the way that they live (or, of course, die) through their actions. Characters come in all variety of personality, shape, and size. (inside joke) Casshern could be said to have the best pseudo-harem since Ginko from Musi-shi.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is episodic much in the same sense as Cowboy Bebop. The chains of episodic parts are broken up by plot-related episodes, the major characters get their own introspective episodes, and the last group of episodes form the conclusion. There were a couple of less-than-amazing episodes (I remember finding 15 and 16 a bit boring and 21 is kind of ill-done but the next episode justifies it) but otherwise, every episode was great.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the plot episodes were superb, especially whenever Casshern and Dio fought, which was always quite epic. Besides the wonderful climactic episodes, I pretty much had 4 favorites. Episode 7, where a woman in a high tower teaches Casshern about the beauty of this ruined world - Episode 8, where a woman wants to spread hope through her song - Episode 12, where a man tries to paint his city his color so that the world will remember him - and Episode 18, and excellent cuckoo nest episode into Lyuze\u2019s psyche.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in the beginning, Casshern Sins is definitely not for everyone. If you like all kinds of anime regardless of genre and are easily interested in something without it having to be fast-paced, Casshern may be for you. If you\u2019ve always wished that the philosophical plots of pretentious anime would mix with the good fun and awesome fights of shounen action, Casshern may be for you. However, if slowness leaves you bored or action leaves you disinterested, you\u2019ll want to stay away. For me, the show was everything I could have wanted and filled a niche that I\u2019ve long waited for an anime to fill.",

            "content": "I started watching this anime, giving it a starting 6/10. I was up to a 9/10 within the first 7 episodes. Does that say something?\r\nI am pleased to say that it says a lot. Casshern Sins is what looks like the most original anime of the Spring 2008 lineup, and while it may be sad, it is truly amazing to watch. (This review will update as the series goes on, if all goes well ;D)\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nCasshern does not know if he is a man, robot, or neither. In a world of destruction, where humans are rarely found and the last of the robots rust, Casshernwanders, trying to discover his true self. If you exclude the amnesia cliche, the story is very original and engaging. You feel Casshern's emotions, you feel that somehow he has changed throughout his unknown ordeal, and you feel his sadness and frustration at his inability to control his primal instincts. As he wanders, he encounters many new things, all of which get him closer to discovering the truth of his world. The pace is somewhat slow in the beginning, but it gets quicker and stays generally understandable.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Casshern Sins truly shines. The animation is amazing to watch, it's fluid, smooth, and elegant. The battle scenes are works of art, and it seems like the animation staff is always excited to draw new panels instead of reusing the old ones again and again. The landscapes look fabulous, and draw the viewer deeper into the sadness and depression in Casshern. Everything is drawn and animated beautifully; this series is almost a must see just for the animation. The best part is that 11 episodes into the anime, the animation crew still has not cut any slack on this wonderful series.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe theme song is pretty good, the ending is also above average. Nothing super superb here, but the music is engaging enough to draw you into the anime and feel the emotions of the characters. The ED is a &quot;hopeful&quot; song, one that leaves you with the right emotion instead of destroying the ending mood with a happy go lucky ero ero ending... just what we don't need. Luckily Casshern Sins doesn't do this, and the background music is above average as well. Nothing super special here, but its definitely not bad.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCasshern is somewhat cliche in his amnesia-but-wanting-to-do-good act, but it definitely works well for this anime. The characers around him are very unique as well, and all of them have some sadness that they share with Casshern and different ambitions. The way the characters interact is very realistic, and there's not so many characters that you start getting confused. Casshern Sins does a good job of introducing the characters and letting you get to know them well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPromising series from what I have seen so far. I definitely reccomend checking Casshern Sins out if you're looking for something unique. It is a somewhat depressing anime at times, but it is meant to be saddening, so make sure that you watch something lighthearted afterwards. Unless you absolutely love the plot and characters, in which case I've done my job well :)  I suggest you give this one a shot; you may find something you really like.",

            "content": "What would you do if you couldn't change your fate? Would you grasp at any slither of hope that presents itself, even if that hope required you to hurt someone else? Or would you accept your fate? Just letting it pass over you? This is one of the many questions that Casshern Sins asks. \"What is the answer\" you might wonder? Well, let us sit down together and discuss it shall we.\r\nCasshern Sins is a remarkable feat, in that it somehow captures every single, minute detail of the human spirit. It achieves this by starting from the very basics and quickly developing on the basicsas the series moves on.\\n\r\n One thing that really took me in, is how Casshern Sins truly captured my fear of death. It achieved this through an odd but clever display of writing, by showing us that even the machines that we make will some day fall into decline as rusting scrap metal.\\n\\n\r\n I for one like to identify myself through the materials that I collect and make, and even this review right here is constructing another aspect of myself. Casshern Sins asks, what is the point of all this? I believe the materials that remain after my death will serve as a reminder of my existence, but nothing can escape the harsh reality of time and a millenium from now, it is an almost inescapable fact that those materials that I had so carefully constructed, so thoughtfully made, will just vanish. It is quite frightening and puts true emphasis on the word death.\\n\\n\r\n Things change however, a chance of hope comes along. An ideal that preserves life, immortality.\\n\r\n Many religious affiliations pervade Casshern Sins series. God from the perspective of Catholicism promises a chance of eternal life, I make this comparison as Sins as a robot stands as a metaphor for this deity, a promise for immortality. Building on that concept, the precious beautiful skin of his body only serves to emphasize the prize of such a trait, but being immortal comes at a price. A price that one may not expect. As time wears on, one discovers an infinite sea of potentials, this quest to transcend the boundaries between being just a simple robot engineered to destroy, to becoming 'human', not physically but consciously has begun, but once this has been achieved. Who is left to bear witness it? Even though this concept and theme is not exactly original, it must be said that Casshern Sins is particularly noteworthy on how it manages to effectively show this journey of emotional discovery in every excruciatingly painful detail.\\n\\n\r\n Watching this show reminded me of Paulo Coelho's quote \"It is the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary\" and it is the simple things in life that Casshern Sins detaches from and allows us to witness as realistically as possible; both the efforts and dramas to recapture these important and sometimes trivial things, but it is these aspects that only elevate the potency of Sins journey. Even when the helping hand of a loyal friend may seem far away, capturing that relatable and simple essence of loneliness has rarely ever made such a profound impact.\\n\\n\r\n A negative aspect to the story can largely be centered on the extremely pessimistic nature of the series and it can arguably fall into the category of angsty melodrama rather than insightful, and many of the concepts that are brought up through the entire series can come across as completely redundant by the series conclusion simply because of the handling. One scene that I wanted to bring up in particular is a scene where a robot finally submits to her desire of wanting to be immortal after reflecting for an entire episode that she wants to die naturally. Whilst it was certainly a powerful scene at the time, thinking back on it, the series only seems to want to be as depressing as possible. Whilst this isn't always a bad thing, it comes across as forced, and lacks a level of fluidity.\\n\\n\r\n However, with those observations out of the way, it still can't be dismissed that the overall series has very solid writing and is riveting in how it plays out. Never failing to provide a delicate balance of answers to the many questions that the series asks.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of Casshern Sins' characters are truly integral to the story that the show is telling, and because of the theme heavy story in respect with the series episodic nature. It is only inevitable that many new characters are constantly introduced in order to represent another aspect of a philosophical question/s that the series imposes. A lot of the characters become representations for the themes of mostly hope and despair, but entangles within many varying levels of regret, remorse, guilt, jealousy, occasional romantic struggle and sometimes optimism.\\n\\n\r\n Considering the series episodic nature, a large majority of the episodes do an absolutely splendid job of building characters in such a short time and it is a truly commendable aspect because at times I was almost pushed to tears in some of the more powerful episodes. Saying that, I will have to discredit some of the episodes for having an inconsistent quality, this inconsistency is mostly due to the characters that are being presented, but for the most part the character development is well above average and occasionally phenomenal but these cases are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\n I can only appreciate the characters so far though, because as I said previously there is a varying level of quality in the development of many of the characters, another problem I had with the characters is that many of them have very similar intentions  throughout the entire series, it can get a little repetitive at times. Adding onto that; some characters only seemed to be placed there to plunge Sins into a more intense state of guilt and regret. Even though this can be perceived as a problem. The fact remains that this can be ignored to an extent because these characters show that this the series is remaining true to the premise that it has given and does not cop-out, even at the moments when the series becomes unbearable.\\n\\n\r\n Many of the motivations for the characters are understandable, as a dying breed of life suffering from an incurable disease; I imagine it would only be natural for someone to carry out desperate measures when they have been pushed to their breaking point. This is one theme that Casshern Sins portrays better than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe series artwork does nothing but do what it sets out to do, abysmal and ruined, wrapped up in an unusual mixture of bluish-greyish brownish textures that builds the apocalyptic landscape with powerful ease.\\n\\n\r\n The series takes time to build on its own sorrow in order to emphasize some lovely landscapes that capture the quintessential and brooding style that is reminiscent of an Edward Hoppers painting, two that come to mind are \"The Lighthouse at Two Lights\", and \"Screaming Monkey Drive In\", pleasant to look at but cringing with a landscape of heart-ache and desperation.\\n\\n\r\n Much of the animation is carefully designed. One noticeable moment was a touch of rust painted below the eye-line of a robot. The moment was heart-breaking and is something that took me by absolute surprise. Rust is deterioration and its symbolic connotation within this scene was used to its utmost potential.\\n\\n\r\n I always look forward to bear witness to the fascinating ideas of art that series from Madhouse Animation studios have to offer and Casshern Sins is a beautiful edition to the collection that is sure to become an influence in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I noticed about the OST was the consistently monotonous style across the board. Which certainly works in the series favor, but a couple of tracks stood out for me: the first one being \"Roamer\" as it captured the image of one man, simply standing a-top a hill graced in a red sunset, contemplating as to where his feet will take him next, it's a classic pose and one that holds much weight.\\n\\n\r\n The second one was \"Memory Past\", I'm not entirely sure what it was about this track but it just pushed a button in me. It was like I was floating in a sea of water feeling the waves softly carrying me. An interesting perspective to say the least, but I couldn't help picturing myself as a robot resting in the sand of the shallows feeling the water brush over me. It was a vivid moment, and a beautifully foolish one, it is simply a moment of passing time awaiting the day of no-return.\\n\\n\r\n At the time of watching this series. I think I was in the exact state of mind that was required to enjoy Casshern Sins and I finished it up in a marathon sitting. I tend to love a nice happy show as much as the next fellow but my thirst for drama can be over-bearing at times and Casshern Sins knew how to keep me glued to the couch. I was engaged with every detail that was playing out before me and every bit of terror, every moment of blissful decadence only served to invoke a greater emotional response from me. Those special moments of heart-ache scattered throughout, only serves my interest as keeping Casshern Sins as a worthy investment of my time for years to come.\\n\\n\r\n From what has been discussed I believe that Casshern Sins is a fantastic work, capturing every rigid emotion of the human spirit and melding every element so effectively. Constantly serving as a reminder to the breadth of questions that have been brought up and sought after in this series. Deep, often beautiful questions that serves as a recipe for sympathy and empathy towards all its characters as you bear witness to there destruction.\\n\\n\r\n I find it difficult to recommend this series mostly due to its overbearingly negative nature, and time has shown that not many people like pessimistic series. Nevertheless, for all of those out there who can withstand or perhaps immerse themselves in Casshern Sins battlefield of depression, they will surely find solace in the beauty of its melancholy.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "Spoilers Ahoy!\r\nCasshern&hellip; a series reboot of the original Shinzou Ningen Casshern back in 1973. Of all the new shows this season, I think this one is my favorite. Lets talk production values, people. I really enjoyed the OP and ED, I think they fit very well, and they have a nice melody. Music overall was certainly a strong point of the show. The BGM really fit well into the scenarios presented, and I think that they sound lovely as well. The animation is fluid, almost seamless, which goes along well with the simplistic character art and gorgeous post-apocalyptic backgrounds. The voices are another strong point.Personally, I had a fangasm when I discovered with glee that Utsumi Kenji was reprising his role as Braiking Boss. I don&rsquo;t think anyone else could have voiced him better than the original guy. The voice of Casshern was good too, and you can see the talent of Furuya Tooru. My only gripe in the entire show is Ringo. That little girl is kind of messed up looking. To quote Tenka Seiha, she looks like she&rsquo;s going to devour Casshern. You can really see the connections to the old series. The robot designs are the same, but the coloring is gone, rusted and corroded due to the ruin. They are as cruel and heartless as they were in the first version too.\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m really enjoying the plot. A fanboy like myself has been coming up with so many conspiracy theories about the plot, and links to the old show back in the 70&rsquo;s. Hell, I typed a three-page bullet list on my theories. Leave me a comment if you&rsquo;re interested. So Casshern wakes up from a hundred year slumber with no memories. All we know is that he killed Luna, and the Ruin (the apocalypse) was triggered by this event. Humans are now few and far between, being slowly killed by the poisonous air from the Ruin and Ringo even comments that she has not seen one. The robots don&rsquo;t fair any better. The poisonous air is corroding and killing them along with the humans. Casshern kills a bunch of robots that think that they can end the Ruin and become immortal if they devour him. A strange woman appears, and notes the patheticness of the robots, then vanishes. We see that Casshern is wounded as well, and he screams. An old man, Oji, realizes that Casshern has awakened, and Braiking Boss tells him it is so. Casshern later meets a little girl robot named Ringo, and she comments that he is as pretty as a human. (In the original series, Casshern was originally a human who turned himself into a cyborg to combat the robot menace.) Ringo says she&rsquo;s broken, Casshern says she&rsquo;s not, Ringo gives him a shell and runs off. Casshern has a few flashbacks of when he killed Luna, and this causes him to freak out every so often. (These flashbacks helped fuel my theories too). Casshern, the super-hearing sexy devil that he is, hears her shells drop as she is attacked by a robot, and rushes to help her. He carries her to safety, then turns into badass mode. Glowing green-blue eyes, and combat ready. He brutally destroys the robot in retaliation for hurting Ringo, but in return, he makes Ringo afraid of him. Oji carries her off, voicing his disappointment in Casshern (which was one of my conspiracy flags, comment on my profile if interested.) The enigmatic female that showed up earlier and notes how brutal Casshern is, and that he disgusts her. He is the cause of the Ruin, and that is all she needs to know to hate him enough to want to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I&rsquo;m in love with this show. The production value is incredible, the story is intriguing, and it made me, a fanboy, come up with theories of conspiracy with renewed vigor. I highly recommend this series to fans of the original show, superhero fans, fans of a dark story, and anyone in general. My overall score is 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nProduction done by Madhouse. Airs on Wednesday. Subs by Shinsen.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to an experimental anime like this, it\u2019s quite difficult to give a conventional score. Even more so, Casshern Sins tends to polarize the audience into two groups: either calling it a work of art or being bored as hell by it. \r\nHere\u2019s a good test whether you may or may not like it. \r\nAre you an anime fan one who: \r\nA) Tolerates a continuously oppressively grim atmosphere and a snail-paced plot? \r\nB) Forgives gaping plot holes for the sake of appreciating the heavy symbolism and existentialism?\r\nC) Is fine with an acrobatic fist-fight for every single episode?\r\nD) Doesn\u2019t mind sparse dialogue, one-note andmelodramatic characters, and numerous silent introspections?\\n\r\nE) All of the above\\n\\n\r\nIf you picked choice E, the chances are in your favor and you may like this style over substance anime. \\n\\n\r\n**No Spoilers really.  And I\u2019ll be vague in the analysis as for the most part, you should be the one doing that. Keep in mind, that it can be a depressing anime. **\\n\\n\\n\r\nConcepts, Character, Story-\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have much of a plot but has some unique and interesting concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half starts episodically, featuring heavily on the surrounding bleak world. Our main protagonist, Casshern, wanders around the barren wasteland and sees how the various humans and robots react towards this post-apocalyptic event that he caused. Suffering from amnesia, he intends to find answers in his placement for this world. Meanwhile, the second half starts explaining the mysteries of what occurs. But it never gets fully resolved and makes gigantic jumps in the narrative. There were sudden shifts in characterization and in the end, becomes incredibly ambiguous. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the cast of characters, \u201cnaturally wooden\u201d would be the best way to describe them. \\n\\n\r\nThe main quintet of Casshern, Lyuze, Ringo, Ouji and Friender appear one-note and simple to evaluate. Their dialogue is sparse, often calling each other\u2019s name many times or simply staying silent the entire time in an artistic way. Also, Casshern may seem also too melodramatic at first, but very slowly develops because of the other characters. The antagonists and robots (if I can even call them antagonists) have simple motives but gets confusing as it changes pace in the second half and stumbles itself near the end. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of their flat characterization, they give out further meaning towards this post-apocalyptic world in a crucial, yet subtle way. However, for Casshern Sins, it becomes a double-edged sword as non-recurring secondary characters of each episode suffer from redundancy. There are no surprises from seeing what may occur to them (it\u2019s quite predictable and repetitive), but taken upon further necessary examination, they provide some heavy symbolism that manages to be new in its own right episodically. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, it depicts a metaphorical setting that not many anime generally would take. There are lengths for ambiguity for it and different interpretations on what they may mean. However, most of the themes are rooted in existentialism and the meaning of life.  \\n\r\nGranted, despite its slow pacing and episodic format, I had to binge watch this over the course of 3 days as I\u2019ll end up forgetting the impact of the setting and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art/Animation-\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, Kaoru Wada made it seem like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for his InuYasha\u2019s OST. Seriously, I could replace some of the tracks and it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. However, it does well to bring out the bleak aspects of the atmosphere and manages to blend into the ambiance. The opening \u201cAoi Hana\u201d by Color Bottle has a catchy sound that I like but doesn\u2019t fit well overall. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, \u201cA Path\u201d sung by Nami Miyahara has some pretty good English pronunciations (even more so with the English version by Caitlin Glass) and bears weight to the overall themes to the anime. It\u2019s very emotionally moving, but it noticeably gets repeated a couple times, though.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for both English and Japanese carry out their part when necessary and manages to project the character's angst for catharsis. One thing that I may have overlooked would be the sound effects. The visceral crunches of the iron clad robots and the most minor of movements such as rustling fabric embellish the complexion of its environment even when dialogue remains tacit. And there are occasions of a show-and-don't-tell presentation.   \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes visually, it does well for it. It\u2019s Madhouse what do you expect. \\n\\n\r\nThe brown rusting of the robots gives a good contrast to the azure sky. The details are quite beautiful to gaze especially since not much else is going on. The specks of dust and other particles splinter into the air on many occasions and it's very aesthetically pleasing especially with the flora that sometimes gets presented.\\n\\n\r\nChildlike character designs are juxtaposed towards its more depressing background. The contours are bold and sleek but details are quite simple. The animation features very solid figures with hand-to-hand combat, although I can\u2019t help but easily see the numerous repetitions of each scene. I distinctly remember certain fights and robots being re-used. Because of these repetitions, it makes it feel even more monotonous. It's a bit unique though as choreographed scenes quickly pan to the smaller details of the area rather than focusing on the characters, having that elegant flair. \\n\\n\r\nWhile certainly not the most high-budgeted and most amazing animation, its presentation and style is what makes work well for the atmosphere and the anime as a whole. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9/10 (first 15 episodes) \\n\r\n       7/10 (latter part) \\n\r\n       5/10(ending)\\n\\n\r\nWhat made me enjoy this anime would be its world. The pacing is intentionally slow and not hamfisted with details, allowing for some thought-provoking ideas on existentialism to leak through. It establishes that ambiance and truly makes it a post-apocalyptic world. Because of this, even if I found many scenes to be melodramatic and not relatable, it manages to get me emotionally that some other anime can\u2019t pull off. \\n\\n\r\nIt takes the conventional heroism where the main character is OP, and there are continuous strings of fights for a sense of justice. However, it subverts it as the fights are never thrilling, mostly everyone (including the antagonists) are victims of the decaying society, and the meaning to continue to pursue a goal is grimly lost as one mindlessly wanders around the world, knowing that he is different and must be alone as he loses everyone around him.\\n\\n\r\nOnce it starts trying to unravel its mystery, my focus shifted towards that and I was expecting some sort of large revelation that would solve everything. But it doesn\u2019t. Near the end, the pacing speeds up, makes a large shift in unresolved details, and fizzles out in the end. \\n\\n\r\nIf I would make an analogy, it\u2019s kind of like Ouji\u2019s dilapidated jeep. It works well slowly, but when it puts the pedal to the metal and makes a large U-turn, the rusted parts start crumbling away because of the Ruin. At least there is still some meaning for that ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- a mid-high 7/10 (Good, not average)\\n\\n\r\nThe flaws are apparent such as its monotonous pacing and unrealistic characters. If taken at face-value, this anime will be a terrible chore. This anime is not the most accessible as it doesn\u2019t cater the audience\u2019s general accustomed tastes. However, its quality is mostly based on the eye of the beholder through individual experience and appreciation for analyzing. If read in-between the lines in its atmospheric presentation, it will be a unique experience that few ever dwell upon.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I thought I would really like Casshern Sins, but this was a letdown of epic proportions. My original impression was that the Casshern character would be a modern day Kenshiro of Fist of the North Star, or something akin to it; a lone wolf hero trekking across the devastated wasteland to fulfill his purpose/clear his name/discover who he is. Any one of these would've been nice, but intsead of taking a plot synopsis as simple as this anime produces and making something good out of it, it fails to deliver on any conceivable level that would be considered quality entertainment. \r\n Now this storymoves slow, I mean VERY slow, and this is the first noticable flaw of Casshern Sins. This is supposed to serve as dramatic build up, but the schitck wears thin after five episodes, and establishes nothing outside of what the audience already knows. The trick to telling a competent story is to offer mood and then deliver the plot, from there you move on to climax, as opposed to the 12 episode circle jerk the first DVD boxset provides. Calling it a story gives it too much credit, because it implys that anything thats taking place is going to lead somewhere. Humpty Dumpty has more plot cohesion then Casshern Sins because even this nursery rhyme managed to tell a decent plot offering a character (the Egg), the situation (a wall he wanted to sit on), the predicament (he fell), and a conclusion (he died). In Casshern, we get the egg beating up a bunch of rotten eggs and other eggs talking.\\n\r\n There's lots of dialouge, but I lost interest in anything ANY of these characters had to say by episode nine.\\n\r\n Which is Cassherns' other problem: Bland as hell, one demonsional lead characters. Casshern himself is a six page rant in itself, so I'll just summarize the point of my angst in regards to this character and others written like him: I HATE AMNESIA-STRICKEN ANIME LEADS! This is a cliche that's been done to death and I am sick of seeing every other title being bogged down by a main character with a gimmick thats been used to death by Hannah-Barbera in the sixties. Writing a character that doesn't remember anything excuses the author of having to make their hero develop in a chronological sense with the rest of the stroy because everything has to grind to a halt until he says, \"OH YEAH, now I remember!\" It's insipid and five out of every ten shows is almost guaranteed to use this stunt. As for Lyuze, she's even more worthless than Casshern himself. Her grief against him seems simple enough, but becomes insufferable as time goes on. How do have complex emotions about a guy who allegedly destroyed your past that borders outside genocidal rage?! It's ricidulousluy stupid character writing and diving into her psyche only shows just how egotistical and self-deluded this writing staff really was into thinking they were creating a philosophical masterpiece. The villians Leda and Dio add nothing at all besides generic obstacles who, from what I could piece together, fail as antagonists, and Ringo's only driven purpose is to chew up as much scenery as possible before the Ruin hits. The characters in this show are episodic.\\n\r\n The animation is impressive at first, but gets hammered into your brain with as many cluttered, over-choreographed fight scenes as any given episode of Bleach, and the fights are just as meaningless. If this show isn't talking your ear off, it's showing Casshern laying waste to every rejected Mega Man robot master fans submitted in to be put into a video game and nobody can lay a hand on him! This guy no-sells damage worse than John Cena!!\\n\r\nIN CLOSING: Not since RaXephon have I made it all the way through an anime that could've been promising if it had direction, likable characters, and wasn't so pretentious and long-winded in it's own bullcrap writing. Characters talk, dialogue goes nowhere, then they fight and fight and fight, then stop for more talking. Intrigue was lost halfway through and the climax was God-awful. I'm sorely disappointed that I spent money on this. I'm gonna go turn myself into a robot bell.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3\\n\r\nART: 5\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPROS: English dub isn't bad\\n\r\nCONS: Lackadasical writing, boring characters, repetitive BGM, everything else",

            "content": "Erected from the pillars that once cradled human civilization, the Robotic Empire reached its pinnacle under the iron-clad rule of Braiking Boss and the grace of the Sun that was called Moon. Then came the Ruin, and with it the end of those fabled days. Once thought immortal, the empire, its structures and citizens, and even nature itself into rust and decay and death. A landscape dotted with the deceased and dying, attributed to the sins of one machine... Casshern.\r\nDirected by Shingeyasu Yamauchi, scripted by Reiko Yoshida and Yasuko Kobayashi, and produced by Madhouse, whose resume includes the popular Death Note, the recent Chihayafuru, thesomber Gunslinger Girl, and the short Death Billiards, Casshern Sins is a reboot of earlier Casshern franchises, Shinzou Nigen Casshern and Casshern: Robot Hunter. The old-school character design by Yoshihiko Umakoshi is meant to be a tribute to those earlier eras of Casshern and anime itself. This new reincarnation, however, takes more similarities in substance from, say, the Rebuild of Evangelion than the Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica Movies in that they both seek to tell their own separate tales. However, unlike the Rebuild of Evangelion, a copy and paste of personality and drive of its earlier counterpart, Neon Genesis Evangelion, this show hosts vastly dissimilar character backstories and motivations. Now, as grave his deed may be of killing Luna and, consequently, unleashing the Ruin, the Casshern the audience follows at the show's opening, as opposed to the Casshern of flashbacks, has no recollection of his deed nor much knowledge of the consequences of the devastation aside for the obvious absence of life from organisms and machines alike, hounded by hordes of robotic thugs wishing to consume his flesh so they can live forever, or so the rumor goes (a fallacious conclusion due to Casshern somehow gaining immortal himself) and Lyuze, a robot in the likeness of a woman, that seeks vengeance for his supposed crimes. Yes, robots are defined, in part, by gender. It's not for guttural reasons for once, mind you. \\n\\n\r\nConsider the philosophical classification of being and personhood. Being refers to concrete qualities such as a blood vessel or a wired transistor, whereas personhood refers to more abstract qualities, yet qualities the majority of us can't deny doesn't exist, such as emotion, reason, and free will. Now, put aside any preconceived notions of mechanical agents save their hardware and understand that the robots in this setting are both beings and persons, much as humans typically are. Factoring the fact that a robot can exist indefinitely and coupling it with the effects of the Ruin, these elements are a conceptual build for this question: how would one react when suddenly confronted with the reality of mortality? It's something humanity has long since acknowledged, but robot-kind? What we have here isn't mainly sci-fi or action. People looking for primarily one or the other will be disappointed. Instead, we have life's meaning. If you're not interested in topics pertaining to existentialism, as too many people are unfortunately, then you might want to pass this show by. If you are, then, by all means... read on.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern and ourselves ignorant of the Ruin, its effects on all persons, places, and things it encompasses, we learn about this destitute world's people as well as the world itself bit by bit through his eyes, his encounters. Each of these encounters follow an episodic format: the inhabitants of the hospice, the man who coughs blood, the angel of ruin, the maker of bells, the singer, the artist, etc. Some romantic, others tragic, still others enigmatic, but most... inspiring, and soon a theme takes shape. A matter of living vs. existing. Our female warrior confronts the same internal conflict in Episode 20, complete with a host of surreal spatterings. Kudos to Madhouse, or rather, some studio other than Shaft, for putting the effort to experiment, to challenge the bounds of what constitutes a meaningful visual experience. The more conventional visuals are excellent as well. The devastation of the Ruin and the traces of life in plants and people in between, already striking to the eye, become more poignantly bleak and beautiful in juxtaposition than they would otherwise. The same can be said of peoples' that have given in or carry on in the face of death and the way they carry themselves, whether on the move or in a fight, from clunky and cluttered, to impassioned and empowered.\\n\\n\r\nWith shows of episodic natures, specially ones that have more to do with observation than action, they can afford to take a few more liberties than would otherwise be acceptable. However, the conveniences have piled up in Casshern Sins to a point where they are too noticeable to ignore, particularly the frequency and timing of generic mobs assaulting Casshern and whatever company he keeps for generic reasons: misery loves company, and desperation begets savagery. It's not that these reasons aren't worthy for illustration, but they lose their impact when they become cliches. It gets tiring when the show has to resort to them to make a point. Devoid of much in the way of substantial variance, the fighting and imagery can get fatiguing, even if they aren't merely for the fighting and imagery's sake. I can only look at flowers and Casshern going apeshit on metallic husks for so long until I have to shout \u201cI get it already!\u201d to get rid of the frustration. The recurring cast too, for that matter. Then there are just moments where both feel out of place, particularly towards the end. Speaking of endings, the show decided to forgo episodic beginning at the half-way mark and finish plot-driven, namely, discovering how to end the Ruin. Unfortunately, plot-driven narratives permit far less wiggle room and require more solid development, and the content of before hadn't done much of a good trying to map out the developments of this overarching plot. The result toward the end were that certain mysteries from before were completely neglected and others after were suggested but forgotten or too ambiguous to really appreciate. New material is rammed in, scattered throughout, and resolved without enough time for it to settle and concentrate. Some developments occur that even within episodic paradigm are hard even for me to swallow, not to mention certain themes are just stabbed over and over like a mentally battle-scarred greenhorn trying to make sure his bloated, putrid husk of an enemy adversary is dead with his equally odorous bayonet. The time the show took toward overemphasize would be better served trying to address more pressing issues. And finally, the resolution that Casshern ultimately decides to act on, one of arrogance, is one that, given his journey and my convictions, leaves a foul taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetics for the OP \u201cAoi Hana\u201d or \u201cBlue Flower\u201d by Color Bottle is mainly composed of a sequence of pictures of Casshern and Lyuze doing aloof poses. However, combined with the acute climb in musical intensity from rest, the images take a transitional quality, blurring the seams of stagnancy into motion, a blurred barrier between still artwork and animation frames, blurs of vocals. The music itself is comprised of a freewheelings of the drum set, electric guitar, and male vocals. They give off this air of freedom in how each of these parts, summed together, can so effortlessly careen in speed, volume, and dynamic. The OP and EDs have lyrics fitting for the subject of the show, but while the OP appears to mimic fits of passion, the EDs take on more subdued, reflective tones. That, of course doesn't diminish the enjoyment I got from either. The EDs for Episodes 1-12 and 14-23 are \u201cReason,\u201d by K\u2227N\u2227 and \u201cHikari to Kage,\u201d or \u201cLight Like a Shadow,\u201d by Shinji Kuno respectively. Both are pleasant, the former, upbeat and uplifting, the latter, dreamy and drifting. Episode 13 has a separate ED entitled \u201cAoi Kage.\u201d While the rest of the OST excels in helping establish a tonally appropriate mood for each scene that it is present in, a noteworthy mention goes to the OST, \u201cA Path,\u201d by Nami Miyahara in the sub and Caitlin Glass in the dub. Sung by the main episodic one-shot character Janice in Episode 8, the number recurs throughout the series. If there's one factor that may lead one to watch the dub over the sub, it's that the English voice actor on this particular piece does a better job than her Japanese Seiy\u016b counterpart. In addition to being fluent in the language that the lyrics for the OST was written in, namely, English, Glass just conveys more passion, more power, more consistency, more expression, more flourish into the words. In Episode 8, she works with the motions of her character as Janice has her moment on stage, whereas Miyahara work feels, comparatively, distant and disconnected.\\n\\n\r\nThough distasteful the ending may have been received by me personally, I'm grateful toward the show and all its moments throughout its beginning three fourths worth of content, splayed out in those many encounters, those many moments, for taking on such a bold and contemplative topic in such an inventive and imaginative way.\\n\\n\r\nI give Casshern Sins an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "To describe this anime in one word is simple: depressing. Casshern Sins follows Casshern--a character who doesn't know whether he is human or robot--in a dystopic world that is, quite literally, the end of the world. I don't mean it's some Armageddon-like atmosphere where some supernatural force is destroying everything; in this setting, the world is just dying. It is a barren wasteland where even robots, who are supposed to be immortal, experience death.\r\nOf the nine episodes that I have seen so far, each episode follows a pattern: Casshern is wandering through his seemingly endless journey when he meets a new character. This new character,just like every other being in that world, is suffering in some form from the ruin. But while this pattern detracts from the overall plot of the story (I don't need to provide it, you can read it yourself), it adds new perspectives. It goes to show how one worldwide trauma can separately affect different lives. It adds a new personal tale each episode that serves to constantly remind and torment Casshern of his sin. This increases his need for redemption and his need for finding the answers. One definitely cannot say by the end of this anime that Casshern receives no development.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are some recurring characters--particularly Lyuze, Ringo, and Oji--and their consistent interaction with Casshern is realistic, not to mention it provides some development for them as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery is horribly lovely. There could honestly be no better way of drawing such a bleak setting than with the animation style that is used in this anime. There's just a quality to the art that makes this anime its own; an art that is both beautiful and upsetting. And the music, while repetitive, is fitting. I only gave Sound a 5 because of its lack of diversity, not because it doesn't work. (Of course, I could just be tone deaf and unable to decipher distinct soundbites.)\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone asked for my opinion of this anime, I would definitely recommend it. But I must also warn anyone who tries to watch it to keep a good couple years' supply of antidepressants handy, whether or not you're prone to manic depression.",

            "content": "Story:  The story is a very thought-provoking and great examination of the value of truly living your life, as opposed to passing through it aimlessly.  It is about an apparently immortal robot named Casshern, who after killing a woman named Luna, creates the Ruin, a plague that causes the world to die.  All life has withered away, and any survivors are on the brink of insanity as they are surrounded by death.  His journey to discover his identity and role in this new world causes the robots he comes into contact with to realize the value of our existances and theirthoughts on life itself.  It is a very engrossing, thought-provoking story for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The drawing style is very minimalist, but is works incredibly in the context of the world of ruin.  Everything is very angular and colors are usually very muted.  It helps to establish the world of Casshern as one that is both unique and memorable.  This carries over into the fight scenes as well, where the fast movements really compliment the sharpness of the drawings to create a very visually exciting and energetic sense of combat.  The art style really helps to bring all the themes of this universe and the intensity of combat into full fruition.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The music is very fitting.  It's mostly sinister, ominous tones used to bring out the dread of the world at hand.  However, many tracks bring out the small shimmers of hope Casshern and his friends encounter in a world governed by death.  It is these tracks that really stand out to me personally as great compositional scores and pieces that really bring the main themes of the show to light.  \"A Path\" stands out as one of the best songs in anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  All characters in this anime are fully-fleshed out and are all very important in the grand scheme of things.  The character of Casshern is a great lead.  Yes, his amnesia is a little generic in anime in general, but it never becomes a problem and serves to re-enforce the themes presented.  Ringo is a great kid character, never annoying but still very childish.  She also serves as a great motivator for everyone, always inspiring them to search for a better tomorrow even as the odds are stacked against them.  Lyuze, Ohji, and Friender all serve as great lead characters that all contribute equally to the story at large.  The villians are real showstoppers as well.  Dio and Leda are a great duo that are full realized and make very worthy adversaries to Casshern's team.  Braking Boss as well is a great sideline villian.  He is a master manipulator that always gets other people to do his work for him.  \\n\\n\r\nCasshern SINS is a fantastic anime series that deserves your attention.  The depressing atmosphere may turn off some people, and in the first half of the show its basically all one shot stories, but that's OK.  Everyone else who sticks around will get not only an outstanding action anime, but an outstanding action anime that makes the characters and you the viewer think at the same time.  It is truly a remarkable and unique show for the current generation of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score, 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "People who lose their memories of the past are almost always dying to get those back. They feel empty inside, as if something was taken out of them. Something irreplaceable... Is Casshern the same? \r\nI think that this question kept running through the studio director's mind as he decided to take up an old project that was long lost and created its new version - Casshern SINS. The series is a 24-ep-long philosophic discussion on the sense of human nature and its everlasting need for self-improvement. Paradoxically though, there are very few humans in this distorted world. The entities who appear to be more humaneare... decaying and rusting robots... \\n\\n\r\nThe story keeps dwelling on the subject of coming of age and dying as well, as almost every robot out there is about to perish because the world has lost its only flower - Luna. And this aspect is staggering too. Every episode presents a different story with a different characters. Of course some stories intertwine to create a whole plot line, but mostly you will have to get used to one story-one ep form of the show. It remains that way till the very end. You'll also have to get used to a very slow pace. Noone is rushing nothing here. There are moments of complete silence (that is if you don't have a proper hi-fi and a blu-rau version) or a muttering sound of the wind rustling with the rocks, the sand and the water ocassionally. There are almost no plants in Casshern's world. Only rust, rocks and the remains of human civilization. This picture may sometimes get depressing, but there's not one thing in this show that would suggest that it should be different. But going back to the story, which is the main protagonist here...\\n\r\nAs the show progresses many truths about the world are revealed. Some are universal and old-school viewers would get to those since episode one, and some are... impossible to comprehend at first. But once you reach the final episode most of those are cleared. And even in this distorted world, there is a place for family warmth and love. These two transcendental aspects of our nature will have their toll on Casshern, as he changes from ruthless and calm destruction machine into... a human, who no longer needs his past, and no longer needs Luna.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply brilliant. Throughout the whole series you won't find a single persona that is boring or useless. Every single one of them is relevant to Casshern's journey towards the light. Every single one of them is a part of this world and adds up to the whole image. Despite all this, Casshern is alone. He may have a cybernetic dog called 'Friender' but it still does not account for a companion, although the dog seems to be more intelligent than its master at times. Likewise with the story, Casshern earns the trust of the two most important people he has met on his journey - the robot-girl I mentioned above - Ringo, and another robot-girl who seeks revenge on Casshern -  Lyuze. You can easily guess now, who his family is...\\n\\n\r\nI think I'll just pass through the video and audio aspect. Although both important, they had little influence on me, as the story kept me interested more and more. Of course, in an anime of this level those are splendid. The animation is perfect and smooth, and Casshern's bloody battles are impressive. The same goes for the audio part. If you have a good quality release and a hi-fi you can hear a lot more than you may think. The score is beautiful on the other hand, and I really loved the op and ed sequences. \\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up. Casshern SINS is not an anime for everyone. Those looking for pure action and quick pace will quickly get bored and tossed away, despite the very good quality of art and music. Those longing for heart breaking experience and great story will love it all the way through, and those looking for a title to shed some tears on... it's for you as well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm partially all those types mentioned, and I sincerely loved it. More than most other titles in 2008...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cHumans are always contradictions.\u201d\r\nEarly in Casshern Sins, a character makes this observation. It wasn't lost on me that Casshern Sins is full of seeming contradictions itself; the series features fast action and snail's-pace plot development, \u201coldschool\u201d character designs presented with new technology, extreme violence and quiet speculation, and a tone that wavers schizophrenically between \u201cuplifting\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d The end result is something unique enough to merit a cautious recommendation.\r\nCasshern Sins centers around the titular Casshern\u2014a character who wakes up on a barren futuristic world knowing nothing of his past. The only thing he seems to remember is how to brutally kill others; he only knowshis own name because it's what his enemies scream as they attempt to kill him. The world is ravaged by The Ruin, a plague that slowly destroys robots and humans alike. Casshern quickly learns that in the distant past he was responsible for killing Luna, a life-giving savior. Her death caused The Ruin. Burdened by this knowledge, Casshern attempts to navigate the unknown world while gradually learning more about his past, and the sins that he cannot remember.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a strong one, with many intricacies that are revealed as time passes. Two stories are actually being told at once; one of the present and, indirectly, one of the past. The parallels between them drive the series forward with the feeling of a classic tragedy. \u201cComplete amnesia\u201d is a plot device that seems to be very popular nowadays, but this series manages to present a pretty original spin on it. It's not used for cheap emotional content. Instead, it's an integral part of establishing the plot. It allows other characters to show Casshern just what he did wrong, but since the explanation is actually a necessary one to get Casshern on the right track, it doesn't feel like needless exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, Casshern Sins doesn't seem to be about sin/atonement (as the title suggests) but, rather, about life and death. Specifically, whether or not immortality would really be \u201cworth it,\u201d so to speak. In this world, robots and humans have been equalized by The Ruin\u2014robots were once immortal, but now certain death lies on the horizon for both races, and how each party reacts to the looming threat is an integral part of the show. Some fight The Ruin, gratefully embracing any semblance of hope, while others give up entirely and await their end in silence. The series poignantly debates whether it's better to live in a calm eternity, like a placid lake, or to live a short but fulfilling life before succumbing to death, like a fire burning in the night. \\n\\n\r\nNow, while I was a fan of the story and themes, it's tough not to be put off by the pacing of the show. For the first half of its running time Casshern Sins is episodic, meaning that each episode tells a self-contained story that's connected only loosely\u2014if at all\u2014to the overarching plot. The problem with most of these episodes was that, while they connect well to the repeated ideas of life and death, most of them lack any connection to the central storyline. Sometimes it feels like the series is just buying time, and to be honest, there are points where these episodes do drag a little bit. I wouldn't say they're \u201cfiller\u201d episodes, but some of them do merit the question: \u201cDid this really need to be here?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIn fairness, Casshern Sins does find its stride around episode 13, when the series switches to a continuous story thread that puts more focus on major plot points. But whether or not you can wait it out until then to see the pacing pick up is a different story. Even after that point, it's still a pretty slow-moving show, with many, many exchanges of dialogue, but the change from \u201cgut-wrenchingly slow\u201d to \u201cslow but deliberate\u201d is noticeable and welcoming once you get there.\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the characters in Casshern Sins, it's necessary to know that the show features two different \u201csets\u201d of characters: Episodic characters, who exist only in the context of one episode, and the main cast, who persist throughout the show. The episodic characters are generally well-written and given a lot of emotional appeal, but they suffer from the same problem I described above; that is, they connect to the show's themes, but not its story, and therefore some of them can end up feeling a little unnecessary. The main cast, on the other hand, features several memorable characters that get fully fleshed out as the series progresses. Casshern is the central figure for most character development. Whether Casshern is to be hated or sympathized with is a running argument throughout the show, and you can tell a lot about a character based on which side they take. As Casshern grows to learn more about his past and present, and develop thoughts of his own, this creates a sort of ripple effect in which the other characters change along with him. The central cast are all given appropriate backstories that are revealed at strategic points in the show, adding a sense of depth and believability to their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals...man, I really need to stop reviewing Madhouse shows, because they're always great looking. Casshern Sins features extremely detailed background art that turns the world of robots and humans into a beautiful dystopia of vast deserts, barren mountains, and shining seas. When there is an oasis in the middle of this hellish world\u2014a spot of pink and blue flowers, perhaps\u2014it looks even more gorgeous by contrast. The art seems to echo the show's themes; everything that's still alive seems to be encircled by the empty land, besieged by death from every direction. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the character designs in Casshern Sins are decidedly more \u201coldschool\u201d than what most of us are probably used to. Most of the characters have sharper, thinner, more angular bodies than what's common nowadays, and in truly classic style, everyone seems to have ridiculously massive and spiky hair in every color of the rainbow. All gentle mockery aside, these designs look great; I always welcome a unique departure from the norm. Casshern himself seems almost iconic, a spot of white and red in a world that's completely black and brown.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say that Casshern Sins also has some great action sequences, which are lovingly animated. Casshern is an elegant killing machine who seems to almost dance while he's fighting, bringing a strange sort of beautiful brutality to the table. He pirouettes and spins, all while violently dismembering his opponents, splitting them in half, or ripping out pieces of their inner workings with his bare hands. The scenes of action are well-choreographed, a real treat to watch, and there's no shortage of them in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins also shines in the sound department, where a beautiful orchestral soundtrack is used to great effect. Most of the songs feature string and wind instruments as the lead sounds, with an occasional chanted or choir element of background vocals. Despite the high quality of the soundtrack in general, I took some slight issues with two songs that occasionally play in the show: They have English lyrics, and pretty hammy ones, at that. While the singer (Nami Miyahara, who also voices a main character) has a great voice and puts in an admirable effort, she still sings with a noticeable Japanese accent. This, combined with the cheesiness of the lyrics, means that these songs will probably not have the intended effect on an audience of native English speakers. This is a relatively small complaint, and since English speakers were (obviously) not the originally intended audience of the show, it's really not anyone's fault, but it's there nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins has a lot going for it\u2014it boasts a great plot, mature themes, memorable characters, refreshing art, and a top-notch soundtrack. When it comes right down to it, I'd say that the only thing holding Casshern Sins back from true greatness is its pacing; it's the biggest flaw in an otherwise excellent series. Whether or not you're capable of enjoying this series is completely up to how patient you are. If you're the type that doesn't like to wait, and wants a story that's always in high gear, watching this would be a nightmare. But those with a high degree of tolerance for things that are slow to develop might find Casshern Sins to be well worth their time.\\n",

            "content": "In a nutshell, I think that Casshern Sins is a terrible anime. I might\u2019ve given it a slightly higher rating, say, a 2 or even a whopping 3 instead of 1 like I am giving it now, if only I haven\u2019t picked it up because after watching Ergo Proxy I read on Reddit that \u201cErgo Proxy is just a pale shadow of Casshern Sins\u201d. I loved Ergo Proxy to bits, so naturally I just had to have a look at something that was potentially even better. This, however, made me compare the two series at every turn, be it consciously or subconsciously, and it wasnever in Casshern Sins favor. So, I went in with reasonably high expectations, and what I have encountered has disappointed me so badly that my overall impression of Casshern Sins ended up being even grimmer than it could\u2019ve been. That being said, I am certain that if I had gone in blind, I would still hate it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the plot tells us a story of a not-quite-robot-not-quite-human named Casshern who mopes his way through the wastelands of a planet where once a mighty robot civilization now falling prey to Ruin has flourished, or so we\u2019re told, at least, but I somehow doubt the civilization had been that advanced. We only get to see a handful of small towns, one (one!) spare parts factory, a church, and the rest is, well, desert, copious amounts of flower fields (I swear, there are more flower fields than there are towns, but of course there are, everyone knows flowers are essential to robot well-being, right?), desert, lake, plains, sea, some more desert, caves, some gigantic microphone-shaped constructions of unknown origin and purpose protruding from the sand in the, oh, did I mention there\u2019s deserts? No, there\u2019s no roads or any infrastructure whatsoever, except maybe, uh, some pools or hot springs or whatever, which again, everybody know robots can\u2019t live without, like flowers. Oh, and there\u2019s a hidden experimental laboratory tucked away somewhere, too, but it\u2019s the humans\u2019, not the robots\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nYes, there\u2019s apparently humans, too, although you only ever see, like three of them over the course of the entire series and they\u2019re all minor background characters. They have created robots, and the apparent root cause of all conflict in the series \u2013 Luna, an, uh, immortal frog-faced girl with twin blue ponytails that provided life eternal for man and robot alike, until Casshern came along and somehow managed to do her in despite her stated immunity to death, thereby attaining immortality himself and unleashing  the mysterious plague called Ruin upon the world. What it does, as we\u2019re told and shown, is that it makes robots rust and start to break down gradually, resulting in their eventual death and dissolution into dust. All tools are apparently subject to this too, for some reason. In episode two we\u2019re told that replacing rusted parts doesn\u2019t work, but it doesn\u2019t preclude robots from still trying to do that in a bid to save their life. Just, y\u2019know, not in a rational way of \u201cmass-producing spare parts so we could change them as soon as they start showing signs of wear\u201d (the only factory we see is in perfect working order, so it\u2019s certainly not out of realm of possibilities). Instead, those who can, choose to hunt smaller and weaker robots to take them apart for their innards. As in, in one instance, a large, classic box-shaped giant robot with a flail or a morning star for an arm picks up a tiny robot identical to a human child in all respects, cackling triumphantly, and gleefully tells us he\u2019s going to get so many good parts from this body still relatively untainted by Ruin. Are you fucking dumb, Robot-Man?! There\u2019s no way ANY of her parts will fit you. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that was a major source of my unending frustration with this anime \u2013 NOTHING adds up. The world is an entirely illogical mishmash of half-baked apocalypse-themed ideas no one ever bothered to think through. The details of it end up contradicting each other ultimately, and that\u2019s where the details are given at all. I have mentioned above that humans are a part of the world in Casshern Sins, but nothing is ever explained about them, not their relationship with robots after they have created them (we only know that the robot king hated them, and that \u201cbad\u201d robot goons will kill them on sight, but the why of it is left out), not where they reside and what they are doing now, not how the Ruin affects them, if it at all does (seems to imply it does, fails to explain how), nor, most importantly, what the difference between the robots and people even is, despite this seemingly being a plot point. \\n\\n\r\nRobots in Cassern Sins behave exactly like people would. They fall in love, the feel anger, joy, sadness, despair, they cry (one character remarks to the other with disdain \u201cYou\u2019re crying?! Like a human?!\u201d only to do that herself a few episodes later), they dream of becoming famous singers, they bleed, they can go for a swim, they sleep and rest, they breathe, they take pills, they have families, baby robots grow up into adult robots and grow old\u2026 About the only thing they haven\u2019t explicitly shown them doing is eating, but neither do we get a sense of what energy source if not food keeps them functioning. No sockets or landlines, no batteries, no tanking stations, no solar panels\u2026 Why bother making most of the characters robots at all, if their being robots doesn\u2019t add anything to the story? They could\u2019ve just as well been humans that have attained near-eternal life through advanced medical technology (as the humans in Casshern Sins apparently have!) and not a single thing would have changed.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the world falls apart (literally, too, har-har), the motivation and the backstories of everyone involved crumble to dust right with it. Recurring characters are static and one-dimensional, and minor characters all blend together to form two blurry blobs: the bad guys that have to hurt others just because they happen to see them, cue our protagonist flying in to save the day and utterly destroying them in a bland fighting scene without any real stakes, and the, er, I suppose, good guys, that are trying to live to the fullest despite the world around them having gone to shit, or something. Just, the ways they do it are often absurd \u2013 there\u2019s a guy who paints the whole town bluish white, even the tallest buildings somehow, despite him being in a wheelchair and needing help to go up a flight of stairs, a woman that tries to knock out a robot who\u2019s just passing by and strikes her fancy with aroma candles to try and make him a part of a bell (don\u2019t even ask), a girl who likes to beat others up and fight, but somehow she\u2019s admirable unlike the bad guys because, I guess, she looks pretty and asks before she goes impaling robots on her sword? The only decent episodic character was the human from episode three, at least he brought some much-needed levity and exposition into the dreary mess Casshern Sins calls its plot. Just as well that he died very promptly. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character oozes angst like Ikari Shinji on steroids. From episode one it\u2019s obvious that none of what\u2019s happening is really his fault, but still he spends all of his screen time (and most of viewers\u2019 time along with it)being emo about it. His preferred method of conversation is staring at people dumbly, moaning about his suffering and repeating the last few words his conversation partner said in a questioning tone. There\u2019s also a robot dog, the only one we see in the series, whose relevance to the story is a mystery shrouded in an enigma, but it\u2019s there in almost every episode anyway. Then there\u2019s a girl who starts out hating Casshern\u2019s guts and wanting to exact revenge on him, and then ends up falling in love with him out of the blue over the course of two bizarre episodes dedicated solely to the topic. No, they\u2019re not about their interactions \u2013 their interactions are minimal at that point. It\u2019s a peek inside her \u201cinner world\u201d, and boy is it weird as heck! You could say that this is the character with most development, but since all that development is shat into existence out of nothing, it doesn\u2019t really count. Or maybe her falling in love with the protagonist was inevitable \u2013 because this could\u2019ve just as well been a harem with how many women fawn over Casshern, cling to him and call him beautiful. Just because. Also, we have an annoying child, whose primary function is to a) laugh like an idiot, pluck flowers and marvel at how pretty things are so that we know how innocent and beautiful her heart is and b) run away and get lost. At one point, she also serves to get the gang\u2019s hands on an important gimmick that turns out to be a MacGuffin, forgotten about in the very next episode and ultimately serving nothing. Oh, and there\u2019s also her guardian and apparently, gasp, the creator of Casshern (which is never explored at all), whose sole purpose is to rant about how precious the robot girl in question is to him and drive a truck around to take her places. Places where she can stumble upon Casshern, so we can listen to how she repeats his name over and over and watch her gift him seashells or something. The antagonists are similarly one-note: Mr. \u201cI-need-to-kick-Casshern\u2019s-ass-with-my-two-feet-because-he-humuliated-me\u201d and Ms. \u201cMaleficent-who-wants-to-get-knocked-up\u201d. I won\u2019t even touch upon Braiking Boss and Luna, because that fail is of truly epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nMany here praise Casshern Sins for its visuals and sound. I won\u2019t deny it, the crisp lines and stark, bright contrasting colors make this series easy on the eye, and the animation is fluid and dynamic. There is of course this weird fetish that the art director has with drops of water, flower fields and pieces of robots affected by Ruin chipping off and scattering into dust, and while it admittedly looks great, it\u2019s repetitive to the point of obsession. It smack of an attempt to appear deep and meaningful through visual means without anything of substance backing it up. The black-and-white video footage insert in one episode is another example of that visual pretentiousness. Also, I, and this is due my personal taste, absolutely loathe the character design. It\u2019s so overwhelmingly 70\u2019s? 80\u2019s? There\u2019s very little variety in facial features \u2013 we have ugly classical \u201cbucket of bolts\u201d robots, humanoid-type robots with distinct half-oval eyes and single vertical line on their faces, and Casshern-style sleek and pretty robots indistinguishable from, say, humans. The only exceptions to the rule would be Ringo\u2019s guardian Ohji, Braiking Boss and maybe that short dude from the church in episode two. Casshern, Dio and Leda\u2019s design with their regenerating bodysuits and Gundam-esque horns made me giggle. Especially Casshern with the blatantly Superman-like \u201cC\u201d on his chest. Also, the trio seems to have a pair of weapons hanging from their hips purely for decoration as Leda is the only one to actually use them. Why do the rest bother with them again? And Luna\u2026 well, she just looks as if someone stuck a frog\u2019s head in a blue wig and a bicycle helmet on a loli body. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, honestly, it made me laugh at the most inappropriate moments. Sometimes, the characters would talk, and then this incredible sappy melody would start blasting full-force, and instead of moving me to tears the scene would make me gag because of its blatant grab for my heartstrings. I\u2019m familiar with Kaoru Wada\u2019s work through anime like 3x3 Eyes and InuYasha, and the similarities between those OSTs and Casshern\u2019s are striking to the point of the man plagiarizing his own work. I swear there was this one track that was a dead-on ripoff of his own Sango\u2019s Theme for InuYasha. Where that sort of music worked for a simplistic and a bit na\u00efve shonen anime, it fails to deliver in a postapocalyptic series with philosophical aspirations. It sounds pretty, sure, but it\u2019s completely at odds with the world and the story it tries to convey. It doesn\u2019t add to it, it detracts from it. The voice acting is unimpressive, particularly in the leads. I suppose that Casshern\u2019s VA does an adequate job of conveying what a sad little boy the protagonist is, but he also manages to make him sound like he\u2019s got a developmental disorder, and his \u201chowls of pure agony\u201d, groans and grunts sounded very unnatural. Lyuze\u2019s VA made her character have all the emotional range of a toaster oven. Ringo sounded whiny, bratty and annoying, good job picturing a child, I guess? The rest were passable. I\u2019d say Braiking Boss\u2019 and Luna\u2019s VAs hit the mark with their acting, but that didn\u2019t save their characters from poor writing, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen reviews claiming that all lore omissions, plotholes and worldbuilding problems are actually non-issues because this anime is not supposed to be a consistent, fleshed out sci-fi story, but more of a philosophical\\psychological exploration of sorts, particularly of the issues pertaining to death and life in the face of immortality and unavoidable doom. I don\u2019t know where people saw depth, or metaphors, or anything like that, because the series is about as subtle as Casshern\u2019s fist in a random robot\u2019s chest. Already in episode one (or was it episode two? they do blend together so) the main message of Casshern Sins is established \u2013 \u201cthere is no true life without death, precisely because of the prospect of perishing one must strive to live as full a life as possible\u201d. Roll credits, I guess, because all that follows is a disjointed series of mind-numbingly repetitive vignettes that serve to illustrate this particular point with plots so similar they seem cloned. There\u2019s also an overarching plotline that comes to the forefront in the latter half of the series, but it doesn\u2019t bring any satisfying answers about the world or the characters, and the message stays exactly the same. I swear, this could\u2019ve been one or two-episode OVA and it would\u2019ve been sufficient to tell this story, if you wring it out to rid it of endless landscape shots, intense face close-ups, characters standing or walking in silence and meandering pointless dialogue that doesn\u2019t shy away from repeating the exact same phrases several times in a row in the exact same wording. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Casshern Sins is a hollow, artificial, pretentious attempt at making a puddle look like an ocean. If you\u2019re 13, like the idea of robots and have never happened to ponder your own mortality, give this a whirl, and maybe you\u2019ll like it despite its agonizingly slow pacing. Also worth a try if you like to poke fun at logical fallacies, plotholes and poorly written dialogue. For the rest, it would be an exercise in frustration.",

            "content": "This series is very... depressing.  It is not like the Casshern series that people expect, but in it's own right is well made.  The first thing I would like to mention is that the artwork and music is superb.  Watching anime, and then watching Casshern Sins is like going from a child's artwork to architectural blueprints/designs.  The animation, art, and colors are very crisp and clean.  Half the time, I was busy enjoying the artwork and the animations.  Casshern is like looking at a work of art.\r\nDespite that, the story at first was very depressing and slow.  Afterwatching the series through a few more times, I found it to be a lot more entertaining and has a much more deeper meaning than what I originally thought.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development shines in this series.  One can see the growth of the characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I would not mind seeing is a prequel to the series, just to see what the world was like before the ruin and the different stories of the characters that you meet throughout the series.\\n\r\nOf course, if a prequel was made, I can see it being a lot more faster paced and more action oriented due to the period of time in the story, and the ideas that took place at that time (in the anime)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable series.  Probably not what people expect, but with the right mindset, can be a great series.",

            "content": "Are you sick of monotonous anime? It\u2019s time to change up the pace and travel along with Casshern as he discovers his sins that doomed the world. Sounds interesting right?\r\nCasshern Sins, a philosophical anime about Casshern has caused The Ruin to occur. Before such event, the world was full of sentient robots who were immortal. Ruin causes rust until they wither away leaving them to only contemplate death. But rumors have been spreading of someone named Casshern to be the answer to immortality when killed. As the opening states: \u201cHey why are we born? Hey why did we meet?\u201d Casshern struggles to comprehend why heexists and remembers nothing of his feared past. As robots hunt him down, Casshern travels to learn the truth.\\n\\n\r\nOne day as I was going through an anime slouch, I decided to browse around to see if I was missing any interesting shows. That\u2019s when I stumbled upon Casshern Sins. At first, looking at reviews I was skeptical at first that it would be basically wordless, have odd fighting, and have a slow pace. But personally I can debunk all of these claims and state that Casshern Sins demolished any of my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the first claim that Casshern Sins has little dialogue. From the very start it begins with dialogue, and even in fights there is usually plenty of inner thoughts and conversations occurring. The only time where I see this criticism \u201ccorrect\u201d is when it is silent still shots or when Casshern is traveling alone in deep thought. Which develops the mood and presents how desolate and lifeless everything around Casshern is. But this tone shifts throughout the anime as Casshern finds friends creating more dialogue and character interactions. It is a mystery of why anyone would think that Casshern Sins is too silent.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onward to the final one I want to tackle is odd fighting and I\u2019ll keep it brief. The choreography of the fighting feels very floaty, like the characters glide to enemy to enemy. This makes Casshern Sins fighting something to get adjusted to. I personally didn\u2019t have a problem with it, if anything it was a surge of something new for me. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts on common complaints/ why people don\u2019t give Casshern Sins a chance, is that I understand that this kind of show is not for everyone. Whether that comes with pace, realistic fighting, or any other reason. But Casshern Sins is definitely the kind of show to watch till the end regardless to get the full experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cReal\u201d Start Of My Review~\\n\\n\r\nWhen it is time to pull up the first episode of an anime what do you want to see? Most likely one would want to see good character introductions, art, animation, sound, and most importantly a good hook. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins intro scene is personally my favorite anime hook of all time. If you do not want any episode 1 spoilers, skip the next paragraph. Ok, so in 8 seconds Casshern Sins instantly confused, intrigued, hyped, and surprised me all at once. \\n\\n\r\nIt starts off with Casshern dropping his hand on the ground as it then cuts to a girl. She states, \u201cYou are?\u201d Flashing back to Casshern he introduces himself. Then zooming into his soulless face he saids with determination, \u201cLuna, I will kill you.\u201d With this information alone many questions arise. With a bombshell of a scene like this as the first scene in the show, it becomes enourmous later on in the show. But also works perfect as a hook. In the beginning of each episode, 8 more second add onto the original until it all starts to fall into place. With this, Casshern\u2019s backstory unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nIf I discuss anymore of the show it will ruin your experience. As each character has their own fantastic arc and others have mind boggling plot twists. What I love about this show is how every character feels unique, even the side characters all bring something special. Depending on the character, they all have different connections to Casshern. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is top notch even if it was made in 2008. It is produced by Madhouse, which is always a nice plus most the time. I love the style of the art too, it fits well with the setting of a barren wasteland being devoured by The Ruin with soulless robots desperately searching for any salvation. Same can be said for the animation. Each fight is really smooth and full of style. Especially since the fighting by itself is like extreme acrobats. Madhouse made acrobatics look epic.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts are about enjoyment. As one can tell by my score, I loved learning about the mysteries of Casshern and the dramatic tension of whether or not he will learn from his sins. All major complaints I ever had about the anime were cleared up as the anime progressed, meaning I just did not have the available details.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins made me inspired and existential all in one. Having realistic developing character arcs, an interesting environment/ premise, phenomenal hook, killer opening, smooth animation, stylistic art, a thought provoking message, and much more. I truly cannot praise it anymore! If you are looking for a different experience with philosophical messages, Casshern Sins is a must watch. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nOveral: 9 \\n\\n\r\nI would easily recommend this to anybody.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I will admit that my opinion of \"Casshern: Sins\" is somewhat biased by the fact that I watched and enjoyed the original 1973 anime \"Shinzou Ningen  (Neo Human) Casshern\" first.  Because of that I became more than a bit pissed off when I realized that \"Sins\" had absolutely _nothing_ to do with \"Shinzou Ningen.\"  \r\n\"Sins\" is touted as a \"remake\" of the original series, but that's a fallacy.  What it actually is, is a story so utterly disparate from the original that the use of familiar names and faces seems to have been the result of a combination of laziness onthe part of the designers and a desire to boost the initial viewership by feeding off of a pre-existing fandom.  The characters who \"return\" in \"Sins\" are not at all like the ones they were cloned from - in Luna's case there is no similarity whatsoever, which is a shame, because Luna was my favorite character in \"Shinzou Ningen.\" \\n\\n\r\nEven when I cooled down and resolved to evaluate \"Sins\" on its own merits, rather than comparing it to \"Shinzou Ningen,\" it still came up lacking.  It seems as though the creators got together to come up with a collection of evocative images and scenes, and then strung them all together with a flimsy, poorly developed plot cluttered with ill-fitting elements.  The anime is rife with trite symbolism, and does its level best to constantly hammer you with angst, without bothering to be remotely subtle in the execution of it.\\n\\n\r\nActually, there's a fundamental lack of subtlety on most levels of this story's execution; where it's most damaging though is that as the story progresses it becomes overwhelmingly preachy; and that, more than anything else, I could have done without.\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, I can't exactly call it a _bad_ anime, I think anyone who likes this style of story will probably find it reasonably entertaining, and the art and animation _are_ beautiful, but if you're looking for a great anime, this isn't it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a pity though; I would have loved to see what a faithful rendering of \"Shinzou Ningen Casshern\" would have looked like executed with modern storytelling aesthetics.",

            "content": "Story\r\nDespite being a remake to a kitschy 70\u2019s anime \u201cclassic,\u201dCasshern Sins begins promisingly. In the first few episodes, the creators lay out a post-apocalyptic setting that manages to feel both unabashedly retro and grimly bleak at the same time. The resulting mix of camp and angst is weirdly intriguing, especially when the solid supporting characters and mysterious titular protagonist are factored in.\r\nSadly, Casshern Sins fails to live up to its initial promise due to its unfocused overarching narrative. Rather than develop any core theme in the early to middle stages, the series meanders among flavor-of-the-week plots and half-hearted attempts at a main story. After countlessthematically tangential episodes, the anime barely has room to resolve its main plotline and is forced to squeeze a half-hearted conclusion into the final few episodes. The final episodes seem to assert that death is needed to make life worth living. However, the distracted narrative and conflicting themes beforehand causes this moralizing to feel hollow and unconvincing by the time the creators decide to tack it to the end. At the end of the series, Casshern Sins doesn\u2019t feel like it was ever actually about anything, and this is perhaps its greatest flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s plot is further diluted by lame fight scenes that lack context or relevance. In many occasions, a group of mooks will simply appear in the middle of an episode to suicidally impale themselves on Casshern\u2019s foot. These scenes appear to have been inserted to please the action junkies, but the problem is that Casshern Sins tries to be something more than just another shounen action show. By mixing mindless action with serious science-fiction, the anime fails to appeal to fans of either.\\n\\n\r\nStill, in spite of all these weaknesses, the series is not without merit. Casshern Sins\u2019 main strengths lie not in the actual meat of the plot, but in the assorted one-shot episodes that pepper the overarching narrative. While they disrupt the flow of the actual story, many of the disjointed plotlines are well-written enough to be entertaining in their own right. Granted, not all of the self-contained stories are good, but others are genuinely compelling. This alone prevents Sins\u2019 story from being an outright failure.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Casshern Sins has an excellent idea of what it wants to look like, if not what it wants to be about. Put simply, the style of the series' dystopian setting is wonderful.Casshern Sins uses carefully chosen color schemes and crisp animation all to great effect, and the final visual package is one of the most impressive I've seen this year. A particularly impressive aspect of the visual package is the dramatic use of light in just about every scene. It's not Makoto Shinkai obsessive, but the shadows drawn across the hero's face do a lot to darken the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting as a whole is uneven. The protagonist\u2019s seiyuu is so hideously terrible that I genuinely wondered if he was trying to sound wooden on purpose, while some of the supporting roles turn in excellent work. On the other hand, the background music is almost universally excellent. The music grimly underscores the anime\u2019s bleak mood without ever becoming a distraction. The soundtrack\u2019s one flaw is its frequent repetition, but this never becomes too much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the haphazard plot and the hamfisted ending, the creators botch the characterization on nearly every major player in the show. Casshern himself is the most egregious example; his deadpan voice acting, terrible dialogue and unconvincing development combine to form one of the most ineffective protagonists that I've ever seen. Dio and Leda, the two main villains, are almost as bad; not only are their motivations left woefully unexplained, they're just flat-out boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, some of the supporting characters fare better; Lluyze in particular is a welcome exception to the bad characterization. Casshern Sins dedicates an entire episode to dissecting her psyche in a weird and decidedly Freudian fashion, and the result is arguably the highlight of the show. Sadly, she is a comparatively minor character and simply can't carry the show on her own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed myself as I was watching and in particular liked the one-shot episodes, which at times evoke the amazing work done in Kino's Journey. However, the turgid overarching narrative, the bad characters and the incompetent ending make me wonder if these scattered episodes were enough to make the series actually worth my time.",

            "content": "Super Heroes by now are a standard part of our lives, being adapted into thousands of films already, we are used to incredibly powerful men and women walking around in weird skintight clothes that are supposed to be their trademark. It has almost been done to death in western media and I myself am not a huge fan of those franchises either, with a few exceptions. In Anime though, while we have quite some superheroes, it is not nearly as much as in the western media and only few of them really rose to popularity in the Otaku Culture. Today I will Review an Animethat is rather unknown to the masses, while still not disappointing in most parts. Casshern Sins is a Spin Off of the original Shinzou Ningen Casshern, which aired in 1974, meaning this show was goddamn old. It aired in 2009 and tells the story of an Alternative Universe.\\n\\n\r\nStory: In this Alternative Universe, the world is almost only inhabited by Robots and the humans that once created those, became rare. This world is shown in a post apocalyptic state, where all the robots, which couldn't die due to them getting old earlier, now slowly ruin away. This Ruin heavily resembles rust and seems to work the same way as infirmity for humans. Here lives our main protagonist called Casshern. He is a robot that is immortal, immediately heals every time he is wounded and cannot decay like all the others Robots. There also are a lot of rumors around him, that if a robot would devour him, he would get the immortality that is Casshern's. Our protagonist though, doesn't know what happened to him and has no idea why he is immortal and where the Ruin comes from.\\n\r\nThere actually is not a lot more to say about the plot, as it is rather simple and going deeper into it would result into spoilers. The thing that stands out though, is not the plot itself, but the Setting it is presented in. One thing has to be said though, being that this show is slow! For almost the whole show it moves forward so slow, at points it even gets a little boring. It actually takes the show 12 episodes before it gets a little faster, before it actually goes back into slow-motion mode again and decides that the fast pacing is something it doesn't like, before only getting a little faster in the final episodes. This is something that many people might find to be a problem with this show and something that turns away many. I myself didn't have any problems with that though and actually thought it fit the world rather well, but that is just preference and I can totally see why people might not like that.\\n\r\n6.7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: For the majority of the show, it moves forward in a \"Character of the Week\"-Style and only goes away from it if it gets to a climax, which happens rarely due to the slow pacing. Every single episode, the show introduces a new Robot or Human, lets them interact with the main characters that are currently present, before either letting them stay, leaving them alone, or killing them off. It's a concept that quite some shows often use in a similar way, being the \"monster of the week\"-concept. A really popular Anime for this is the Mecha Deconstruction \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", which introduces one enemy per episode and let's the three main characters kill them off at the end, before it goes into the actual main plot later on. Casshern Sins does the same thing with it's supporting cast. The thing that most shows that use this concept intend to do is get depth added to their own characters. Casshern Sins does this while also getting a little more into the Setting every single episode and every single episode that is used for a Supporting character in the end helps our main character realize the thing that the whole show wants to tell us, being that without death, life would not be livable\\n\r\nThis concept is executed in such a good way, that every single episode we get a new character, that for the most time doesn't even show up anymore at all, that is either really likeable or just amazingly well written. Unfortunately this can not be said about all the main characters. More than once, I had the feeling that the supporting cast would be overshadowing the main characters by far. We do get development for every single one and a lot of depth of course, especially to Casshern, but all this doesn't help me to sympathize with the characters more and I feel like they were way to boring for the most part to actually make for a good cast. Leaving us with an amazing Supporting cast, while the main cast didn't succeed in convincing me of them being really interesting.\\n\r\n7.6\\n\\n\r\n\ufeffArt: The Art in Casshern Sins is, to leave it simple, amazing! It's another show where Studio Madhouse doesn't disappoint in just being awesome. The fighting scenes, which exist at least once per episode, look really good and are completely fluent. The coloring is for the most part beautiful and fits the dark atmosphere really well, while still featuring a lot of colors. The Characters Designs though, are something that I had my problems with, with it being really old school, since the characters were designed in 1974 already for the most part, which is not a style that I really like. That again is only preference and doesn't really matter for the overall enjoyment but rather is something that I didn't like myself.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack of Casshern Sins is something that I didn't realize during the first few episode, but that grew on me really fast. It mostly consists of really quite pieces, using a lot of guitar. It is used perfectly for the most part and one of the few songs in the Soundtrack that I actually didn't like was the only one that was not the opening or ending, was the only one using lyrics. The Openings and Endings though, were something that is in contrast to the OST itself actually...rather annoying. While the first Ending song was okay, I could stand neither the first Opening, which was plain annoying to me and the second ending, which I actually didn't watch a lot. \\n\r\n8.3/10\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is a show that is not for all people, featuring a pacing that is a lot slower than the pacing of most, but if you happen to like more than a few genres and are able to take things that are a little different from the usual shows, it definitely is worth checking out.\\n\r\nNow as I calculated all 5 scores that I have given (Story, Characters, Art, Sound and my personal Enjoyment), I give Casshern Sins a 7.96/10 as a show that\u00a0 pleased me, but not as much as others did! It currently is available for legal Streaming on FUNimations web page, if you happen to live in a country where you have access to that particular Stream (Other than me '-.-). It also has been licensed by FUNimation if you happen to live in America, and by Manga for the Europeans.\\n\r\nWith that I hope I could help you and I'll see you next time!\\n",

            "content": "I'm usually the guy who digs melancholic & sad shows with a deeper meaning but Casshern Sins was pretty much of a drag for me to sit through. It ponders very heavily on it's apocalyptic decay of the world mood while handling reasonable character choices and a consistent story as optional. \r\nThe first half of the show is kind of a journey for the protagonist in search of his memories. On this journey he encounters new characters in each episode and we learn about their backstory and the state of the world. The writers try to give every episode / character his own theme, butsince they are all bound to the decay there is little actual variation in the stories told. So this episodic character telling barely anything new makes the whole show feel like having 7 actual episodes and 17 fillers. \\n\\n\r\nWhen they finally get to resolve the main story in the last third of the show, huge plot holes / logic issues begin to shine (e.g. there is the big idea, that a life without death has no real meaning but they don't distinguish between a healthy life/death cycle and a whole world going extinct). Also some major questions will never be answered. The final conclusion is fine but far away from perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this show was definitely the cool & unique art style in combination with the melancholic sound design. Also the obligatory fights in each episodes where nicely animated (except the mostly generic enemy designs) but given their hopeless tone, they weren't exactly fun to look at. All in all i would have probably enjoyed this show more in a 12 episode frame.",

ANd ever more better until I was obsessed, until I finished the whole show in three days. \r\nCasshern Sins is like nothing I've ever watched (and belive me I've watched tons) It's unique in every way. Each episode has is like its own story that all adds onto each other. The overallplot of the series is very simple. It's not very hard to understand and yet has a lot of depth and meaning. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it is dome completely beautifully. The animimation is truely beautiful. Even as it's set in a seemingly dead world where everything is dieing, there is still the beauty found in unexpected places. The characters and done wonderfully and everyway.\\n\\n\r\nReally, I have absolutely NOTHING bad to say about this show. BUT! I will say one thing. It did take a little getting used to hearing Casshern's name. It messes with me a litle bit. It sounds French.... Very strange. \\n\\n\r\nBut dis[ite that there's nothing bad about this anime. It's intreaging. It's unique. People who like a slow paced anime will love it and people who like action packed stuff (like me) will love it as well.

            "content": "Casshern Sins the anime embodiment of style. The animation and sound direction/quality are best of anything I've ever seen. Everything from the color pallet, contrast, angles, pacing, just everything is absolutely astounding. Not only does the animation do exactly what the plot wants it to do, but it goes out of its way to stand on its own as breathtaking. Most trailers are cut very awkwardly so they wouldn't be the best reference for something like this. If you watch the first episode or first couple minutes you'll understand what I mean. \r\nSo then, is Casshern Sins all style and no substance? Short answer isno. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins stands out to me primarily for its ability to swiftly shift focus from theme to theme. By that, I mean that the plot itself is able to morph into whatever the characters need it to be. At the beginning, it appears that the plot is everything. It is presented as this huge mystery and that the main character's sole goal for the series is to uncover it. The only reason it sets off this way is as a means of exposition for Casshern. Once that is no longer needed, the plot slowly dissolves the mystery to the point that it's not even important by like episode 16. There's also a great many things that go unanswered in the series, some extremely important and interesting things. However, they go unresolved simply because they are not required to tell the story the creator wanted to tell. For example, at the beginning, they show you three main characters. The anime tells you that they are not human, and not machine either, and that they were created for a certain purpose. The anime never tells you what they are, how they were created, or why they were created. Many people would naturally assume this is a bad thing and that it makes the anime bad, but that is not the case. It was just never important enough for the characters to find out. They ended with much bigger personal and interpersonal conflicts. Not to mention one of the themes of the anime is about forgiveness and letting go of the past. It'd be hypocritical for the anime to then spend a great deal of time and effort explaining the characters' past, wouldn't it? \\n\\n\r\nI told you everything that Casshern Sins is NOT about, so then what is it actually about? Casshern Sins, like the title suggest, is about coming to peace with one's sins. However, it also delves deeply into other themes, kind of dependent on which character we're talking about. Each character has some internal struggle or conflict that is unique to that character. This idea is aided by the fact that a little over half of the anime is entirely episodic. We got to meet a new character and its conflicts every episode. My personal favorite character from the series was Braiking Boss. He is very similar, yet arguably more complex, to Yoshii from Texhnolyze. So instead of spoiling this anime here, I'll talk about Yoshii and what made him interesting. Yoshii was in a pseudo-utopian world, where humanity had reached its evolutionary peak. He decided that the world was too peaceful, that life in that world was no life at all. He then started causing chaos, death, and destruction, simply to see how humanity would react. \\n\\n\r\nEnding thoughts:\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is spectacular. The only thing it did that I didn't like was simplify the plot. Like I said, it was done with great purpose, but I personally prefer things with a little more complexity, especially for this kind of anime. I think it could've done a lot more with the its universe. Evangelion only had 2 more episodes (counting End of Evangelion as episodes 25 and 26) and that was immensely more complex, giving it a great deal of creative freedom. I'm not going to harp down on an anime for not being Evangelion, but simplifying the plot is what brought the score down so much. Regardless, it has my highest recommendation for people who do not mind slow paced storytelling. For all philosophy aficionados.",

            "content": "I usually pride myself on objectivity when evaluating things. However, just watching Casshern Sins makes me want to squee, and I have a feeling that squeeing and objectivity don't exactly go together. So I suppose that I will write a subjective review.\r\nNow, at some level I can understand why one might not like Casshern. You might say the character designs are old fashioned (they're actually quite beautiful, though, old in style but with modern colors and animation). You might say that it's slow (rather, it's like a flower blossoming in front of you, slowly, but surely). You could conceivably say that it's full of clich\u00e9s(really, it just builds upon the best elements of pre-millennial anime).\\n\\n\r\nSee, even listing the things that could be considered defects, I can't help but see them as positive.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern is a show that pushes all of my buttons, without even trying. It has amazing art and animation that falls well outside the mainstream, a post apocalyptic setting, and robots galore. It has a deep plot, and characters that rise and fall, only to rise again. It pushes change in a static world, and life in a dying one.\\n\\n\r\nThe show was \"based\" on Casshern, but you won't really see much to connect it to the old series and movie. It forges its own path, and you can tell that it was carried forward by a strong artistic vision. Like many anime (and media in general) which have this feature, it can sometimes be pretentious, or overbearing. It's worth it, though, because the show is able to deliver on all the promises that it builds up.\\n\\n\r\nSo, unapologetically, I strongly recommend this anime. If it isn't for you, then my description will probably have already turned you off to it. But if you find yourself a bit lost amid the meandering moe that has filled the new century, maybe, just maybe, this anime is for you.",

            "content": "\u201cRuin is the salvation of man and machine.\u201d \r\nDeceptively complex themes hide beneath a flamboyant exterior of fast action fight scenes and fancy shot compositions. The director, Shigeyasu Yamauchi, who has a propensity for psychological studies and aesthetic stylishness, uses Casshern Sins as an opportunity to deconstruct death and hope in a visually arresting way. \r\nThe first episode establishes the premise with a satisfying level of badassery. In the distant future, Robots have evolved sentience, and can feel emotions like humans can. A global \"Ruin\"\u2014with a capital R, implying that it's more than an action\u2014was prompted when Casshern, a highly skilled and gaudily dressed fighter,\"killed the Sun named Moon.\" Now both humans and robots are on the brink of extinction. \\n\\n\r\nThe robots hadn't appreciated their lives until death became a reality for them. Having been immortal up until the Ruin, being confronted with the realization that their existence would soon end terrifies them. For some, particularly the humanoid robots, this fear is quelled by love, community bonds, or passionately engaging in an interest. For others, this fear is expressed violently through random acts of desperation and senseless cruelty. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone except Casshern is affected by the Ruin. As the bodies of the other robots quickly deteriorate, Casshern's body remains new, and regenerates when it\u2019s damaged. There\u2019s a rumor that the one who \"devours\" Casshern will become immortal. Consequently, when many robots encounter Casshere and learn of his identity, they have no qualms with abandoning their \"humanity\" to seize an opportunity to regain their immortality. \\n\\n\r\nBy the halfway point of this series, listening to bleak soliloquies on death and hope\u2014but mostly hopelessness\u2014became mildly taxing. To be fair, the trepidation expressed by these robots is understandable when we consider how new of an experience death is for them. Humans have had over 200,000 years to develop coping and denial mechanisms for death anxiety. On this level, it's not difficult to feel some pity for the robots. \\n\\n\r\nThere's the occasional melodrama and sentimentality, which is effectively scored with slow strings or an acoustic guitar. You can see the emotional chords that they're trying to pull, but it doesn't take much effort to go along with it if you withhold cynicism. The action scenes are scored more aggressively, often utilizing tremolo strings or heavy horns like those heard in 90s era historical-action films. Sometimes there's no score at all, and the scene is simply textured with the sounds of wind, rain, or debris. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall style is retro by modern standards, which is to be expected from a director who\u2019s been in the anime industry since the 80s. Unfortunately, this old school style is accompanied by some unflattering old school stereotypes that may annoy some viewers. The one unambiguously black character is a lustful degenerate, and the leading female characters are either manipulative or easily love struck. Even Ringo, an overly cute loli robot who looks like a 4-year-old, fawns over Casshern when she first meets him. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins has brilliant ideas and beautiful animation that are hampered by some repetition, occasional missteps in characterization, and what some might consider plot holes. The faults aren\u2019t enough to Ruin the viewing experience, but they do hold it back from being the psychological masterpiece that it could have been. With all that said, I still recommend this series if you're looking for something dark and thoughtful to watch.",

            "content": "CS has been one of those shows that I've seen highly recommended by some while hearing warnings about this or that aspect from others (or sometimes the people that recommended it in the first place). After watching it, I understand why. While I really liked the world/character design, thought the animation was great, and didn't even dislike the story once it made it into the latter half of the series. \r\nI think my personal issue with it is that for a \"slow build\" show, the pace of the writing was just a bit *too* slow, and felt like despite all of that build time itsomehow didn't quite develop the characters and relationships to a point that I felt truly invested in them. I understood them, followed their backstories and connections with each other, and saw how the narrative overall was well put together, it just left me wanting it to have pushed that little bit extra so I could connect with them and really feel the impact of the story. Like I said - the story itself was actually pretty well crafted (though the end left me a little wanting), but if you're not invested in the characters, what's the point? \\n\\n\r\nSide note, my one dislike about the show was the sound design for fights and some other general foley work. While the animation aged *really* well (and at points looked like it could've been made in the past few years rather than 10 years ago), I was always taken out of a slick, well put together fight scene when all of a sudden someone hits something and it sounds like the foley artists just lifted a sound bank from an early 90s Saturday morning cartoon.",

            "content": "This anime is criminally low in score for how good of a show this is. Casshern Sins is truly one of the most excellent television shows you can watch. Be forewarned, this show requires a mature audience. I do not mean the ability to deal with gore, sex, drugs or swear words. It requires maturity on the viewers part to take the time to really look at what the show is presenting to you, and then to digest it and look again. This message is not spoon fed, and you will get out what you\u2019ve taken the time to put in. \r\nStory 9/10: the plotis not simple, but it is also not complex or convoluted. It is fluid, the characters desires change and with that so does the plots direction. As for specifics, I personally dislike reviews that rehash the entire summary when you can read it above, but I will say this. The plot, the characters dialogue, the \u2018cinamatography\u2019, and the animation...they\u2019re all excellent. The team treated this like they were directing a real movie, not some random animated tv show, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: there was a true dichotomy with the art style here. The characters are plain, though extraordinarily well done regardless of this, and flow very wel. Some scenes they\u2019re even more plain as faces are excluded to help convey emotion or hidden meaning. I personally was a huge fan of the character design, though I could see why others might not be, which is why this gets a 9 instead of a 10/10. Contrasting this were the absolutely gorgeous backgrounds. Whether a sea of glass, or a field of flowers, or just endless wastes....everything was eye catching, and there was constantly something going on onscreen becides the characters movement. And the colors. The colors in the show are so vivid. The animation team killed it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: the sound in Casshern Sins, from the voice acting to the sound effects, to the music.... was what truely solidified this as one of the best show's i've seen. While I did really like the plot and the characters, without these voice actors, without this orchestrated sound track.....I don\u2019t think I would be giving this a 9.5/10. Probably would have gotten an 8. The sound... is everything. The attention to detail to the correct sounds for the provided effects was excellent. The voice acting, and the emotion behind it, from the main characters to the run of the mill bad guys, was excellent. The music? Out of this world. And I\u2019m not talking about the two songs specifically produced that everyone is overhyping a bit. The actual music was brilliant. Heart-wrenching. It brought smiles, and it brought tears. It made the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10: the characters were all excellent, no exceptions. From the main cast to the characters showing up for only one episode, to the run of the mill bad guys. Everyone gave it their all, and it made it feel real. Every character in this show is multi-dimensional, and felt like a living breathing person. Every single one. Even some of the cannon fodder in a few episodes. That\u2019s how seriously they took it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a show flesh out each and every character this well, while also having the voice actors fit the characters so well. And I doubt I\u2019ll see it again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 (personal 10/10): I cannot give this a 10/10 on enjoyment despite how excellent everything was, as I know this show will not resonate with everyone. It requires patience. It requires introspection into the characters and yourself. What do I mean by this? You realize early on that while some robots in this show are what you are expecting, others mimic humans. And once you realize that while the cast is mostly robots, they act like humans...the entire show takes a much more serious time within you. \\n\\n\r\nI watched this in three sittings. Episodes 1-8, 9-15, and 16-24. Both times I went to continue watching on my second and third times, it was with trepidation and a heavy heart, because I knew what I was getting into. And yet, despite this, watching Casshern Sins feels rewarding. I feel relieved, and saddened that it is over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10. There were some issues. Some minor writing style stuff I disagreed with and I did not like one of the main ish characters (Dune). But this truly is a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, the fight scenes in Casshern Sins are some of the finest I\u2019ve seen. The reason for this is because the animation team went out of their way to try and obey the laws of physics for most of the fights. Characters move, and fall, like they should. The best example I can give, is in one fight Casshern gets slugged in the face while he\u2019s in the air moving toward his opponent. Instead of rocketing backwards like every other anime with a fight scene, he instead follows the trajectory of the fist, and ends up doing a half flip in the air and lands on the ground, without moving backwards even a foot. I wish more studios would do this honestly, it made for much better viewing.",

            "content": "*contains spoilers*\r\nI like post apocalyptic settings. I like action. I like wit and creative and critical outlooks on life. I do not like the show however, even though it has all those. Surprising, right?\r\nNow, let's have a glance at how this comes to be? First of all - the story and characters. The story is rather shallow and vague, masking its flaws with volume, passing characters (that die off or are never seen again even if they live), tons of conversation (most of which is pointless and repetitive, to the point a lot of characters could be one and the same), and philosophical questions (thatit asks and doesn't even attempt to answer or even poke at). Secondly the pacing. Now although slow (something i really don't like), it would be pretty tolerable in this show, if not for the other problems that is. Characters. Most of them are pretty one dimensional, and forgettable, not to mention that they are not very believable in most cases too. The art and sound are also pretty mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the consistency of the story and the message its trying to relay is very shaky, changing a few times, and in the end failing to properly put out the points its trying to make nearly all the time, down to the very end. Its also littered with plot holes and incomplete pictures (for example, it speaks of, and shows humans at a few points, but forgets all about them, not really telling how they fit in the world or if they can live on (despite this probably being a yes due to nothing changing much for them, and the soil being fertile). A lot of detail is also left in the shadow, fore example you can't tell for a few characters if they are humans or robots, or something in between, and a lot of other important details too)\\n\\n\r\nFinal word - i would probably not recommend watching this to anyone, instead, i would recommend the anime \"Plastic memories\", as it has a similar message, but is far more emotional, believable, colorful, and to the point.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is a thoughtful, violent, and dark reboot of the 1973 series Shinzou Ningen Casshern that examines the question of what give our lives value.\r\nThe show begins with the amnesiac protagonist Casshern feeling depressed after being told that he caused \"The Ruin,\" which created the post-apocalyptic world that this series takes place in and is the reason that robots, which were previously immortal, can now die. The first half of the series is largely composed of episodic stories of Casshern searching through the ruined world for robots who still live for something despite their impending death, and in each of these robots, Casshern findsbeauty. The problem with this is that the first half of the show feels very repetitive. Each episode focuses on a new character with a different life story, but Casshern ends up learning the same thing at the end of each episode, which is that there is still beauty in the world despite the ruin. It's incredibly simple and doesn't need to be stated more than once, but the entire first half of the show is spent tell that to the viewer again and again. The pacing is incredibly slow and despite lengthy conversations between characters, they say very little of substance. Because the entire first half of the show is incredibly slow, repetitive, and generally just lacking substance, it genuinely feels like the show is wasting your time. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the actual plot starts to pick up in the latter half of the series, and I think it does a decent job of synthesizing the ideas of the first half in a meaningful way to contribute to the show's over all themes, but that doesn't justify the fact the the beginning of the show outright wastes your time. By the end of the show Casshern, who was previously a blank slate, comes to have his own beliefs and ideals and concludes that the existence of death forces people to live their lives to the fullest. It isn't a particularly original idea, but it's executed competently through all of the different encounters Casshern has with dying robots. Despite that, this show really has no right being 26 episodes. I think the same story could have easily been told in 13 episodes without wasting any of the viewer's time. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue in Casshern Sins is another major problem in my opinion. Whenever Casshern meets a new robot, they basically just dispense their philosophies and motives to him in the most prosaic way possible. While I understand that this is done so a character's story can be told in a single episode, it's done in the most unrealistic and uninteresting way possible. Not only is the fact that these characters would be having such personal conversations with a complete stranger unbelievable, but the way that the characters speak also feel heavily scripted and unnatural. While I guess this is sufficient for simply divulging information about the character to the viewer, it lacks artistry and isn't engaging at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's any aspect of Casshern Sins that is wholly positive it is the soundtrack. Overall, it sounds more akin to something I would hear in a Hollywood movie than in a seasonal anime and there is no shortage of memorable tracks. Because so much of this show is just shots of characters standing around contemplatively staring at blue dirt, you really get to appreciate this anime's great OST.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, I think this anime makes great use of its cold color palette to depict its dying, ruined world. In other a small handful of episodes the colors can be incredibly vibrant to emphasize that there is still beauty in the world in spite of the ruin. As is the case in a lot of shows made by Madhouse, the animation in the first episodes is of noticeably higher quality to hook the viewer in, but as the series goes on, it makes more use of still frames and stock footage to pad things out. Taken as a whole, the animation in this series is just fine.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I spent most of this review criticizing Casshern Sins,  I rated it as highly as I did because of its great soundtrack and more focused latter half. Even though I enjoyed watching this show about as much as I enjoy getting my teeth pulled, I can't say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think Casshern Sins would appeal to those who like similar atmospheric, philosophical, and slow-paced anime like Ergo Proxy and maybe Texhnolyze. While I typically enjoy shows like that, Casshern Sins missed the mark for me.",

            "content": "My appraisal:\r\nThis is a maturely self-assured series that- at the expense of its commercial marketability- transcends genres in order to successfully establish itself as an expressionistic, philosophical piece on how we should treat life.\r\nThe production committee have taken the overused, protestive scenario of the human race\u2019s ever-increasingly rapid developments leading to their own downfall and used it as the mere foundations on which to build a world they can freely manipulate. Through subsequently deciding to not dwell on logistical issues while altering the landscape (and to a lesser extent the art style) to convey the current emotive themes, a guided journey of spiritual discovery isthen formed. As it is very abstract in its approach though the series neglects to fully expand on the sparse premise and instead overstates its most immediate aspects. However enough defining shots and scenes are shown as a wide variety of characters struggle for their beliefs in a highly strained setting for this to still easily linger in your mind long after its completion and quite possibly even change your outlook on life for the better.",

The only question I really have is about the soundtrack.

So well, got introduced to this wonderful\r\nseries by a friend of mine.\r\nCasshern Sins is not pretty much what it looks like if you\u2019re seeing this picture for the first\r\ntime. It is not the usual action adventure shounen-esque series you watch, but a very deep\r\npsychological series. The plot \u2013 The world is in ruin. Robots are rusting (dying) everywhere unable to repair\r\nthemselves. Signs of Human are rarely seen, which ensure their extinction. As despair\r\nconsumes the heart of everyone there is onewho is to blame for all the happenings :\\n\r\nCasshern, who killed Luna, the Sun that was named Moon. Struck with amnesia as seen in\\n\r\nthe beginning of the series, Casshern walks into a journey remembering the sin he\\n\r\ncommitted.... Each episode, for the most part, explores a different aspect of humanity, usually regarding\\n\r\nhope and despair. They end up giving away moments of vain hope, enraging emotions\\n\r\ntransformed into love, rarely having scenes of unfettered rage. The first fair half of episodes\\n\r\nare quite dull regarding the number count and how long they tried tried dragging it, makes\\n\r\nmore reasons to why it isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Whereas the second explores a mystery\\n\r\nabout how even the most unlikely chance at life can bring out the ugliest in anyone, the emotional impact creates such unrelenting momentum that these roadblocks do nothing to\\n\r\ndeter anyone from the end.\\n\r\nFight scenes, at first it\u2019s not hard to expect a depressing setting with some above average,\\n\r\nalbeit grizzly, fight scenes. However in the very next moment it turns into an introspective\\n\r\npiece, symbolical. Just as how the very emotional depth that can be drawn from a single blue\\n\r\nflower (As seen in the series) is uncanny, especially as it becomes an unusual personification of death, and as the glimpse of rust on the cheek of a Robot or the emptiness in their eyes\\n\r\nbring out the terror of death as a monster which devours on every being.\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, this is one series hard to categorize. It is stands in it\u2019s own as a\\n\r\nmasterpiece of artistic integrity. But then again tastes may vary, as this definitely is not\\n\r\neveryone\u2019s cup of tea.",

            "content": "Anime: Casshern Sins\r\nTitle: Satisfying But it's missing something. \r\nAbout the Anime: In a dark future, the world is in ruin and everything is slowly crumbling away into dust. Humanity is almost extinct, while robots desperately seek out new parts to replace their rusting bodies. Their only hope for survival is to devour the one known as Casshern\u2026 or so they believe. Meanwhile, Casshern himself has lost all memory of his past. Why are these robots attacking him? Did he really kill the one known as Luna; the Sun that was called Moon? And why is he, alone, unaffected and undamaged by the ruin?\r\nStory 5/10: Despitebeing a remake to a kitschy 70\u2019s anime \u201cclassic,\u201d Casshern Sins begins promisingly. In the first few episodes, the creators lay out a post-apocalyptic setting that manages to feel both unabashedly retro and grimly bleak at the same time. The resulting mix of camp and angst is weirdly intriguing, especially when the solid supporting characters and mysterious titular protagonist are factored in.\\n\r\nSadly, Casshern Sins fails to live up to its initial promise due to its unfocused overarching narrative. Rather than develop any core theme in the early to middle stages, the series meanders among flavor-of-the-week plots and half-hearted attempts at a main story. After countless thematically tangential episodes, the anime barely has room to resolve its main plotline and is forced to squeeze a half-hearted conclusion into the final few episodes. The final episodes seem to assert that death is needed to make life worth living. However, the distracted narrative and conflicting themes beforehand causes this moralizing to feel hollow and unconvincing by the time the creators decide to tack it to the end. At the end of the series, Casshern Sins doesn\u2019t feel like it was ever actually about anything, and this is perhaps its greatest flaw.\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s plot is further diluted by lame fight scenes that lack context or relevance. In many occasions, a group of mooks will simply appear in the middle of an episode to suicidally impale themselves on Casshern\u2019s foot. These scenes appear to have been inserted to please the action junkies, but the problem is that Casshern Sins tries to be something more than just another shounen action show. By mixing mindless action with serious science-fiction, the anime fails to appeal to fans of either.\\n\r\nStill, in spite of all these weaknesses, the series is not without merit. Casshern Sins\u2019 main strengths lie not in the actual meat of the plot, but in the assorted one-shot episodes that pepper the overarching narrative. While they disrupt the flow of the actual story, many of the disjointed plotlines are well-written enough to be entertaining in their own right. Granted, not all of the self-contained stories are good, but others are genuinely compelling. This alone prevents Sins\u2019 story from being an outright failure.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10: Fortunately, Casshern Sins has an excellent idea of what it wants to look like, if not what it wants to be about. Put simply, the style of the series' dystopian setting is wonderful. Casshern Sins uses carefully chosen color schemes and crisp animation all to great effect, and the final visual package is one of the most impressive I've seen this year. A particularly impressive aspect of the visual package is the dramatic use of light in just about every scene. It's not Makoto Shinkai obsessive, but the shadows drawn across the hero's face do a lot to darken the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: Voice acting as a whole is uneven. The protagonist\u2019s seiyuu is so hideously terrible that I genuinely wondered if he was trying to sound wooden on purpose, while some of the supporting roles turn in excellent work. On the other hand, the background music is almost universally excellent. The music grimly underscores the anime\u2019s bleak mood without ever becoming a distraction. The soundtrack\u2019s one flaw is its frequent repetition, but this never becomes too much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's 3.5/10: In addition to the haphazard plot and the hamfisted ending, the creators botch the characterization on nearly every major player in the show. Casshern himself is the most egregious example; his deadpan voice acting, terrible dialogue and unconvincing development combine to form one of the most ineffective protagonists that I've ever seen. Dio and Leda, the two main villains, are almost as bad; not only are their motivations left woefully unexplained, they're just flat-out boring characters.\\n\r\nFortunately, some of the supporting characters fare better; Lluyze in particular is a welcome exception to the bad characterization. Casshern Sins dedicates an entire episode to dissecting her psyche in a weird and decidedly Freudian fashion, and the result is arguably the highlight of the show. Sadly, she is a comparatively minor character and simply can't carry the show on her own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10: Overall, I enjoyed myself as I was watching and in particular liked the one-shot episodes, which at times evoke the amazing work done in Kino's Journey. However, the turgid overarching narrative, the bad characters and the incompetent ending make me wonder if these scattered episodes were enough to make the series actually worth my time.\\n\r\n~WhiteBakemono",

He is a man with a troubled past, andthe people who he meets touch his life to make him a \"better\" person. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a low rating on sound, mostly cause I had to include the \"lack of\" element.

Its deep and post-apocalyptic theme dragged me into the series that if you are not a fan of those post-apocalyptic setup stories, I suggest you to skip it but if you are a fan of those series that is something to do with redemption, I suggest you should give this show a try.\r\nAt the end of the day, if you are like me who learnedthat Friender could transform into a jet in the original, you will be disappointed because the series tries its best to stay as believable as possible. This is a good thing now that most of the films right now focused more on trying its best to explore in the real world while trying to pull some fantasy elements on it.\\n\\n\r\nFor my full review (Brief comparison with the original series with Sins, and etc.), you can go into this link: http://orendsrange.blogspot.com/2010/09/redemption-casshern-sins-review.html",

            "content": "Casshern Sins doesn't hide what it wants to convey. Right in the tagline, it says \"Death is the salvation of man and machine\". The show tries to tell us that one cannot have life without death. The whole series revolves around this idea, and, while overall a very simple idea, the show does this fairly well. That's not to say this message was without fault. There were many contradictions to this idea throughout the series, which may make its message fall flat. Even so, this show was still great, and here's why.\r\nStory-wise, the show is very slow-moving for a while, and it seems to begoing nowhere. Until about the mid-teen episodes, the show is more one-episode adventuresque, meaning that each episode is its own standalone story. These, while sometimes interesting and entertaining, make the show seem to drag on, and some may outright give up on the show before it gets interesting, which is in the teens, when the story becomes the main focus. In the end, the story ends well with Casshern's goal being fulfilled, however what that goal is and what I mean by fulfilled I'll keep secret, to avoid spoilers.\\n\r\nCharacter wise, this show is amazing. Every character is well fleshed out, even the unimportant ones. Casshern himself seems to suffer a lot of personal conflict, as, despite being an invincible nearly-immortal fighting machine, he wants to die, and doesn't want to kill. He can't stand all of the fighting in the world, and just like all of us, wants peace and happiness. He works to achieve this as time passes, all the while trying to remember his past, as he's an amnesiac, which, while an overdone idea, is done fairly well here. All the other characters are well fleshed out too, and very interesting, but I can't help but think that some of the antagonists, particularly Dio and his partner, were ultimately useless, pointless additions....Ah well....\\n\r\nThe art in the show is unique and gorgeous. It's very smooth and shining, and somehow successfully portrays a dying world in a beautiful manner. Everything looks unique, and yet, the show also seems to look classic at the same time. Look a pictures and you might see what I mean.\\n\r\nThe music was relatively good, with the exception of the opening song, which was annoying. The music is often very sad, mixing well with the atmosphere of the show, and it can easily make things even more dramatic and sad when \"that one song\" is sung. You'll know what I mean if you watch it.\\n\r\nAs I watched this on Toonami, I think it's safe to say this show has a great dub. The actors did splendidly. Especially Casshern and Lyuze.\\n\r\nOverall, this show is fairly interesting, and certainly amazing, however its not for everyone. It's a little slow moving, and it takes a while for it to really pick up, but once it gets there, its well worth the work of watching all those pointless episodes. It's a fairly short series, so it's not too troublesome. All in all, a great show, but not for the action hungry, though the action that is in this show is extremely brilliant and well-choreographed, though sometimes a little hard to see.\\n",

            "content": "Journeys are funny things. As the old cliche goes, \"It's not the destination that matters, but the journey\". That being said, sometimes the destination isn't what a person thinks it will be, as is the case for humanoid robot Casshern, a being with eternal life in a world ravaged by the apocalypse. Now, let's look to see if Casshern's journey is one worth taking.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of Casshern Sins is one that begins with a protagonist without memories. As he embarks on a journey for answers, this robot, Casshern, is confronted with the cold reality of death everywhere he travels. Some try to escape death,while others live their lives to the fullest as they accept their demise. The overall story of the series serves to tie together different adventures along Casshern's journey. Every so often, details about the origin of the Ruin are unearthed, placed carefully to keep the overall plot momentum. Character back stories, struggles against death, dynamic battle scenes and tender moments all blend together to create a world of life in the face of death. Unexpected surprises await the cast as they wander from place to place but the end result is one that is both appropriate and humbling. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this series is both an achievement and a pitfall. It remains consistent throughout, allowing characters to get their time in the spotlight. Every episode also has a balance of action and conversation to keep, allowing the audience to fall into a rhythm. However, the show takes its time, as if slowly unrolling a painting, showing the picture at a calm pace. Because of this slow pace, each episode feels longer than it truly is. This leaves the pacing in a quandary: any faster and the story would have seemed rushed, yet as it is, it can seem a bit too slow for some. For this reason, it's up to the viewer themselves to choose whether or not this is a problem. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art captures the dark mood and intensity the story requires. The stylized appearances of characters like Casshern and Dio contrasts with the barren metallic wasteland they live in. Each character has their distinct look, allowing them stand apart from their other robotic brethren. The action scenes, although sometimes brief and repeated, use varying views, image lines and the environment in general to illustrate gruesome struggles of robotic dominance. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening uses stills in a kind of picture montage that goes well with the music. In an age of moving openings, it's stiffness seems a tad out of place. However, it is this stiffness that sets it apart from other openings and makes is appropriate for the tone of the series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting are among the strongest parts the show. The music captures the harrowing tone of death and the despair it can induce, with no preppy beats to be found. The BGM is timed nicely and changes when necessary. One track in particular, a song named 'A Path', is a bitter sweet song, played during some of the more powerful scenes. The opening, Aoi Hana, complements the opening animation, captures the blend between action and drama and is overall quite appropriate. The 4 endings vary in quality. The first ending, Reason, is nice for its place in the series, as it follows Casshern's initial journeys in his world. The second ending, Aoi Kage, only follows one episode and seems out of place in the mostly atmospheric OST. In my opinion, it sounded like it belonged in Casshern's original series. The third opening is yet another calming track that shows internal struggles within the characters and serves as a perfect fit for it's designated arc. The last ending for the final episode is A Path, the song I mentioned earlier. It's a versatile track, serving as both a good background piece and a nice ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is illustrated through a great vocal cast. The sub is good, so those who are looking for the original actors need not worry. However, the dub is among the best dubs in recent memory. Eric Vale as Casshern (think Trunks from Dragonball Z) takes his acting to the next level, delivering the controlled ferocity and wholehearted determination that his role calls for. Brina Palencia also does a good job as Lyuze, with her performance only getting better from her first scenes. Jerry Jewell is an interesting choice for Dio but ends up doing a masterful job portraying Dio's subtle insanity. There are more examples, proving that different voice actors can redefine characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, this is show about characters and the way they deal with death, making it very character driven. To preserve the enjoyment of discovering the characters, I'll keep this brief. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern: A young man who starts off as an amnesiac protagonist but matures into a person who understands the impact of death in the lives of the living. \\n\\n\r\nLyuze: A sister to one of the guardians of the Sun named Moon, Lyuze seeks out Casshern, for more reasons than one. \\n\\n\r\nDio: Another robot who seeks out Casshern to validate his own existence. \\n\\n\r\nOuji and Ringo: A pair of adventurers who meet with Casshern on a number of occasions, their fates becoming ever more tightly bound to his. \\n\\n\r\nAssorted Robots and side characters: Each episode places Casshern in a new situation. A person (or group of people) who is facing their impending doom tries to live their lives how they want. Some descend into madness, while other find inner peace. While the names of individuals might not stick with viewers, their legacies live on in Casshern and the other characters, changing them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is a slow series that takes it's time. Each character gets the respect they deserve and no episode is wasted. While the pacing has the potential to be a problem, those who make the long journey will not be disappointed. With powerful action scenes and simple yet effective dialogue, fans who want the best of both worlds are sure to find something to love in the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\r\nCasshern Sins is an example of a journey well traveled. It may seem to drag at times, but it's never boring. Instead of soaking the entire series in a melodramatic tale, the story skillfully peppers various adventures before reaching a satisfying destination. The art is stylized with impactful action scenes, dark environments and notable character designs. The sound is a key aspect of portraying the series' themes and with an OST that hits the right notes and voice acting that defines characters into unique individuals, Casshern has an auditory substance that few modern series can match. The main characters are relatable and mature along with the audience, exhibiting that even in times of death, people can still grow. If you're ready for the long journey, Casshern Sins is a show you won't regret.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is yet another anime that I would place in the genre of philosophical. What do I mean by that? Well, it's a show that is incredibly slow. It's full of questions, some answers, and metaphors that deal with what it means to be human. \r\nThe story here isn't all too unique, but it doesn't have to be. We pretty spend the entire series following Casshern on his quest to find out about his past. During his journey, he meet several characters. Some of them are friendly and others are not too nice. There are a few fight scenes here and there, yet, notenough to warrant calling this an action anime. I would argue that Casshern Sins is almost as slow as Texhnolyze. Not quite as slow, but very close. Most of Casshern Sins is a lot of talking. Some may find this quite boring, but I was always fascinated by the characters Casshern met and what they had to say. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Casshern Sins is dark. Because of this, there aren't a lot of bright colors. The world is as gloomy as the themes of the series. Most of the series takes place on barren landscapes - similar to what you might think of when you watch Dragonball Z, but with a higher budget. It's beautiful to look at. I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's gothic. I'd probably be more on board with post apocalyptic. Characters have a fairy-tale look to them. Some of them have big anime eyes and others seem more robotic due to the current events in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nothing to write home about. They aren't bad or good. I barely remember them and I've seen the series, in full, two times. With that said, the soundtrack used in each episode is really good. Sadder pieces are played for parts that get dark. Action pieces are used for battles and work well. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern is a very flawed character. The more he learns about his past, the more it haunts him as we get closer and closer to the finale. He's someone who seems to want friends, but never goes out of his way to get such things from the various people he meets. At times, Casshern can be determined and egotistical, but he can also be thoughtful and warm. I wish I could talk about a number of other characters, but I feel that would enter spoiler territory, so I won't. All I'll say is this - everyone that Casshern meets is unique and interesting in their own way. There wasn't one character who I thought was a waste, despite how many appear in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis is very slow series. If you can handle a show that is full of philosophy, and has very few action scenes, you'll probably get something out of Casshern Sins. If not, it'd probably be best to skip the entire series. After the first episode, you'll know if Casshern Sins is right for you. It's definitely not for everyone, but those who enjoy it will be fulfilled with a wealth of interesting questions about life, death, and the human condition.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins feels like watching two different shows at once. I like the first half, not so hot on the second.\r\nThe First half is a very Samurai Jack-esque formula and for those of you who haven't seen Samurai Jack what I mean by that is a lone warrior (in this case Casshern) thrown into a world he doesn't fully understand (because he has amnesia in this instance) while meeting interesting one-off characters every episode. It's less about the story itself and about exploring this world and the different ways everyone deals with what is basically the robot apocalypse (and the world is already pretty messedup to begin with). My favorite episode is probably episode 2, which is about a community of robots that decide to peacefully accept their death until...well obviously I'm not gonna spoil it but it gives great insight into the tragedy of our main character: Casshern.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern is an interesting character, at the beginning of the series  we learn that he's an amnesiac robot. The only three things he knows for sure is that A: He is the one who caused the ruin (that robot apocalypse I talked about earlier) B: His name is Casshern. And C: Most robots believe that if they kill and consume him that they'll then become immortal and able to withstand the ruin. As he ventures across the landscape his character arc revolves around him learning and coming to terms with the fact that he's a killing machine.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a host of side characters including: Ringo: An optimistic little girl robot. Ohji: The Robot Engineer that watches over Ringo like a parent or guardian. Lyuze: A female robot who vows revenge against Casshern since he apparently caused her sister's death. Friender: Just an awesome robot dog. He's the Rush to Casshern's Megaman, that's all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\n\"So you like the formula that the show's using and there's a host of interesting side characters, so why did you say that you only liked half of the series?\" I hear you cry. Well that's where the second half of the series comes in.\\n\\n\r\nAbout halfway through the show the writers suddenly remembered that they had a plot and decided to focus on that, this is where the show falls apart. Not everything is explained and the things that are aren't explained well. The main premise of the show aka the fact that there's \"The Ruin\" that's killing robots is going on isn't even all that well explained. The Ruin is just...the robots rusting until their body parts and insides start deteriorating. And that sucks but...did that not happen before? Were these robots literally immortal before that? Never explained. And it's like this for most plot points, it's vaguely explained but never really delved into, especially when it comes to the Luna situation. Why did killing her specifically make the ruin happen, what was special about her? (This isn't a spoiler by the way.) Why can Friender withstand the ruin? This isn't a spoiler or a reveal, he can just do that...deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the Animation and Sound Design are great, the actions scenes are pretty damn smooth. But I've never been all that critical of Animation or Sound design anyway so don't take my word on that part.\\n\\n\r\nDespite I this I still think the show is overall worth it. The first half more often than not makes up for the lackluster second half, with it's interesting one-off characters and self contained stories about people's unique reactions when confronted with an inevitable death. It's just a shame that most of the intrigue of the first half is wasted so badly.",

            "content": "This anime caused me a headache, especially when wondering if I should review it or not. After all, my opinion was changing with every episode, and quite drastically most of time. Hence why this review will be fairly short in comparison to my usual walls of text.\r\nThe very first seconds of the anime made me cringe. The drawing style. Oh, at this very early stage I could tell the series will equal a torture for I'm very sensitive when it comes to art. It got me wondering how did I end up having Casshern on my planning-to-watch list at all. First, I tried to justifyit being old, as the style resembles ol' good mecha animes television was filled with when I was little. But checking the dates on MAL told me the anime was not /so/ old. Did it try to mimic those old animes, being based on one? Was such style chosen to set the atmosphere? I don't even care, as I found the art horrible and no excuse would fix it. Sorry, old school fans. It goes back to my childhood and mecha animes on television that I completely detested.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, my opinion about mechas had not changed ever since, and so the beginning for the first episode nearly made me cry out loud, again wondering how did this thing sneak into my sacred list of animes I'm yet to find. The second thought was making a relation to Power Rangers. Don't ask, I don't even know. But I've buckled up, mostly led by my OCDs that suggest I complete every anime I start, and carried on. First few episodes were making me acknowledge the problem I have, as I swear, watching this anime was very difficult for someone like me. But eventually I started getting deeper into it. I enjoyed a concept of few small stories, especially about the girl who loved to fight. That very episode was the breaking point for me, when I finally started understanding the anime was not as simple as I thought and there were a lot of messages hidden along the lines. This is when I started paying more attention to the things said rather than how they were drawn. Although, I admit, I struggled with the art for the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was alright. I can't say I was particularly fond of any of the soundtracks, but they did not irritate me either. As I've watched the subbed version, I had a grip of the translations of both, opening and ending lyrics, which, I'd say, matched the theme of the anime itself. That's a plus, really - most of time lyrics of the soundtracks are hardly related to the series. The tracks within the anime itself were well timed and suited the situations. But that's pretty much all I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were truly the best thing about Casshern Sins. The mains were given a proper development, as much as it was possible with not too many episodes. The supporting characters that Casshern would encounter once and never again were the ones that deserve all of my praises. They were a living example of the struggles we all go through at some point of our lives, offering to see how do our feelings and actions differ from how we see them and how do others perceive them. Although, they were being shaped as the robots and were hidden in tangles of metaphors not everyone can make out, therefore this anime is meant for the audience that likes to think. Otherwise, it will leave an impression of a weird and incoherent anime that makes no sense. I especially loved the concept of Luna and how the world perceived her existence and how that perception differed from her own. Again, for the ones who expected some mecha fights that require no second thought it'd make no sense, but if viewed as a piece that requires deep insights, Luna's phenomenon leaves you thinking about yourself and the world for a long time after you finish the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's still difficult to say how do I feel about this anime. It was a difficult watch, mostly because of my preferences in regards of art and not being a fan of mechas and post-apocalyptic settings. I did enjoy it to some extent, that's for sure. But in the same time I was not drawn in enough to stop noticing things that bugged me and occasionally I'd start regretting giving the series a go all over again. \\n\\n\r\nOverally, I must say Casshern Sins is definitely a good anime that makes you think. It wasn't as action packed as I thought it will be, but I'm only grateful for that. If not for the deep ideas it harboured, I'd have a REALLY bad time watching it. Now, time would go past a bit faster as I'd be spotting the subliminal messages and decoding them. I guess I was mostly getting put off when those things were lacking.

            "content": "Casshern Sins is a very unique and impressive anime. However, it's not for everyone. It's slow paced and it tends to drag throughout some of the episodes, the storyline is slightly confusing, and at times it doesn't make sense. But it deals with philosophical subjects and the episodes are very thought-provoking. \r\nStoryline: 8\r\nLike I said before, Casshern Sins is slow paced and it tends to drag throughout some of the episodes. The story itself is very good, and even at the end of the series you are left with several questions. Are Luna and Casshern truly immortal? What exactly are Dio, Leda, Luna, and Casshern(are they robots, humans, or something else entirely)? How did Luna cause the Ruin?\\n\\n\r\nIt definitely leaves you thinking.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the way they incorporated philosophical themes within the episodes. It dealed with the subject of Life and Death in an interesting way, and it really helped to impact the mood. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that started to get annoying after a while was the number of times they kept saying \"Casshern\". The dialogue itself was very simple and easy to follow, and the way they talked about the Life and Death themes was emotional and impacting. \\n\\n\r\nIt did have its fair share of plot holes, and even some of them weren't solved at the end. Where did the colored stone fit into all of this? Why does Friender seem immune to the Ruin? These are just some of the many unanswered questions viewers were left with at the end of Casshern Sins. \\n\\n\r\nIf there would have been a few more episodes, perhaps the plot holes could have been fixed and the questions could have been answered. And maybe the ending would have ended better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI must say, the art style for Casshern Sins is absolutely astounding! Each character is designed in his/her own unique way. Despite the fact that it's set in a ruined, dying world, the background is beautiful. There are a lot of bold lines in the art style and the graphics are AMAZING! They put a lot of emphasis on Dio, Leda, and Casshern's beauty. Madhouse did an excellent job with designing everything, they definitely made the art unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound for Casshern Sins was perfect! The music they used with the episodes fit extremely well and it helped a lot with the emotional scenes. I actually found myself downloading the music they used for the episodes and the ending themes. They were also\\n\r\n careful not to overdo the sound effects, they kept it simple and real. The voice actors did an amazing job with the English dub, (though I did find Ringo's voice annoying at times). You could feel the emotion in their voices, which is something that not all English dubs have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI found myself falling in love with all of the characters; whether they were the protagonists, antagonists, or the one-shot characters. They were very well thought out and each and every one of their appearences had an impact on the storyline. Even the characters that started out as dull and boring, soon become well fleshed out as the storyline progressed. Each individual character had their own natural flaws which made them differ from one another. However, I really think they could have done a bit more with Ringo's development. She is portrayed as a cheerful, innocent little girl in the midst of the Ruin. But it seemed that they kept emphasising her innocence a bit TOO much. They could have also done a bit more work with Casshern as well. \\n\\n\r\nLuna's change in personality is surprising. At first, she is presented as a saviour; the answer to everything. Though it didn't show much about her past, it seemed as if she was a quiet, kind person. When she came back, however, she was completely different. She was disgusted with the idea of death (even though she originally gave it), and she became a selfish, uncaring person. But it seems reasonably, she did die after all.\\n\\n\r\nLeda seemed dull and boring at the beggining of the series, and she didn't have much development. She just seemed like a selfish, vain woman with a lust for eternal life. But as the story progressed, her character became better developed. It turns out she wasn't always like that, she was actually a kind, gentle person.  But the loss of her child changed who she was. In the end, all she really wanted was another chance at life, another chance at being a mother again. She was one of the characters that I truly fell in love with, and she was also one of the few that left a huge impact on me at the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime, and through its ups and downs, it never ceased to amaze me. The characters each left an impact on me, and even though the storyline wasn't the best, it was still pretty Damn good. If you ever get a chance to watch this anime, let me just say that you wouldn't regret it.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is at times a masterpiece, and at times barely tolerable. Maybe that's a weird way to start a review for an anime I'm ultimately going to give a pretty good score to, but you need to know right now.\r\nThe story begins on what I could consider a very interesting (if painstakingly slow) note. Casshern wakes up in a world that has barely survived some kind of apocalypse. He's set upon by robots trying to kill him and even eat him, blaming him for the world's end and in some cases believing that consuming him will grant them immortality. He, in fairly common animefashion, remembers nothing and finds all of this incredibly shocking. Nonetheless, he is an efficient and remarkable killing machine and is frequently able to easily defend himself from these attacks as he wanders the wasteland. But why is there a wasteland? Why are so many robots after him? What happened to humanity? What is The Ruin, and why is Casshern immortal and immune to it?\\n\\n\r\nThese (and more) are all questions that are slowly, SLOWLY answered over the course of the 24 episodes. And in case I wasn't clear enough, I mean SLOWLY. Casshern Sins moves at a snail's pace, if that snail had to constantly stop and ask for directions. But surprisingly, this works to the series' strength at times. The visuals are stunning and the anime does a terrific job of totally immersing you in the world you're given. Speaking of, that world is bleak an unrelenting. Happy endings are scarce in Casshern Sins, and the ones that do come are still often more bitter than sweet. But in my opinion, this works. And while Casshern's character does frequently devolve into \"staring at hands and wracked with guilt,\" seeing the world through his eyes makes for an interesting reveal of the apocalypse and a decent narrative. The supporting cast is also surprisingly well-developed - Lyuze, Oji and the villains Dio and Leda all make for compelling stories of their own. In time, of course. The except to this is Ringo, a pretty annoying cutesy girl character who seemingly serves no purpose. Still, none of this really changes the fact that for a significant portion of the anime, nothing happens. The first season really moves at a crawl that cannot be avoided, no matter how invested you are.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the second season, things REALLY pick up. Not only do Casshern and the gang finally start to make progress towards a real goal on their quest, but a true looming threat begins to approach in the form of Dio and his army. The storytelling also improves significantly, culminating in many memorable episodes. In particular, \"The Glass Cradle\" and \"The Time I've Lived and the Time I Have Left\" are some of my favorite anime episodes of all time. Many things are implied without being outright stated, which I value tremendously. The show uses clever and patient pacing combined with powerful visuals to really bring things to a head, leaving you clamoring for more while also being quite satisfied at the end of episode 23.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the final episode happens. The final episode of Casshern Sins feels like a spit in the face for all the hard work you've done to make it through the anime. It's a bigger betrayal than Brutus stabbing Caesar. I seriously can't believe that somebody, let alone an entire anime production team, decided that episode 24 was a good follow-up to episode 23. It's not just a bad ending. It's a truly horrendous ending that also mars any moral or philosophical conclusions the show might have been able to come to.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is not for everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even for most people. But it does so many things so well that I can't NOT tell people to at least try it. It asks many poignant questions, but ultimately fails to answer them in a satisfying or even interesting way. There are plot points that are also just seemingly forgotten or that truly go nowhere, and again the ending really renders so much invalid. The ending of the story also really drags this anime down. What makes a lot of the emotional moments in the later arc so good is that you really feel you're going to get a conclusion, a light at the end of the tunnel. When that didn't come, I was pissed. I've never finished an anime I enjoyed so much and actually just sat, flabbergasted, throughout an entire final episode while actually saying aloud \"Is this really what's happening? Why?\" And perhaps it seems like I'm harping on the disappointing finale a bit too much. But it truly undermines so much of what makes the show great than I would argue I actually can't stress it enough!\\n\\n\r\nBut whatever. At this point, I can hear you groaning. \"Uggg, NeoSeth, just tell me, is Casshern Sins worth watching?\" Yes. Is it enjoyable? Very, very much so, if you like a slow burning show and can subsist on great visuals and animation for a few episodes. But it's not for everyone, and ends disappointingly. I highly recommend you check it out, but don't be surprised if it breaks your heart (in more ways than one).",

            "content": "If you are familiar with Neon Genesis, then you should probably understand this somewhat of a deconstruction anime which features a sad cruel world worthy of a post anime depression syndrome.\r\nWhile its predecessor was focus on a power ranger plot, this one is a whole different story, in which, the protagonist is wandering in seach for someone in a desolated world. You see a beautiful scenery at times due to its great animation, but this would make you even sadder since there is a lots of variety of deserts and grey colors show throughout to indicate: this is not about happiness.\r\nTo top it off, ithas very good soundtracks which eludes a feeling of hope even though both robots and humans of the world are constantly dying while the ones still living are struggling to survive. This sort of show appeals to me due to its focus on storytelling and a consistent throughout. There are fight scenes, but even these are not as great compare to the popular series of its time. Its mainly the fact that it explores characters desires and goals and in the end, you realized there is not real antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are able to shoulder the emotion of sadness and tragedy while looking for good storytelling, this is one worth watching.",

            "content": "Oh how I've longed for this kind of anime, for a very, very long time. I watched it and while watching it I was like: \"Oooh... that's the spot...\" It managed to get in to my top 5 anime list, and since I'm crazy about harems and fma brotherhood, it's not an easy list to get in. \r\nStory: A humanoid robot killed the sun, and forced doom on earth. Simple. \r\nYea, no. Joking. Much more to it of course. Without giving away spoilers, Under the orders from someone, Casshern killed Luna (Oh the irony, it' the moon), sun of earth, and started the end ofthe world. Rust. Humans have created robots, and robots overthrowed humans long before. And now, they have to die with rust, Casshern's doom. \\n\\n\r\nSummary, Casshern destroyed the world. Yeah. Talk about sins eh? \\n\\n\r\nArt: Wonderful. Only thing that crossed my mind. Backgrounds, fairly detailed, and since it's a wasteland, it'd be a shame if they did not do that. And Casshern... oh god that smoking hot body... don't get me wrong. It's not a bishounen anime. Just... I'll explain it in the character part, since it's related to it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: CS really shines in this department too, since an orchestra was used for the soundtracks. Like Mushishi, I've downloaded most of the OST tracks to my IPod. OP and EP, both suits the mood of the anime. And lyrics makes sense. You know how long it's been since I've watched an anime that's opening song was meaningful? IT'S BEEN VERY LONG. LIKE, REALLY LONG.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Uu baby, talk about development. Let's start with Casshern. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern is... beautiful. He just is. He's beautiful. Elegant. Perfect design. It's not my idea, anime exploits this. They throw this to his face, how beautiful and perfect he is, not a single scratch on his body, and thus, leading to the idea of eating Casshern would grant immortality. \\n\r\nI am a sucker for lonely, sad MC's. Just... maybe I am an evil creature, feeding from despair, but I just do love how they are lonely, and how this is acknowledged by another characters. It hits homerun with this anime. Casshern is -and obviously- lonely. Crushed by his sin. After waking up with a memory loss, every thing on earth tries to kill him. Fighting with these, and fighting with his own mind, struggling to keep his sanity, all mixed up in a journey. God, it's perfect. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern gains consciousness after waking up, thus, a heart. He hates himself, his ability to kill, and everywhere he goes, death follows. He desperately tries to find a way to save the world. \\n\r\nThis is a dark world. A sad, very sad world. Being immortal is not a good thing for his case. Can you imagine everywhere you go, in every corpse, in every ruin, in every rusted body, you see your own sign? And come on, what can you \"do\" to make amends for killing the sun and dooming earth? It isn't something anyone can handle. I pity Casshern. He's without a doubt, one of my favourite MC's of all time, but he is \"the\" destroyer of earth. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern is a kind, thougthful, rush-to-action-to-save-friends type of a man. His struggle for sanity and truth is a must-watch on it's own. But I'm not saying he's perfect. His body is yes, but his thoughts. His melancholy did feel forced for a few. But that's enough for him now.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we have Lyuze. She's someone got very hurt by Casshern's actions, and hates him for it. She refuses to kill him until he finds out what he's done to the world, and waits for him to fall to despair. She is too, one of my favorite MC's of all time. \\n\r\nShe is a good person, lovely one, make you fall in love with her. But her hatred for Casshern is not something to turn a blind eye. She hates his guts. You feel this. After you learn why, you support this. Her actions are completely justified. She's a good character of course, don't get me wrong. \\n\\n\r\nRingo... Uuuh Ringo. She laughs. A lot. That may be her program. She laughs at everything. You'll see what I mean. Other then this, she's like a normal child. \\n\\n\r\nFriender... it's relationship with Casshern is... at best, complicated. I can't say much without spoiling, but he's the best companion Casshern could have. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: This anime was marvelous. Perfect. Tear-jerking. Sad. Dark. Happy. Romantic. Depressing and not depressing. Walking on a very thin line. All at once. I can't begin to tell you how perfect this journey was. Now I know that this won't be a review that reaches to front-page reviews of the anime, but I'd like to give my own opinion about it. Watch it. You can't possibly regret it.\\n",

I have to take it sparingly because it digs deep down into emotional territory that can be weird and scary if you aren't ready for it.\r\nI like stuff that gets me thinking, and what can be deeper than contemplating mortality. \r\nStory- Compelling, deep, and intentionally vague in some areas. I have my own theories about what some of it means, and what things weren't said outright,but those are things best kept to the forums and not a review in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt- This has a really retro-gritty dismal feel that's just amazing. It's beautiful to look at, and I couldn't have asked for more. They really pushed the envelope with this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound- I think the sound track, one song in particular (the song played for the preview at the end of each episode) is just amazing. There was one song that was unmistakably similar to the Terminator theme, but hey, it's hard to write original music without running parallel somewhere.\\n\r\nI preferred the English dub in this one, but both are just outstanding. One of the best dubs I've ever watched. \\n\r\nThe opening theme is strangely upbeat considering the meaning and the rest of the show, but I think that's probably good. You need a splash of cold water in your face sometimes. And it's a refreshing hopeful distraction to help ease the needle in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- I found myself loving a lot of the side and one-off characters. Hell, I liked them all I think. Even the characters I probably should hate, I couldn't. Friggin' Leda tho... Why aren't more people compelled by that character. I feel that her voice in the dub, is amazing. Definitely has a lot of depth conveyed in simple short instances that left me wanting to know more.  Anyway, I could write about the characters, and the inferences all day and night.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Yes.  All of it. From the lowest depressing lows, to the highest triumphant highs, I was compelled, riveted, engaged.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I just love this show. It's hard to recommend it to just anyone, but man, do I wish I could get more people to just sit down and drink this in, and reflect on it. It's a thing of beauty. An animated masterpiece.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is a very unique anime. Like many users said this anime is usually a hit or miss for people. The story is very easy to follow with  beautiful openings/endings/insert songs. The animation style is defined and pale which really set the perfect atmosphere for the anime. Their are a few minutes of fight scenes in each episode which are really different from your typical anime, but different in a good way. Dialogue is very crucial to this anime as it does not really have much action or adventure. The first few episodes are more like short stories which are absolutely beautiful, thenaround halfway the main plot starts to unravel and the story continues on from their. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the show more, but the secound half is still very good. This anime is quite serious with very little to no humour. Both the sub and dub are good, with neither version being more advantageous or better. The story can be summed up as a character named Casshern who has no memory of his past being hated by the rest of the world (mainly comprised of robots), for having apparently killing Luna ( the goddess of life essentially) which is causing \"the ruin\"( basically robots rusting and dying, so they no longer have eternal life, with the exception of Casshern). Casshern progresses throughout the story uncovering parts of his past aswell as learning various lessons about life by observing the joys and sorrows  of characters, caused by \"the ruin\". A very memorable anime that changes you.... in a good way :)",

If you enjoyed these anime then chances are you will like the others as well.\r\nErgo Proxy, Mushishi, Aria (the animation), Kinos Journey (the beautiful world)\r\nNow.. Time for the \"review\"\r\nThis anime is as raw as they come. If you want a slow-paced story of discovery in a world where people have to fight for survival when barely anyone survives, a tale of heroism without a hero and a story where people crave humanity without an ability to find it then this anime is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe following paragraph is a prequel to the anime to give you an idea of the setting. Essentially humans create intelligent life in the way of machines. These \"machines\" become a slave to man, they lived to serve a purpose. That purpose might be to act as children to the wealthy who can't give birth, be used for militaries around the world or simply built to do one job very well. More or less, machines are created and eventually develop a mind of their own and at some point or another became the leading world power ahead of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nBUT... After taking over the world for a few hundred years the cyborgs begin to rust and die when they thought they would live forever.\\n\\n\r\nThis philosophical anime is set in this post-apolopytic world where only a small percentage\\n\r\nof life still remains. Machine are beginning to rust and die while humans are on the brink \\n\r\nof extinction because of the machines hardwired tendency for killing. Both humans and machine alike are just striving to survive. \\n\\n\r\nBut make no mistake, this story is as slow paced as they come. It is about a humanoid called Casshern who cannot die. A man who destroyed the world only to forget he did it. \\n\r\nThe story is based on Casshern and his slow discovery of the horrific things he has done and trying to make amends for the world he has created.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10, Well fleshed out and very symbolic\\n\r\nArt: 8/10, - artistic\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - Quiet and soothing\\n\r\nAmbience: 8/10 - Philosophical\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 - I dont think they're cliche which is a positive\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 - Slow pace, not much dialogue yet theres a lot to think about.\\n\\n\r\nOverrall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite being an incredible show with fantastic character depth, fantastic ambience and a generally fantastic art style, this show failed to really draw me in. The odd action scene I felt only took away from the anime as a whole and didn't do the show justice. There were plenty of plotholes in order to try add more symbolism and could have been improved overrall if more effort was made to try speed up the plot in ways other than out of place action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nBUT Casshern sins is no doubt a fantastic almost unforgettable watch. Has the potential to change your view on the world and open your mind up in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 would watch again",

Well, I definitely enjoyed watching Casshern Sins, though I have to admit, in the beginning it was a little hard to stick with. The whole ambience of the world that is visualized for us in this anime is very gloomy, cold, dystopian. The anime is very slow paced and has long periods without dialogue. It\u00b4s probably a lot easier to watch one episode per day, but of course I needed the full experience and watched episode after episode. Those are all thethings that made the experience... difficult in the beginning. However continuing to watch the anime, the plot and story developed amazingly. Casshern Sins is VERY philosophical. It has been compared to a lot of philosophical shows, it basically discusses the human will to live, as well as a few other things every episode. Since Madhouse produced this anime, it is blessed with amazing art and animation, not to forget music and soundtracks. The anime has one of my favorite endings of all time. It will literally change the way you think, if you haven\u00b4t thought that way already. ;)",

I am actually pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this show is, especially considering that I wasn't as impressed with it at first from what I can remember.  While there are a large number of fight scenes, as a whole they were not very impressive or entertaining.  What this show does have is atmosphere.  Combining a unique and appropriate art style and background music, Casshern Sinscreates a very interesting setting, full of gloom and yet also hope.  It is this somber yet hopeful atmosphere that I found very intriguing.  The characters themselves are also mysterious and intriguing in their own right, in which I looked forward to learning more about them as the series progressed.  The series tries to convey a number of themes and ideals, such as what it means to truly live.  Unfortunately I did find Casshern Sins a little confusing at times, and some of the sci-fi elements are never really explained, which I found disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite those few elements that I wasn't fond of, I still found Casshern Sins to be entertaining, receiving a 7/10 (Good) and a recommendation to at least try out.",

Suddenly \" God\" gets a mention and then the appalling pseudo scratchy live  film footage of what looked like a japanese girl waving her arms above her head - wow- \"high art\"- lol- was that the producers daughter?\r\nBut truly the terrible waste is made apparent by the failure of the music. There's is a rehash of the 3X3 Eyes mystery theme ( a great anime by the way) surely not the same music -i was stunned that it turned out to be the same composer - how about some new ideas... how cheap is that....\\n\r\nLooking at the first version-casshen robot hunter - the opening scene is still striking even though its dated now.And the marvelous narrators  voice over by majel baret (english dub).and many other small jewels.  Overall it  It had an \"X\" factor which Casshern Sins does not. This work is too patchy, some beautiful imagery  but too long,  - a real shame - it leaves you feeling what a waste of resources and writing that ended up out of its depth. It could have been so much better.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is what you get when you get two different cliches' in anime: robot fights, and tear wrenching sadness, and blend them together. While the blend is an interesting original idea, Casshern Sins has a few issues with its plot, flow, and general over-sadness for me to have overly enjoyed.\r\nThis anime is sad. Sad, sad, oh so very saaaaaad. The world of Casshern Sins is in ruin, and by that I mean every city in the series is decaying, both its buildings and its citizens. There is barely any nature anywhere, and the world is swimming with sandstorms. All the robots in the showused to be immortal, but the ruin changed that, and most robots we meet are having various mental stresses trying to deal with imminent death which they didn't have before. Casshern Sins is sort of a zoo exhibit, with each episode featuring a new robot who is sad for one reason or another. Sure it has a core plot, but overall the main strength of the show is in its singular stories within each episode featuring a robot. \\n\\n\r\nThe core plot of the series is iffy. At the start of the show, we're introduced to Casshern, the main hero, who everybody wants killed. It appears that Casshern is actually responsible for the ruin, and robots have spread a rumor that whoever eats Casshern will regain their immortality. Casshern has no memory of what he did to cause the ruin, nor why he did it. He starts off the series as a blank slate, and the various sad robots (and one human) he meets fills him with sympathy, envy, guilt, regret, and other emotions, and help him grow over the series. This original premise is great, but certain later developments of the core plot didn't make sense to me either because I missed something important in the plot, or the plot was just flawed. I'm gonna list the main ones I can recall, but if you don't want any spoilers skip the next section.\\n\\n\r\n1. What exactly happened in the past? Did Luna actually die? What exactly caused the ruin to begin? Exactly why did Casshern do the murder, and where did his amnesia and immortality come from?\\n\r\n2. Was the Luna that shows up later indeed an imposter, or was she genuine? \\n\r\n3. Why does Luna have her powers? It was never really explained why Luna had the ability to repress the ruin, she just did.\\n\r\n4. I more or less missed the explanation of Casshern and Dio. Why isn't Dio as strong as Casshern?\\n\r\n5. Where are all the humans? As far as I recall, there was one human in the entire anime. Are they all dead, and we just witnessed the very last human being ever?\\n\r\n6. In episode 17, they uncover a gem and Ouji seems very excited about it, saying that with it he may be able to reverse the ruin. However, after the episode it's completely forgotten. Ouji comes running back later, looking like he has made progress on the gem, but nope. It's as if the gem erased itself from everybody's memories.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is half pretty and half ugly. While it does have some shiny robot battles that look amazing, most of the time it really doesn't have much to show, except how sad everybody is and how you should also be sad. The world really does look like it's in ruin. It reminds me greatly of the future world in Chrono Trigger, as if the future was ended by an apocalypse. Most things look gray, or as if they're rusting. The anime does have the occasional colorful flower bed, but those only exist to make some sad plot development to make you more sad.\\n\r\nThe BGM is usually slow and humble, making it very forgettable. Most of the time there isn't any BGM at all, probably to emphasize the sadness the show wants to portray. I very much like the opening song a lot, as well as the ending songs Reason and Hikari to Kage. If all other music in the series is forgettable, at least these three songs are wonderful and very good at setting the tone. The English dub is rather unimpressive. Some English lines sound silly, particularly KILL CASSHERN, DEVOUR CASSHERN, which is said all the time! One character in particular, Sophita, sounds dreadful in English. SOPHITA WANTS TO FIGHT YOU! Yeh, just watch with Japanese subs, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nTwo characters in the show are greatly developed throughout, those two being Casshern and Lyuze. These two really carry the show from episode to episode. Casshern starts off completely blank, and at the end he has a clear understanding of what he believes to be right and wrong, important and unimportant, and just and unjust. He develops his own philosophical believes by observing his sad world, and decides for himself what he should do about it. Lyuze starts off as a anger driven woman obsessed with revenge, but over time she changes. She cannot get revenge on a man who has no memory of his crime, and decides to travel with Casshern, and get her revenge once he regains his memory. However, over time, she also observes the sad world with Casshern and changes her beliefs 180 degrees. \\n\r\nAll other characters aren't that important. They either serve a purpose within that episode to make the viewer sad, or they make many appearances to make the viewer sad many times. I do not really understand Luna, Braiking Boss, or Dio very well, which is a shame since they're all so important to the core plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly is the point of all the sadness the anime spews out? Well, it becomes clear, especially in the later episodes, that the point of it all is to convey the life message \"Life is only truly beautiful because it has an end\". This message seems good, but many events in the series work to make this claim weak. Many robots die in vain, never truly able to see how beautiful their lives were. Many don't even understand that they are alive or what it means to be alive. A character says early on \"were we ever even alive to begin with?\" Especially in the last few episodes when a particularly important character dies off from the ruin (when this character had the opportunity to continue living but passed it up), we're left feeling as if this message couldn't be more false, and it would have been better if that character were immortal. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a few very good episodes within, and at least a few of them will make you sad (and a bit existential). The core plot has some issues, but the growth of Casshern is excellent and makes watching this much more enjoyable. The anime has some robot fights, and some are exciting, but most of the time it's really one sided and exists just to be there. If all you want to see is robots fighting, this anime is definitely not for you. The anime's real shine comes from its sad stories, and whether those touch your heart is really up to you. Casshern Sins can be really good sometimes, but most of the time for me it was just alright.",

Casshern Sins falls into the category of the dreaful anime I've watched.\r\nHonestly, this is by far the WORST anime I've ever watched in my life. The story is absolutely terrible, the artwork and animation is painful to even look at, the some of the voice acting is very basic and even terrible for some characters. I knew this anime would be horrible after the first few minutes. Seriously, this anime is about some dude named \"casshern\" who doesn't understand whether he isa robot or a human; and there are these giant robots that are trying to eat him to become immortal. I'm not even joking right now, thats basically what this terrible anime is about. On top of that, the setting sucks! The world and environment they are in is just absolutely terrible. It doesn't capture your interest at all! It's the same boring setting over and over again every horrible scene.\\n\r\nIn the end, this anime is terrible. I wouldn't recommend this to ANYBODY! And any person with even a little bit of a taste in anime would not watch this. The setting sucks, the characters are boring and poorly designed, the voice acting is \"ok\" at times but is also crappy alot of the time in most case for the robots, the story is childish and poorly made up and not to be taken serious at all,  the fights scenes are painful and boring to watch, and overall you will NOT enjoy watching this garbage. Most of the time you won't even understand what is going on! So do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this trash.",

I loved the style and initial premise, and although a lot of people complain about the (slow) pacing of the show that was never an issue for me. \r\nMost of the early episodes were one shot stories that introduced interesting characters, all facing the demise of the world in their own way. The major issues come in the second half of the series where it tries to develop and resolve its overarching plot. \r\nThe progression ofthe story feels like it was written on the fly. I could imagine that there was an initial idea for an interesting setting and protagonist, but no idea what to actually do with them as the story goes on. The result was gaping plot holes, unanswered questions and inconsistent character goals. After the last episode I was left with a very distinct feeling of irritation. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend the first half of the show, but don't expect it all to tie together in the end. It's a pity because if it had been better written, this show could've been something really special.",

They created robots who gained some kind of artificial intelligence over time and outof disgust they started to exterminate humanity.\\n\\n\r\nIt is said that humanity summoned a girl called Luna \"who was the sun that was named moon\" as their salvation. Robots feared her as potential threat and were sending three of their most powerful cyborgs to kill her. Out ot the three Casshern was the strongest one and managed to fullfill his duty. By killing Luna a phenomenon called \"Ruin\" was released into the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself begins many hundred years later. The \"Ruin\" is responsible for  humans and even robots to die slowly. We are following Casshern who has returned with no memories of his past life as he is traveling the world filled with death, life, hope and despair in search of the meaning to life and his destiny.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nImpressions:\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFor some it may sound boring, for some it may stretch too much and for some it's closer to a masterpiece.It all depends on your preferences and what you seek in an Anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor myself I can definietly say that Casshern Sins is one of the best series out there no matter the age (2008). The reason? The themes this Anime is dealing with.\\n\\n\r\nIn general I'm not a huge fan of Animes which are build more episodic. The story itself is quickly told  and not even that deep and complex if you leave the last episodes out of it. But the theme in form of death, life, despair and hope is so strong that it's leaving you speechless from time to time. One episode has a greater impact comaraped to others and what often remains is an atmosphere that is supporting the themes and what you feel really well.\\n\\n\r\nFeeling the pressure Casshern is in watching people die throughout the series for different reasons you feel for each of them individually. But it's not just about the different stories you come to know. It's also mainly about the story of Casshern and the more or less \"main Characters\" like Lyuze , Ringo, Ohji.\\n\\n\r\nCasshern has lost his memories after killing Luna and is wandering the world. It is said that after killing Luna he gained immortality and that by killing and devouring Casshern people and robots can stop the Ruin and become immortal themselfes. That is one of the reaons he is confronted by people and robots trying to kill him and making him aware that he is the reason for the \"Ruin\" to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nNot understanding what it means to be the most powerful cyborg ever created and being pratically immortal  he is searching for his reason and destiny  to be alive. In his journey he is being confronted by a lot of death, despair and hopelessness by people and robots alike. Many die just by being near him, some are growing dear to him and as he is gaining his past memories you are growing with Casshern and his few friends.\\n\\n\r\nThis all is underlined by a really great soundtrack that is supporting the story, themes and the atmosphere really well. Some tracks can be heard here to get a feeling for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design and backgrounds are really impressive and in my point of view timeless. There are so many variations and details that it's really astonishing. You may get your own perception by browsing through some of the wallpapers and screenshots at the end.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nValue: (Containing spoilers) \\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCasshern Sins is a quite dark and mature Anime which defitnly won't appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nI like to be reminded that there is somethink dark in our lifes and that not everything should be taken for granted. Casshern Sins was and is helping me to think about themes like death and my own value in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe feeling that you get from this Anime as you are feeling helpless from time to time, when you are reflecting your life and what you have is just awesome. It's really thought-provoking and is able to balance it well based on the great scripts of most of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs one of the many example I like \"Turn the Time Lived to Colo\"\\n\r\nIn this episode a robot who sees himself as an artist is painting the whole city in white. He knows of his dying body and his wish is to tell others that he had lived and therefore wants to leave the city painted in his colour. He refers to different timelines as he is scraping the walls and showing some kind of rainbow which is showing that other artists were telling their stories just like he wants to do. The rest of the people in this city aren't able to live with someone who has hope in his heart. They just wish to die quietly as they have accepted their Ruin and don't wish to think much about it.\\n\\n\r\nFor me that is one strong desire. Nobody knows what's happening after you leave this life and  maybe are afraid of it. Some want to leave something to be remembered by others and to live on by doing so and that is something I could see myself doing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many examples where I would need days to write them down.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end what you gain from this Anime depends on you entierly.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIf you have suggestions/improvement suggestions please let me know.\\n\\n\r\nMy native language isn't English so don't be to harsh on me. I'm still glad about corrections and looking forward to them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "By the looks of it, Casshern Sins was trying to express morals on mortality and redemption focused on our amnesiac main lead, Casshern, as he wanders an apocalyptic future where humans and robots await what they believe to be their inevitable death after Casshern kills the planet's life source in the form of a young girl named Luna. To a degree, the focus works as the series explores Casshern's encounters with different robots and humans who have differing beliefs on how to live their lives within this future with those resigning themselves to their fates, trying to off Casshern from rumors that his flesh bringsimmortality, wanting to live their last days to the fullest, bring hope to those who have resigned to their fate or take advantage of this great uncertainty for personal gain. Many of the characters within the series also have legitimate personal motives for the actions they commit to within this world which can be quite on the tragic side. These motives can also come with their fatal flaws that come back to haunt the characters, thus creating flawed, tragic heroes and villains for the majority of the cast. In Casshern's case, he seeks redemption for what he sees as the sins he committed in his role of bringing about incoming ruin to the world while cursed with the inability to die for his atonement thanks to the immortality he gained from Luna's death.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series does suffer from some major flaws with trying to implement its themes and its plot elements. For as interesting as Casshern Sins' themes are, the first half tends to drag quite a bit as there isn't much in the way of plot advancement as many episodes tend to be episodic and self-contained with Casshern's encounters with different people in his journey. This means mostly every character introduced that you might grow to care for won't be around after the particular episode and while the exploration on morality and redemption is an interesting one, some elements explored in the world of Casshern Sins did get repetitive at points. The anime also has its fair share of unexplored plot elements and contrivances such as what triggered Casshern's moments of going berserk, certain characters conveniently falling into ruin rather quickly or having little ill effects from the ruin compared to other robots and the return of a major character who was seemingly offed at an earlier point in Casshern Sins.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Casshern Sins was of average quality for a TV anime series with details looking a bit on the simple side and having roughly-drawn details with characters and settings. I'm guessing the animation style was used as a sort of homage to the 70s anime series that Casshern Sins is supposed to be a reboot of. The subdued, dark color tones used for the anime go along well with the it's somber, dark mood and apocalyptic world. Animation isn't too impressive either as the series has a nice number of animation shortcuts it resorts to with still shots and speed stripes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I guess I found Casshern Sins to be a bit of a mixed bag. While making effective use of its moral themes at a number of points and offers solid focus on its world and characters, the series does drag quite a bit in its first half with its episodic stories, has some major elements unexplored and some moments happening too conveniently just for the sake of pointless drama. It's still a decent series, but the mentioned flaws to Casshern Sins still weigh the series down quite a bit for me.",

            "content": "There have been tons of anime about robots and mechs fighting monsters. However, this special gem does not fall into that category. It's definitely more complex, story-wise, and can be depressing as well. Do these factors help the show stand out on its own or does it hurt the show? Let's find out.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where robots rust and humans are nearly extinct. Casshern Sins follows a robot named Casshern who's immortal, he travels the land in search of answers as to how the world came to be in ruins and who he really is. The plot's pretty straightforwardand episodic as well with some symbolism that makes the story unique and the fact that no one, not even the main characters are safe, makes the story interesting to watch. Though, the show can be slow paced at times which could throw some viewers off.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe animation is solid done by studio Madhouse who's always shown their A game from other great shows in the past. It's a unique design that blends in well with the overall tone and setting of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OST is very good that goes well with the different scenes throughout the course of the story that fits with well with the show's tone. I watched this anime during its run on the new Toonami block on Adult Swim so I will only be talking about the dub for the show. It's a very good dub with the voice actors giving it their all and giving a good performance, though Funimation usually brings out good, quality dubs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters for the most part are likeable. Casshern usually meets different people on his journey and a couple of them either join him right away or eventually. Everybody else is the supporting cast that meet Casshern who show, in their respective roles, how the world has evolved and how they have adjusted to their environment. At points they do drastic things due to how desperate and dangerous the situation has become.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThis was a surprise as I literally had to expectations going into it. I always find shows that are set to be in a post-apocalyptic world interesting, with some symbolism thrown in there if it serves a purpose. They tend to show a what if scenario if the world was on its last stand and what you would do in that situation. Though the show can be depressing at times which isn't for everyone and I'm not sure if I would watch it more than once.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, despite my gripes with the show I still enjoyed it and am glad I checked it out. The show may not be spectacular, but it should be watched at least once before you decide if this is the kind of show that's for you. You can watch it on Funimation or Hulu for those of you who want to check it out. Well that's it for me. Thank you for reading my review. You guys take care. \\n",

            "content": "I have just recently finished Casshern Sins, so I figured I may as well do a review of it before it leaves my mind and makes my review somewhat shoddy. Starring one of Tatsunoko's more obscured and less popular protagonists, the titular Casshern, this bleak and depressing story of death and despair spans 24 slow-paced and heavy episodes.\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nCasshern, an immortal robot, awakens to windswept scenery and only flashes of his past memories. His name is legendary and infamous due to his apparent bringing about of a worldly calamity known as \"The Ruin\", which is rusting away and killing robots who once knew eternal life.He wanders the desolate, ruined world, searching only for The Sun Named Moon and a reason for his existence. Along the way he meets those affected by The Ruin, those affected by people from his past and even some who have no relation to him at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile amnesia stories are something I usually dislike for their overuse, I found Casshern Sins to use it decently well. During the beginning of every episode, you get hints of the past, whether it be his own or of those around him. Sometimes the short, second-long memory shown relates to the episode in one way or another and it's pretty nicely executed. There are unexpected and interesting twists and surprises around every corner.\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\r\nDuring the final few episodes, the quality dips just a tad. There are several animations reused several times, so much so it becomes a little obvious and distracting. I also found eyes on characters to be somewhat uncomfortable to look at, especially one of the child characters known as Ringo.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these flaws, however, I love the art. Even if the backdrop is depressing, bleak, and lifeless, there's a beauty to them. They're beautiful to look at, no matter how desolate they are. Shading is beautiful and definitely adds to the atmosphere of any scene. When fight scene animations aren't being overused, they're very cool to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nThe songs that this soundtrack does have are very beautiful, but I found them reusing specific songs, especially for the sad moments, too many times to leave as much of an impact as the first time they played. The OP for this show is fantastic, with lyrics that relate to the show for once. The EDs are somewhat boring, but they're not bad, per se.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show, when characters are first introduced, I felt that they were mostly pretty bland and generic. However, as the show went on they all built upon who they were to become memorable characters I found myself quite attached to. For spoiler reasons I can't dive too deep into this, but the development and introductions of some characters are expertly executed. It takes a few episodes for development to start due to the show's slow pace, but it's very well done once it happens. There's also a LOT of angst from the protagonist, sometimes a little too much. He's still likable and relateable, though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nFor about half of the show, I would watch it occasionally, maybe an episode or two before viewing something else. However, once it got going, I found myself marathoning the rest of the series in one sitting. I loved the setting, I love robots, I loved the symbolism, the questions, and the statements the show brought up. I was attached to the characters, I wanted to know how they ended up or what happened to them. The twists were great and don't even get me started on the emotional roller coaster...\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nThe combination of a slow start and a slow pace overall could turn off those expecting a high-octane and fast-paced action show. If you're looking for something dark, something gritty and depressing, with interesting characters and questions, you should think about picking this one up. It's got depressed robots, a robot dog, robot armies, robot gore... Pretty much a lot of things involving robots. Robots and angst.",

            "content": "Casshern Sins is the perfect example of an anime with a lot of wasted potential. It's got a unique story. Great artwork, music and even interesting characters. Sounds like it should be rated higher than right? We'll get to that but first lets get into what the show's about.\r\nBasically, Casshern is a robot who's lost his memory. As he travels around the world which has been stricken with ruin (A disease that causes a robots body to deteriorate slowly until they die) he finds out that not only is he immortal but he is the one who caused all of this. He journeys around theworld trying to piece his past together and atone for his sins.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is unique and makes all of the battles look awesome. The soundtrack is really good and each track fits the dark yet hopeful mood of the show.The opening song is probably one of the best I've heard lately and the lyrics match up well with the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a really good mix of characters. Some you may love and others you may hate which is great. My only problem is that sometimes characters will randomly dissapear and then reappear in the next scene without any explination. The best example of this is episode 4 in which Friender (A robot dog that joined Cashern in episode 3) dissapears entirely.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad. The show seems to have some serious problems with pacing. One minute things are progressing at a slow, calm pace and the next things are happening so quickly that they feel rushed. I know they had a lot to pack into 24 episodes but they could've shortened certain scenes to stretch out the more important ones. Also, some characters don't get as much exposure as they should, leaving you to wonder what their motives were in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it's an enjoyable anime and I'd recommend that anyone who likes sci fi or action give it a try but if you're not into it after the first six episodes than it's probably not for you.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh Casshern Sins, you were an unexpectedly interesting anime. For better or worse. This may sound harsh but I'd be interested in more anime like it, but better. Not that it was bad, far from it but...well...\r\nWhile the first couple of episodes were questionable, but the series quickly became a great series of one-off stories. It's like a post-apocalyptic robot version of a roadtrip movie for the first half of the series. Casshern (and later his robot dog buddy Friender, among others) travels around the \"ruined\" world, trying to find answers and finds how these characters, almost all robots, react to their sudden mortality andto the dying world at large. Each episode, well mainly 3-12, is each an interesting story with an enjoyable character and how they react to this post-apocalyptic world. It's a generally interesting look at inevitable mortality iwth the clever twist that it's all about robots, who were basically immortal before \"the Ruin\" began.\\n\\n\r\nYou have your core cast, Casshern the emo whiny character...but to be fair, that part is fairly tolerable and his interaction with other characters help too. Plus, it's understandable considering what happened. You have the optimistic silly child character Ringo, Lyuze, the old man, and villians. The villians are built up well, they are fun villians basically, with decent enough personalities. And it leads into some great plot twists halfway through. Afterwards it's more plot oriented instead of episodic, and at first I was genuinely enjoying that, with one fight in episode 14 that took the usually brief fighting of the series and turned it into an almost DBZ-like level of awesome. Some good continuations of the plot and it looked like it was going to head to a satisfying climax with finding the supposedly alive Luna.\\n\\n\r\n...and I don't know, the series just didn't work that well in the last 1/4. The series had always had a somewhat (I hate to use this word but it's true) pretentious feel to it, but it got really annoying towards the end. The stupidly obvious symbolism, the lame twists, the contradicting message of life and death...ugh. It wasn't bad even than but compared to how much I was enjoying the rest of the series, everything after episode 18 just fell flat by comparison, even if there was still a lot of good in those episodes, it didn't come together well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is really good. Only watched dubbed by the voice acting was typical good Funimation stuff. Nothing more nothing less. Some really good music, and the series knew when NOT to play background music, which was necessary for this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art however, is gorgeous. I'd honestly say it's easily one of the best looking tv anime I have ever seen. Even what should have been brown, ugly backgrounds still look great and if anything really help the colorful characters pop. It's so good that for me, it single-handedly makes any defense of every brown and grey next gen video game a complete joke. The characters are so colorful and the animation is really good when necessary and everything is just great in terms of art. I mean for tv anime, I'm not gonna compare it to a Ghibli film or anything, that's just unfair. But still, it's fantastic. The old school designs also make it look pretty unique.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, it was a good anime. It's a shame about how dissappointing the last few episodes was, but it's still a genuinely good anime worth watching. I had a lot of fun for the most part watching it, and it makes me want to see other anime with similar themes or in general a more somber look at the overdone post-apocalyptic setting. I'm sure they exist, I just haven't watched them yet.",

            "content": "My First Review:\r\nThis anime is Amazing. It portrays life & death; life is precious and meaningful. However, life WITHOUT death is meaningLESS. The life you live is valued by the experiences you've went through, memories you've gained and lives you've touched but in a world of ruin where only decay is abundant, only death awaits. The main character, Casshern is immortal, has memory loss and wears white tights. From episode one that's basically all you understand and the show kinda continues in that pattern. You understand more things, however the 1st half especially is more like individual episodes that have no connection showing Cassherns journey2 find who he is, his meaning of existence. They never show you how he lost his memory in the 1st place, lots of times we just have 2 except what they throw at us which isn't necessarily bad for this series. The sound is  great especially with the singing part, visuals r decent and the story is kinda not all that deep so we'll base it off each episodes individual meaning and moral which is a thumbs up. This series reminds me a lot of the MINDFUCK known as Ergo Proxy so if u like this, you can get this along with u trying 2 decipher wat 20 seconds of an episode meant or wtf is with that? And Ohhhh moments so yeah I rate this an 8",

L'unica cosa che permangono sono i nomi, per il resto \u00e8 completamente un'altra storia. E che storia.\r\nLe basi narrative possono sembrare le classiche dell'eroe che dopo aver combinato qualcosa di grave (qui aver portato il mondo alla rovina in uno scenario post apocalitticomolto suggestivo), si ritrova senza memoria a voler scoprire il proprio passato e porre rimedio al male nel mondo.\\n\r\nLa trama da qui si dipana in maniera mooooooooolto lineare, priva di colpi di scena, e io stesso dopo i primi episodi, mi chiedevo cosa lo stessi guardando a fare, dato che praticamente non veniva svelato niente, e le singole puntate parevano completamente scollegate. Qua e la ci stava qualche combattimento, molto spettacolare anche (MadHouse docet!), ma il vero punto focale dei vari episodi erano le esperienze che Casshern viveva di volta in volta.\\n\r\nEsperienze che portavano il protagonista (ma soprattutto lo spettatore) a scontrarsi con tutta una serie di riflessioni morali e filosofiche che riguardano il lento incedere della rovina e la sua accettazione(sia da parte dell'uomo e novit\u00e0, dei robot), trovare uno uno scopo alla propria vita, il poter lasciare un segno nella storia, e il significato di una vita senza morte, da parte di un essere che dall'alto della sua immortalit\u00e0 non si sente nemmeno vivo (and much more).\\n\\n\r\nCasshern sins \u00e8 questo dunque, una sorta di manuale ricco di spunti sulla vita (emblematico l'intro della canzone: \"Ehierch\u00e8 sono nato?\") in 24 episodi scanditi da una narrazione che alcuni troveranno lenta e pesante, ma che se capita e apprezzata \u00e8 in grado di lasciare il segno in mezzo a mostri sacri come ghost in the shell, evangelion (please non gridate allo scandalo, era per fare un esempio di Anime fantascientifici che dietro una facciata di picchia picchia nascondono un significato pi\u00f9 profondo) ed ergo proxy.\\n\\n\r\n4 stelle!",

            "content": "Ah yes, Casshern Sins. You either love it, or you hate it. Personally, I liked it.\r\nI can see why many would hate it. It's very slow, especially at first, because there isn't a clear cut path the story goes through like some anime. Rather, it deviates a lot to tell individual character stories for several characters that Casshern meets throughout his wanderings, which ultimately help give him an understanding of what it truly means to be alive. It's only until episode 20 until we really focus in on our main characters, Casshern, Lyuse, Ringo, Dio, and Leda. However, once you hit that episode, the pacinggets a bit faster, as I saw myself blowing through episode 18-24 in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nIf I can fault the anime for anything is that there are several questions that are left vague or unanswered such as how The Ruin really happened and what happened to it in the end. Also, the character motivations for some characters, especially Luna, are very hard to follow. I can see how many people would be confused about its plotline and drop it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where Casshern Sins really shines is its Presentation. Umakoshi always delivers when doing original character designs and it shows here as they are unique and lively, giving Casshern Sins an almost classic look, fitting for a series based off an old super fighting robot anime. This anime's world is also given life through its use of sound, color, and lighting to help really set the tone for many key scenes, such as occasionally setting a scene in grayscale save for some highlights like blushes or blood. Its sound gives every hit a big impact, making it a joy for those who just come to see what fight Casshern will get into, and there is usually one in most episodes to break the normally slow pace. This is also helped by its dark and bombastic score which is contrasted by a few mellow insert songs like \"Aoi Kage\" and \"A Path\" which while occasionally overused, never fails to help set the mood for any emotional scene. \\n\\n\r\nCasshern's characters really leave an impact. Surprisingly, some of the best characters are the one-off ones like Sophita, Akos, Margo, and Janice who have enough attention to be impactful to the theme of the show. In contrast, while most major characters are easy to understand, some characters like Luna have very confusing loyalties and motivations, and it's hard to figure out what she does exactly. If I explain too much more I would go into spoiler territory, but it is still a great story, complexities aside. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Casshern Sins has something for everyone. Smooth and impactful fight scenes, several great characters, and a gorgeous post-apocalyptic setting. If you can get past its slow pacing and occasionally overly-complex plot, there's something you can enjoy.",

            "content": "This anime is unique in many aspects. People are thrown into confusion by it's focus. There is, essentially, no story line or plot in this anime. What this anime attempts to do is delve into the nature of death, and the meaning of life. It is important to realise that the characters, and their stories, are not only the focus of the anime, but the only thing that drives what little plot there is. \r\nSpoilers \r\nA few things that need to be clarified in my opinion is the confusion around luna's eternal life giving, the ruin, and Casshern's final decision. Luna only wants to givelife eternal because she is simply afraid of death. However, the way she does this is curing the Ruin by giving people her blood which we are told contains nano-machines which will repair  robots. This repairing is what brings the robots back to their normal state of immortality, which we are told robots had before the Ruin. So Luna does not have some 'magical power' which gives life, she is simply repairing the decay that is occurring because the world is Ruined. However Casshern, who we are repeatedly informed is the God of Death in everyone's opinions, both for his bodies innate strength and destructive power, as well as the fact that he caused the Ruin by slaying Luna. Casshern, after travelling and bearing witness to the numerous stories of people striving to live to the fullest before they are consumed by Ruin and die (imo ruin can simply be substituted for death or ageing)  realises that what makes these people work so hard, and accomplish so much, in essence, live, is the fact that they are aware of their own mortality. \\n\\n\r\nSo when Casshern finally encounters Luna, he, and his companions, realise that this 'gift' of eternal life, could also be a curse. Because if you live eternally, and have no fear of death, your life loses meaning. You have no fear, no motivation nothing. This is also, though not clearly, shown by the episode where they pass through the circus like town that has grown up around Luna. It's full of what most people would call insane people. We see the robot repeatedly throwing itself from a building, (more robotically than any other robots have acted in the show) purely because it can not die. This is the effects of Luna's 'eternal life'. And Casshern, Lyusa and Ringo decide that it's, as Ringo says' \"Unnatural\". So they leave because it is their ability to die which gives meaning to their life. However after Ogi and Lyusa die, Casshern leaves Ringo to face Luna again. They meet and Luna stabs Casshern. And, just like we were shown 20 something times at the start of each episode, their blood mixed. Casshern's nature of 'death' corrupted Luna's nature of 'eternal life' resulting in robots gaining mortality. So instead of just killing everything instantly, or everything living meaningless lives forever, Casshern compromises. He lets Luna give life, and in return, when those lives have 'used up' their meaning, or as the show says 'forgotten death' Casshern will come and kill them. Their fear of him, the fear of death, will provide the meaning to the eternal life that Luna can provide.\\n\\n\r\nA final point that was shown even in the final episode, and as the credits rolled, is Ringo's apparent ability to survive the Ruin. It is quite possible she is a Cyborg, or essentially Casshern Sins perfect being. Not only are we shown her to be rusting, but she also bleeds (which only she, Leda Dio and Casshern do aside from Ogi for some reason) There is also the scene in Ogi's backstory where he finds here hidden in a robots body and says something along the lines of, she seemed to be both Robot and Human... and what's that called? A cyborg. What this means, is that as a robot, she can survive the Ruin because of Luna's nano-bots, but as a human she will still age and eventually die. (as the fact she is shown to be the only robot to grow up). She also hints that 'the others' will eventually become like her. What this means i don't know. but it suggests that other robots are accomplishing what Braiking Boss and Ogi started, making Robots into 'God's' beings that will live, age, reproduce, and die. (As a side note, I think that was the meaning behind Leda's character. I believe her despair at not being able to be a mother, which she was created to be, has led her to seek beauty. But that selfishness corrupted her until Dio's example of caring for her changed her priorities from selfish vengeance back to a love for another, which is why they were shown to die so peacefully with each-other.)",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe narrative was incredibly sappy. It dragged on more than it should. Yes it was comprehensible, but it had an obviously overly flowery approach to it which directly tells the writer is trying too hard to be deep making for a highly emotional experience that...get's really old really fast. It's slow, it's droll, and while it doesn't seem like that for the first few episodes, you'll soon see things ruin quickly (pun intended lol). \r\nArt:\r\nI favor a lot of the character work and somewhat dirty approach. It gives power to each scene (when present) and is a nice take away from the clean look I'mso used to; in characters, it's a highly stylized experience. Scenery is another story however... lots of droll droll scenery. Sure I get it, the world is in ruin so not much to look at. But I've seen a lot more apocalyptic style works with tons more visual \"effort\" than this piece. Considering also that this piece can be very conservative with it's dialogue, using the silence and scenery to move the story, that lack of interesting visuals only pretty much adds to the \"doldrum like\" experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound effects and planning were done pretty ok however. You feel a lot of the grit on each clash with not too much getting in the way. The series however doesn't do much in its musical score however. Many ques will repeat, or you'll be treated to soundscape ambiances. This is fine as a support, but would have been nice if some more exploration in the sound department were made in specific areas.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nOi...I mentioned the sappy narrative, but that's only due to the sappy characters that fill it. It's like you'll hear Casshern's name like a 100 times in a \"breathy\" like way to make it sound \"crying\" or \"emotional\". Casshern spends...pretty much all of the time \"looking for himself\" with a resolve that isn't unique. Wait let me edit that, he's always looking for a resolve because it seems like something is always wrong with him or something wrong has happened to him! He feels like a mechanical version of Shinji >:(. Other characters have a little more complexity (Braiking Boss, Ringo, Ohji) but not by much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a \"tear-trip\" with an endless supply of melodrama, then this is for you. Honestly I can't recommend this to anyone. It may have a deeper message in humanism, conservatism, etc. but many have done each of these topics better, with tons better visuals, tons better style, tons better approach.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that while I did indeed give Casshern: Sins such a low score it doesn't mean that I did not enjoy it.\r\nOn the contrary I thought it to be a more than decent anime entry. It had an original story and the characters were more developed than we see in many anime today. \r\nSo why such a low score from me? \r\nCasshern sins is not for everyone. \r\nIt has a slow pacing and a fractured storytelling process at the best of times. \r\nThe problem lies in the very lore of the anime itself. This is set post-apocalypse. \r\nA genre thatI both love and hate at the same time. I like dark and gritty things such as those universes that fall within this genre but I also like to 'see a light at the end of the tunnel', either in the form of a happy ending or one where 'hope springs eternal'.\\n\\n\r\nAn example of this for me would be like 'The Walking Dead'. It's a dark and gritty show but the characters somehow pull through and there's always hope for a tomorrow. \\n\\n\r\nNot so for Casshern. If anything this anime's future is more in line with 'The Road' and it's clear that by the end all life would end. \\n\\n\r\nI gave Casshern such a low score because of my personal disappointment for this outcome. But I understand there are many that like this kind of bleakness in their stories and that's just fine. \\n\\n\r\nBut don't take my view on it and go try Casshern for yourself! ;)",
