            "content": "Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. Even that title alone may convince some viewers to watch this series. But what you may least expect would be a ghost troll (a hot ghost troll if I may add) hanging out with the main protagonist on a daily basis doing cute little things here and there. \r\nThe story covers the Paranormal Investigation Club, a club that deals with the supernatural. From there, we have the other members starting with Teiichi Niiya, probably the only normal member of the group. He maintains an unusual relationship with our ghost troll Yuuko in which despite her flirtatious and mischievous attempts at him,he still values her as a friend and not forget her. Then, there's Momoe Okonogi, the most enthusiastic member of the group. Her enthusiasm of the the club is probably over the limits in Niiya's point of view as far as she shows the most interest in finding out what happened 50 years ago involving our lovely ghost troll, Yuuko. Of course, she still hangs out around the club while creating many mischievous interactions between herself and Niiya. Next, we have the Kirie Kanoe, the not so enthusiastic member. At first glance, she seems normal but when you get to know her more, you'll find that she's a very insecure person. Why? Well, for nearly every 5 minutes, she goes on about the dangers of Yuuko and warns Niiya to be on his guard. She can be seen as the antithesis of Yuuko for even though her outside (appearance) may resemble her somewhat, her inner self is worlds apart. \\n\\n\r\nThen, finally our lovely ghost troll Yuuko, who can forget about her? After all, she is the star of the series and the \"dusk maiden\" of amnesia. Her flirtatious attitude with our main protagonist is guilty pleasure and some of the guys watching this might be biting their fingernails about how lucky he is. (I know I am at least sometimes) However, it does seems that despite playful self, she harbors a dark past she tries to keep herself a secret from anyone. She tries hard to forget about her past and make it into an amnesia but there's one thing you cannot forget: you can't run away from your problems like an amnesia. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, even for stories like this, there would be fan-service, pool parties, and those cute \"love-love\" scenes. Then there is always those \"horror\" scenes mixed in with light comedy and even psychological twists later on. However so far, this series is not another Another (no pun intended). I mean seriously, let's ask ourselves: who actually got scared out of their pants in the first episode? \\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, there is definitely an eerie atmosphere behind the curtains and lies beyond the horizon of the dusk. We also later learns the truth behind Yuuko's death and the hatred she developed that manifested as the her ying and yang. Hate is definitely a strong word this time around as her darker self becomes one of the driven antithesis of Yuuko's cheerful self. As she deals with her past with her new profound friend Niiya, they must cope with the horrors that may lie in the future.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I find the art of the series to be gorgeous as well as the various well captured angles of \"dusk\" in this anime and the night moon skies. Kudos to Silver Link I say, you sure know how to set a high bar for this season. As for the sound, it's not something you'll listen to while studying for your university entrance exam but it's also something catchy that fits the overall story. And take notice the OP and ED song that our beloved ghost troll Yuuko-san seems to be imitating. She would go pretty far in American Idol I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find Dusk Maiden of Amnesia to be entertaining and makes Sundays a wonderful relaxing day to finish off the weekend. Its balanced light comedy and seriousness is something that most of us will notice and while it doesn't reach the necessity horror levels of some other series you may have seen in the past, it does makes it up with its entertainment and value. Its darker tone of the story later on will keep some of you viewers glued to your seat. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an unique anime at that and one such series this Spring Season that I'm sure most of us will not forget like an amnesia. (at least I hope)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mixing very different themes together can sometimes produce surprising results, but there's a big risk involved with this approach to storytelling and original concepts that are formed using this process often fall at the first hurdle. There are always exceptions to this guideline, but in anime these are usually adaptations of some other media that are often the result of hopeful popularity forecasts and a severe lack of common sense.\r\nThankfully, Tasogare Otome x Amnesia (Dusk Maiden of Amnesia), manages to steer its way through the conversion rapids - but not without taking some damage along the way.\r\nBased on the manga by Maybe, the story revolvesaround the unusual relationship between Niiya Teiichi - a middle school student at Seikyou Private Academy and a senior member of the Paranormal Investigation Club - and the club president Kanoe Yuuko - the spirit of a female student who died in the abandoned school building 60 years before. The story begins with a rather humourous series of events that are initially shown from the perspective of Okonogi Momoe - a girl who is blissfully unaware of Yuuko's presence - and the beauty of the scene is that it not only forms a surprisingly good introduction to the main characters, but that the impact of this is reinforced when the events are replayed to expose the joke.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately things don't really proceed so well for the rest of the series as, although there is an actual story behind everything, the plot is broken up into a series of short arcs that only last one or two episodes. It's an approach that can be surprisingly flexible when used correctly, and given the importance of the ubiquitous \"seven mysteries of [insert name here] school\" it's understandable why this method was used. Sadly the move from manga to anime has been far too rushed, and the compression of information causes too great a shift in pace between each arc. In addition to this there are several major plot points that are noticeably absent in the anime - mainly because the shadow of early adaptation reared its ugly head again. Dusk Maiden is yet another show that has suffered the ignominy of being animated before the manga was complete, and this causes a few contextual problems that the writers have tried to gloss over - with varying degrees of success.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most adaptations the character designs are taken directly from the source material, and as with the majority of school-based romantic comedies there isn't really anything special in this department. That said, Dusk Maiden is stylistically and aesthetically pleasing to the eye - mainly because director Oonuma Shin has applied a number of the visual tricks and techniques that he used in the \"ef\" series. Unfortunately the character animation isn't as crisp as it could be and some of the movements are a little odd, but aside from that (and several moments of shoddy line work along with the repeated use of low angles and sunsets - which can become a little tiresome after a while), SILVER LINK have produced a good-looking show. The design mentality works particularly well in a number of scenes, serving as a pleasing visual reference to reinforce the show's genre foundations of horror and romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden does contain some fanservice (it's a school-based romantic comedy with harem elements after all), but the approach is far less aggressive than that of a number of anime out there. These moments are often caused by Yuuko's carpicious nature and the amusement she derives from making Teiichi uncomfortable - which is a nice change from the usual protagonist falling face-first onto a random girl (or her falling on him).\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting aspect of the series that does bear mentioning is the overt symbolism related to Noh and Kabuki theater - Momijigari. The meaning of the repetitive red and yellow maple leaves is something that can be easily passed of as a way to make the scene look good, but it's actually a subtle reference to stories about a beautiful maiden/princess who was actually a demon in disguise, and who is ultimately killed by the man she is attempting to seduce. It's a surprisingly telling visual device that, once understood, gives the plot some extra weight and sets a performing precedent that the voice actors and scriptwriters can build on.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden opens with Suzuki Konomi's \"Choir Jail\" - accompanied by a straightforward visual medley to introduce the main characters mixed with the maple leaf metaphor. The closing theme is somewhat noteworthy - showing Yuuko sitting against a window in what is presumably the abandoned school building, singing \"Karandorie\" by Okui Aki while the sun sets. Both sequences feature some decent audio/visual choreography, and this is largely true for the majority of the series. The score contains a variety of tracks that add some nice background to scenes and jokes, and there's some surprisingly good effects work on display - although this is offset by a degree of untidiness, and the usual comedy-centric noises can sometimes feel out-of-place.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the series crosses two very specific genres there's always the danger of the script going from one extreme to another - especially with an adaptation of an unfinished work - and while this does happen on some occasions the writers have maintained a pretty good balance between the disparate elements for the majority of the story. The Japanese dub fares particularly well because of this, but the translation into English could have been approached in a more intuitive manner as it is a bit too ... literal. Tsubasa Yonaga handles the role of the befuddled and slightly put-upon Teiichi very well, and Hara Yumi delivers a good performance as the precocious amnesiac ghost Yuuko. Kitamura Eri (Kanoe Kirie), and Fukuen Misato (Okonogi Momoe),  also work rather well in their supporting roles, and while the all of the voice actors have moments that don't quite fit, their collective efforts are pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the English dub is rife with issues that could easily have been resolved during the translation and ADR processes - which is probably why Clint Bickham seems to struggle with the role of Teiichi and Emily Neves (Yuuko), seems unable to pronounce her love interest's name correctly. Jessica Boone offers some solace as Kirie, but it's the talented and highly experienced Britney Karbowski who suffers the most as Momoe. The lacklustre scripting issues are underlined by the adherence to literal translation, so the entire English dub is littered with out-of-place terms and the rage-inducing 'kun', 'san', etc - all of which have a big effect on the viewer's perception of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt first Teiichi appears to be little more than the common-or-garden lead male in a romantic comedy (with some harem elements), but he does have some good points as, unlike other stories of this type, he is determined to stay with Yuuko. In this respect he has more in common with the likes of Morisato Keiichi from \"Ah! Megami-sama\" than the usual harem leads of the last decade. As for the ghost herself, Yuuko is very clearly an extremely lonely character who, upon finding that someone can see and touch her, displays her affection in much the same way an abandoned puppy would to someone who fed and cared for it. The development of the relationship between these two is one of the central pillars of the storyline, and it's interesting to see the progression of their relationship clash with Teiichi's desire to know how Yuuko died and her desire to run away from anything that hurts or upsets her.\\n\\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that time restraints and the need to leave a major chunk of the plot out of the ending (because it hadn't been written), meant that Kirie's growing friendship with Teiichi and her relationship with Yuuko are never fully realised - especially as the latter adds a competely different tone to the ending of the series. The sad part is that anyone who has read the manga will understand just how much has been left out, and the meaning behind the sinister shadow becomes much more horrifying than the anime depicts.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia is predominantly a story of what could have been. The decision for early adaptation, combined with the limitations of a twelve episode series, has forced a number of edits and alterations that are noticeable - but only if the viewer has read the manga. While it lacks the punch of the source material - particularly at the end - the series offers some interesting concepts, a few laughs, and a rather sweet relationship between a boy and a ghost. The stylish visuals work surprisingly well with the storyline, and although the series plays fast and loose with some of its elements, several themes are dealt with in an astute manner. Aside from the issues with the English dub the narrative holds together quite well - which is an achievement for an adaptation of an unfinished story that has been crammed into a short series while trying to cover the holes in the plot.",

            "content": "Hmmm I rarely consider any anime as 10's, but Dusk Maiden of Amnesia truly was an impressive piece of work. It's saddening to see so many negative reviews of it.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThere is one tiny flaw in the story: it's slightly hard to follow. If you don't really pay attention to what the characters tell you, it can be easy to fall behind and get confused. Nonetheless, if you can follow the explanations, the story will be awesome. Story wise, it's really as the synopsis says: the school ghost Yuuko can't remember her past whatsoever, and the main protagonist along with some others form a clubto help her discover it. Now, the synopsis makes the story sound extremely spooky and the anime is classified as horror, but it really isn't, so if you're not a fan of horror stories, do not worry. It's more of a thriller and mystery; the horror elements are almost nothing. In fact, there's a lot of comedic moments since it is a romance. \\n\r\nBut I think the way in which they tell the story is flawless. The beginning episodes may seem a bit filler since they're individualistic and don't seem to contribute plot movement at first, but they're important to the story as a whole, which is what I was saying before about following the story closely. The pace at which they reveal details is perfect as they don't try to flood you with too many revelations, but leave just enough cliffhangers to make you watch the next episode. And like a true mystery story, they don't completely leave the viewer in the blind; you too will be able to decipher the mystery with some thinking. This may cause some people to think it a predictable anime, and while the ending was sort of expected, I would not say it was predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNormally art style isn't a huge aspect in a lot of anime, but since this is technically a horror (it really isn't scary I promise), the visuals are semi-important, and I think the artists did a wonderful job portraying the thriller elements. The art sort of reminded me of the Bakemonogatari series, and for those who have seen that, the art was extremely important in making it fantastic, just like in this series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFitting music for a mystery anime. The opening and ending themes were alright; they weren't amazing but the sound effects and spooky motifs were perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI think this is where other people would have the most disagreements with me. There's a lot of criticism for the male protagonist since he's sort of cliche, and while that is true, I think his slightly cliche personality was important to developing Yuuko, the truly interesting character of this series. Because she's a ghost with amnesia on a journey to discover her past, her personality naturally changes as she recovers memories, and this extremely unpredictable and dynamic character makes the series fun to watch because you really never know what she'll do next, and the predictability of the male protagonist molds well with hers. If both characters were too dynamic, it would make the story too chaotic since it is a mystery by nature and the viewer already has to keep track of the plot and all its details. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI normally don't watch horror/thriller/mystery whatever you want to call it, but I was definitely not disappointed. If you're hesitating because you don't like horror (I personally get scared pretty easily), don't let that stop you because the horror aspects are minimal and only add to the excitement of the mystery. It's a story with funny moments and emotional moments, and enough plot twists to keep you watching. There were honestly no flaws that were significant enough to decrease the quality of this anime, and I think this show appeals to a broad range of fans: those who love romance, mystery, or just a good story with highly developed characters will find this show enjoyable. So please give it a watch!\\n\\n\r\nIf you found this helpful, please click so, it means a lot!",

            "content": "Excellent storytellers always have a way to weave suspense and doubt throughout their works so subtly that you can feel somethings wrong but not think it. Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is an adaptation from the similarly named manga following Teiichi and Yuuko as they expand their relationship and face the chaotic horrors born from the catacombs of fear deep within each students mind. Providing a brilliant mix of horror, romance, and drama, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia makes you feel genuine fear, contentment and sadness. \r\nStory - 7\r\nOne can never expect a deep and compelling plot from shows focusing on romance, the show usually depends oncharacter relationships to hold the anime together. However while Dusk Maiden suffers from the lack of a gripping plot, the simplicity of the narrative is one of its strongest points. The horror is intense enough to keep yourself checking behind you every few minutes in uneasiness, and mysterious enough to make you wonder \"What exactly is behind all this?\". The horror leads up to and settles down nicely in the conclusion. With the simplicity of the plot we are drawn into the world of Dusk Maiden, but not enough that it detracts from the true essence of the story: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link never fails to provide quirky yet majestically beautiful visuals. Every character is handled with care, the backgrounds are stunningly effective at setting the mood, and the directing is top notch. The only thing bringing the art down from a ten is how static the characters' movements are. Subtracting that from the equation Dusk Maiden provides the quintessence of horror visuals, with each scene perfectly encapsulating a different variety of fear; insanity, doubt, sacrifice, and above all, fear of the unknown. Of course the directing and art aren't limited to horror scenes. With Shaft-like directing we are treated to a kaleidoscope of different angles and settings that make the important scenes quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maidens soundtrack itself is mediocre, I'm writing this with no recollection of any memorable tracks besides the opening, ending, and insert song. However even if the score is sub-par the tracks still correctly set the tone and mood of the scenes where they are used. And although I enjoyed the opening, it's inclusion at the end of the final episode ruined the mood which doesn't sit well with me. The ending was adequately suited to the show, providing a melancholic feel. Shifting the actual ending sequence itself provides excellent foreshadowing which is well done. Onto the insert song. The inclusion of this song in the finale was THE most brilliant thing the director of this show chose to do. It absolutely PERFECTLY  sets the mood of the last episode, and I was bawling my eyes out the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nOur dynamic duo Teiichi and Yuuko share a fresh and different relationship compared to all the rabble churned out every season. Skipping the countless episodes of \"D-does he like me...? I don't know... Better postpone anything romantic until the penultimate episode...\" Dusk Maiden skips right into the lovey-dovey action. Some people may be put off by this but trust me, it's one of the shows greatest selling points. By choosing this relationship the studio has provided us with actual romance in the story instead of angsty teens, and provides us with a powerful ending that will throw your emotions into a roller coaster of turmoil. Yuuko as a character, Teiichi as a character and the relationship between them warrants a 10, but unfortunately the side-characters bring the rating down. There will be Kirie and Okonogi fans pissed at me saying this but when you have such a strong established romance the only thing potential rivals do is annoy you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe final and penultimate episodes are usually the strongest in the series, with Dusk Maiden being no exception. With the heartwarming romance, horror, and drama all converging throughout the story one would expect a finale that far exceeds the sum of its parts, and that is exactly what is delivered. The final episode caused a few tears to stream down my cheek, and the last anime that made me cry was Clannad After Story. The directing was done so well that during the episode I didn't know if I would be left a sniveling mess or the happiest camper since cavemen discovered fire.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nViewing Dusk Maiden of Amnesia was a pleasure each week, and while various nuances detracted from the shows overall enjoyment, it didn't keep the show from starting strong and ending with a bang. Whether you're looking for chilling horror, loving romance, tearful drama, or any combination of the three, you will enjoy Dusk Maiden. And remember, a story can be good whether it has a happy ending or a bittersweet one.",

You instead found yourself captivated, reaching out to her to know more and to experience this quirky spectacle with her. This is no easy feat.

            "content": "\u201cTasogare Otome x Amnesia\u201d tells the story of Kanoe Yuuko, a beautiful ghost girl who mysteriously died a gruesome death many years ago.  When I first heard of this anime, I thought immediately that it would be a very interesting anime to watch, since I was really into horror stories and such. However, when I think about it, I believe I overestimated the anime a bit. You may hate me when I say this which may automatically make you press that \u201cNot Helpful\u201d button, but either way I will say it. While watching the first five episodes of \u201cTasogare Otome x Amenisia,\u201d I findit a bit clich\u00e9; it was technically just your subtle anime with a few laughs, and a bit of mystery and horror mixed into it. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\n\u201cDusk Maiden of Amnesia\u201d definitely seems like an acceptable anime with the little plots, synopsis, and summaries written about it. Ultimately, it is your normal anime with a dark feel, and a lot of comedy and romance latched onto it. However, the anime mostly contains comedy and romance which I find it to be quite ironic. Usually the summaries written about this anime give you the feel of horror and mystery, but when you watch the episodes you see too much romance. The only times you have a feeling of horror and mystery into it is when you see the Paranormal Investigation Club trying their very best to find clues about Yuuko\u2019s death, or when Yuuko is pretending to be a ghost just to scare the crap out of the main characters which is only a total of four. Lastly, the anime is way too fast paced, I kept on getting confused on like how much time has passed during the anime. To summarize it all up, I believe \u201cDusk Maiden of Amnesia\u201d does a terrible job at showing any type of plot development because it gives me the feel that it is mainly concentrating on showing the relationship between Yuuko and Teiichi. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main characters in this anime either show an advanced character development or an extreme lack of character development. The characters Yuuko and Teiichi are seen throughout this anime 80% of the time. I believe these two show too much character development because in just a short amount of time they already act like lovers who\u2019ve been together since childhood or something. The problem with this is that you see the same scene almost all the time: Yuuko seducing Teiichi, Yuuko making fun of Teiichi,   Yuuko touching Teiichi, Teiichi touching Yuuko, and both of them all lovey dovey. I love romance and all, but this is too much, I mean in just the first day they meet and you already see them on top of each other, it\u2019s too much of a fast development for me. The other main characters Momoe and Kirie are pretty much shown 20% of the time throughout the whole entire series; they barely receive any amount of screen time which results into barely any character development. As a result, I believe the creators only made them to act as \u2018extra\u2019 club members.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem I have with this anime is that it lacks background characters. I understand perfectly well that background characters are not that important to the anime, but seriously throughout the whole anime you just see four characters and their all the main characters! I don\u2019t know if you understand this, but minor and background characters may not be that important to an anime, however when you see the same characters every  episode, and no other characters at all, you slowly understand that  minor and background characters play the crucial role of making it seem more realistic to the viewer. I mean think about it, if you were a person trying their very best to find clues to some death at a school than you expect to see some people who know some information about it, or at least you see just some random people off into the distance chatting about God knows what! But this anime doesn\u2019t have any of that, just four characters in some big ass school. This anime takes place at a school, and at a school you have students, teachers, and all those other people, but there aren\u2019t any of them around in this anime; it makes me think to myself \u201cWhere the hell are the other students? I mean I\u2019m only seeing four characters the whole entire time, doesn\u2019t anybody go to this school?\u201d The only time I saw some actual background characters in this anime so far was on episode five, even if it was just a little bit it made me feel happy to know that some other people actually exist in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime seems like the only darn thing that is 100% perfectly fine! Even though the plot is all messed up, the art is like the only thing that makes me give this anime a decent score of 7 out of 10. The colors used in this anime were so pretty it makes me feel like I\u2019m looking at some painting. The animation was also very well done it had a great use of graphics and effects. Yep art perfect in every way. Indeed the background artists could do a bit more better job at making the backgrounds seem older to give the overall anime feel a bit of pizzazz, but it\u2019s still fine just the way it is. Oh and did you guys know that the people who drew this anime did a great job at showing some fan service? Well now you know, so if you like these sort of animes with fan service than you might actually think \u201cHoly crap, I\u2019m in Heaven.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSeems okay, I have no problems with the voices used in this anime nor the opening and ending songs of the anime. Though I don't know why, but both opening and ending songs didn't seem to attract much attention to me, I didn't really like them that much, but I still thought it was good for the whole mood. The only thing that needs fixing is the better use of background music to better add the mood of the events occurring throughout the show. If the anime had some special sound effects or my favorite, motivational music than I bet I would have rated the anime a little higher maybe up to a 7.5 if that option existed in MyAnimeList.net, I wish it did, it would make my reviews a lot more accurate. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment to \u201cTasogare Otome x Amnesia\u201d was definitely nothing special, I pretty much thought that it was boring. I didn't feel any type of suspense in this anime, no chair gripping, hair biting, mommy I\u2019m scared moments. It was just me sitting there, staring at the computer pretty much bored out of my mind watching Yuuko and Teiichi have some fun. Some parts in the anime did make me awe in adoration or laugh out loud towards the characters or some moments happening in it. Though I mainly just felt bored throughout the whole thing. I did feel a bit of jealously watching this anime since Yuuko and Teiichi\u2019s relationship together seem so perfect, they rarely have any arguments and such or some difficult obstacles they have to face in order for them to be together forever or something like that. I mean throughout the anime their always together, their love just seems perfect and all with no strings attached. God, you don\u2019t know how much I want a relationship like theirs; just watching them all lovey dovey makes me feel like I\u2019ll be forever alone. \\n",

            "content": "Seikyou Academy is a school whose history is steeped in myth and folktales, so much so that it even has a club dedicated to the investigation of the paranormal. Its members include Teiichi, a humble and unassuming boy; Kirie, a curt tomboy; Momoe, a ditsy and childish girl; and Yuuko, a flirtatious young woman. Oh, and Yuuko is actually a ghost who died in the basement of the school fifty years ago and the entire club is just a front put in place by Teiichi so that he can investigate the circumstances surrounding Yuuko's mysterious death. Yep. Anime.\r\nIn pure technicalities, Dusk Maiden is a prettygood-looking series. Productions which feature an element of horror or mystery can sometimes be guilty of straying too far to the \u201cdark\u201d side, but this show's color palette is all about contrast, with the high oranges and yellows of the titular dusk splendidly highlighting the deep purples, greens, and reds of the gloomy setting, as well as the pale features of key characters. The designs are pleasant, if leaning a little towards generic, the backgrounds are solidly detailed, and with the exception of a few off-model moments the art is of above-average quality. Some interesting choices in direction add heartily to the show, and they merit special mention. Many shots are angled to make rooms and hallways appear either smaller or larger than they are, adding an aura of claustrophobia or ominous openness to the setting. During moments of exposition, cuts to a brief black-and-white flashback or a series of still images illustrating a story are sometimes made\u2014these are animation budget saving tactics, sure, but they're creatively used and mesh well with the folklore/legend motif that persists throughout much of the series, so I say \u201cbravo.\u201d The end result is that this show is almost never boring to look at. Quite the opposite; its visuals add greatly to the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs impressive, though seldom as noticeable, is the musical score. It tends toward atmospheric noise, often relying on the eerie, echoic notes of a piano to gain the desired effect. Older, more traditional-sounding drums and chimes, slow and foreboding, sound right at home in the remnants of the decaying school building. Drama is sometimes accompanied by more complex orchestral compositions, but even these are usually integrated with a fair amount of subtlety. The most standout piece, a haunting vocal ballad, is used sparingly but effectively. The score can also be goofy, as the show can, but even the more lighthearted tracks usually have a thin coat of creepy applied to them, as if to present a playfully demented take on the school comedy soundtrack. That's a nice touch. Overall, the music does a lot while still feeling relatively minimal and unobtrusive, and I see no problem with that.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a recurring theme in Dusk Maiden, it\u2019s the thought that unpleasant feelings cannot simply be shied away from; whether consciously or unconsciously, people will be affected by their fears and insecurities. This is most evident in the form of Yuuko, who is literally torn in two by denial. She\u2019s able to maintain her jovial and lighthearted demeanor only because she has dissociated herself from her anger, jealousy, and the memories of her unjust death, which manifest themselves as a malevolent black entity termed Shadow Yuuko. Like the repressed doubts she represents, Shadow Yuuko always lingers in the background, waiting for a moment of weakness to exploit. Moreover, the series uses interesting internal logic to explain the appearances of ghosts. When the students look at a spirit, it takes a shape that is reminiscent of their own emotions. Those who are calm and have no preconceived notions about terrible things lurking about might see something benevolent, like Yuuko. But those who walk the dark halls of the school with anxieties eating away at them might see something altogether more sinister in her place. This is a theme of reasonable weight, and it\u2019s both conveyed consistently throughout the duration of the show and interwoven with the show's audiovisuals to create an atmosphere that can be rather entrancing.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko as a character is an interesting concept; a decent amount of thought is given to what it would really be like to be a ghost, weird as that may sound. She is starved for human contact, and understandably so\u2014most people can't see her, and those who can usually see her as something to run from, the Yuuko of urban legends. The series is good at conveying the feeling that most of what we're seeing isn't Yuuko as she was in life, but a Yuuko who is a product of her stale environment and the cruel way that her life ended\u2014a teenaged girl trying a little too hard to be a teenaged girl, her carefree and bubbly nature concealing all kinds of resentment, anger, and bitter desires which are all the more frightening because they're understandable.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, though, the series struggles to break away from the traditional trappings of high-school romances: despite the good showing of tantalizing ideas and the fair amount of effective artistry, it still desperately strives to be, above all else, a show about a guy with all the verve of a dried-up sponge who is inexplicably loved by three girls. Teiichi himself is poorly characterized, and while he's often described by the rest of the cast as \u201cgentle,\u201d \u201cearnest,\u201d and \u201cdependable,\u201d these traits are perhaps more of a ghost story than anything in the series, discussed in whispers but never truly shown or elaborated on. A more accurate description of him would read along the lines of \u201che is there\u201d and \u201che is the main character.\u201d To be sure, he performs what the show dictates are the proper actions, never taking advantage of the loneliness and vulnerability of his female friends, helping Yuuko track down information about herself. Yet, there's no indication that it's because of his personality (and, for that matter, there's no indication that he has a personality). Rather, he's the male protagonist in a romance, and that's just what the male protagonists in romances are expected to do. He's a nice person because he helps people and he helps people because he's a nice person; forgive me for thinking that's far from compelling writing. The result is that most generic of characters, someone who is difficult to dislike but also difficult to notice or care about in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nEqually damaging are the show\u2019s shifts in tone, which are as frequent as they are jarring. Sharp interjections of half-witted slapstick, usually centering on comedic relief character Momoe, sometimes abruptly decapitate more serious moments. Fanservice and boob humor are plentiful and unsubtle, inserted at all of the wrong instances, often overstaying whatever welcome they might have originally had. There\u2019s no avoiding that much of what goes on is fluff unrelated to what could loosely be referred to as the story, an observation epitomized by the fact that they somehow managed to cram a swimsuit episode in here somewhere. And, worst of all, the show\u2019s appreciable atmosphere of somber, reflective melancholy can often give way to a soapy melodrama of poorly thought out and repetitive dialogue (\u201cI\u2019m so lonely\u2026so sad\u2026in so much pain\u2026\u201d) that is downright difficult to listen to, much less take seriously. Drama, romance and mystery seem closer to the real heart of the series, but its peripheral elements end up distracting from, rather than enhancing, its strengths, and some of its strengths aren't that strong to begin with. The series looks good, sounds good, and knows how to get the viewer caught up in the moment\u2014qualities, make no mistake, that I appreciate. However, it's also the kind of show that's very vulnerable to hindsight, and looking back it's clear that there are plenty of issues with pacing, characterization, and tone.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes down to it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to let this series scrape by with a pass. It does a decent amount of things well, and the things it doesn\u2019t do well are frequently irritating but arguably not deal-breaking. Be warned, though, that Dusk Maiden is one show likely to split audiences down the middle; if you don\u2019t mind the sound of some of the attributes I\u2019ve labeled as weaknesses, you\u2019ll probably appreciate the show a lot more than I've indicated, and if you do mind the sound of same, you might not choose to give it the benefit of the doubt, as I have.",

            "content": "So you're looking for a good horror anime to watch and you come across Tasogare Otome x Amnesia. You read the summary and think it sounds pretty good so you watch the first episode. It starts out perfect, giving you a feeling that something creepy is going to happen then BAM!..they add in some corny comic relief. Most of the anime is like this, it'll give you a creepy feeling, then it'll ruin it by trying to add in some comedy.\r\nTasogare Otome x Amnesia (also known as Dusk Maiden of Amnesia) is about a boy named Niiya Teiichi who is part of the Paranormal Investigationsclub at his school, along with three other members, Kanoe Kirie, Okonogi Momoe, and the most famous ghost of the school, Yuuko. The thing is, only Teiichi and Kirie are able to see and touch Yuuko while the rest of the school's population cannot. This anime is mainly about this club investigating the paranormal rumours that haunt the school, as well as the mystery of what really happened to Yuuko in the past and why she cannot remember it.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\r\nThe idea of the story is very interesting, though the comic relief ruins it for me. In my opinion, this anime gets really great towards its finale when things finally start to get more serious. The serious scenes in this anime were great, especially when they gave me that creepy feeling. If only the whole anime was like that it would've been perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime was all right. The characters were given a more cute, young, child-like look to them, but I don't think they're something worth praising.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nI really liked the soundtrack of this anime. The background music that played when it started to get creepier was great! I also really liked the opening and ending! They were really perfect!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime weren't really the best, in my opinion. There wasn't anything really special about them and some of them actually were pretty annoying (mainly Okonogi).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for a creepy horror anime that'll give you chills, don't watch this because you'll be disappointed like I was. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia was an all right anime for me, but I probably won't rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! This is my first time writing one so please feel free to give me some feedback and criticism so that I can improve! :)",

I found this on my kissanme bookmark and remembered somebody had recommended this to me before but since I was not a fan of horror genre I didnt watch it immediately. But somehow from the first episode of this anime I was hooked and it turned out pretty good too.\r\nThe artwork and animation was beautiful. They used the artwork brilliantly to differentiate between the \u201cmain characters\u201d and the \u201cother people\u201d at a level even superior to Durarara!! The \u201cghosts\u201d were also drawnvery well, as a mass of dark formless matter which took different forms at different situations. The use of darkness and colour heightened the atmosphere and it was almost like I was living in the anime which definitely is a proof of how good it is.. The music was very good too. The OP and ED both were catchy and the in anime OSTs were almost perfect. The voice acting also didnt leave much to be desired. The various emotions of differently people were splendidly portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty coherent. It is based on the life of a dead girl and goes back and forth in time, in her memories, to arrive at a solution to what they were searching for. The timing of the \u201cold memories\u201d episode was perfect too. Many a time I have been irritated by the \u201cold memory\u201d episode, I found it out of place but not in this one. And of course I enjoyed the anime. A lot. Its been a while since I enjoyed a romance anime this much..\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the plot. The plot was refreshing. It had a bit of mystery and horror. But the way they handled the \u201cghost\u201d and the \u201cdisorder\u201d was amazing. The ending was almost perfect till they messed it up a bit going in the path to appease the commonwealth. It was a touching story and showed how bad \u201cfanaticism\u201d can be. It subtly also showed that this fanaticism never yields good results even though it itself is a supernatural anime. The romance factor is handled well too, the way I like it, with a nice development and fulfillment at the very end. I call these type of anime \u201csoft romance\u201d and trust me if its done well, it can put many proper romantic anime to shame. This one almost achieves that.\\n\\n\r\n It is a very good watch. I sure most if not all will find something to connect to",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Niiya Teiichi (Yonaga, Tsubasa), a student at Seikyou Academy, loses his way when exploring one of the older school buildings when he encounters a girl named Kanoe Yuuko (Hara, Yumi). It turns out that she is the ghost who has haunted the school for 60 long years and the source of the many horror stories and recounts of paranormal activity that circulate among the students. As she does not remember how she died, she and Teiichi along with Okonogi Momoe (Fukuen, Misato) and Kanoe Kirie (Kitamura, Eri) form the Paranormal Investigations club in order to discoverwhat led to Yuuko\u2019s death and uncover the many mysteries of the school.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story takes place in a school setting, the cast of characters is actually fair short, consisting of the main four characters and then occasionally introducing side-characters for small 1-2 episode mini arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are pretty tolerable overall. Teiichi himself feels a little typical in his design and voice however he has a few points that make him endearing enough \u2013 chiefly of which is his dedication to Yuuko. While the show most definitely has some harem elements, it plays mostly upon the relationship between Teiichi and Yuuko and treats any other romantic interests as a comedic backdrop to the actual romance of the story. In this way, Teiichi does seem to genuinely care for Yuuko and goes above and beyond the more shallow, noncommittal iterations of the main character in a romance show in the way he actively displays his affection.\\n\\n\r\nKanoe Yuuko is similarly forwards with her feelings however even more so. I think that she is the best written member of the cast and her sometimes overly attached attitude and hands-on, affectionate nature really helps convey that she has felt very alone for a long time and is ecstatic at the thought of interacting with someone who can see and touch her. She operates equally well in both comedic and dramatic situations and is often the source of both.\\n\\n\r\nOf the group, Kanoe Kirie is the most serious of them however this mood is sometimes undercut by her jealousy of Yuuko and her relationship with Teiichi for primarily comedic purposes. Okonogi Momoe joins the club because of her somewhat fanatical approach to the supernatural and is, ironically so, the only person of the main cast who can\u2019t see or interact with Yuuko. She exists almost entirely for comedy\u2019s sake in my opinion and doesn\u2019t really feature any development or plot-related intrigue so I felt she was a little superfluous overall.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are fairly subdued which helps the show along in its horror and school elements. The show itself actually has a great deal of visual elements that lend themselves very well to its horror scenes and settings the most notable of which was the refreshingly dynamic directing approach of Oonuma Shin. Outside of utilizing fairly interesting shots in general, the show makes constant use of the white space of the screen to show the scene in animated slides amidst a black surrounding (in my experience, the techniques implored were similar to his other work in directing Ef: A Tale of Memories and its sequel). This technique worked very well given the horror tones of the show as it gave the visuals a dark and claustrophobic vibe when used. There is even an episode shot almost entirely in first person POV which I thought was really fun and worked quite well within the story. One of my only major qualms was that occasionally the body movements during dialogue would look outlandishly out of place with added motion or unrealistic movement but it happened rarely enough that I could overlook it. All in all, the visuals were one of the strongest points of the show and while the art itself may not have been crisp as one might desire, the style with which the show is executed makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nOtome x Amnesia is a little weird in that the combination of its genres are somewhat contradictory and this is one of my primary concerns with the show. Firstly, it works quite well as a horror show \u2013 the meat of the story is done in this genre and the overall tones are of this type as well. Romance is not necessarily a new sub-element within the horror genre either and in fact it feels quite at home within this show as well with the exception of the out of place harem themes and fairly consistent fan-service. Lastly, the show busies itself (unnecessarily in my opinion) with the comedy genre \u2013 depicting most character interactions outside of the straight-up horror scenes comically.\\n\\n\r\nIn other attempts to occupy multiple, sometimes conflicting, genres some shows feel like they become one genre first and foremost and the others are added for flavor however I can say that in the cast of Otome x Amnesia they are surprisingly equally present throughout the course of the show with horror being slightly predominant. What this all boils down to is that the show tries to be all of these things proportionally and it doesn\u2019t really work for it. In my opinion, it could have been quite good had it only presented its horror and romance elements and nixed its pseudo-ecchi and comedic attributes. I found that the comedy undercut the serious moments of the show and when each horror scene is sandwiched by a comedic moment on either side with them intermittently spliced within \u2013 it ultimately cheapens the effect and tarnishes the mood. The comedy itself is not outstanding either and so I feel like it only exists to fill the gaps in action within the show while providing some sex appeal in the way of its fan-service.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good enough but nothing I can make special note of. It mainly occupied the low-toned, ominous background style often seen in horror shows and it worked well for the show. It would play up the music slightly given the romantic scenes and relax a bit when things turned comedic so everything more or less functioned as expected in this regard.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nI thought the show, by way of its style and its story, was interesting and fun however I felt the overall experience was marred a bit by the fan-service, harem elements, and generic comedy. I think the show fell short in some regards and while I think it featured a good deal of potential it didn\u2019t quite achieve would it could have for me.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 5 because, while it had some genuinely interesting and well-executed elements, it had an equal share of issues that made it feel mediocre in my mind however I still found it watchable for its high points.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to people that enjoy those that enjoy the horror genre \u2013 it makes up the small majority of the show and is done quite well in a variety of ways. The romance wasn\u2019t bad and anyone that is a fan of relationships that get to the point rather quickly instead of stumbling around for a while in the \u2018who likes who?\u2019 phase would do fine in picking this up. In general, anyone that can overlook the kind of typical comedy and fan-service should be able to enjoy the show just fine but if that kind of stuff is a turn off or might ruin the more serious mood of the anime than I suggest they stay away.",

            "content": "Tasogare otome x Amnesia is a complex and unusual anime that doesn't really fit the well-known pattern of ghost stories. But still... Ghost of a girl [checked], haunted school [checked], scary moments [checked]...Then why is this anime different?\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is about Yuuko, a girl who died 60 years ago but whose ghost still haunts the hallways of Seikyou Academy. The only uncommon thing about this ghost is that it's not an ugly faceless bleeding monster, but a sexy and funny girl who takes mackery to a whole new level. Teiichi, Kirie and Momoe are the three members of the Paranormal Investigation Club who tryto unravel the mystery of Yuuko. However, Teiichi is the only one capable of seeing Yuuko, which makes him, undoubtedly, fall in love with her. And so, the story goes on, with the 4 main characters trying to make Yuuko remember why she died and why she can't rest in peace.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10\\n\r\nBoth art and sound are outstanding. The characters are well-drawn, with many distinctive features and so are the outside sceneries. The sound provides at the same time a friendly atmosphere and a totally freaking scary atmosphere when Dark Yuuko appears and supernatural occurs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYuuko, despite being a ghost, is one of those crafty, deceptive and attractive girls that makes any other female character envious of her beauty and sharpness. However, she shows a lot of emotions: from total carelessness to complete emotional attachement to Teiichi. She can be both a good and a bad ghost whenever she wants. Teiichi, on the other hand is one of those shy boys, always following the rules and trying not to upset anyone, but at the same time he can show a lot of courage, willing to die for the sake of others. This is a very interesting combination of characters. Due to the fact that Teiichi is the only guy who can see Yuuko, makes her fall in love with him and that goes for Teiichi, too. I mean, who could possibly resist such an attractive ghost? \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship evolves so much during the series. They learn what love is and become more attached to each other. Even they belong to two different worlds, that doesn't seem to be a problem for them, showing us that love conquers everything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really really enjoyed watching this. While the beggining was funny with lots of jokes, the ending almost made me cry. I didn't even notice when the anime took this abrupt turn but I'm glad it did because I was able to experience a large variety of emotions watching only 12 episodes of the masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nTasogare otome x amnesia is a good anime, but not one of the best. I still rated it 9 beacuse of the beautiful ending and great character development. I would gladly recommend it to everyone looking for a not-so-common ghost story with both happiness and sadness wrapped in a single package.",

It's based in a school setting where a boy wanders off into an area that is no longer used and is able to see a ghost.  At first he doesn't believe her, but as the day goes on he starts to realize that she may in fact be a ghost.  This anime looks to be a good one.  I am excited it made me laugh, andhad that level of mystery that makes me want to keep coming back for me.  I cannot wait to see what else they have in store!  Will they find out how she died or who killed her?",

            "content": "I went into Dusk Maiden of Amnesia expecting a dark dramatic horror-style thrill ride with a hint of mystery, Instead I got all that and a light hearted rom-com as-well. Now you're probably thinking how is that even possible and wouldn't that formula equate to a pretty messed-up anime? well the answer is no, It actually creates a very enjoyable unique viewing experience which the anime industry needs more of.\r\nDespite saying that, the story isn't very appealing or great by itself, It is when the spectacular art direction comes in, the story's full potential is realized.\r\n= Story (8) = \r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story featuresa lot of genres not usually seen accompanying one another, but it still works out great. The problem doesn't lie there, though rather with the stories appeal and entertainment value. You see the old 'character with amnesia' and 'ghost and human forbidden love' plot points have been used quite a number of times, spanning across books, movie 's and TV series and makes the story feel quite clich\u00e9d.        \\n\\n\r\nHowever, with character back-stories, the intriguing setting, numerous slice-of-life type sub-plots and the presence of some very unusual plot devices cancel out that clich\u00e9d feeling and makes the story seem rather unique.\\n\\n\r\n= Art (9) & Art Direction (10) =        \\n\r\nArt is very well done, the studio has managed to capture the right sort of tone and look for the series. Character designs aren't anything special but they don't have to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt Direction is something that people don't really look for in a series, usually since there's nothing special about it compared with all the other thousands of anime series out there. Though, the direction in this series is extremely noticeable and rather incredible. The way the director uses lighting is especially brilliant and very artistic, he manages to manipulate the tone of the story with ease. The director (Shin \u014cnuma btw) also uses a number of screen effects to make the series more compelling, such as using manga type composition. Another interesting trick the director uses is the 'blacking out' of all background characters, which I think adds a little something to the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing I'd like to add is that first-person effect episodes were excellently crafted and very memorable.  \\n\\n\r\n= Character (8) =\\n\r\nThe small amount of characters in this anime were all interesting, especially Yukko's character which I found very compelling. It's a shame however that the other three main characters were shunned a bit and more development could've easily been made, especially Okonogi, who we really know hardly anything about and significance in the main story is hardly felt. \\n\\n\r\n= Sound (8) =\\n\r\nI didn't have any problem with the seiyuu's chosen for their respective parts and I think all performances were done rather good. The OST fitted nicely though nothing memorable, The OP and ED weren't really to my taste though resonated with the story nicely.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (9) =\\n\r\nThe series is very enjoyable from start to finish, you'll be laughing, scared sh*tless and maybe even crying throughout the twelve episodes and probably even wanting more once you finish the series. \\n\\n\r\n= Overall (8.5) =\\n\r\nOverall, Dusk Maiden or Tasogare x Otome is a great series, It's very unique for it's blending of genres, It's intriguing story, the splendid art and art direction which is simply a masterpiece, It's alright sound, the characters, even though there could've been more development for them and the series enjoyment levels.",

The anime it self can be compared to \"AnoHana\" but with a much darker and naugthy side into it, I limit it to a 7 because it is a bit simple since it involves Teiichi Niiya who serves as Yuuko's comfort in fact for the rest of the episode it is always like that so forthe \"Enjoyment\" I gave it a \"Poor\" number 3, because I kinda find the Yuuko X Teiichi arc as irritating since it kinda suggest that Yuuko would wanna pop Teiich's cherries. in which I would have suggest that some ecchi be added into this. But, alas the ecchi element about Yuuko is  disappointing. Then again the ending did make up for this anime's short comings so for the \"Overall\" I give it a good number 7.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other parts:\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince I like the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nHere's why:\\n\\n\r\nTeiichi Niiya- At one point he seems to be uneasy with Yuuko's constant sexual advances, however he also doesn't do anything make her behave nor does he avoid her, in fact I can't make out if wheather or not he enjoy's Yuuko's constant pestering or is he simply too stupid to let Yuuko do what she wants with him.\\n\\n\r\n Yuuko Kanoe- I hate it when she seemly forgets that she's a ghost and Teiichi is in the world of the living, that they can never have a normal relationship, I also hate the way she treats him as if he is her property. I also find her more of an irritating character as if that you would want her to be the antagonist, but the only nice thing here is that she is one antagonist which I would like to give a nice ending.\\n\\n\r\nMomoe Okonogi - Here is another character which I find to be irritating, co'z she seem to believe any urban legends she come across. But then again there is this sliver lining about her where I wish that after Yuuko goes to the other side, she and Teiichi would have an arc, another is since this anime has a comedy genre in it, she kinda serves as that genre.\\n\\n\r\nKirie Kanoe- One thing about her, is that she is a mere filler that anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSide comment, Wtf does Yuuko have to come back?!\\n\\n",

It is truly inspiring seeing such an interesting story about ghosts and how they evolve around feelings.\r\nArtwork isn't very successful but I overlooked it as I was wrapped in the shroud of the mystery.\r\nCharacters are quite stereotypical with the exception of the femaleprotagonist but the story makes  them evolve in different ways than other series.\\n\r\nSo if you are a fan of mysteries and ghosts then succumb to this new world called Seikyou",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free(?) after thought. Apologies if my review offends any lovers of this show. That being said, I was kind of disappointed with the show.\r\nFor me, this show is analagous to SAO (hear me out first...) in that I came in with certain expectations of what the show was about (SAO: action, world exploration, Tasagore: mystery/horror) and the first episode confirmed my expectations. But as the show progressed it became very apparent that this was really an anime centered around romance with harem vibes. I guess this divergence from my expectations was a huge reason why I could't enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\n~~As a romance anime...~~\\n\r\nMindsets should first be adjusted as this show is really a romance anime with a supernatural setting. But as a romance anime it just didn't resonate with me. Maybe I was turned off by the many unnecessary fan service so I couldn't view the characters relationship seriously? Maybe because the characters just sort of fell in love with each other with no strong reasons? Was it because of weak characterization? But I feel its mostly because there wasn't anything fresh/refreshing brought to the table. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I really object to how the show ended. **SPOILER skip to next section!!**                                          Necromancy cheapens the feels.\\n\\n\r\n~~As a horror/mystery anime...~~\\n\r\nThe focus of the show being romance aside, there wasn't much of a payoff to the mystery's resolution. \\n\r\n1. It was casually revealed early in the story, so the tension is lost. It feels like collecting your exam script after you have already been informed of your grades.\\n\r\n2. It was cliche. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime didn't give me the sense of cold creeping dread or horror, and mind you, I'm the sort of person who's too scared to watch any horror movies plus I was watching this anime alone in my room on a dark and stormy (slightly...) day.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, while sexuality and horror does blend well together, the anime's particular brand of blatant, targeted at pubescent boys, \"you like this?\" fan service is very jarring in a horror setting. Personally, I feel it destroys the gravity of the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n~~Characters~~\\n\r\nThere was really nothing special or memorable about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nYuuko could be interesting, but her personality for the early half of the anime was defined by fan service and jealousy. Though showing a more layered personality in the later episodes, Yuuko is not a character that could stand alone as her own, her being and purpose revolves inescapably as a love interest for our main lead Niiya. This is likewise for Niiya\\n\\n\r\nThe 2 side characters were underdeveloped and their sole purpose was to be fodder to develop the main leads' relationship.    \\n\\n\r\n~~Art and Sound~~\\n\r\nFor me this was the standard expected of anime nowadays, good stuff but nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\n~~I'm SORRY!~~\\n\r\nThis is a rather one sided review, but there are more than enough better worded reviews espousing the goodness of the anime. \\n\r\nBased on probability alone, I expect that you would end up enjoying the anime, but for me, it just wasn't what I wanted to see.",

But they decided to bring the heroin back and that to me was their downfall. \r\nA few untied loose ends but not enough to hate the ending. Extreme sadness then overjoyed happiness flowed throughout the last few moments of the show, even a few tears swelled up in this 14 year old dork. Clint Bickham, Emily Neves, Brittney Karbowski and Jessica Boone did an outstanding job I highly recommend the English Dubbed version. The show overall waswell worth my time, so what are you still doing here reading this review?",

            "content": "The first couple episodes make you think that this series is a semi-ecchi, light hearted mystery series, where a ghost and some other people go around solving weird minor happenings around the school. There's a few hints that the series is alluding to something much darker, but this sense gets mostly swept away by the overall flirtiness that is Yuuko and her antics. Overall it's kinda interesting to watch, but nothing really hooks you to continue to watch the series besides the humor.\r\nUntil about episode 7. Oh episode 7. This series legitimately starts getting good here, and the plot gets kicked up by about 20notches. It's hard to say anything without spoilers, but there's a pretty big and unexpected event that happens in this episode that made the series a whole lot darker than it was before. \\n\\n\r\n- Character -\\n\\n\r\nThe series is entirely driven by the two main characters: Yuuko and Teiichi. They're both cute and adorable, and I actually care what happens to them, moreso as the series progresses. I can tell you right now that how much you enjoy this series will be directly proportional to how much you like Yuuko, whose story is the main focus of this anime, if you couldn't tell by the title. Yuuko seems pretty air-headed and carefree, but even this becomes a plot device later in the series. Well-played, anime creators, well played. \\n\\n\r\nPreface: I'm a girl. So the intense flirtiness that the main character Yuuko exudes isn't exactly a turn on for me. The main hook that this anime had on me was the story of this girl's past. The series did a pretty good job of making this anime generally light-hearted and funny, but dark enough to make me seriously concerned about some of the characters and the mysteries behind them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Yuuko's voice actress is pretty darn amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, I would say the weaknesses would be the other characters. Nothing about their character stands out, falling mostly into the typical tsundere and always-happy characters.  Neither of them are really truly developed, and they easily fall into the background until they're used as a convenient plot devices (post episode 7). Not to say that they weren't developed at all, or that they don't add enjoyment and depth to the series, but they weren't treated as being as instrumental as I thought they would be. But in the end, this is a story about Teiichi and Yuuko, so maybe that was to be expected.\\n\\n\r\n- Plot -\\n\\n\r\nThe series is around a 6 before episode seven, and a solid 8 afterwards. Stick with it if you actually care about Yuuko's past, because it pretty much made me really respect her way more than I did previously.\\n\\n\r\n*edit* Ok, the last episode made me cry.  :'( This series was pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nIf your taste is usually high quality anime, if your come into this series with very low expectations, you may enjoy this more than you expect. \\n",

            "content": "Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. Even that title alone may convince some viewers to watch this series. But what you may least expect would be a ghost troll (a hot ghost troll if I may add) hanging out with the main protagonist on a daily basis doing cute little things here and there. \r\nThe story covers the Paranormal Investigation Club, a club that deals with the supernatural. From there, we have the other members starting with Teiichi Niiya, probably the only normal member of the group. He maintains an unusual relationship with our ghost troll Yuuko in which despite her flirtatious and mischievous attempts at him,he still values her as a friend and not forget her. Then, there's Momoe Okonogi, the most enthusiastic member of the group. Her enthusiasm of the the club is probably over the limits in Niiya's point of view as far as she shows the most interest in finding out what happened 50 years ago involving our lovely ghost troll, Yuuko. Of course, she still hangs out around the club while creating many mischievous interactions between herself and Niiya. Next, we have the Kirie Kanoe, the not so enthusiastic member. At first glance, she seems normal but when you get to know her more, you'll find that she's a very insecure person. Why? Well, for nearly every 5 minutes, she goes on about the dangers of Yuuko and warns Niiya to be on his guard. She can be seen as the antithesis of Yuuko for even though her outside (appearance) may resemble her somewhat, her inner self is worlds apart. \\n\\n\r\nThen, finally our lovely ghost troll Yuuko, who can forget about her? After all, she is the star of the series and the \"dusk maiden\" of amnesia. Her flirtatious attitude with our main protagonist is guilty pleasure and some of the guys watching this might be biting their fingernails about how lucky he is. (I know I am at least sometimes) However, it does seems that despite playful self, she harbors a dark past she tries to keep herself a secret from anyone. She tries hard to forget about her past and make it into an amnesia but there's one thing you cannot forget: you can't run away from your problems like an amnesia. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, even for stories like this, there would be fan-service, pool parties, and those cute \"love-love\" scenes. Then there is always those \"horror\" scenes mixed in with light comedy and even psychological twists later on. However so far, this series is not another Another (no pun intended). I mean seriously, let's ask ourselves: who actually got scared out of their pants in the first episode? \\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, there is definitely an eerie atmosphere behind the curtains and lies beyond the horizon of the dusk. We also later learns the truth behind Yuuko's death and the hatred she developed that manifested as the her ying and yang. Hate is definitely a strong word this time around as her darker self becomes one of the driven antithesis of Yuuko's cheerful self. As she deals with her past with her new profound friend Niiya, they must cope with the horrors that may lie in the future.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, I find the art of the series to be gorgeous as well as the various well captured angles of \"dusk\" in this anime and the night moon skies. Kudos to Silver Link I say, you sure know how to set a high bar for this season. As for the sound, it's not something you'll listen to while studying for your university entrance exam but it's also something catchy that fits the overall story. And take notice the OP and ED song that our beloved ghost troll Yuuko-san seems to be imitating. She would go pretty far in American Idol I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find Dusk Maiden of Amnesia to be entertaining and makes Sundays a wonderful relaxing day to finish off the weekend. Its balanced light comedy and seriousness is something that most of us will notice and while it doesn't reach the necessity horror levels of some other series you may have seen in the past, it does makes it up with its entertainment and value. Its darker tone of the story later on will keep some of you viewers glued to your seat. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an unique anime at that and one such series this Spring Season that I'm sure most of us will not forget like an amnesia. (at least I hope)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mixing very different themes together can sometimes produce surprising results, but there's a big risk involved with this approach to storytelling and original concepts that are formed using this process often fall at the first hurdle. There are always exceptions to this guideline, but in anime these are usually adaptations of some other media that are often the result of hopeful popularity forecasts and a severe lack of common sense.\r\nThankfully, Tasogare Otome x Amnesia (Dusk Maiden of Amnesia), manages to steer its way through the conversion rapids - but not without taking some damage along the way.\r\nBased on the manga by Maybe, the story revolvesaround the unusual relationship between Niiya Teiichi - a middle school student at Seikyou Private Academy and a senior member of the Paranormal Investigation Club - and the club president Kanoe Yuuko - the spirit of a female student who died in the abandoned school building 60 years before. The story begins with a rather humourous series of events that are initially shown from the perspective of Okonogi Momoe - a girl who is blissfully unaware of Yuuko's presence - and the beauty of the scene is that it not only forms a surprisingly good introduction to the main characters, but that the impact of this is reinforced when the events are replayed to expose the joke.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately things don't really proceed so well for the rest of the series as, although there is an actual story behind everything, the plot is broken up into a series of short arcs that only last one or two episodes. It's an approach that can be surprisingly flexible when used correctly, and given the importance of the ubiquitous \"seven mysteries of [insert name here] school\" it's understandable why this method was used. Sadly the move from manga to anime has been far too rushed, and the compression of information causes too great a shift in pace between each arc. In addition to this there are several major plot points that are noticeably absent in the anime - mainly because the shadow of early adaptation reared its ugly head again. Dusk Maiden is yet another show that has suffered the ignominy of being animated before the manga was complete, and this causes a few contextual problems that the writers have tried to gloss over - with varying degrees of success.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most adaptations the character designs are taken directly from the source material, and as with the majority of school-based romantic comedies there isn't really anything special in this department. That said, Dusk Maiden is stylistically and aesthetically pleasing to the eye - mainly because director Oonuma Shin has applied a number of the visual tricks and techniques that he used in the \"ef\" series. Unfortunately the character animation isn't as crisp as it could be and some of the movements are a little odd, but aside from that (and several moments of shoddy line work along with the repeated use of low angles and sunsets - which can become a little tiresome after a while), SILVER LINK have produced a good-looking show. The design mentality works particularly well in a number of scenes, serving as a pleasing visual reference to reinforce the show's genre foundations of horror and romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden does contain some fanservice (it's a school-based romantic comedy with harem elements after all), but the approach is far less aggressive than that of a number of anime out there. These moments are often caused by Yuuko's carpicious nature and the amusement she derives from making Teiichi uncomfortable - which is a nice change from the usual protagonist falling face-first onto a random girl (or her falling on him).\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting aspect of the series that does bear mentioning is the overt symbolism related to Noh and Kabuki theater - Momijigari. The meaning of the repetitive red and yellow maple leaves is something that can be easily passed of as a way to make the scene look good, but it's actually a subtle reference to stories about a beautiful maiden/princess who was actually a demon in disguise, and who is ultimately killed by the man she is attempting to seduce. It's a surprisingly telling visual device that, once understood, gives the plot some extra weight and sets a performing precedent that the voice actors and scriptwriters can build on.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden opens with Suzuki Konomi's \"Choir Jail\" - accompanied by a straightforward visual medley to introduce the main characters mixed with the maple leaf metaphor. The closing theme is somewhat noteworthy - showing Yuuko sitting against a window in what is presumably the abandoned school building, singing \"Karandorie\" by Okui Aki while the sun sets. Both sequences feature some decent audio/visual choreography, and this is largely true for the majority of the series. The score contains a variety of tracks that add some nice background to scenes and jokes, and there's some surprisingly good effects work on display - although this is offset by a degree of untidiness, and the usual comedy-centric noises can sometimes feel out-of-place.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the series crosses two very specific genres there's always the danger of the script going from one extreme to another - especially with an adaptation of an unfinished work - and while this does happen on some occasions the writers have maintained a pretty good balance between the disparate elements for the majority of the story. The Japanese dub fares particularly well because of this, but the translation into English could have been approached in a more intuitive manner as it is a bit too ... literal. Tsubasa Yonaga handles the role of the befuddled and slightly put-upon Teiichi very well, and Hara Yumi delivers a good performance as the precocious amnesiac ghost Yuuko. Kitamura Eri (Kanoe Kirie), and Fukuen Misato (Okonogi Momoe),  also work rather well in their supporting roles, and while the all of the voice actors have moments that don't quite fit, their collective efforts are pretty decent.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the English dub is rife with issues that could easily have been resolved during the translation and ADR processes - which is probably why Clint Bickham seems to struggle with the role of Teiichi and Emily Neves (Yuuko), seems unable to pronounce her love interest's name correctly. Jessica Boone offers some solace as Kirie, but it's the talented and highly experienced Britney Karbowski who suffers the most as Momoe. The lacklustre scripting issues are underlined by the adherence to literal translation, so the entire English dub is littered with out-of-place terms and the rage-inducing 'kun', 'san', etc - all of which have a big effect on the viewer's perception of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt first Teiichi appears to be little more than the common-or-garden lead male in a romantic comedy (with some harem elements), but he does have some good points as, unlike other stories of this type, he is determined to stay with Yuuko. In this respect he has more in common with the likes of Morisato Keiichi from \"Ah! Megami-sama\" than the usual harem leads of the last decade. As for the ghost herself, Yuuko is very clearly an extremely lonely character who, upon finding that someone can see and touch her, displays her affection in much the same way an abandoned puppy would to someone who fed and cared for it. The development of the relationship between these two is one of the central pillars of the storyline, and it's interesting to see the progression of their relationship clash with Teiichi's desire to know how Yuuko died and her desire to run away from anything that hurts or upsets her.\\n\\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that time restraints and the need to leave a major chunk of the plot out of the ending (because it hadn't been written), meant that Kirie's growing friendship with Teiichi and her relationship with Yuuko are never fully realised - especially as the latter adds a competely different tone to the ending of the series. The sad part is that anyone who has read the manga will understand just how much has been left out, and the meaning behind the sinister shadow becomes much more horrifying than the anime depicts.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia is predominantly a story of what could have been. The decision for early adaptation, combined with the limitations of a twelve episode series, has forced a number of edits and alterations that are noticeable - but only if the viewer has read the manga. While it lacks the punch of the source material - particularly at the end - the series offers some interesting concepts, a few laughs, and a rather sweet relationship between a boy and a ghost. The stylish visuals work surprisingly well with the storyline, and although the series plays fast and loose with some of its elements, several themes are dealt with in an astute manner. Aside from the issues with the English dub the narrative holds together quite well - which is an achievement for an adaptation of an unfinished story that has been crammed into a short series while trying to cover the holes in the plot.",

            "content": "Hmmm I rarely consider any anime as 10's, but Dusk Maiden of Amnesia truly was an impressive piece of work. It's saddening to see so many negative reviews of it.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThere is one tiny flaw in the story: it's slightly hard to follow. If you don't really pay attention to what the characters tell you, it can be easy to fall behind and get confused. Nonetheless, if you can follow the explanations, the story will be awesome. Story wise, it's really as the synopsis says: the school ghost Yuuko can't remember her past whatsoever, and the main protagonist along with some others form a clubto help her discover it. Now, the synopsis makes the story sound extremely spooky and the anime is classified as horror, but it really isn't, so if you're not a fan of horror stories, do not worry. It's more of a thriller and mystery; the horror elements are almost nothing. In fact, there's a lot of comedic moments since it is a romance. \\n\r\nBut I think the way in which they tell the story is flawless. The beginning episodes may seem a bit filler since they're individualistic and don't seem to contribute plot movement at first, but they're important to the story as a whole, which is what I was saying before about following the story closely. The pace at which they reveal details is perfect as they don't try to flood you with too many revelations, but leave just enough cliffhangers to make you watch the next episode. And like a true mystery story, they don't completely leave the viewer in the blind; you too will be able to decipher the mystery with some thinking. This may cause some people to think it a predictable anime, and while the ending was sort of expected, I would not say it was predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNormally art style isn't a huge aspect in a lot of anime, but since this is technically a horror (it really isn't scary I promise), the visuals are semi-important, and I think the artists did a wonderful job portraying the thriller elements. The art sort of reminded me of the Bakemonogatari series, and for those who have seen that, the art was extremely important in making it fantastic, just like in this series. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFitting music for a mystery anime. The opening and ending themes were alright; they weren't amazing but the sound effects and spooky motifs were perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI think this is where other people would have the most disagreements with me. There's a lot of criticism for the male protagonist since he's sort of cliche, and while that is true, I think his slightly cliche personality was important to developing Yuuko, the truly interesting character of this series. Because she's a ghost with amnesia on a journey to discover her past, her personality naturally changes as she recovers memories, and this extremely unpredictable and dynamic character makes the series fun to watch because you really never know what she'll do next, and the predictability of the male protagonist molds well with hers. If both characters were too dynamic, it would make the story too chaotic since it is a mystery by nature and the viewer already has to keep track of the plot and all its details. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI normally don't watch horror/thriller/mystery whatever you want to call it, but I was definitely not disappointed. If you're hesitating because you don't like horror (I personally get scared pretty easily), don't let that stop you because the horror aspects are minimal and only add to the excitement of the mystery. It's a story with funny moments and emotional moments, and enough plot twists to keep you watching. There were honestly no flaws that were significant enough to decrease the quality of this anime, and I think this show appeals to a broad range of fans: those who love romance, mystery, or just a good story with highly developed characters will find this show enjoyable. So please give it a watch!\\n\\n\r\nIf you found this helpful, please click so, it means a lot!",

            "content": "Excellent storytellers always have a way to weave suspense and doubt throughout their works so subtly that you can feel somethings wrong but not think it. Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is an adaptation from the similarly named manga following Teiichi and Yuuko as they expand their relationship and face the chaotic horrors born from the catacombs of fear deep within each students mind. Providing a brilliant mix of horror, romance, and drama, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia makes you feel genuine fear, contentment and sadness. \r\nStory - 7\r\nOne can never expect a deep and compelling plot from shows focusing on romance, the show usually depends oncharacter relationships to hold the anime together. However while Dusk Maiden suffers from the lack of a gripping plot, the simplicity of the narrative is one of its strongest points. The horror is intense enough to keep yourself checking behind you every few minutes in uneasiness, and mysterious enough to make you wonder \"What exactly is behind all this?\". The horror leads up to and settles down nicely in the conclusion. With the simplicity of the plot we are drawn into the world of Dusk Maiden, but not enough that it detracts from the true essence of the story: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link never fails to provide quirky yet majestically beautiful visuals. Every character is handled with care, the backgrounds are stunningly effective at setting the mood, and the directing is top notch. The only thing bringing the art down from a ten is how static the characters' movements are. Subtracting that from the equation Dusk Maiden provides the quintessence of horror visuals, with each scene perfectly encapsulating a different variety of fear; insanity, doubt, sacrifice, and above all, fear of the unknown. Of course the directing and art aren't limited to horror scenes. With Shaft-like directing we are treated to a kaleidoscope of different angles and settings that make the important scenes quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maidens soundtrack itself is mediocre, I'm writing this with no recollection of any memorable tracks besides the opening, ending, and insert song. However even if the score is sub-par the tracks still correctly set the tone and mood of the scenes where they are used. And although I enjoyed the opening, it's inclusion at the end of the final episode ruined the mood which doesn't sit well with me. The ending was adequately suited to the show, providing a melancholic feel. Shifting the actual ending sequence itself provides excellent foreshadowing which is well done. Onto the insert song. The inclusion of this song in the finale was THE most brilliant thing the director of this show chose to do. It absolutely PERFECTLY  sets the mood of the last episode, and I was bawling my eyes out the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nOur dynamic duo Teiichi and Yuuko share a fresh and different relationship compared to all the rabble churned out every season. Skipping the countless episodes of \"D-does he like me...? I don't know... Better postpone anything romantic until the penultimate episode...\" Dusk Maiden skips right into the lovey-dovey action. Some people may be put off by this but trust me, it's one of the shows greatest selling points. By choosing this relationship the studio has provided us with actual romance in the story instead of angsty teens, and provides us with a powerful ending that will throw your emotions into a roller coaster of turmoil. Yuuko as a character, Teiichi as a character and the relationship between them warrants a 10, but unfortunately the side-characters bring the rating down. There will be Kirie and Okonogi fans pissed at me saying this but when you have such a strong established romance the only thing potential rivals do is annoy you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe final and penultimate episodes are usually the strongest in the series, with Dusk Maiden being no exception. With the heartwarming romance, horror, and drama all converging throughout the story one would expect a finale that far exceeds the sum of its parts, and that is exactly what is delivered. The final episode caused a few tears to stream down my cheek, and the last anime that made me cry was Clannad After Story. The directing was done so well that during the episode I didn't know if I would be left a sniveling mess or the happiest camper since cavemen discovered fire.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nViewing Dusk Maiden of Amnesia was a pleasure each week, and while various nuances detracted from the shows overall enjoyment, it didn't keep the show from starting strong and ending with a bang. Whether you're looking for chilling horror, loving romance, tearful drama, or any combination of the three, you will enjoy Dusk Maiden. And remember, a story can be good whether it has a happy ending or a bittersweet one.",

Such a commanding presence compels you to embark as if she were waiting for you.\r\nPresentation is key.\r\nYou could have easily found yourself unamused by childish antics, or unamused with how she treated such activities so seriously. You instead found yourself captivated, reaching out to her to know more and to experience this quirky spectacle with her. This is no easy feat. It's a delicate balance, a tonal tightrope trod ever so gracefully by this charming vixen of aseries. This isn't to say she never loses that balance, but it\u2019s clear that she is a majestic raven.\\n\\n\r\nHer friends certainly have their own quirks, even if none of them are quite as fun as she is. They're at their best together, interacting with their daily ghost stories to varying degrees of knowledge and style. The mysteries they unravel and the misadventures they deal with are more than intriguing, whether they\u2019re about the girl or about these new friends of ours. It seems that romance also bloomed in front of you, adding another layer of charm to the group, to the maiden that inducted you, to the music you all hear, and to the wonderful environment she would constantly frolic in. It's strange since not everything should work as well as it does, and indeed it doesn't, but the fleeting yet lengthy time spent more than speaks for itself, for all its faults and all its whimsical, even theatrical wonders. \\n\\n\r\nThe maiden's dance ends. A bittersweet farewell always follows. For all the tripping and all the headache, it was fun while it lasted, this blissful dusk.",

            "content": "\u201cTasogare Otome x Amnesia\u201d tells the story of Kanoe Yuuko, a beautiful ghost girl who mysteriously died a gruesome death many years ago.  When I first heard of this anime, I thought immediately that it would be a very interesting anime to watch, since I was really into horror stories and such. However, when I think about it, I believe I overestimated the anime a bit. You may hate me when I say this which may automatically make you press that \u201cNot Helpful\u201d button, but either way I will say it. While watching the first five episodes of \u201cTasogare Otome x Amenisia,\u201d I findit a bit clich\u00e9; it was technically just your subtle anime with a few laughs, and a bit of mystery and horror mixed into it. \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\n\u201cDusk Maiden of Amnesia\u201d definitely seems like an acceptable anime with the little plots, synopsis, and summaries written about it. Ultimately, it is your normal anime with a dark feel, and a lot of comedy and romance latched onto it. However, the anime mostly contains comedy and romance which I find it to be quite ironic. Usually the summaries written about this anime give you the feel of horror and mystery, but when you watch the episodes you see too much romance. The only times you have a feeling of horror and mystery into it is when you see the Paranormal Investigation Club trying their very best to find clues about Yuuko\u2019s death, or when Yuuko is pretending to be a ghost just to scare the crap out of the main characters which is only a total of four. Lastly, the anime is way too fast paced, I kept on getting confused on like how much time has passed during the anime. To summarize it all up, I believe \u201cDusk Maiden of Amnesia\u201d does a terrible job at showing any type of plot development because it gives me the feel that it is mainly concentrating on showing the relationship between Yuuko and Teiichi. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main characters in this anime either show an advanced character development or an extreme lack of character development. The characters Yuuko and Teiichi are seen throughout this anime 80% of the time. I believe these two show too much character development because in just a short amount of time they already act like lovers who\u2019ve been together since childhood or something. The problem with this is that you see the same scene almost all the time: Yuuko seducing Teiichi, Yuuko making fun of Teiichi,   Yuuko touching Teiichi, Teiichi touching Yuuko, and both of them all lovey dovey. I love romance and all, but this is too much, I mean in just the first day they meet and you already see them on top of each other, it\u2019s too much of a fast development for me. The other main characters Momoe and Kirie are pretty much shown 20% of the time throughout the whole entire series; they barely receive any amount of screen time which results into barely any character development. As a result, I believe the creators only made them to act as \u2018extra\u2019 club members.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem I have with this anime is that it lacks background characters. I understand perfectly well that background characters are not that important to the anime, but seriously throughout the whole anime you just see four characters and their all the main characters! I don\u2019t know if you understand this, but minor and background characters may not be that important to an anime, however when you see the same characters every  episode, and no other characters at all, you slowly understand that  minor and background characters play the crucial role of making it seem more realistic to the viewer. I mean think about it, if you were a person trying their very best to find clues to some death at a school than you expect to see some people who know some information about it, or at least you see just some random people off into the distance chatting about God knows what! But this anime doesn\u2019t have any of that, just four characters in some big ass school. This anime takes place at a school, and at a school you have students, teachers, and all those other people, but there aren\u2019t any of them around in this anime; it makes me think to myself \u201cWhere the hell are the other students? I mean I\u2019m only seeing four characters the whole entire time, doesn\u2019t anybody go to this school?\u201d The only time I saw some actual background characters in this anime so far was on episode five, even if it was just a little bit it made me feel happy to know that some other people actually exist in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime seems like the only darn thing that is 100% perfectly fine! Even though the plot is all messed up, the art is like the only thing that makes me give this anime a decent score of 7 out of 10. The colors used in this anime were so pretty it makes me feel like I\u2019m looking at some painting. The animation was also very well done it had a great use of graphics and effects. Yep art perfect in every way. Indeed the background artists could do a bit more better job at making the backgrounds seem older to give the overall anime feel a bit of pizzazz, but it\u2019s still fine just the way it is. Oh and did you guys know that the people who drew this anime did a great job at showing some fan service? Well now you know, so if you like these sort of animes with fan service than you might actually think \u201cHoly crap, I\u2019m in Heaven.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSeems okay, I have no problems with the voices used in this anime nor the opening and ending songs of the anime. Though I don't know why, but both opening and ending songs didn't seem to attract much attention to me, I didn't really like them that much, but I still thought it was good for the whole mood. The only thing that needs fixing is the better use of background music to better add the mood of the events occurring throughout the show. If the anime had some special sound effects or my favorite, motivational music than I bet I would have rated the anime a little higher maybe up to a 7.5 if that option existed in MyAnimeList.net, I wish it did, it would make my reviews a lot more accurate. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment to \u201cTasogare Otome x Amnesia\u201d was definitely nothing special, I pretty much thought that it was boring. I didn't feel any type of suspense in this anime, no chair gripping, hair biting, mommy I\u2019m scared moments. It was just me sitting there, staring at the computer pretty much bored out of my mind watching Yuuko and Teiichi have some fun. Some parts in the anime did make me awe in adoration or laugh out loud towards the characters or some moments happening in it. Though I mainly just felt bored throughout the whole thing. I did feel a bit of jealously watching this anime since Yuuko and Teiichi\u2019s relationship together seem so perfect, they rarely have any arguments and such or some difficult obstacles they have to face in order for them to be together forever or something like that. I mean throughout the anime their always together, their love just seems perfect and all with no strings attached. God, you don\u2019t know how much I want a relationship like theirs; just watching them all lovey dovey makes me feel like I\u2019ll be forever alone. \\n",

            "content": "Seikyou Academy is a school whose history is steeped in myth and folktales, so much so that it even has a club dedicated to the investigation of the paranormal. Its members include Teiichi, a humble and unassuming boy; Kirie, a curt tomboy; Momoe, a ditsy and childish girl; and Yuuko, a flirtatious young woman. Oh, and Yuuko is actually a ghost who died in the basement of the school fifty years ago and the entire club is just a front put in place by Teiichi so that he can investigate the circumstances surrounding Yuuko's mysterious death. Yep. Anime.\r\nIn pure technicalities, Dusk Maiden is a prettygood-looking series. Productions which feature an element of horror or mystery can sometimes be guilty of straying too far to the \u201cdark\u201d side, but this show's color palette is all about contrast, with the high oranges and yellows of the titular dusk splendidly highlighting the deep purples, greens, and reds of the gloomy setting, as well as the pale features of key characters. The designs are pleasant, if leaning a little towards generic, the backgrounds are solidly detailed, and with the exception of a few off-model moments the art is of above-average quality. Some interesting choices in direction add heartily to the show, and they merit special mention. Many shots are angled to make rooms and hallways appear either smaller or larger than they are, adding an aura of claustrophobia or ominous openness to the setting. During moments of exposition, cuts to a brief black-and-white flashback or a series of still images illustrating a story are sometimes made\u2014these are animation budget saving tactics, sure, but they're creatively used and mesh well with the folklore/legend motif that persists throughout much of the series, so I say \u201cbravo.\u201d The end result is that this show is almost never boring to look at. Quite the opposite; its visuals add greatly to the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nAs impressive, though seldom as noticeable, is the musical score. It tends toward atmospheric noise, often relying on the eerie, echoic notes of a piano to gain the desired effect. Older, more traditional-sounding drums and chimes, slow and foreboding, sound right at home in the remnants of the decaying school building. Drama is sometimes accompanied by more complex orchestral compositions, but even these are usually integrated with a fair amount of subtlety. The most standout piece, a haunting vocal ballad, is used sparingly but effectively. The score can also be goofy, as the show can, but even the more lighthearted tracks usually have a thin coat of creepy applied to them, as if to present a playfully demented take on the school comedy soundtrack. That's a nice touch. Overall, the music does a lot while still feeling relatively minimal and unobtrusive, and I see no problem with that.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a recurring theme in Dusk Maiden, it\u2019s the thought that unpleasant feelings cannot simply be shied away from; whether consciously or unconsciously, people will be affected by their fears and insecurities. This is most evident in the form of Yuuko, who is literally torn in two by denial. She\u2019s able to maintain her jovial and lighthearted demeanor only because she has dissociated herself from her anger, jealousy, and the memories of her unjust death, which manifest themselves as a malevolent black entity termed Shadow Yuuko. Like the repressed doubts she represents, Shadow Yuuko always lingers in the background, waiting for a moment of weakness to exploit. Moreover, the series uses interesting internal logic to explain the appearances of ghosts. When the students look at a spirit, it takes a shape that is reminiscent of their own emotions. Those who are calm and have no preconceived notions about terrible things lurking about might see something benevolent, like Yuuko. But those who walk the dark halls of the school with anxieties eating away at them might see something altogether more sinister in her place. This is a theme of reasonable weight, and it\u2019s both conveyed consistently throughout the duration of the show and interwoven with the show's audiovisuals to create an atmosphere that can be rather entrancing.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko as a character is an interesting concept; a decent amount of thought is given to what it would really be like to be a ghost, weird as that may sound. She is starved for human contact, and understandably so\u2014most people can't see her, and those who can usually see her as something to run from, the Yuuko of urban legends. The series is good at conveying the feeling that most of what we're seeing isn't Yuuko as she was in life, but a Yuuko who is a product of her stale environment and the cruel way that her life ended\u2014a teenaged girl trying a little too hard to be a teenaged girl, her carefree and bubbly nature concealing all kinds of resentment, anger, and bitter desires which are all the more frightening because they're understandable.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, though, the series struggles to break away from the traditional trappings of high-school romances: despite the good showing of tantalizing ideas and the fair amount of effective artistry, it still desperately strives to be, above all else, a show about a guy with all the verve of a dried-up sponge who is inexplicably loved by three girls. Teiichi himself is poorly characterized, and while he's often described by the rest of the cast as \u201cgentle,\u201d \u201cearnest,\u201d and \u201cdependable,\u201d these traits are perhaps more of a ghost story than anything in the series, discussed in whispers but never truly shown or elaborated on. A more accurate description of him would read along the lines of \u201che is there\u201d and \u201che is the main character.\u201d To be sure, he performs what the show dictates are the proper actions, never taking advantage of the loneliness and vulnerability of his female friends, helping Yuuko track down information about herself. Yet, there's no indication that it's because of his personality (and, for that matter, there's no indication that he has a personality). Rather, he's the male protagonist in a romance, and that's just what the male protagonists in romances are expected to do. He's a nice person because he helps people and he helps people because he's a nice person; forgive me for thinking that's far from compelling writing. The result is that most generic of characters, someone who is difficult to dislike but also difficult to notice or care about in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nEqually damaging are the show\u2019s shifts in tone, which are as frequent as they are jarring. Sharp interjections of half-witted slapstick, usually centering on comedic relief character Momoe, sometimes abruptly decapitate more serious moments. Fanservice and boob humor are plentiful and unsubtle, inserted at all of the wrong instances, often overstaying whatever welcome they might have originally had. There\u2019s no avoiding that much of what goes on is fluff unrelated to what could loosely be referred to as the story, an observation epitomized by the fact that they somehow managed to cram a swimsuit episode in here somewhere. And, worst of all, the show\u2019s appreciable atmosphere of somber, reflective melancholy can often give way to a soapy melodrama of poorly thought out and repetitive dialogue (\u201cI\u2019m so lonely\u2026so sad\u2026in so much pain\u2026\u201d) that is downright difficult to listen to, much less take seriously. Drama, romance and mystery seem closer to the real heart of the series, but its peripheral elements end up distracting from, rather than enhancing, its strengths, and some of its strengths aren't that strong to begin with. The series looks good, sounds good, and knows how to get the viewer caught up in the moment\u2014qualities, make no mistake, that I appreciate. However, it's also the kind of show that's very vulnerable to hindsight, and looking back it's clear that there are plenty of issues with pacing, characterization, and tone.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes down to it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to let this series scrape by with a pass. It does a decent amount of things well, and the things it doesn\u2019t do well are frequently irritating but arguably not deal-breaking. Be warned, though, that Dusk Maiden is one show likely to split audiences down the middle; if you don\u2019t mind the sound of some of the attributes I\u2019ve labeled as weaknesses, you\u2019ll probably appreciate the show a lot more than I've indicated, and if you do mind the sound of same, you might not choose to give it the benefit of the doubt, as I have.",

            "content": "So you're looking for a good horror anime to watch and you come across Tasogare Otome x Amnesia. You read the summary and think it sounds pretty good so you watch the first episode. It starts out perfect, giving you a feeling that something creepy is going to happen then BAM!..they add in some corny comic relief. Most of the anime is like this, it'll give you a creepy feeling, then it'll ruin it by trying to add in some comedy.\r\nTasogare Otome x Amnesia (also known as Dusk Maiden of Amnesia) is about a boy named Niiya Teiichi who is part of the Paranormal Investigationsclub at his school, along with three other members, Kanoe Kirie, Okonogi Momoe, and the most famous ghost of the school, Yuuko. The thing is, only Teiichi and Kirie are able to see and touch Yuuko while the rest of the school's population cannot. This anime is mainly about this club investigating the paranormal rumours that haunt the school, as well as the mystery of what really happened to Yuuko in the past and why she cannot remember it.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\r\nThe idea of the story is very interesting, though the comic relief ruins it for me. In my opinion, this anime gets really great towards its finale when things finally start to get more serious. The serious scenes in this anime were great, especially when they gave me that creepy feeling. If only the whole anime was like that it would've been perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime was all right. The characters were given a more cute, young, child-like look to them, but I don't think they're something worth praising.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nI really liked the soundtrack of this anime. The background music that played when it started to get creepier was great! I also really liked the opening and ending! They were really perfect!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime weren't really the best, in my opinion. There wasn't anything really special about them and some of them actually were pretty annoying (mainly Okonogi).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for a creepy horror anime that'll give you chills, don't watch this because you'll be disappointed like I was. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia was an all right anime for me, but I probably won't rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! This is my first time writing one so please feel free to give me some feedback and criticism so that I can improve! :)",

            "content": "I had been looking for nice romance anime(not manga, because there are plenty there) after I had watched most of the common ones. I found this on my kissanme bookmark and remembered somebody had recommended this to me before but since I was not a fan of horror genre I didnt watch it immediately. But somehow from the first episode of this anime I was hooked and it turned out pretty good too.\r\nThe artwork and animation was beautiful. They used the artwork brilliantly to differentiate between the \u201cmain characters\u201d and the \u201cother people\u201d at a level even superior to Durarara!! The \u201cghosts\u201d were also drawnvery well, as a mass of dark formless matter which took different forms at different situations. The use of darkness and colour heightened the atmosphere and it was almost like I was living in the anime which definitely is a proof of how good it is.. The music was very good too. The OP and ED both were catchy and the in anime OSTs were almost perfect. The voice acting also didnt leave much to be desired. The various emotions of differently people were splendidly portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is pretty coherent. It is based on the life of a dead girl and goes back and forth in time, in her memories, to arrive at a solution to what they were searching for. The timing of the \u201cold memories\u201d episode was perfect too. Many a time I have been irritated by the \u201cold memory\u201d episode, I found it out of place but not in this one. And of course I enjoyed the anime. A lot. Its been a while since I enjoyed a romance anime this much..\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the plot. The plot was refreshing. It had a bit of mystery and horror. But the way they handled the \u201cghost\u201d and the \u201cdisorder\u201d was amazing. The ending was almost perfect till they messed it up a bit going in the path to appease the commonwealth. It was a touching story and showed how bad \u201cfanaticism\u201d can be. It subtly also showed that this fanaticism never yields good results even though it itself is a supernatural anime. The romance factor is handled well too, the way I like it, with a nice development and fulfillment at the very end. I call these type of anime \u201csoft romance\u201d and trust me if its done well, it can put many proper romantic anime to shame. This one almost achieves that.\\n\\n\r\n It is a very good watch. I sure most if not all will find something to connect to",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Niiya Teiichi (Yonaga, Tsubasa), a student at Seikyou Academy, loses his way when exploring one of the older school buildings when he encounters a girl named Kanoe Yuuko (Hara, Yumi). It turns out that she is the ghost who has haunted the school for 60 long years and the source of the many horror stories and recounts of paranormal activity that circulate among the students. As she does not remember how she died, she and Teiichi along with Okonogi Momoe (Fukuen, Misato) and Kanoe Kirie (Kitamura, Eri) form the Paranormal Investigations club in order to discoverwhat led to Yuuko\u2019s death and uncover the many mysteries of the school.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story takes place in a school setting, the cast of characters is actually fair short, consisting of the main four characters and then occasionally introducing side-characters for small 1-2 episode mini arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are pretty tolerable overall. Teiichi himself feels a little typical in his design and voice however he has a few points that make him endearing enough \u2013 chiefly of which is his dedication to Yuuko. While the show most definitely has some harem elements, it plays mostly upon the relationship between Teiichi and Yuuko and treats any other romantic interests as a comedic backdrop to the actual romance of the story. In this way, Teiichi does seem to genuinely care for Yuuko and goes above and beyond the more shallow, noncommittal iterations of the main character in a romance show in the way he actively displays his affection.\\n\\n\r\nKanoe Yuuko is similarly forwards with her feelings however even more so. I think that she is the best written member of the cast and her sometimes overly attached attitude and hands-on, affectionate nature really helps convey that she has felt very alone for a long time and is ecstatic at the thought of interacting with someone who can see and touch her. She operates equally well in both comedic and dramatic situations and is often the source of both.\\n\\n\r\nOf the group, Kanoe Kirie is the most serious of them however this mood is sometimes undercut by her jealousy of Yuuko and her relationship with Teiichi for primarily comedic purposes. Okonogi Momoe joins the club because of her somewhat fanatical approach to the supernatural and is, ironically so, the only person of the main cast who can\u2019t see or interact with Yuuko. She exists almost entirely for comedy\u2019s sake in my opinion and doesn\u2019t really feature any development or plot-related intrigue so I felt she was a little superfluous overall.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are fairly subdued which helps the show along in its horror and school elements. The show itself actually has a great deal of visual elements that lend themselves very well to its horror scenes and settings the most notable of which was the refreshingly dynamic directing approach of Oonuma Shin. Outside of utilizing fairly interesting shots in general, the show makes constant use of the white space of the screen to show the scene in animated slides amidst a black surrounding (in my experience, the techniques implored were similar to his other work in directing Ef: A Tale of Memories and its sequel). This technique worked very well given the horror tones of the show as it gave the visuals a dark and claustrophobic vibe when used. There is even an episode shot almost entirely in first person POV which I thought was really fun and worked quite well within the story. One of my only major qualms was that occasionally the body movements during dialogue would look outlandishly out of place with added motion or unrealistic movement but it happened rarely enough that I could overlook it. All in all, the visuals were one of the strongest points of the show and while the art itself may not have been crisp as one might desire, the style with which the show is executed makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nOtome x Amnesia is a little weird in that the combination of its genres are somewhat contradictory and this is one of my primary concerns with the show. Firstly, it works quite well as a horror show \u2013 the meat of the story is done in this genre and the overall tones are of this type as well. Romance is not necessarily a new sub-element within the horror genre either and in fact it feels quite at home within this show as well with the exception of the out of place harem themes and fairly consistent fan-service. Lastly, the show busies itself (unnecessarily in my opinion) with the comedy genre \u2013 depicting most character interactions outside of the straight-up horror scenes comically.\\n\\n\r\nIn other attempts to occupy multiple, sometimes conflicting, genres some shows feel like they become one genre first and foremost and the others are added for flavor however I can say that in the cast of Otome x Amnesia they are surprisingly equally present throughout the course of the show with horror being slightly predominant. What this all boils down to is that the show tries to be all of these things proportionally and it doesn\u2019t really work for it. In my opinion, it could have been quite good had it only presented its horror and romance elements and nixed its pseudo-ecchi and comedic attributes. I found that the comedy undercut the serious moments of the show and when each horror scene is sandwiched by a comedic moment on either side with them intermittently spliced within \u2013 it ultimately cheapens the effect and tarnishes the mood. The comedy itself is not outstanding either and so I feel like it only exists to fill the gaps in action within the show while providing some sex appeal in the way of its fan-service.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good enough but nothing I can make special note of. It mainly occupied the low-toned, ominous background style often seen in horror shows and it worked well for the show. It would play up the music slightly given the romantic scenes and relax a bit when things turned comedic so everything more or less functioned as expected in this regard.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nI thought the show, by way of its style and its story, was interesting and fun however I felt the overall experience was marred a bit by the fan-service, harem elements, and generic comedy. I think the show fell short in some regards and while I think it featured a good deal of potential it didn\u2019t quite achieve would it could have for me.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave the show a 5 because, while it had some genuinely interesting and well-executed elements, it had an equal share of issues that made it feel mediocre in my mind however I still found it watchable for its high points.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to people that enjoy those that enjoy the horror genre \u2013 it makes up the small majority of the show and is done quite well in a variety of ways. The romance wasn\u2019t bad and anyone that is a fan of relationships that get to the point rather quickly instead of stumbling around for a while in the \u2018who likes who?\u2019 phase would do fine in picking this up. In general, anyone that can overlook the kind of typical comedy and fan-service should be able to enjoy the show just fine but if that kind of stuff is a turn off or might ruin the more serious mood of the anime than I suggest they stay away.",

            "content": "Tasogare otome x Amnesia is a complex and unusual anime that doesn't really fit the well-known pattern of ghost stories. But still... Ghost of a girl [checked], haunted school [checked], scary moments [checked]...Then why is this anime different?\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is about Yuuko, a girl who died 60 years ago but whose ghost still haunts the hallways of Seikyou Academy. The only uncommon thing about this ghost is that it's not an ugly faceless bleeding monster, but a sexy and funny girl who takes mackery to a whole new level. Teiichi, Kirie and Momoe are the three members of the Paranormal Investigation Club who tryto unravel the mystery of Yuuko. However, Teiichi is the only one capable of seeing Yuuko, which makes him, undoubtedly, fall in love with her. And so, the story goes on, with the 4 main characters trying to make Yuuko remember why she died and why she can't rest in peace.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10\\n\r\nBoth art and sound are outstanding. The characters are well-drawn, with many distinctive features and so are the outside sceneries. The sound provides at the same time a friendly atmosphere and a totally freaking scary atmosphere when Dark Yuuko appears and supernatural occurs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYuuko, despite being a ghost, is one of those crafty, deceptive and attractive girls that makes any other female character envious of her beauty and sharpness. However, she shows a lot of emotions: from total carelessness to complete emotional attachement to Teiichi. She can be both a good and a bad ghost whenever she wants. Teiichi, on the other hand is one of those shy boys, always following the rules and trying not to upset anyone, but at the same time he can show a lot of courage, willing to die for the sake of others. This is a very interesting combination of characters. Due to the fact that Teiichi is the only guy who can see Yuuko, makes her fall in love with him and that goes for Teiichi, too. I mean, who could possibly resist such an attractive ghost? \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship evolves so much during the series. They learn what love is and become more attached to each other. Even they belong to two different worlds, that doesn't seem to be a problem for them, showing us that love conquers everything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really really enjoyed watching this. While the beggining was funny with lots of jokes, the ending almost made me cry. I didn't even notice when the anime took this abrupt turn but I'm glad it did because I was able to experience a large variety of emotions watching only 12 episodes of the masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nTasogare otome x amnesia is a good anime, but not one of the best. I still rated it 9 beacuse of the beautiful ending and great character development. I would gladly recommend it to everyone looking for a not-so-common ghost story with both happiness and sadness wrapped in a single package.",

It's based in a school setting where a boy wanders off into an area that is no longer used and is able to see a ghost.  At first he doesn't believe her, but as the day goes on he starts to realize that she may in fact be a ghost.  This anime looks to be a good one.  I am excited it made me laugh, andhad that level of mystery that makes me want to keep coming back for me.  I cannot wait to see what else they have in store!  Will they find out how she died or who killed her?",

            "content": "I went into Dusk Maiden of Amnesia expecting a dark dramatic horror-style thrill ride with a hint of mystery, Instead I got all that and a light hearted rom-com as-well. Now you're probably thinking how is that even possible and wouldn't that formula equate to a pretty messed-up anime? well the answer is no, It actually creates a very enjoyable unique viewing experience which the anime industry needs more of.\r\nDespite saying that, the story isn't very appealing or great by itself, It is when the spectacular art direction comes in, the story's full potential is realized.\r\n= Story (8) = \r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story featuresa lot of genres not usually seen accompanying one another, but it still works out great. The problem doesn't lie there, though rather with the stories appeal and entertainment value. You see the old 'character with amnesia' and 'ghost and human forbidden love' plot points have been used quite a number of times, spanning across books, movie 's and TV series and makes the story feel quite clich\u00e9d.        \\n\\n\r\nHowever, with character back-stories, the intriguing setting, numerous slice-of-life type sub-plots and the presence of some very unusual plot devices cancel out that clich\u00e9d feeling and makes the story seem rather unique.\\n\\n\r\n= Art (9) & Art Direction (10) =        \\n\r\nArt is very well done, the studio has managed to capture the right sort of tone and look for the series. Character designs aren't anything special but they don't have to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt Direction is something that people don't really look for in a series, usually since there's nothing special about it compared with all the other thousands of anime series out there. Though, the direction in this series is extremely noticeable and rather incredible. The way the director uses lighting is especially brilliant and very artistic, he manages to manipulate the tone of the story with ease. The director (Shin \u014cnuma btw) also uses a number of screen effects to make the series more compelling, such as using manga type composition. Another interesting trick the director uses is the 'blacking out' of all background characters, which I think adds a little something to the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing I'd like to add is that first-person effect episodes were excellently crafted and very memorable.  \\n\\n\r\n= Character (8) =\\n\r\nThe small amount of characters in this anime were all interesting, especially Yukko's character which I found very compelling. It's a shame however that the other three main characters were shunned a bit and more development could've easily been made, especially Okonogi, who we really know hardly anything about and significance in the main story is hardly felt. \\n\\n\r\n= Sound (8) =\\n\r\nI didn't have any problem with the seiyuu's chosen for their respective parts and I think all performances were done rather good. The OST fitted nicely though nothing memorable, The OP and ED weren't really to my taste though resonated with the story nicely.\\n\\n\r\n= Enjoyment (9) =\\n\r\nThe series is very enjoyable from start to finish, you'll be laughing, scared sh*tless and maybe even crying throughout the twelve episodes and probably even wanting more once you finish the series. \\n\\n\r\n= Overall (8.5) =\\n\r\nOverall, Dusk Maiden or Tasogare x Otome is a great series, It's very unique for it's blending of genres, It's intriguing story, the splendid art and art direction which is simply a masterpiece, It's alright sound, the characters, even though there could've been more development for them and the series enjoyment levels.",

            "content": "I've just finish this 12 episode anime, and I got to say that this is rather a good one, so for the story I'd give it a a \"Good\" number 7, since I really like about the mystery that surrounds Yuuko Kanoe the  infamous ghost of Seikyou Academy. The anime it self can be compared to \"AnoHana\" but with a much darker and naugthy side into it, I limit it to a 7 because it is a bit simple since it involves Teiichi Niiya who serves as Yuuko's comfort in fact for the rest of the episode it is always like that so forthe \"Enjoyment\" I gave it a \"Poor\" number 3, because I kinda find the Yuuko X Teiichi arc as irritating since it kinda suggest that Yuuko would wanna pop Teiich's cherries. in which I would have suggest that some ecchi be added into this. But, alas the ecchi element about Yuuko is  disappointing. Then again the ending did make up for this anime's short comings so for the \"Overall\" I give it a good number 7.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other parts:\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nDon't ask.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince I like the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Dreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nHere's why:\\n\\n\r\nTeiichi Niiya- At one point he seems to be uneasy with Yuuko's constant sexual advances, however he also doesn't do anything make her behave nor does he avoid her, in fact I can't make out if wheather or not he enjoy's Yuuko's constant pestering or is he simply too stupid to let Yuuko do what she wants with him.\\n\\n\r\n Yuuko Kanoe- I hate it when she seemly forgets that she's a ghost and Teiichi is in the world of the living, that they can never have a normal relationship, I also hate the way she treats him as if he is her property. I also find her more of an irritating character as if that you would want her to be the antagonist, but the only nice thing here is that she is one antagonist which I would like to give a nice ending.\\n\\n\r\nMomoe Okonogi - Here is another character which I find to be irritating, co'z she seem to believe any urban legends she come across. But then again there is this sliver lining about her where I wish that after Yuuko goes to the other side, she and Teiichi would have an arc, another is since this anime has a comedy genre in it, she kinda serves as that genre.\\n\\n\r\nKirie Kanoe- One thing about her, is that she is a mere filler that anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSide comment, Wtf does Yuuko have to come back?!\\n\\n",

I must say, no human being should bear so much pain and suffering. It is truly inspiring seeing such an interesting story about ghosts and how they evolve around feelings.\r\nArtwork isn't very successful but I overlooked it as I was wrapped in the shroud of the mystery.\r\nCharacters are quite stereotypical with the exception of the femaleprotagonist but the story makes  them evolve in different ways than other series.\\n\r\nSo if you are a fan of mysteries and ghosts then succumb to this new world called Seikyou",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free(?) after thought. Apologies if my review offends any lovers of this show. That being said, I was kind of disappointed with the show.\r\nFor me, this show is analagous to SAO (hear me out first...) in that I came in with certain expectations of what the show was about (SAO: action, world exploration, Tasagore: mystery/horror) and the first episode confirmed my expectations. But as the show progressed it became very apparent that this was really an anime centered around romance with harem vibes. I guess this divergence from my expectations was a huge reason why I could't enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\n~~As a romance anime...~~\\n\r\nMindsets should first be adjusted as this show is really a romance anime with a supernatural setting. But as a romance anime it just didn't resonate with me. Maybe I was turned off by the many unnecessary fan service so I couldn't view the characters relationship seriously? Maybe because the characters just sort of fell in love with each other with no strong reasons? Was it because of weak characterization? But I feel its mostly because there wasn't anything fresh/refreshing brought to the table. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I really object to how the show ended. **SPOILER skip to next section!!**                                          Necromancy cheapens the feels.\\n\\n\r\n~~As a horror/mystery anime...~~\\n\r\nThe focus of the show being romance aside, there wasn't much of a payoff to the mystery's resolution. \\n\r\n1. It was casually revealed early in the story, so the tension is lost. It feels like collecting your exam script after you have already been informed of your grades.\\n\r\n2. It was cliche. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime didn't give me the sense of cold creeping dread or horror, and mind you, I'm the sort of person who's too scared to watch any horror movies plus I was watching this anime alone in my room on a dark and stormy (slightly...) day.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, while sexuality and horror does blend well together, the anime's particular brand of blatant, targeted at pubescent boys, \"you like this?\" fan service is very jarring in a horror setting. Personally, I feel it destroys the gravity of the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n~~Characters~~\\n\r\nThere was really nothing special or memorable about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nYuuko could be interesting, but her personality for the early half of the anime was defined by fan service and jealousy. Though showing a more layered personality in the later episodes, Yuuko is not a character that could stand alone as her own, her being and purpose revolves inescapably as a love interest for our main lead Niiya. This is likewise for Niiya\\n\\n\r\nThe 2 side characters were underdeveloped and their sole purpose was to be fodder to develop the main leads' relationship.    \\n\\n\r\n~~Art and Sound~~\\n\r\nFor me this was the standard expected of anime nowadays, good stuff but nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\n~~I'm SORRY!~~\\n\r\nThis is a rather one sided review, but there are more than enough better worded reviews espousing the goodness of the anime. \\n\r\nBased on probability alone, I expect that you would end up enjoying the anime, but for me, it just wasn't what I wanted to see.",

Extreme sadness then overjoyed happiness flowed throughout the last few moments of the show, even a few tears swelled up in this 14 year old dork. Clint Bickham, Emily Neves, Brittney Karbowski and Jessica Boone did an outstanding job I highly recommend the English Dubbed version.

            "content": "The first couple episodes make you think that this series is a semi-ecchi, light hearted mystery series, where a ghost and some other people go around solving weird minor happenings around the school. There's a few hints that the series is alluding to something much darker, but this sense gets mostly swept away by the overall flirtiness that is Yuuko and her antics. Overall it's kinda interesting to watch, but nothing really hooks you to continue to watch the series besides the humor.\r\nUntil about episode 7. Oh episode 7. This series legitimately starts getting good here, and the plot gets kicked up by about 20notches. It's hard to say anything without spoilers, but there's a pretty big and unexpected event that happens in this episode that made the series a whole lot darker than it was before. \\n\\n\r\n- Character -\\n\\n\r\nThe series is entirely driven by the two main characters: Yuuko and Teiichi. They're both cute and adorable, and I actually care what happens to them, moreso as the series progresses. I can tell you right now that how much you enjoy this series will be directly proportional to how much you like Yuuko, whose story is the main focus of this anime, if you couldn't tell by the title. Yuuko seems pretty air-headed and carefree, but even this becomes a plot device later in the series. Well-played, anime creators, well played. \\n\\n\r\nPreface: I'm a girl. So the intense flirtiness that the main character Yuuko exudes isn't exactly a turn on for me. The main hook that this anime had on me was the story of this girl's past. The series did a pretty good job of making this anime generally light-hearted and funny, but dark enough to make me seriously concerned about some of the characters and the mysteries behind them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Yuuko's voice actress is pretty darn amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, I would say the weaknesses would be the other characters. Nothing about their character stands out, falling mostly into the typical tsundere and always-happy characters.  Neither of them are really truly developed, and they easily fall into the background until they're used as a convenient plot devices (post episode 7). Not to say that they weren't developed at all, or that they don't add enjoyment and depth to the series, but they weren't treated as being as instrumental as I thought they would be. But in the end, this is a story about Teiichi and Yuuko, so maybe that was to be expected.\\n\\n\r\n- Plot -\\n\\n\r\nThe series is around a 6 before episode seven, and a solid 8 afterwards. Stick with it if you actually care about Yuuko's past, because it pretty much made me really respect her way more than I did previously.\\n\\n\r\n*edit* Ok, the last episode made me cry.  :'( This series was pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nIf your taste is usually high quality anime, if your come into this series with very low expectations, you may enjoy this more than you expect. \\n",

            "content": "*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* / *YOU BEEN WARNED*\r\n\"Tasogare Otome x Amnesia or Dusk Maiden of Amenesia, is a anime to remember by when coming across the genre of horror, suspence, mystery and pure supernatural thrill ride.\"\r\nThis is what I said to a friend after I watched the series. \r\nHere why:\r\nTasorgare Otome x Amnesia starts off by presenting these mixtures of different characters which shows off straight away in what they are like and how they respond to their surroundings. We are first shown the 'Seikyou Academy' where we see Teiichi, Momoe, Kirie and later on a mysterious character known as Yuuko which endeavor to find outall the mysterories which are happening around the school and to find out the biggest mystery of them all. The whole group decided to make a group called 'Paranormal Investigations Club' which then leads on to the plot of the whole story.\\n\\n\r\n(8) Art: I found in my opinion that the art style fitted the atompherse just right to give off a spooky yet horror feel to it with it's mixtures of colour art style and surroundings within the whole anime. What also got my attention was the amount of detail which was put into making it seem like the world that Takashi Sakamoto and Shin Oonuma created *Directors*, is realistic and believable to the extent where even for supernatural happening to start, would seem believable.\\n\\n\r\n(8) Sound: In most animes it's easy to find out how bad the 'Sound Mixture' can be while watching an anime but in most cases it's very hard to find an anime which has good sound mixtures within it too. So in this case Tasogare Otome x Amnesia hits it right on the ball when it comes to freaking out the audience with it's pure horror sound mixtures in a lot of scenes in the anime which just makes the viewers say \"...what on earth is going on...AHH!\". The soundtrack for the whole series sets the tone right and makes atmosphere enjoyable when certain scenarios happen during the anime.\\n\\n\r\n(7) Characters: Now when I watch an anime I want to endeavor into the mind and actions of the main character, so in this case it would be Teiichi Niiya who is set out to be the character which most veiwers can relate to. Sadly how this character is portrayed is very 'down to heart' kinda 'go with the flow' type of guy which in this type of anime is very annoying. As the viewer, you seem to put Teiichi Niiya down the catorgory as 'Romance Boy' which is totally fine, but seems most of the time he is very oblivious to certain circumstances to the point where you want to literally slap him in the face *or punch I dont mind* to say \"LOOK! it's so obvious what's going on! THINK!\".\\n\\n\r\nSo your probably saying \"why give the catorgory 'Characters' a (7)?\" well it's not Teiichi which makes the show, it's the other characters which make this show a one to remember. To begin with Kirie Kanoe who is voiced by the lovely Eri Kitamura does a excellent performance by believing that her character is part of this whole story which then moves on to developing this intriguing character. \\n\\n\r\nMomoe Okonogi is the 'bright star' character who is just crazily hyper most of the time because she believes that every ghost is out to get her, but in the end she's just over thinking it all. I really enjoyed Momoe character as she brought to the table the 'comic relief' type of feel of the anime which in all scenes fit well. I would of liked to seen more of this character through out the series or even be more part of the main plot but unfortunately this did not happen.\\n\\n\r\n(9) Enjoyment: The most enjoyable factor for me is the development of both Yuuko and Teiichi as two opposites can actually make a good team. A lot of the time I got frustrated about some of the characters and what actions they were making in certain scenarios, but to say that would mean that I would be the bravest person in the world if I was up against a supernatural being and had taken action. So having this in mind, when the characters actually had taken action, the enjoyment level went up pretty high due to the amount of heroism that's shown in these characters in those scenes which reflected on my overal thoughts about the enjoyment of the characters. *Except for Momoe who was running away most of the time* ;)\\n\\n\r\n(8) Overall: I feel that this anime is probably one of those that will be in my thoughts when watching other animes, just purely based on how intriguing and innovative the whole series was and what it could expand into. For the sake of the fans I hope they do announce a season two of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia to give a comfort to the characters which were forgotten about during the series. Like  *Momoe Okonogi and Kirie Kanoe*\\n\\n\r\nI would of loved to seen more of a performance by Eri Kitamura *voice for Kirie Kanoe* because she has a wonderful voice, and a performance level which astounds me most of the time. Seems like she was kinda a wasted character to be honest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBelieve me when I say this:\\n\\n\r\n\"Watch the anime and while you watch it, appreciate what it's trying to show and how well they execute it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now it's very rare that I give straight 10s across the board- but this anime deserves it. First of all it made me cry- and again it takes alot for me to do so.\r\nStory-10:Reason:Within all the 12/13 episode long anime this series hit the nail on the head balancing time management and plot. The story began in an interesting way- no one would honestly see it coming and it seemed like the story would be focused around this one character first shown- not the case. When weird things start to happen...you get confused-and wonder if this is another Ghost Hunt series- it's not. It startsout funny and good-nature, then eventually starts to show its' true colors. The seriousness within the story and how the characters and and each episode worked together to provide small clues and hidden facts the helped progress the story along. In the end it tied things up very nicely, and again made me cry and emotions will ride up around the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10- Reason- Oh where to begin. First of all- the mixing of pastel colors in the opening, ending, and throughout the series gave the anime a softer side and a gentle connection with the horror side. The amazing effects used for the backgrounds and objects such as the autumn leaves and snow were outstanding and honestly more realistic than most.  Also how the trees and the skies looked, especially during different sequences of the anime and opening and ending songs- reminds me of fire, and how everything was blended well. The character's artwork shined! The way certain characters literally glowed to emphasize their importance and their feelings and emotions at the time, and accompanied by sounds it was perfect. The characters were drawn on a range from realistic to absolute cartoonish(mostly restricted to one character). It gave the anime another side which could connect to others in the audience. It also made the anime funny and uplifting at times without losing it's general horror theme. Even the main character had her bits of fun and outbursts. Even the dark scenes and the darker sides of characters were drawn to perfection and every detail made the character come alive and we see how they truly are and feel.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10-Reason:Voice acting (subbed) was obviously fitted perfectly to each character. They sounded as if they were one with each other, voice actor and character. Their emotional screams, cries, growls, and literally not only made me feel like I was there but also made me feel what they were. The opening and endings drive you deep into the core of what the anime really is. It makes you cry. I cried and repeated the songs multiple times. The opening further details the main character's feelings and soul. It is very catchy to say the least (if some don't agree with my review) and it is something that does make you want to sing to it. It is haunting, beautiful, elegant, and yet has a hard core modern scream to it. The ending is just as beautiful and leaves you feeling a type of sadness. And because the main character sings it you can feel how complex and deep the words are and it's meaning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10-Reason:The anime could get away with only developing one character's background, and the current relations going on in the series, because that's all they needed. The main character had the best development throughout the series as we see one side of her and then another, and then we see into who Yuuko really is and the mystery is delved deeper until the final outcome. She is funny, charming, sensual, and is like a normal girl- but she has a spark to her that attracts. The leading male Niiya-san, is also an interesting character, although not a lot of background until the end, we do see a development being formed all throughout the series with he main character and the side ones. The characters have minds of their owns...they each feel and have human qualities that broke off the page and bordered on and into reality. Each character had it's own personality coming from the hyper-active, to the calm and collected, to the serious and deadly, to the heart-wrenching and emotional. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10:Reason: I think I've stated enough when I say that this is one of my favorite anime because of the effect it had on me. It gave me chills during scenes meant for horror, it made me laugh when it presented fast scenes that were meant to be funny and ironic, and it brought me to tears when  the hurtful moments and separating parts came to play. The songs and inserted noises were both hysterical and mesmerizing. The songs themselves is inspiring and the character herself, Yuuko, is almost a real girl who could be seen as a role model (in some cases), especially with the seriousness she puts up and how much she cares for the others. Other times she just acts just like normal people would ^^\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10-Reason: Enough said- this anime was amazing. It is an entertaining watch. It contained elements from a lot of sources. It mixed the artwork and sound-work to match up brilliantly, leaves an ever-lasting impression on you. The characters were a delight, finding out their connections, and mysterious pasts. It also was a wonderful happy ending I must say. It gave me a sense of finish- where I was content with what I was presented with.",

            "content": "Even though Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is technically a ghost story, under the surface there's not much that differentiates it from other high school -setting slice-of-life (romcom) anime. Over the course of this anime our MC composes a harem of the most essential cliche characters, and this happy gang goes through the standard trite high school events.\r\nWe have Teiichi Niiya, our main protagonist. He is the silent observer who does little to move the plot forward. Teiichi is the one who awakens Yuko-San from her slumber, thus creating a bond between the two.\r\nYuko Kanoe is the Dusk Maiden. Yuko is the \"first girl wins\" characterand is utterly devoted to Teiichi. The two of them are the \"official couple\" pretty much from the first episode onwards. For the series credit, though, it is mentioned multiple times that this is because no one had ever touched or even paid attention to Yuko until Teiichi became aware of her, so it kind of makes sense. Yuko's split personality and psychological repression, causing her amnesia, is the main plot device and the main cause of our characters is to find out about Yuko's past.\\n\\n\r\nKirie Kanoe is the tsundere one, who is the only student besides Teiichi who can see ghost Yuko. Kirie joins the rest of the main cast on their quest to find out about Yuko's past for no apparent reason other than she has no friends and wants to hang around Teiichi for god-knows-why, since the viewers are exposed to absolutely nothing that could have sparked her romantic interest. Kirie is used as a narrator for audience, since our silent protagonist is oblivious to basically everything happening around him and needs to be talked through.\\n\\n\r\nMomoe Okonogi is the moe one, mostly acting as a comedic relief. She is used to create both fun and tension, since she is the only main character who cannot see Yuko. Momoe is obsessed over Teiichi, constantly trying to make a move on him, which often leads to sticky situations since Yuko is usually always glued to Teiichi (\"haunting him\"), thus sparking jealousy.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a high school setting, (unwanted) harem, fan service in the form of gratuitous boob shots and boob grabs. We have the swimming pool episode and the culture festival episode. Even though there are attempts at being genuinely spooky from time to time, those are the times when this show truly falls on its face. I do believe this show at its core tried to emulate what, for example, the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya did. The spooky and unnatural elements of the show are sprinkled upon, used to create ambiance, while the real focus of the show is in character interaction and the funny bits.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that unlike with Haruhi, there is pretty much no depth to these characters whatsoever. They are what they are: card board cuts. There is no character development happening and characters' motivations are justified very poorly, if at all. This is a shame because towards the end I was still feeling involved in this series for one reason or another, and felt that the characters could have been given a proper background and some distinctive traits along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing Dusk Maiden had going for it were the character interactions between Yuko and Reiichi pawing each other, Momoe freaking over the seemingly otherworldly occurrences and Kirie getting worked up by the couple's insensitive behavior because she's the only one who can see them getting frisky. Even though the plot lacks meat and is delivered poorly, the humor worked for me. The series is only 12 episodes long, so if you have some tolerance for stupid BS and fancy humor and some mild fan service (and you have seen every other anime that deliver on these things), Dusk Maiden of Amnesia could be worth a try.",

            "content": "First of all, this anime doesn't live up to neither its genres nor its 8 score that may give you a feeling it's the new another. It's basically a cliched shounen with a little touch of ecchi and harem, and it even fails at being one of these genres. I thought it's a story with wasted potential at the first 4 episodes, but it got much worse to the point where I thought of dropping it. I thought waiting till the mystery is solved can make me change my mind, but it was very painful to watch the last 3 episodes. The problem lies atthe cliched characters and the episodic nature of the anime so let's analyze those a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10)\\n\r\nIt follows a highschool boy that meets a ghost with amnesia and honestly, it was nothing more than that. The mystery was rarely tackled as most of the show you spend time watching 4 characters interacting in the same way every episode. The main character who's always clueless, the main heroine who always clings to the main character, booby-chan that loves the mc but is too shy to show it, and the flat one who also loves the main character but acts tsundere. Let me also note that the last 2 characters get very short screen time and it's never important when they do.\\n\r\nThe ending was a disaster on its own, it basically ends like it starts.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (9/10)\\n\r\nThe opening and ending is maybe why I continued watching this series and I never skipped them. The animation is unique and fits the series quite well, specially the backgrounds, they are always calming and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10)\\n\r\nIt was very painful to get through the last 2 episodes, they hurt my brain. everything was cliched, I couldn't find the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nI recommend not watching this anime if you want a show with horror/mystery genres.",

It's plenty of ecchi moments in it and also humor at some moments, and some episoes may cause confusions or something like that butyou'll understand after some minutes or hours ^_^ the story's really good but on minus are that they showed the ending of the serie at the beginning of episode 1 which was a huge mistake i think, if they hadn't done that the ending would be alot more better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art are really good and i gave it 10, the sound are brilliant and the soundtracks are masterpieces, i've found a liking of the intro \"Choir jail\" which is also played at the end of episode 12. Characters are good, i gave it 9 because of Yuukos perrsonality, i'm not gonna spoil anything but i didn't like the part with the shadow thing and that, and where she suddenly changed from airhead to \"something else\" enjoyment is on 8 because it's alot of ecchi (which is minus for me) otherwise it's good, the last episode's ending are quite similar to alot of other animes, for example Clannad after story's one example, for some reason when i watched the endingof episode 12 Tasogare otome x amnesia i got the Clannad After story ending in mind. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i gave it 9, This anime's a both girls and boys anime and i recommend it  to people who like Romance and at sametime ghosts and old tales.",

As he later finds out, she is the school's infamous ghost, Yuuko. The pair eventually fall in love and with the help of several friends, uncover the truth behind Yuuko's tragic past.  While it is somewhat clinched and you can see some of the twists coming, it's hard not to get engrossed in the storyand you can't not feel bad for Yuuko.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link has done a decent job of animating the series, while the animation isn't the best out there, it is pretty good. The entire series feels surreal, due to the superb lighting and the fact that it always seems to take place at twilight. Overall I was impressed yet again by Silver Link.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what made this series great, in my opinion. The Opening and Ending songs are beautiful, unforgettable, and they fit the series extremely well. The music used in the show itself is also decent and fitting, but the opening and endings are what really caught my eye as far as the sound\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the one area where the series tends to falter. You have the main lead, Teiichi, who is somewhat irritating and whiny and shows very little character depth. Then you have Kirie and Okonogi who appear in the first few episodes and then seemingly disappear for most of the remaining episodes. The characters' saving grace, however, is Yuuko. She is very outgoing and is seemingly perfect (never gets angry/jealous, etc., but this is due to a reason) and she also has an incredibly tragic and horrible past. You can't help but feel bad for her. In addition, she also displays a good amount of depth throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIt is what it is. A decent love story, mystery, and horror series that despite it's flaws, manages to be an extremely good series overall. If you're looking for an entertaining romance series, I'd highly recommend this one.",

            "content": "Presenting a Phantomhive review of [Tasogare Otome x Amnesia] for your reading pleasure.\r\nStory(6): Tasogare Otome x Amnesia tells of a very peculiar tale, the ability of a high school student to detect and interact with one belonging to the supernatural realm, can only lead to trouble if not disaster. Much of the circumstances regarding the death of the one who still haunts the world of the living, has been shrouded in mystery. By the power of a mismatched group of teenagers under the pretense of being a Paranormal investigations club, Teiichi and his group attempts to unravel the mysteries of an unknown death; perhaps allowingthe lingering spirit to rest in peace at long last. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia most certainly is worthy of your afternoon tea time, with a sufficiently captivating story that may leave you questioning the morality of adults who make decisions that affect many others.\\n\\n\r\nArt(6): The atmosphere is definitely re-enforced by the artistic style of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia. The colors are not bright, they are dull and a bit on the grey side; properly representing the dark and mysterious nature of this anime. There is an ever present feeling of danger right around the corner, similar in a sense to that of a haunted house. This feeling that something is not right but one can not determine what is wrong; that feeling is reflected well in the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound(5): Tasogare Otome x Amnesia seems to employ echoing words and repeating of certain phrases in order to deliver a deeper impact upon the viewer during possible key moments in the story. The music is of the unknown sort, in the sense that one feels as if there is something missing but no one knows what that something is; thus in that regard, the sound and music of this anime fit relatively well with the overall theme that there is a mystery to be solved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(7): The strength of this type of anime generally depend greatly upon the characters themselves. There certainly is a character who could be considered comic relief or rather has the capability to speak yet seems to be brainless. Those who can see what no mortal should ever be able to see, ultimately are the ones who must resolve the mystery they have found themselves in the middle of. This leads to the bonding of mortal and spirit in a way that could be considered amongst the highest cases of forbidden love. The Character development is indeed the highlight of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7): The level of enjoyment one might attain from watching Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is questionable. There is certainly a lot of Character development within a short period of time, as the mysteries of prior generations are unraveled and the true cause of death of a lingering spirit are revealed, an unexpected bump in the road to the \"and they lived happily ever after\" type of ending occurs. Such surprises that leaves the viewer often guessing and mystified as to the reasons behind certain actions, is in my personal opinion the most enjoyable aspect of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(6): Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is an adequately enjoyable anime over afternoon tea. I find the solving of mysteries of the supernatural kind to be quite entertaining to observe. When beings not of the mortal world are involved, it is enjoyable to attempt to predict their actions as Human Psychology certainly does not apply to supernatural beings, such as Ghosts and Demons; which I consider the true entertainment value of this anime. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is certainly an anime that possess a Halloween aura to it, therefore if you are frightened easily by the supernatural, I would recommend that you do not watch Tasogare Otome x Amnesia and seek out slice of life animes such as Clannad. \\n\\n\r\n[This review has been brought to you by the Funtom Company!

            "content": "I feel like this series managed to deliver a nice blend of paranormal mysteries and romance. The school setting was fairly interesting in the way it was done, since it was a mish-mash of buildings laid onto each other, resulting in a frankenstein school full of dead ends and abandoned areas where ghost stories thrive.\r\nWhile the protagonist is the only male character and the show does lean on some one-note fanservice for his relationship with the girl\u2019s ghost, the series also features two female club mates, although their presence is a lot less noticeable than that of the main couple. The aloof girl felt veryone-dimensional since she was often being clumsy about everything, including trying to confess her love to the protagonist; however, the more serious girl felt like a more interesting character due to a very simple conflict of interest (wanting to see him happy with, or in spite of her). I also liked how the series managed to deliver its story with very few characters: Besides the four members of the paranormal research club, there\u2019re four secondary characters that appear for an episode or two at most, allowing the plot to focus on the couple\u2019s growing bond and their search of the girl\u2019s mysterious past.\\n\\n\r\nAs a closing remark, my only gripe with the show is the ending (spoilers ahead): After helping the ghost accept her negative emotions and giving her corpse a proper burial, the girl finally passes on to the afterlife with the protagonist promising her that he\u2019ll forget her eventually so that he can move on... Then, a final scene reveals that she couldn\u2019t pass on due to her love for him, which undermined the concept I thought the series was about: coming to terms with things though the help and support of others.",

            "content": "Where should i start. . . art and sounds,YEa !! \r\nThe art is magnificent and fitting the show , it also has quiet the symbolism and it really helps awaking the emotions this show wants to awake. Just brilliant work on that part! The colors were beautiful and there were no faults here.\r\nAlso the sounds were distinguished! The OP,ED and OST were captivating and inspirational. Not forgetting ofc, fitting the moment and overall enhanced the shows in many ways! 10/10 for me.\r\nThe characters are well introduced and well fleshed out but don't expect something extraordinary or captivating. It has its development and its reasonable andlogical. That's all you need to know and also the fact that every character is lovable and not nerve breaking!\\n\r\nThe story is not as plain as it seems , there are twists and the plot unraveling is very well placed and executed. The thing is that for something that carries the tag \"HORROR\" this show has tons of fan service and comedy which I found personally unfitting and in general unwanted and tiring...The romance is also here. And very satisfying one !! \u252c\u2500\u252c\u30ce( \u00ba _ \u00ba\u30ce) *Thumbs up*\\n\r\n-------------------------------------Personal Thoughts and weaknesses----------------------------------\\n\r\nLet's clear this out, Anime is a place when you can get haunted by a 70+ yo horny ghost in his 15 yo beautiful physique with fcking red eyes!! (yeap i got sold by the eyes) But still that doesn't count as being haunted in my books... Also there are way too much comedy included and it will surely destroy you. . . I mean \" We came here for the horror mystery, not COMEDY!!\"\\n\r\nOther than that the anime is about a school, with only our characters around in all scenes.... \"LEGIT\" NOT!!! Also, there are So many romantic concerns that feel mostly out of place! Too much fan service!! FFS even tho a 50% its well placed and kinda excusable ITS STILL TOO MUCH FOR A HORROR/romance story...\\n\r\nI followed a policy...1 unintentional boob grab= 1 facepalm ,I face palmed a lot.... \\n\r\nAT LEAST MAKE IT INTENTIONAL !! (>\u10da)\\n\r\nShounen. . . Shounen is almost 70% of the times bad... This time ...it was too bad....\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it starts poorly and full of fan service but its placement was fairly good and escalates brilliant. The OP,ED and OST help a lot and actually.\\n\r\nThe ending was really satisfying. 4 hours of disappointment followed by salvation and some minor feels! \\n\r\nWorth it !\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n- This anime just tried to appeal in my necrophile nature??!?!?! \\n\r\n- \"When boob grabs can move plots. . .\" \\n\r\n- The magnificent art and sounds!\\n\r\n- The ghost.",

            "content": "Actually I was looking for something scary. Horror genre is one of my favorites. Too bad there are only a few of them. You'll find many animes labeled as horror, but the reality is - that's not the case for all. If you are looking for something scary and going through recommendations, I bet you'll come across many titles labeled as horror when actually they are not. For example, \"Monster\". Yes, the anime may have blood, gore, murders, psychopaths... Though they may be the ingredients of a horror story but not the core. You have to have a story that is paranormal and realistic atthe same time, something you can imagine and relate to. Otherwise it won't be scary.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I conclude \"Tasogare Otome x Amnesia\" is NOT a horror anime. But that doesn't make it less enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a story of romance, pain, sadness, loneliness, people going crazy, superstitions... \\n\\n\r\nActually there is nothing horror in it. The romance is between a human and a ghost, that's all. \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't that good as a whole. But the end part is moving. If you start watching it, at first it may feel like a pain in the butt. But keep patience for the first 5 episodes and then the anime will start becoming interesting. Eventually, you'll realize that the first episodes weren't meant for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime, at first, seems like a parody of horror genre. You may even laugh your stomach out. But, slowly it'll get into the business. After the first 4 episodes, it will get tensed and the 10th and 11th episode are so cruel that it may even make you writhe in pain. That's why I urge not to give up the anime for the bad start.\\n\\n\r\nDowner... the ending was a fan service. So, you will feel good but not satisfied. That's what happens when you go servicing people instead of the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTHE HORROR PART:-\\n\\n\r\nHumans some times can be scarier than monsters. Their actions at times of panic and stress can overwhelm the greatest of horrors. So, if you are to be afraid of anything, then be afraid - not of ghosts, but of the actions of humans. This you will realize painfully.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy my... the art is freakingly amazing. It is the essence of horror to have a grim, dark, creepy, damp environment. This anime has it. I have seen such great dark environment only in \"Another\". Sad part is that the story couldn't do justice to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is KAMPEKI (perfect). You can't enjoy horror without sounds that will make your heart stop. Unfortunately, this anime isn't a horror one. The opening and the ending is creepy as hell. I wouldn't have believed it before that a song can actually make you feel scared, but the songs in \"Another\" and this anime made me believe it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing to say about the characters. They are all so so. There is development of only one character, Yuuko. That's bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough many lackings were there, I can't say I didn't enjoy the anime very much. So 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI have rated this anime 9 in my anime list, but here in this review I have to go with my logic rather than my emotions. So, I can't give it more than it deserves.",

            "content": "Upon reading the synopsis for Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, I expected the atmosphere of the series to be more on the darker side with little bits of suspense or horror thrown in. While this was true for the later episodes, it was definitely not the case for the earlier ones, which gave me the impression that this was yet another romantic comedy except with a small twist, in the form of having a human and a ghost being the main couple. Looking at it as a whole, this series has been a slightly weird one. Although it strayed from my expectations, it managed to providean entertaining experience for the most part. There were both the flaws and the memorable moments; a solid series overall. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art was the strongest aspect of this series by far. I was absolutely captivated by the beautiful use of colours in those countless panoramic and sky shots of the sunset and night sky. It reminded me of how a lot of attention was put into the clouds in the sky in Makoto Shinkai movies. The use of SHAFT-like animation sequences also effectively added to my enjoyment of the artwork. Like SHAFT's animation, Silver Link took a risk by using a hit-or-miss art style in many of the more serious scenes and I think it paid off. In addition to the detailed backgrounds and environment, the character designs were also quite solid, with the periodic chibi designs providing a nice bonus. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, I felt some of the side characters needed more development, namely Kirie and Momoe. While it was easy to see that Teiichi developed from being a seemingly dull person into someone who really cared for the girl he loved (especially near the end), the development of the other characters was much more lacking. Even Y\u016bko's development was restricted, but that was mainly due to the nature of her character. The only thing I got out of the series regarding the two other members of the Paranormal Investigations Club is that Kirie acts as an \"advisor\" for Teiichi and Momoe is there for comic relief. Although the development of the main character is crucial, I don't think it's enough just to focus on him/her alone. I find it is equally important to build up the supporting cast to a certain degree, which is one thing that this series failed to do. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nPartially backed by the excellent OP, which I find to be important in getting a viewer into the mood of watching the episode, Tasogare Otome x Amnesia presents a decent auditory experience. The ED, although slightly overshadowed by CHOIR JAIL, manages to effectively slow down the pace and allow for time to reflect on the episode, especially in the latter half of the series. While the BGM is far from noteworthy, it did contain a few nice tracks which added to my overall enjoyment. In terms of voice acting, there were no big-name seiy\u016bs aside from Kitamura Eri, who didn't even play a large role as Kirie. Nonetheless, the voice acting was solid and I especially liked how Teiichi's voice actor was able to convey his character's emotions with a great degree of skill, particularly in the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, the ending ruined everything. I felt it was an amateur decision on the part of whoever was responsible for it. Furthermore, if the final scene was not used, I wouldn't have hesitated to give the story an 8/10 (which I had initially had). This just goes to show how much of an influence a bad ending can have on the story as a whole. But aside from that, the premise of the series is interesting at the least. It successfully struck a good balance between a \"romantic comedy\" and a \"dark mystery\"\u2014two genres which generally don't go well together. And because of that, I feel one's satisfaction with it can vary, depending on how well the ending sits with them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nTo say whether I liked the series or not is difficult. On one hand, the first and last few episodes were really good in their own way. But on the other hand, the fact that the plot jumped around quite a bit in the middle and the presence of that horribly placed ending makes me think otherwise. If it came down to it, I'd say the positives outweighed the negatives. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is a solid series overall and those who enjoy romantic comedies and/or mysteries will most likely have fun watching it.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that twenty minutes into the last episode, the score that I had decided to give Dusk Maiden of Amnesia was a solid 8. But little did I know that something so ridiculous would happen in the last 3 minutes that would make me lower the score for the anime.\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia is basically a love story of a ghost and a middle school student. It revolves around Yuuko Kanoe, the ghost of a 15 year old girl who died in Seikyou Academy and Teiichi Niiya, the student who begins to see her after he wanders into the basementof the old school building. From there, they form the Paranormal Investigation Club and are joined by the other two characters Momoe Okonoge and Kirie Kanoe. Yuuko has forgotten about her past and hence, Teiichi promises her that he will help her remember about herself, which is the reason the Paranormal Club is formed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is episodic for the most part, where the Paranormal Investigation Club deals with some ghostly activities occuring in the school as well as trying to deal with Yuuko's problems, her memories and of course, there is also quite a bit of romance. So, expect some fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good and the character designs are distinctive. The animation is fluid and is hardly rough throughout the run of the anime. The voice acting is good too and there are some good soundtracks. There is this one soundtrack which can get really scary and I am sure you will find your heart racing when you hear it while watching the ghost under the dark night sky. I warn you though, do not watch this dubbed. I generally prefer dubbed anime but the \"kuns\" and \"sans\" after the name even in English dub made it really annoying for me. I quickly switched to sub after the first episode itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty good. Yuuko is definitely the most interesting and entertaining character. She is madly in love with Teiichi and sticks to him like a magnet and seduces him all the time. As people cant see her, Teiichi goes through some funny moments. Teiichi is nothing special though but he does his job pretty well. Kirie is another one who can see Yuuko while Okonogi is just there as a comic relief. Overall, they form an entertaining cast. As far as development goes, I think there was just about enough character development to not make the anime redundant in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can get you confused in a couple of episodes but other than that, I think it's worthwhile. Of course, the ending really upset me but overall, I would say that Dusk Maiden of Amnesia wasn't too disappointing.",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia has a good take on the Romance genre, with the coupling between that of Teiichi, the average high school student, and Kanoe Yuuko, a ghost.  Not only does the show have an interesting take on romance but it also shows how easy it is for people to trick themselves into being scared of what is not really there, which has to be what will overall separate this anime from the others.\r\nStory:  The story is what I said before, that of a romance between a normal high school boy and a ghost with the addition of human fear.  Thestory progressed very well and I didn't really notice any filler, or at least didn't mind any that they threw in.  It was fleshed out well and ended perfectly.  The only thing that I did not care for was that at some points they seemed to back track because of a condition that you will learn that Yuuko has, but this was somewhat necessary to express the seriousness of her disorder.  Only because the story does not go above and beyond will I leave this section with a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Nothing special in this area.  The artwork was consistent but it didn't seem to stand out as original.  Not only that but I have seen better from a lot of other anime that I have watched from this year that stood above this one.  Of course, it may just be my own favoritism towards certain styles.  I will nail this section with an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:  This section stood out very well.  Several points in the anime did I have to pause so that I could search for the songs used.  The intro was great and the ending was good too, not only that but the background music was very noticeable and well done, which is why I will give sound a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I enjoyed the anime a good amount.  I didn't just burn through every episode in one day however.  I watched the first couple episodes then came back to see the rest another day.  At no part however did I force myself to move on, I chose to because I enjoyed it and wanted to see what the next episode had in store for our favorite ghost.  I'll land this section with an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Well to get an overall look at the story, it performs all of the listed genres well, but when factoring in my personal enjoyment and preference in animation, its overall rating seems to suffer.  I believe that many people could find this anime to be a 9/10 and some even a 10/10, so I recommend that you check it out but as for me, I'm going to give it an 8/10",

And the way they really make you fell the emotions and pain of the characters is beyond amazing.Now,i usually talk to the empty space,thinking that there is soemone there,its just an amazing anime that can evoke that type of feelings.Everything is well implemented,the background of Yuuko and her character development.One of myfavorite animes of the almost 200 i saw,a must see.",

However this show does execute frightening moments at good points when the watcher is least expecting it.\\n\\n\r\nIn a whole this is without  doubt worth a watch, if not for the heartwarming story then at least for the beautiful visual and soundtrack.",

            "content": "If this isn't one of the most underrated anime of all time I don't know what is. I don't, at all, understand the consensus on this one or the crappy scores. I thought this show was outstanding.\r\nArt-\r\nI thought the art style was excellent. It's silly when it wants to be, scary when it needs to be and always smooth and appropriate. I felt this anime was very atmospheric and they did a great job building up the key areas to be believable and consistent with the theme and setting of the story. I have no qualms anywhere in this department.\r\nSound-\r\nEmily Neeves is one of thevery best in the business for a reason and she delivers, as usual, an exceptionally high quality performance. Yuuko is far and away the most important character in the show so it's imperative her roll is executed outstandingly and Emily Neeves delivers. The other characters have perfectly solid voice acting as well, but they're simply not as important.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS SOUNDTRACK IS GORGEOUS! \"Requiem\" is literally my number one single favorite anime song of all time. Literally number one! While that track in particular absolutely blew my mind and literally brought me to tears the first time I heard it in the anime (and I'm a man pushing 30 and very much NOT a crier...) I thought the entire soundtrack was truly excellent. There are multiple songs from this show on my personal playlist and every time I go back and throw in the soundtrack disc that came with the blu-ray I'm always amazed at how many really good songs are on it and how I never hear a single track I don't like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the weak point of this show, which I absolutely adore, is the characters, as it feels like Yuuko is the only character that matters at all and the only character worth remembering. The male \"lead\" (the real lead is Yuuko) is generic and forgettable and if you don't remember his name three months after completing the show I wouldn't be surprised. Likewise the supporting characters, while I did genuinely like both of the main ones, were largely cookie-cutter and forgettable. Perhaps these characters seem worse than they actually are because of how fantastic Yuuko is, but I really can't emphasize strongly enough, and you'll understand when you watch it, the degree to which Yuuko is the show.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the story was very good, borderline great, but not quite exceptional. Strong 8 or weak 9 feels applicable here. I think one of the biggest misconceptions with this anime, and perhaps one of the biggest reasons some people don't like it, is they think they're signing up for a terrifying horror-genre anime and that's not what they get. This anime definitely has bits and pieces of multiple genres but I think first and foremost it's a love story that happens to have horror elements. This is not a show where being scared is the main premise whatsoever. It just happens to be a ghost story with a few scary moments, but that's definitely not the point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show at 10/10 levels. I loved the mixing and matching of genres and felt it came together perfectly, I loved Yuuko and I found the story, especially its amazing and wildly underrated ending, incredibly touching. Anime does not often give me the feels and this one really, really did. I fully realize I liked this show more than most people seem to and that's fine. There's no accounting for personal taste. I thought this show was incredible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't recommend strongly enough that you tune out the negative reviews and watch this show. This is one of those cases where the consensus is wrong, as this is one of the most criminally underrated shows in anime history. It's gorgeous, touching, charming and engaging. Just know what you're getting into before you start- a love story with horror and slice of life elements- NOT a hardcore scare your pants off horror series.\\n\\n\r\n+Unique mixing and matching of genres that really works\\n\r\n+Yuuko is an exceptional and highly memorable character\\n\r\n+FANTASTIC soundtrack\\n\r\n+Deeply touching story/ending\\n\\n\r\n-Yuuko is a one woman show- no other characters matter or are worth remembering\\n\r\n-Immature fan service moments\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Strong 9\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 10",

It\u2019s not every day you see an anime with very convincing horror/mystery in it but still able to do comedy. And another great thing is ecchi, drama, and romance genres are also nicely incorporated in the storyline. And what\u2019s more exciting is that it\u2019s a slightly episodic series. And of course, mysteries always come with the extremely exciting and anticipating revelations at the end.\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nOne of the amazing things with mystery stories are the equally mysterious and over so interesting characters. The road to finding out who really they are,their secrets, and their pasts are the most anticipating because it is the key plot in the story which is obviously the reason for the title of this series.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\\n\r\nThe animation made the horror and mystery parts so effective, convincing and exciting. The sounds are also well chosen for important scenes or moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a haystack of mystery stories out there and this one is definitely a treasure find among them. Every element of the series is well-incorporated with each other and the result is one amazing story. It\u2019s one of the most entertaining and most interesting mystery stories I\u2019ve watched in a long time.\\n",

            "content": "This season's anime series pleasantly surprised me. There is the zombie show that surpassed any great drama in storytelling, and there is the detective/mystery show that doesn't need murders or man-made puzzles to complicate the story. Then there is this, dusk maiden of amnesia, which blended ecchi, comedy, and horror together. These three shows cleverly trivialized the common conceptions of zombies, mysteries, and ghosts and put everything in a first person perspective.\r\nDusk maiden of amnesia's cleverness can only be appreciated if you don't first preconceive it as a horror, ecchi, or comedy show. It's all of them yet it's none of them. I'm not familiarwith the usual horror series since I rarely watch them, but I suppose the director/directors made the animation horror styled. It's effective and created a good atmosphere. The sound is in my opinion the highlight of this series. From the opening and ending themes to the sound effects, they are all top notch and really brought this series to another level. \\n\r\nCharacter-wise, I have nothing to complain. At first I didn't like any of the characters. I thought they were stereotypical and a little fake. But along the way, I grew to like them. They didnt really develop and even the changes in the main character Yuuko is pretty superficial, but despite that, I still grew to like who they are. I think it partly has to do with Yuuko dominating most of the scenes. With everything involving around Yuuko, I think it'll become pretty obvious that if you dislike Yuuko, you won't enjoy watching this series. However, if you like Yuuko, you will feel attached to the people around her.\\n\r\nPlot-wise, I find it to be quite clever. I never would put a flirting half naked girl in a mystery/horror story because if it's wrongly done, it's pretty much like trashing the story. However, very surpringly, the girl fits, and even the occasional bursts of comedic effects seem appropriate and not out of place at all. Again, I think it's because the story is so focused on Yuuko as a person that even the mysteries surrounding her seem like a backdrop. Even her being a ghost is quite trivialized and made into use only for comedic effects. \\n\r\nThe other thing I thought quite unique about this series is the message behind the story. Of course, most detective and mystery shows have already told everyone that behind every mystery is a human mind at work, but what about fear? I don't think fear itself has been explored in most mystery/horror shows because they are made to create fear in people. A horror series that trivializes fear by turning fearful situation into comedic or ecchi situations together with turning fear into a reflection of the mind, I think that refreshing way of looking at horror deepens the meaning of this series. If you simply want to have a nightmares, this show is too soft. I would only recommend it to those who don't pick it up for its genres. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First thing to say, is that you'll find a lot body exposure here, which is followed by funservice elements. I think that funservice might be good, when it's limited to a certain degree, they almost made it balanced.\r\nThe most important thing in the plot is love. The one that cannot exist, my favorite kind of romance plot. When people think about the present, forgetting or not thinking about what can happen in future, about the consequences.\r\nUnlike any other anime, this one uses a lot of physical subjects, erotic subjects to be exact, in a interesting way, they way of desire. The way not being touchedby anybody for years, which makes you wanna be touched everywhere, when you meet somebody. It's interesting. Unfortunately a lot of times the vibe around it is destroyed, and that is dissapointing.\\n\r\nIt's also a mystery story, about vengance and grief. \\n\r\nIt's also a story about people's souls and feelings.\\n\r\nAnd it's also a story of simple students in a weird world. \\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nOK. Vibe. I do like it, especially with all the things they did to make this vibe special. With all the art and music, pretty good.\\n\r\nBut I am so dissapointed, so so dissapointed.\\n\r\nThe thing is that this series can make you feel a bunch of real emotions, it makes you experience the pitiful sadness. It shows you, how people can crazily do something that, even though it was their decision, will have bad, bad consequences in future, and how they won't think about it. How people can live freely focusing only on the present, and the emotions that are always with them.\\n\r\nAnd then they just destroy it, they ruin everything. With funservice, with unnecessary comedy bits, with pointless dialogues that won't even contribute to the vibe or plot. And that is dissapointing, very dissapointing.\\n\r\nThe authors tried to be outstanding, and yet they wanted to remain in the mainstream, that doesn't work, it just doesn't.\\n\r\nAnd so the vibe was GOOD, but at times it got ruined as fuck, this anime would be so much better without these unnecessary scenes and comedy.\\n\r\nBecause I hate when they try to make \"body\" subject so serious and then they laugh about it, choose one site. And anwser yourself which is better, and which you have to minimize. \\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nIt's pretty. It's damn pretty. First of all the art style is up top, the animation quality is great. I love the looks for Yukko-san so much.\\n\r\nBut what is outstanding about it is that they managed to make people that should be \"original\" original. They happened to master the way of making characters with a great look. Even when you compare main characters, you can easily notice which of these are made to be glorious and which are made to look pitiful.\\n\r\nThe next thing that I liked were the little touches of screen transitions. They made it diffrently in a way of desiging how to show \"talking\" scenes, there's a lot of talking there, so they would make you busy with all the arts, bacgrounds and little boxes around, to keep you more interested.\\n\r\nMoreover they masterfully used that in important scenes in the series, managing to make them more enjoyable and basically better.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nOh wow, I seriously do like it. The opening is not one of the best, I must say. But soundtrack cooperates with the series in a great combo. You can obviously hear that in the background.\\n\r\nI liked that authors would make a soundtrack that was only used in one scene, that worked so nicely. Because it was new, and you could feel more emotions in that certain scene, and believe me that scene is great.\\n\r\nIt's ideally composed to the genre - mystery, horror, romance. And you can obviously hear that too.\\n\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nThe storyline is not as interesting as you would think. There is some grim story behind it, oh there is. But the thing is that, the way towards the revealing of the story is pretty boring. It could have been better.\\n\r\nBUT\\n\r\nI do recommend the story line and the whole series for one big moment, and this one big moment is one of the best scenes in animes ever made. You will embrace such emotions while watching it, and it's worth watching the whole series through, for just this one scene, this one expierience.\\n\r\nYou will notice which scene I am talking about. And here is my best advice for you, Im not gonna say anything, Im just gonna say this: Turn off your media player after that scene, don't watch it till the end, and don't watch the other sequel episode.\\n\r\nYou can do whatever, that is my honest advice for you. Im not gonna say more, you can probably deduce what I have in mind by saying what I just said.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIt's not one of the best animes out there, its pretty average with a good bunch of outstanding elements to it.\\n\r\nThe plot sums up to a great scene, which I liked. But unfortunately authors while trying to be outstanding, they forcefully stood in the mainstream.\\n\r\nAnd that ruined them, it wrecked them apart.\\n\r\nThis anime would have been so much better, if only they stuck to one idea for the series.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Review: https://youtu.be/wJMFCGcjqVs",

            "content": "THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, albeit minor ones\r\nTasogare Otome X Amnesia\r\nI first heard of it from a YouTube playlist that I chose for studying. One of the songs caught my ear so I looked it up. Its genres include Horror, among other things, so I did not dare watch it.\r\nAfter a few months of occasionally thinking of it, I thought about searching \"Is [copypasted title] scary?\" All the replies said 'no' except one, making me think twice. Around two weeks later, I started watching.\r\nIt was good and here's why\r\nIts story started out introducing the characters and set up expectations of the type of animeit'll be in a fairly interesting way, making it out to be pretty light hearted. It mostly is. Fun things happen and characters are developed somewhat up to around one-third in. Then the mystery deepens and the female lead gets fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well paced throughout, starting with a problem, working towards fixing it up to a climax and then a resolution. Every arc follows this properly and feels neither rushed nor dragged out. The mystery feels normal at first and takes a back seat while the characters are characterised, a part of human nature is explored and key supernatural mechanics are demonstrated. After that, the main plot takes over. Events occur that change the female lead's behaviour and the plot thickens. The plot doesn't have very many twists in it yet tension is maintained as layers are peeled off one at a time.\\n\\n\r\nTwo things really stood out to me. I like this episode that, while the plot is going on, it uses a sound, shows an object, followed by the appearance of something. It repeats this a few times such that whenever you hear the sound, you know what's going to appear, triggering a little alarm in your head. Another little touch I really like is in a different episode. Most of the episode is from the first person perspective, creating a very different... feel? [This won't spoil much] When the person stretched and yawned, the edges of the screen flashed white a bit, mimicking the feeling when doing so. I thought that was really cool. When the person gradually started to worry, the visual effect started out subtle, then escalated with each heartbeat, showing the emotions of the person without showing the face. I thought that was pretty neat too.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, after the main plot starts, one of the supporting characters appears a few times but only to encourage the male lead to do the obvious. For someone given so much significance to the plot, her lack of character and involvement is disappointing. The male leads also starts to feel like merely a device to drive the story and be indecisive to keep things interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that stands out a lot when watching is the visuals. The show likes to use heavily saturated colours, stark contrasts, extremely dark shadows and spatial distortions in important scenes. When the scene depicts evil, it uses dark colours and distorts the screen.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were good stuff but I felt a bit betrayed by the song intro, which both sounded like something great before switching gears, so it ended up just 'good'. The song that introduced me to the anime was great though. \"Requiem\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was great. Engaging. It is also spooky but not scary: no jumpscares or any spooks that'll stick to you after watching.\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "The style/genre of Gothic was more or less born from a deep-rooted desire to display the darker side of human nature. This was roughly around the period of Romanticism we're talking about, which was all about the elevation of humans themselves, and, importantly, their feelings and emotions, as sacrosanct to all else. This was the death of Rationality, the birth and rise of Feeling, as a value, and the extinction, or, rather, open desecration of the Divine.\r\nGothicism rode on that. You had people writing stories of Vampires, as paragons of unbridled and destructively rapturous desire. You had people writing about the abject failures of Science,and the creation of otherworldly monstrosities, like Jekyll & Hyde, or Frankenstein, and yet, the notion that all these abject failures were born solely and surely from the human self. Poets wrote about Damnation, Spooky Moon-lit Nights, and (for the French side) fucking a lot of whores.\\n\\n\r\nYet, this was the Western side of the equation. On the other hand, in the Eastern side, there was already an enamored interest in the otherworldly, ghosts and their ilk. Perhaps it was because the Eastern culture was more accepting of contradictions, or that the Buddhist mindset had conveyed to them the sense that everything was a dream, and thus they were closer to dreams than their Puritan counterparts (then again, this is a kind of stereotyping. Especially given that Germanic cultures, with their strange fairy tales and magic spells, was such a huge influence on the poet Goethe. I'm less acquainted with that aspect, so let's just take it as the West were pretty damn 'kvlt' in certain areas beforehand as well\". Pu Songling's famous Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio depicted a host of spirits intermingling, and, even, fornicating with humans. Japan had their Youkai, and the animism of Shinto. Our current trends of harem & romance genres consisting of human protagonists chasing after strange and otherworldly females, gods, aliens, and all that, is merely a form of Pop-Romanticism. An extension of the tendencies that existed in the long past.\\n\\n\r\nSo when Gothicism came to the East, it flourished beyond measure. The most famous art-work, wrapped in this kind of mentality, would be the Muzan-e prints. Famous prints depicting violent scenes from various Kabuki plays and myths. Later you had writers like Edogawa Rampo and Yumeno Kyusaku seeing the Gothic Erotic sensibility in full bloom. They wrote darker and more twisted, visceral and surreal tales. Similarly, in the West, the Surrealists were attaining their bloom, with the most heinously abject of them being the French Writer George Bataille.\\n\\n\r\nThis was just a brief sketch, and the whole movement is probably too dense to go into in a brief review. It stretches into Manga Artists like Suehiro Maruo and Shintaro Kago, and, directors like Takashi Miike. And, Edogawa Rampo treaded the same path as his primary influence, Edgar Allen Poe, to mix the mystery genre in as well.\\n\\n\r\nInfectiously, such manic sensibilities became intermixed into the culture as well. You have the famous urban myths of dead school-girls, and seven school mysteries, and other assorted charms and spells. We can see how such otherworldly taboo captures and tingles the deepest roots of our imagination, especially our adolescent fancy. Not too far back, the 'Charlie Charlie' fad was spreading on Youtube and in schools.\\n\\n\r\nTasogare Otome X Amnesia, is a celebration of all these things. It's a celebration of the reasons why paranormal clubs go to abandoned locations with cameras and other strange equipment in search of a dare or a fancy. It's a celebration, but it's also a warning. It's a warning about how such things, when taken too far, becomes, more than just a love, or an aesthetic, into a violent and virulent superstitious sensibility. It is quite telling that, in Amnesia, the scariest creatures are humans.\\n\\n\r\nThe main heroine of Amnesia is a benevolent ghost. This is not a new trope, of course, and, as I mentioned, it has its roots from Pu Songling, to, even Takahashi Rumiko, with some chapters of Urusei Yatsura. The most interesting thing about Yuuko though, is that she changes appearance depending on the perception of others. This is reminiscent of Kubrick's The Shining, where Jack makes out with a beautiful woman, only to find out he's been making out with a corpse. Yet, importantly, this is not done for horror reasons, but, rather, as an apt metaphor for how people in the world perceive such things. There are those who are enamored, and there are those who are freaked out, and there are those who are addicted solely to the thrill of being scared. The moral, though, is Gothicism in its truest sense. If you learn to love the night, and if you find the night beautiful, and if you go beyond the mere primal instincts and cheap thrills wrapped up in the whole deal, you will gain the treasures of the night.\\n\\n\r\nBeing directed by Shaft-influenced Director Oonuma Shin, Amnesia takes another great cue from Bakemonogatari, which is the whittling down of everything other than the main characters. This is done to great benefit, and, although there are some others that come into play, for the most part everything is focused on the 4 members of the mystery club, and, even more, on the protagonist and the heroine. The result is a poetic and hallucinogenic quality for the most part, almost akin to the first half of Hitchcock's Vertigo. A boy and a beautiful ghost walk throughout the dusk-tinged old quarters of a school, and talk about mysteries, and she speaks poetically about things like Amnesia and the nature of Superstitions.\\n\\n\r\nYet, when other characters come in, and, at an especially climactic point in the series, the warning is raised. You've been given the Night, and you've been captured into its spell, but less you think that the Night is your friend, watch closely at how the Night emerges within other Men. When the thrill of fear is intermixed with Gothic enamor, you have mysteries going haywire, and people driven by a desperate sense of curiosity. These are the condemned. In the end, the Night is for the lonely, and the Night is for those who need to be understood, and the Night is not your whimsical domain.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, in contrast with the Night, we come to the concept of Life. Unlike your by-the-numbers harem, flesh plays a very important role in Amnesia. Besides fanservice (I admit it has that sensibility), the idea of touch is very important. Yuuko's reaction to being touched by Niiya, or not being touched, feels more important when it stands on the borderline of decay. The fruits of her flesh are suspect when other people see her as a rotten corpse, and yet, this is not the Shining, so which is the real flesh? For that reason, when fanservice occurs in the closed quarters of the abandoned and otherworldly poetic Gothic universe of Amnesia, the juxtaposition becomes all the more essential. It plays in with that very Freudian idea that Sex and Death are two sides of the same coin, and much of Gothic Romanticism focuses on this aspect as well.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there is a narrative to be unwrapped, and things need to be solved. In the end, when everything falls away, and returns back to the daylight, and simple loves, and rational answers, and Hollywood marriages, then, it all plays out like a quite long, and quite unforgotten, lingering dream.",

            "content": "Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is the epitome of an ecchi melodrama more so than a horror. It drifts away from the main plot several times to gloss over cleavage. Once the story leads down the horror path, it immediately abates with adolescent drama or sexual themes. There are truths revealed later in the series that could possibly excuse these flaws, but it does not relieve SILVER LINK\u2019s inability to follow through with a solid ghost story. \r\nThe plot revolves around Yuuko, the mysterious ghost, and discovering her past to better understand her current state. Niiya falls in love with Yuuko shortly after their first meeting.The romance seems unrealistic with the love-at-first-sight deal, especially the overused cliche \u201caccidental boob grab\u201d occurring during the first meeting and other occasions. Most of their time together consists of Yuuko flaunting her body or begging Niiya to touch her. However, as the show progresses, it shows that Niiya actually cares for Yuuko and wants to solve the mystery. As it nears the end, their romance seems genuine, but the ending was really cliche and doesn't follow through with the supernatural aspect at all.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Kanoe and Okonagi. Kanoe was a good addition to the show. Unlike the others, she at least showed effort towards moving the main plot forward by coming with clues and leads to Yuuko\u2019s past. Okonagi was the comical addition to the series, being the only one who cannot see Yuuko. Guess what all of these characters bring together. A love square\u2026 This causes a lot of cheesy drama, typical jealousy, and constant sadness.\\n\\n\r\nOther ghost stories and the other characters\u2019 backgrounds are introduced to merge with the overall mystery, so it is not all filler like the episodes entirely composed of drama. Although it might seem overdone, I enjoyed the artistic visuals. The characters\u2019 black silhouettes and gloomy hallways added to the mood appropriate to the show\u2019s main plot. There are also dark scenes with mute voices and suspenseful music. What disappointed me the most was Yuuko\u2019s role as a troll with no one taking notice. Yuuko, as a ghost, would feed Niiya in public, sit in his lap and Niiya mumbles to himself, play basketball, or other shenanigans. It's possible, because Okonagi noticed abnormal activity conducted by Yuuko plenty of times.\\n\\n\r\nThe cliche ending made the entire story meaningless, unless you enjoy happy endings with no consideration for logic whatsoever. Apart from the final ending, the reveal of Yuuko\u2019s background and connection between the characters proved the reasoning behind her actions, including her lustful behavior. Regardless, I was disappointed with Amnesia. If it focused more on the main plot instead of the ecchi fanservice tropes, I would\u2019ve enjoyed it more. Also, if you plan to watch the show, stay tuned for extra scenes after the credits.",

            "content": "If, like me, you\u2019re a seasoned anime vet, you\u2019ve likely already convinced yourself that you\u2019re not going to enjoy this show. I mean, how could a show possibly manage to be scary whilst adhering to all those fanservice-y tropes we all love to hate? But, wait! Maybe this review can actually convince you to set aside your prejudices and give this surprisingly adept horror/romance a go!\r\nStory\r\nDusk Maiden was astonishingly competent as both a horror story and as a sexually-charged high school romance. These are two genres you wouldn\u2019t expect to work together, but I found that the cutesy, fanservice-filled scenes contrasted so starkly with thescenes intended to unsettle and scare viewers that it only emphasised these feelings all the more. But the show was more than just fanservice and fear. As it unfolded it actually became a surprisingly touching story about the redemptive properties of love and its ability to transcend all barriers (including that between the dead and the living). And its finale seemed to want to convey that, no matter how much you love somebody, you cannot escape having to eventually part ways. A shockingly bleak message for a show in which boobs made honking noises when squeezed. It\u2019s a crying shame that the show rescinded that message during its very last moments. Dusk Maiden also kept you pondering over the mysterious circumstances surrounding Yuuko\u2019s death, with various twists and turns in her story keeping you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nYuuko could be a bit full-on, completely dominating any scene she was in, but she was extremely interesting, with many different dimensions to her personality and backstory. By way of contrast, Teiichi wasn\u2019t too strong a character. Throughout the majority of the show he let himself be pushed around by other people and would flounder when made to feel like he had to defend himself. It was only towards the very end of the show that he began to demonstrate any resolve. The two supporting characters, Kirie and Momoe, whilst underdeveloped, were, thankfully, very entertaining, making me laugh on a number of occasions!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nDusk Maiden\u2019s art was also impressive. The colour palate used for many of the backgrounds was satisfyingly grimy, in keeping with the show\u2019s themes of decay and death. By way of contrast, many of the night-time scenes used deep greens, purples, and blues that made the world the characters inhabited seem ethereal and otherworldly, reflecting the supernatural element of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nDusk Maiden\u2019s opening and ending tracks were powerful, both incorporating a choir to give them a gothic, otherworldly feel. The music used within the show was also atmospheric, enjoyable, and complementary of its tone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nI went into this show expecting extremely little of it, having been burned by one too many ecchi/horror shows in the past (I\u2019m looking at you, Highschool of the Dead), so I was shocked to find myself actually really enjoying it. I\u2019ll likely never get the same level of enjoyment out of shiny, plastic-like boobs being honked that so many other anime fans seem to get, but the contrast between the fanservice and the horror actually emphasised the horror aspect of the show quite nicely. Additionally, the show\u2019s story was moving and kept you guessing, its characters were entertaining, and its music and art was stunning. Dusk Maiden is surprisingly difficult to fault! I would recommend it to anybody interested in fanservice, horror, or fanservice and horror.",

            "content": "I can't say I have that much of experience with these kinds of anime, but to be the first, it was surprisingly good! Horror and romance, how could you possibly pull that off? My answer, they succeeded. I actually enjoyed this one to be honest. I'll keep it short but also informative! \r\nStory\r\nYes, oh god yes, I really enjoyed the story. The opening was definitely not boring, also something I would like to point out with this genre (horror). They did not make the mistake of making characters dying left to right, I mean some horror genre can have a very high death count, thisparticular anime did not have that, and that made it all better! They did not skip on anything, they balanced the romance and the horror, it wasn't too overwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe style was not too shabby, I liked how they had these special transitions, never seen one of those before. The antagonist was really wicked looking, definitely not common to have that style, in my opinion. Some of the scenes were well done, they really did a number on how to expose the essential parts of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI am a sucker for piano, so naturally I had to give it a \"10\". Especially how they embedded the soundtrack with the scenes, it was magnificent, that made the scenes a thousand times better! The emotions they wanted to reveal was much more effective with the sound, and that is what I truly appreciate in an anime!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe score was not as high since, of course the main characters were well made with their background, personality and all that but I did not like how they in some scenes pushed in unessential characters. This made no sense, was it to clarify the scene or? It just confused me, I mean they weren't suppose to be important and they didn't enhance anything to the story nor did anything significant. It was just unnecessary, I mean you wouldn't notice even if they were not present.\\n\\n\r\nSummarize\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this one, for many reasons, but the one that took it to the top was that everything fell into place so good, just like cogwheels, it went like a charm. This is far the best romantic horror based anime I've seen. I can't even really express to how I felt watching this one, something that some might not agree with is the ending. Some would have preferred the other way, and some the direction this one went with, in my case, I would have preferred the other way actually, that is why this one was not outstanding! To be fair, it wasn't a bad closure but with everything they built up, the other way would have emphasized the effect of the structure, all that said, it is still worth watching, especially if you like romance!",

            "content": "Every once in a while I decide to watch something at random, most of the time I end up dropping the anime or end up watching it, but not liking it. There are times though that I end up watching something fantastic and thank god I picked this one for today. It sounded interesting, the idea of a romantic horror isn't something you hear about everyday and that was mainly the deciding factor for me to watch it. It accomplishes what it sets out to do, it's just a bit slow to actually do it, but it was definitely worth it.\r\nStory- The story is abit generic to be honest, the backbone at least. It's about a girl that haunts the school because she died many years before when the anime takes place, 60 years to be precise. How the story differentiates itself though is that it's also a romance, and a fairly fulfilling romance I might say. I've watched a lot of romances and most of the time i'm left not being happy, it doesn't seem like nothing has changed since the beginning and it just feels like a giant waste of my time, but not with this. My one and only complaint would have to be that it's a bit slow to getting good. It was enjoyable up to the point where the exciting stuff started happening, but it was just mainly comic relief with some glimpses of what's to come in the future. I don't really like that, but it is what it is, the comedic relief parts do manage to have some small relevance later on though so it's not like it's completely nonsensical. The storytelling is definitely better on later down the line. I would say the last couple of episodes is what most people will remember about this anime for sure. It had some really amazing scenes, specifically one section near the end where half the episode was in first person, that was something that was pretty cool that I haven't seen done before.\\n\r\n   The story was entertaining the entire time though, they were always giving glimpses about the darker nature of everything in the more comedic parts of the anime so it always was making you want more, making you want to just watch the episode. I was at a point to where I was like \"Yeah, this seems fun, but I don't think it will get good\", the fan service and just laid back attitude of it all was making me start to get tired of it, but it definitely picked itself up. I don't want to write any spoilers because I want people to experience it the way I did. Just hang in there, it gets better down the line, it's actually quite jarring how dark it got.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art style and animation quality are really good. Nothing out of the ordinary. The designs are standard, but really high quality and professionally done. I don't think this anime needed anything special though as far as the art style goes, it can accomplish what it wants without having to have an overly excessive and exaggerated art style. Sometimes standard is just the best option.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound quality is about the same as the art, standard but quite fitting. The op and end soundtracks are amazing though. It gives off an upbeat, yet creepy vibe, it's really pretty cool I must say. The opening specifically, I know for sure that it will be stuck in my head for a while.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- There are 4 main characters, Yuuko who is the ghost girl with amnesia, Teiichi who is the main boy character of the anime, Kirie who later joins the club that Yuuko makes, and finally Okonogi who also joins the club later on. Yuuko is the girl who died 60 years prior to when the main story takes place and has some issues on her own. She appears to be this fun and uncaring girl that just wants to sexually harass Teiichi, but she has a bit of a darker past than that and her personal story is definitely a complex and interesting one. She grows more as a character than anyone else in the anime and it's quite the journey. Teiichi joins the club with Yuuko and learns about Yuuko being dead and then sets out to help her recover her lost memories. He also grows some as the story goes on, but he stays mostly the same throughout everything, which isn't a bad thing. Kirie is one of the other girls that later joins the club, she is a bit hard to describe, she's more of a side character than a main character, but she's with the group the entire time and does have a lot of influence of how the story turns out, plus she has some of her own \"issues\" in the story as time progresses. Lastly is Okonogi who is another girl who joins the club and wants to study ghosts and paranormal activities. She has a bit of an apparent crush on Teiichi and just wants to spend time with him learning about ghosts and him. Again she is more of a side character, but she also has a lot of impact on the story later down the line and becomes more important as time progresses. All of the character are well written and well acted out, nothing to complain about. Yuuko is by far my favorite though, she's a very interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- It was enjoyable the entire time through, but it really picked up near the last couple of episodes of the anime. Some of the more interesting parts of the anime was with how they done certain scenes. Like the one long segment where it's entirely first person, or the entire first episode, it has an amazing first episode. You will enjoy the first half of so because of fun going and just cutesy the characters are, but you will enjoy the second half or so for it's deep story and rather disturbing story and romance. It's a pretty strange anime, but that's what makes it fun and enjoyable. I had a really good time with this anime and I think that if the thought of a good romance horror sounds good to you then you should try it, I really enjoyed myself watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall it was slow to start, but really picked up the pace and actually amazed me. I'm glad that things started going the way they were, they got rid of the cutesy fan service shit and started to get more serious about it, after all it is a story about a ghost with a rather troubling past. It's something that I think a lot of people will like, but a lot of people will be turned off by. Either way I thought it was well designed and executed and if you like what you've read here then you should definitely give it a try, just don't get turned off by the first half or so of the anime, it definitely gets a lot better later down the line. It's has my definite recommendation.",

This is dark at parts but it is lightened up by the bubbly personality of Yukko-san. The evolution of the characters and the subtle showing of each of their personalities and their drives within this anime truly make it spectacular. This come highly recommended by me. There are times it can be sad, I know I cried a couple of times. For me, I started to really like Yukko-san, and Kirie and Teiichi. The most unfortunate part of the characters is that Okonogi seemed rather uselessand pointless. However, she was only a secondary character. This anime gives you, at the end, a very important message. I don't want to spoil the anime and by saying the message it just might, there might even be multiple messages within it so you should watch it to find them for yourself. Watch this, this is simply one of the best anime I've seen in awhile. It definitely unique and very, i guess, uplifiting.",

            "content": "Ever so rarely do I get drawn to this type of story (anime/manga or otherwise). My encounter with Tasogare Otome x Amnesia was the result of pointless web searches on a sleepless melancholic night. The encounter began and ended on that same long night. And I enjoyed it thoroughly.\r\nThis is a very biased review - from the viewpoint of someone who enjoyed the show so much, they are more or less blind to its flaws; be it pointless fanservice/ecchi moments or major plot flaws. Every story and every piece of artwork has a number of those; and no piece of art is ever judged bythat number. Imagine Van Gogh's \"The Starry Night\" and tune out, for a moment, the words of those high heeled \"enlightened intellectual\" wanna-be critics. Subjectively (and quietly, lest the savvy critics hear them), anyone might have a few or more objections to the painting - strokes and colors they preferred having been brushed differently. But if The Starry Night gives you that mysterious sense of glorious tranquility, it becomes a reference image for that sensual experience and you accept it as a whole, with (and not in spite of) its \"subjective\" flaws. Well, in that case your opinion is backed by the voices of the fine arts-educated critics and you might be pleased by their affirmations. Such was the experience of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia for me. The comparison certainly sounds absurd - since it is conventional wisdom that The Starry Night is much closer to the ideal form of art as a painting, as Tasogare Otome x Amnesia would ever be to the ideal animated picture. But I'm only interested in my subjective viewpoint - I enjoyed it so much (perhaps because of the particular setting - melancholy and all) that I do not recollect any of its flaws (as much as I'm certain there are quite a few) and have a distinctively positive take which I'm going to defend. So, this is a biased review.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe love story is not original - it hasn't been for a very long time. Every version of the story has been told over the eons by master story tellers in every setting one can imagine. Not to state that there can't be anything original about a love story - the originality lies in the setting and the extent to which it explores the elusive concept of love. For a great love story, it's how it is told that sets it apart. One can easily point to quite a few great examples in the literature. Not so in the motion picture universe - especially anime. While there are a few examples of good love stories in anime, so often they are burdened by dragged out stories, confusing relationships and superficial takes on deep concept duos such as love and longing, desire and fulfillment loss and mourning, jealousy and rage. That's regrettable given the war-chest of design, character and concept anime has to tell good stories.\\n\r\nTasogare Otome x Amnesia excels ever so greatly in the story department. The sotryline is purposely and masterfully designed to be light and without pretense. While the underlying events and the overall settings are indeed grave and sometimes very depressing, the story never loses sight of what it's supposed to tell and pulls all the elements at its disposal, positive or negative, masterfully in the progress of a relateable and heartwarming story. The two grand schemes of the story, that of denial of suffering and negative emotions and that of \"love\", are interweaved so naturally and effortlessly, that there is no need for long pretentious monologues/dialogues about the meaning/nature of those - and there are none. There are no grand transformations, no heroic rescues or selfless sacrifices. There are only simple sensible emotions and very relateable characters playing out in a surreal situation mixed with humorous and dark moments in a simple line of story that is adamant on being the most believable ghost story. \\n\r\nThere are more than a few points and twists in the plot that are the common culprits for abusive over-exaggeration and pointless lingering in other shows/stories. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia however, simply uses them as anchors for the progression of the story, no more or less than they ought to be used.\\n\r\nIn the end, this is one of the better told love stories; one of the best told ghost stories, and certainly among the very few exceptional stories that anime has ever told.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Characters 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a fantastic job of utilizing the ambient and character design in service of the story line. Here there are no outrageous figure designs (with anime standards) and no over-use of colors and scenery to create forced appeal and suspense. The obsessively ordinary design resonates with the uniquely simple story. The design spares no effort to make the characters and settings likable and immersive; and it does an outstanding job at that. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI have no significant objection to the use of sound effects and insert music throughout the show - the sound blends in with the story and scenery to create a wholesome experience. I should however note that in a few occasions the background music could have been chosen more carefully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard to watch the curtains fall; This is a magnificent anime worth re-watching. \\n",

            "content": "I have to give one thing to Tasogare Otome x Amnesia (aka. Dusk Maiden of Amnesia). It has one of the most innovative plots I have ever heard for an anime. A high school boy and the ghost of a high school girl fall in love and form a paranomal investigation club at their school to try and help the ghost girl regain her memories? That sounds pretty darn innovative for me and probably the main reason why I stuck through it from beginning to end.\r\nI will admit that this anime got off to a fairly slow start. After the first 4-5 episodes, I reallywondered if I should continue because this anime wasn't quite what I expected it to be. It consisted of mostly Yuuko flirting with Teiichi and the whole group (Paranormal Investigation Club) discovering the ghostly rumors that were primarily caused by Yuuko's hijinx. Despite this slow start, I would encourage viewers to stick with it, it does get much, MUCH better.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I loved most about Tasogare was the emotional ties it created in its character development between Teiichi and Yuuko. While a lot of anime relationships seem extremely forced, this one feels completely natural. You feel that relationship grow later on in the series when...(NEXT PARAGRAPH IS ALL SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER) Teiichi witnesses Yuuko's tragic fate through a 1st person POV of the memory of her last day(s) alive. This was a downright amazing episode in my opinion. Teiichi felt all of the same senses that Yuuko felt and also felt the dread and fear of death as Yuuko waited for it in the basement shrine. Overall, it was just a moving episode, as were the two episodes that followed. (END SPOILER)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the weaknesses of Tasogare, there were quite a few in my opinion but the weaknesses themselves didn't affect the anime as a whole too much. I felt one of the biggest weaknesses however was the interpersonal character development of Teiichi. This anime focuses so much on Yuuko that I felt as though Teiichi seemed to lack in character development. We never saw the lead characters (Teiichi, Kirie, Momoe) outside of school. Another major weakness in this anime is the main plot really takes a while to get going. As I mentioned earlier, I debated dropping this anime because the first half of the series was rather monotonous and boring. Sure, the concept was interesting, but the first 4-5 episodes felt very similar and didn't help progress the plot. Once Shadow Yuuko is introduced, that is when the anime picks up. I'd say a 3rd major weakness of this anime was the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending wasn't terrible...but in my opinion, it was kinda corny and was hoping for a little bit different outcome. I wasn't completely disappointed with the ending as I did see it as a possible outcome, but the means behind it felt...well...ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tasogare, if nothing else, is an intriguing series. It is a flawed anime (very flawed) but I'll admit it tugged at my heartstrings quite a bit in its final three episodes. It took a turn that I wasn't quite expecting and I must say, I was quite grateful for that turn. Unlike a lot of people, I can overlook an animes flaws if it has the ability to move you. That's what I feel is the most fundamental strength of an anime. If it has the ability to draw you in to the characters and feel their emotions, then I feel as though it outweighs the flaws. If you're looking for an emotional love story, this is definitely worth a watch, but if you're specifically looking for a mysterious paranomal-heavy anime and not looking so much for a love story, I might pass on it.\\n\\n",

This show is so comedic at times that, when the hard stuff hits u, u get beat down by waves of emotion.\r\n Unlike shows like clannad, where the show's drama and emotion comes from its metaphorical nonstop baseball bat of emotion, this is the \"Nyaruko\" type of show, where the individual moments have u lookingback at what the character's original or underlying emotion was the whole time\\n\\n",

I have only one complaint about this anime, and that is Okonoge's (English dub) voice being that shrill, girly voice that tends to grate on one's nerves. That aside, the rest of the anime is amazing.\r\nIt's funny, has an excellent story that keeps you interested every step of the way and most of the characters actually have likable traits. Unfortunately, this anime is rather short. Thankfully though, while it is short,it does provide you with the sense that it doesn't really need any more episodes once you've seen the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10 in all departments even though I found Okonogi to be a rather annoying character. The music for this anime is just amazing. I loved the opening and closing songs. They were among the best I've heard and I rarely even bother listening to them more than once. So, I highly recommend watching this anime if you haven't seen it yet.",

            "content": "To be honest, I've expected more from this so-called 'Dusk Maiden' because of its soundtrack I've heard, Requiem.\r\nMy overview rating in this is most likely average: more than half of 6 stars come from the design, visual effects, cinematography, and soundtrack which is beautifully good. The other 4 springs from the crappy story and bland characters.\r\nTo start, the storyline gets interesting because of how it's \"put\", not by its core or how it is \"described\". It is repetitious, say Kage-yuuko and Yuuko. And it focuses on an obsessive romance--it's not even good anymore because of Yuuko's obvious thing for Teichi. A little more and it'ssoft pornography with the exposure of big boobs, of Yuuko exploiting herself. That's what just disappoints me.\\n\\n\r\n'Forgettable Romance' - Yuuko x Teichi\\n\\n\r\nAnd if this is romance, the two of them doesn't reek any chemistry. Yes, they dated, they did a lot of things together, and the way it ended made no difference: they went out together and watched the leaves fall, fed each other lunch. The main point is, in the beginning, they were ALREADY having a puppy love or 'skinny love' as I see it, so when you get to the near-epilogue, you're gonna be like: 'What's new??'\\n\\n\r\nI never wanted to be a bias, but I just couldn't help it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand is A GOD. It's good because it substitute the flaws of the story. I cringe every time a flashback is projected, or whenever Yuuko and Taechi were actually together because the background becomes a paradise: a rain of autumn leaves, a kaleidoscopic sky; very magnificent, very colorful and fucking bright. It's perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIt's as if saying that human beings--every moment, every part of living existence, was meant for this. \\n\\n\r\nThe drawings are 10/10. It's like a modern form of art and animation, because it's oil painting. Yeah that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are also convincing. Especially the theme song, REQUIEM by Nao Higarii. It fits the story perfectly. The opening and ending aren't boring to the ear, either. Thumbs up for the music composers! \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, I don't see anything fine with the characters. Okonogi has an ugly hair, and she is a symbol of gullible girls that have no use to the world. The only character that stands out isn't even the Maiden, but her rival Kaerie, whose voice actress was able to pull off an amazing girl who shields herself, covers her feelings with a laid-back personality. Otherwise, Taechi and Yuuko are little children K-I-S-S-I-N-G on the tree. \\n\\n\r\nI haven't enjoyed much of the episodes because the story doesn't really make sense to me. Finally, when it speaks of Yuuko's horrid past, it has HAD to be pissing. No one full of heart would even risk coming to a house of crazy, desperate townsmen--for heroism--? That selfless foolish thing led her to her death. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes were scary, almost unpleasant--if I compare this to Shiki, the creator would've laughed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this much. It promotes a cheap romance. The ghosts are 'OKAY' in terms of portrayal here, and the cartoon animation is good to draw inspiration for filmmaking aspirers.\\n\\n\r\nBut good music and good art isn't going to fill the blankness of a story page; the characters and plot will determine the ANIME'S future, and never its background. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Amnesia is one of the most commonly used tropes in all of media throughout any medium of entertainment. And the mass use of amnesia has caused it to become very bland for many veteran media consumers. However when this trope is used properly it can work wonders for an anime. The dusk maiden of amnesia is an example of an anime that does well for what it is but has some significant problems at the same time.\r\nThe dusk maiden of amnesia is a 2012 anime series that's based off a manga of the same thing. It follows a group of students and a ghostthat mysteriously died 60 years ago and how they investigate paranormal activities and try to find out how the ghost died while a interesting romance develops. Despite being a very serious sypnosis there is actually a significant amount of comedy in this series and that is both good and bad at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nDusk maiden of amnesia has a fairly well executed story. A lot of the time it follows the escapades of the paranormal investigation club. What I thought was unique is that the ghost is the president of the actual club. One major problem I had with the story though was that it can sometimes be confusing and it avoid the goal. Like this makes the plot progression unfortunately kind of poor. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big issue I had is the poorly timed comedy. When the show is trying to build an ominous atmosphere within a scene all of that built up immersion is broken when random fan service or comedy is added. Though the transition becomes better in the second half. The second half of the series is undeniably better due to it being overall more engaging and it actually cuts to the point.\\n\\n\r\nOne last gripe is the ending. The ending was ok but I felt that there was one scene that would have made the ending way more memorable. But than I felt they took the wussy way out and just gave us this ending that lessened the impact. But it could have been a lot worse. One positive thing is that the school setting doesn't just feel like a cheap back drop. There is some meaningful world building and lore that makes the setting more fascinating than other school set anime.  There are also some well intergrated themes in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are the most impressive part of the anime. For the most part they all have solid development and they enhance the story very well. The main protagonist, Niiya, has an interesting dilemma within the story and has an excellent relationship with Yuuko and the other characters in the story. Yuuko was a fascinating heroine and she has one of the greatest examples of eternal conflict I've seen in a long time. Kirie started out as kind of bring but she develops nicely over the course of the series. Okonogi unfortunately is not as interesting as the others big still has a good relationship with niiya. An interesting note is that Yuuko reminds me of senjougohara from Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\n That actual music of this anime is pretty decent. There are a few standout tracks but where it really gets good is the opening and ending scenes. These songs work well with the themes of the entire anime. The voice acting was also good and I had no complaints with how the seiyuu portrayed their respective characters. The animation was very pretty and had a sense of gloss and polish. However the background characters were all black silhouettes and this came across as kind of lazy.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion The dusk maiden of amnesia is an intruiging mystery anime with some great characters and an addicting quality. However there were some incongruencies I had with the narrative and background art. But for those who like mystery and ghosts this one is worth a watch.",

Character emotions are a focal point and look great. Soundtrack is similarly low-key overall, but suits the show well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has 4 main characters, though 2 of them get most of the screen time.

Their motivations are simple, but fit the show. Their characters aren't complex, but just right. \\n\\n\r\nThe show lasts only 12 episodes, so you might think it leaves things unresolved and makes you ask for more, but it really doesn't.

This review may be biased.\r\nStory:\r\nIn my opinion the story was perfectly executed, it performed comedy situations which we're fun, it succeeded in the moments it tried to be cute and the drama was spot on. Like I said, I am a complete pushover when I watch Romance/Drama anime, but Ihonestly did enjoy the story with all my heart. Sure it was a little predictable in places but that was never a problem. I predicted what I wanted to happen and the anime pleased me by carrying it out. The light hearted side works in spectacular contrast with the romantic drama and can have you laughing or crying, well have me crying. Overall the story in my opinion was perfect for my tastes. People that do not like heavily romance based anime may not enjoy this, as that did seem to be the main plot all the way throughout.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI really liked the characters, the main male character who is light-hearted and fun but on the other hand can be very dramatic if not a little wimpy. He always feels the need to cry along with me. The main female character is very similar to the guy but with less crying- but to narrow it down to just that would be an insult to the producers. She is so much more than that. We then have 2 main but slightly less main female characters. One of which has no dislikeable parts to her, she just bounces around like she's fallen into a rubber factory and mutated into some sort of overly-hyper bouncy ball. The other is insulting but plays the councillor sort of character throughout the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nIf you, like me, love a romance filled drama then I do believe you'll enjoy this thoroughly. If you prefer ghost stories and creepy shadow people, then I wouldn't strike this off your list either. While it is heavily romance based it still plays a creepy side along with it. There may be an army of people who disagree entirely with my review but this is genuinely my opinion, but then again, I'm not good at spotting bad things when I'm engrossed in the storyline. I guess you'll just have to shut your door, turn off your phone, order a pizza and don't come out until you've watched all of it or been so horribly disgusted by how bad it is to you that you've gouged out your insides with the crust of the pizza. \\n\\n\r\nGood luck!\\n\r\n-MrCallum",

I watch it till the end to make a good review coz I troll the Fate/zero season 2 and many got angry about it ... Sorry about that haters... well I'll try to make this spoiler free\r\nStory(7/10)\r\nIt's a story of a boy meets girl theme...a living boymeets a dead girl.. though It's progress is very fast...

It's like the lesson is don't move on whew hehehhe.. that's for my opinion\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10)\\n\r\nGood Art very much detail especial in some ecchi seens.. And kinda realistic... I like the art of Kage Yuuko.. It's kinda cool one(Kirie Kanoe)..

But most of it are enjoyable I could recommend it to anyone and I can classify it as comedy romance anime\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10)\\n\r\nif Sound is pertaining to Op theme and Ed theme I guess it passed to be a masterpiece.. It's good and its blending with the anime theme.. But I want this to be kinda thriller or something\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nWell like most anime there's a cool person(",

            "content": "Now before I start this review, I wanna say that this is arguably my favorite anime but I know that doesn't make it the best anime ever, as it does have flaws and for some people, they don't really like horror/mystery. However please note that this is based on my opinion and I do not think that this anime is perfect but it is amazing in my eyes, now moving on.......\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story starts off with the main protagonist Niiya Teiichi who encounters a ghost named Kanoe Yuuko who has amnesia and is trying to solve the mystery about her past, the two look tostart a paranormal investigation club in order to solve this mystery and soon enough they start hearing about \"paranormal encounters\" throughout the school. It starts off fairly slow and to most that is a turn-off, however that is mainly because they are introducing other characters, while trying to keep the cheerful side and comic relief in the anime, as you see later when things really start to heat up. The anime during the second half really knows how to rip your heart out and then shove it back in, only to then rip it out once more, so basically this is an emotional roller coaster and the more we find about Yuuko's past the more the feels start to kick in. Another great thing about the anime is the why they implement the \"horror factor\" they give shadow Yuuko a more sinister and evil look and make her out to be somewhat evil, rather we find out there is more to it then just that. In terms of romance and the relationship between the two, the anime allows for some comic relief and some really heart warming moments while also giving the emotion roller coaster all at the same time. Overall the execution is fairly good and the pacing can be considered a bit wayward but overall it is truly amazing how it can have your eyes glued to the screen while you watch some truly breathtaking scenes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThere are mixed views on this, some would say the animation is fairly average and that is a fair point. However I feel as if the art doesn't necessarily mean it has to have A+ animation, rather it has to suit the anime. Which it certainly does in this case, the art style and animation is very gloomy and dark and in my opinion it truly brings the best out  in each scene and really gets the viewer immersed into the atmosphere which it brings, sure it's not always gloomy and dark but it certainly puts chills down your spine at times while watching it. Overall the art is amazing and it suits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis is probably the strongest suit of the anime in my opinion. The opening is amazing, as is the ending, both worth listening to by themselves. But what is truly amazing is the soundtracks during the anime, some of them are outstanding and they just add to the emotional roller coaster that one feels, even listening to some of the soundtracks by themselves will crush your heart and have you teary. Mostly this is opinion based and some people won't necessarily like the music but most will say it is amazing. Both the Japanese version and the English version are also really good, the voice actors all suit their characters and always execute when needed to make the character truly feel real. Not much else I can say, I would give it a higher rating if I could.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nNow this is one area where it is hard to give it a high rating as some of the characters are done brilliantly and some are fairly average, it is also hard as there is only four main characters and a couple of side characters. First we have the main protagonist Teeichi who is fairly cliche and doesn't have much of a personality, rather he feels like your classic \"nice guy\" this doesn't necessarily make his character bad, however he does feel a bit one-dimensional and un-original. Next is the lead female, Yuuko, who is an absolutely amazing character, as she can be carefree and seem innocent, while at the same time being dark and having a mysterious aura about her. She truly makes you feel sad and happy deep down, as her story and life truly grip you and give you a deep understanding into her character and definitely feels like a real person. The last two mains Kanoe, Kirie and Okonogi, Momoe are fairly polar opposite to each other, One being fairly straight forward and tends to act as the responsible person, like a parent. The other Okonogi is fairly carefree and tends to be more of a comic relief and tries to be the third girl in the relationship but most of the time gets stood down by the other characters. Both of them are pretty well written characters and serve their purpose in the overall story. In conclusion the characters are all fairly well written besides maybe Teiichi, but even with that flaw the characters overall are pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nTo conclude I would like to say this review is fairly opinion based and may feel bias, but I do honestly feel that this anime deserves a good score, it's not prefect but it is something worth watching and in my eyes is considered a masterpiece. \\n\\n",

And Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is one of those \"good anime\". \r\nHaving no desire to rewrite the easily found plot description already provided, I will say that the story is filled with moments of suspense, of confusion when a mystery is carefully unfolding, and of the shock when they finally do reveal the satisfying conclusion. And scattered here and there among the elements of horror and mystery are moments of sweetness, of romance, of comedy, and of fan service (notso much where you cringe and mutter to yourself \"that would never happen in real life\", but just enough to give you the shy grin that only the flirtations of a pretty woman can give you). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, at the end of the day, after you watched this anime in it's entirety, you'll lean back in your seat feeling satisfied, and then recommending it to any of your friends that are even remotely interested in the many genres Tasogare Otome x Amnesia fulfills.",

It had it's sad, funny, scary, ecchi ? :D moments and all were processed so wel into it that nothing seemed out of place.

Tasogare Otome x Amnesia does what a lot of animes failed to do. It concluded the story. Very minor spoiler ----> The ending had a huge tear-jerking moment and an interesting plot twist as well, but it was very nicely concluded. I may have been swayed into giving it a perfect score because of the way it ended, but hey, everyone loves a happy ending. :)\r\nCharacters are interesting enough so that they don't bore you. They're closely linked to the main character, and it drives the plotreally well. \\n\\n\r\nArt was very decent, especially the way evil characters were animated. It's a horror show, and it proved to be a good one due to the animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound was excellent, as it provided really scary moods when needed to, and it also gave the ending its sad mood as well. I may have shed a few tears thanks to the last song during the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nStory was really well paced, and the backstory of the main characters was interesting and sad enough that I could really feel the pain the main character was going through. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10. \\n\r\nEverything about the anime was perfect. The romance was perfect. The story was perfect. The ecchi bits were perfect and not forced. The characters were perfect.\\n\r\nThis anime should be on anyone's \"must watch\" list especially if they like Romance and Supernatural genres.",

            "content": "The following review is written fresh from completing this anime in under 24 hours. \r\nHowever, before we get into it I'd like to make a note about fan service, because some people, including professional reviewers on places like Amazon seem to be slightly confused about what fanservice is. Fan service is nudity, near nudity and other titillation for titillation's sake, simply to give the audience a treat. If any form of sexuality or nudity in the show serves the plot and/or character development then it's not fanservice. So, does Yuuko strip down? Yes. However her lack of concern for her own nudity changes as thestory arc progresses. Why? Well watch it and it's rather patently clear. However, if it was completely clear I wouldn't have to be making this note. Let this serve as a warning to pay attention and actually stick your head in the lake and have a look around, as opposed to just watching the surface.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, taking it from the top!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nThe story in Dusk Maiden is absolutely beautiful. There's plenty of plot to enjoy and I didn't find any of it dry, boring or predictable and it had my guessing until I finally started putting two and two together towards episode 6 or so. I'm not writing anything about the story in detail in the name of avoiding spoiling, but it has a lovely blend of romance, comedy, horror and above all a good ghost story. Now, the story itself is complex, and details are hidden away in the art and even music. This isn't an anime you can't not pay attention to. It also generated a lot of discussion. A friend and I literally had to discuss every episode in detail.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, the story gets a gold star from me for avoiding my greatest anime pet peeve revolving around this concept called \"resolution\" that some anime directors seem to try and ward off like it's well, an evil spirit.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime is absolutely beautiful in every possible way. The character design is good and the sets and the ways the animators show us those characters and sets is absolutely wonderful. Cinematography is not something I often get to compliment in anime, but I have to for Dusk Maiden; angles, color, and an amazing variety of motions and fades create a visually grabbing world that blends beautifully with the art itself. As mentioned, the art hides a lot of really deep and meaningful symbols that contribute to the plot. The duology in particular makes for a gripping sense of atmosphere when it's employed. The opening gets special note for it's beautiful shots, and it's use of one of the symbols, the momiji (maple leaves in their autumn colors) which is a reference to a Noh play Momijigari, and the Kabuki dance drama of the same name. The latter being an expanded version of the former. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound Design - 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is stunning from start to finish, Choir Jail, the OP is well paced and enjoyable as Suzuki Konomi delivers once again, and Calendrier, sung by the character Yuuko herself for the EP, makes watching through the credits a treat not worth missing. Acquiring the OST is almost as much of a priority as the actual DVDs. Lucky for you dear reader if you do purchase the reasonably priced DVD box set, the OST is included. The music within the anime is excellent and well themed to the various scenes, ranging from upbeat to haunting. I'm honestly not sure what some of the other reviewers were listening to, but this audiophile was extremely pleased, even more pleased, as I am an audiophile, when I ran the OST through my expensive audio gear of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nTeiichi Niiya - Teiichi seems to be getting a lot of flak for being \"normal\", which I honestly think is a good trait, he might be a regular guy, but he's not weak when the chips are down, and when it comes to Yuuko he faces down some pretty serious stuff with his arms wide open. He's got a lot of courage, and of course gets props for being an anime character who can be open about his emotions before the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nMomoe Okonogi - The comic relief character, Momoe's a very pleasant ditz and scaredy cat who absolutely loves ghost stories and the paranormal, while at the same time having a very, very strong Reality/Someone Else's Problem filter that blocks out all but the most obvious actions of the paranormal.\\n\\n\r\nKirie Kanoe - The grand niece of Yuuko, Kirie is the only other person who can really \"see\" Yuuko. A complex and conflicted young woman, Kirie is actually one of my favorites in the story because of her arc and how she grows and confronts many of her own issues over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko Kanoe - That leads us of course, to the center that these three characters rotate around, the mournful beauty that haunts the grounds of Seikyou Academy, with no memory of her death or the life she lost, Yuuko is a surprisingly cheerful character at first blush, ecstatic that Teiichi can not only see her, but is more then happy to interact with her and be kind to her, the only person to likely do so in the sixty odd years since her death in 23 Showa (1948. Which means the show takes place in approximately 2008 if you care.) However her arc is the center of the show and she evolves beautifully as time goes on, revealing more and more shades of the complex, lonely and hurt spirit that lingers in the world of the living.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nIf you haven't picked up that I really liked this anime by now, I have to question what the hell you've been reading, because it's not this review. \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR; Watch the anime.",

            "content": "Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is a dark mystery romance that will grab you, make you laugh, cry, and occasionally groan and roll your eyes.  It's a \"boy meets ghost\" love story with some mystery and horror elements, some psychology of urban legends, and lightly seasoned with comedy.\r\nTypically, the characters are what make the show and Dusk Maiden has some decent characters but, with the exception of Yuko, they seem a little flat at first.  Of the main cast of four, Yuko outshines them all.  As she should, really.  She is the focal point of the story after all.  The remainingthree are made up of Teiichi who seems be more like the generic lone male in a harem show rather than the lovestruck hero trying to solve a mystery.  The remaining two main characters are the other female members of the club whom I will refer to as Tsundere and Comic Relief. Teiichi is one of only two characters who can see Yuko and he is the only person who can actually touch her.  This leads to several opportunities for some truly touching moments between Teiichi and Yuko (see what I did there...), but instead it is often used as a device for fanservice.  That aside, their interactions with each other are quite amusing.  Especially when Yuko is doing her best to toy with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on Yuko for much of the series, her loneliness, her growing relationship with Teiichi, and their journey to uncover her past.  Despite essentially being a ghost story, the show takes a step back as The Paranormal Investigation Club uncovers the often innocent roots of urban legends and ghost stories.  A recurring theme of the show is human perception, how it can be influenced, and the dramatic effects that fear can have.  Some deep stuff.  The story also takes a couple of light-hearted side trips to allow the viewer a moment to breathe and have a laugh.  My only complaint is that these side trips often interrupt the flow of the series.  There will be a deep realization about the power of fear or a particularly poignant moment between Teiichi and Yuko, then suddenly it's boobs, bento, or a festival.  Occasionally, the show seemed to forget what it was doing and devolve into a generic harem series.  The story does eventually get back on track after each detour, but it is a dangerous thing for a 12 episode show to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is quite good and remains fairly consistent across all episodes.  As most of the show takes place between sunset and sunrise, the lighting and backgrounds use a lot of soft reds, orange, and yellows making some of the darker scenes seem so much more so. Of course there is some fanservice, but it typically fits the scene and it's not excessive. The opening and closing animations are are quite well done and they change slightly with each episode as a way of shadowing what is happening in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the show seemed to do well in setting the tone for each scene, but there really weren't any stand-out pieces.  The opening song, Choir Jail, sounded like J-pop pretending to be gothic metal, but it wasn't terribly painful to the ears.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series.  I've watched it twice, if that says anything, and I will likely watch it again one day.  My only wish was that the romance element between Teiichi and Yuko had been handled a little better and perhaps if the music were a little more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show if you have a hunger for a dark romance and aren't put off by the thought of it dipping into harem territory for a couple of episodes.",

            "content": "Before I start a few side notes: if you asked me 8 months ago, I wouldn't have never ever touched this type of anime or anything even close to romance.  From then to now I've binge watched almost everything in my list. I haven't been watching anime for too long so keep that in mind. Also it's been a couple of months since I watched it so this review is coming out a bit late.\r\nAh where to start. For a while I skipped watching TOxA as the topic seemed a bit boring but dear lord what I would've missed. \r\nStory: 10\r\nAt first it seemedwayyy too boring. A lot of talking and not a lot of romance of what at the time I was looking for (something close to Kaichou wa Maid sama or Toradora) but soon I found myself clicking to the next episode and couldn't stop watching. One part is true like in other reviews: if you watch this anime on your right eye while left is doing something else, you will fall off and need to rewatch the episode to get back on to the train again. Looooved the flashbacks to Yuuko's life and oh the ending... I cried my eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm going to pass my thoughts on art and character as I can't remember the details well enough to write about them but I will say a few words why I enjoyed the sounds of TOxA so much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nIntro song stroke me deep. Beautiful singing combined with heavy and oppressive melody still tingles my neck every time I hear it. Also Requiem (one of the main melodies during the actual show), when watching the final episode and the grand finale while sobbing my eyes out, Requiem finished it. Even though I paused the video and tried to calm myself down, I just couldn't do it. The music had pulled my heart strings wayyy too hard. Loved  it in a twisted kind of way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI felt every range of emotions when watching this anime. The happiness, the butterflies in my stomach, crying my eyes out. Even being bored out of my mind during some parts. But I don't care because my personal motto is that if an anime can do that to me, it's worth rewatching and so I've enjoyed it. Then why not 10? Well I would've liked to see more episodes and find out how their life advanced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this anime is kind of different. As cliche as it may sound, I found out that I don't want to die alone. It made me think about my own life decisions, whether there will be people whom I can in the distant future share my final moments. It made me want to find people who'll be close to me and miss me if I were to die suddenly. Tasogare Otome x Amensia's final episode was enough to make me totally change my life style and how I view people around me.  I realized the limits of a human life and made me think for hours on hours. Never has an anime done that to me.",

            "content": "Forgive me if this \"is how the show was meant to be\" and I'm just lost. I can get that way sometimes and it seems to have caught me on this particular show. I figured this was right up my ally while I kept an open mind. There is solid truth to that. Regardless, it may have been worth watching at the least.\r\nI try my best to not reveal any secrets and give my personal opinion. No spoilers.\r\nStory: 5\r\nBasically, using the summary, there's a ghost that enjoys a certain male and his attention. Instantly you should know where these kind of things go. Let's lookpast this for a second and focus on what the story really offers. I'm a sucker for romance and there is plenty of it, to what end though? The relationships formed had no meaning outside of the 2 mains characters getting along. This felt like a slow boat floating across the horizon, wishing things would speed it up. There was an obvious point that needed to be reached and it took ages. The story gave you no chance to \"think of outcomes\" because it was so focused on one situation. Obviously its the plot of the series, but it was very predictable. I could call out the next scene without effort. Episode 6 and later are where I consider things heating up; we can call that the climax. If that was the climax in my eyes then the show truly didn't grab my full attention.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nLike a lot of shows that I've seen lately, this one had fabulous art work. The animation was eye candy. I really like that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nThe sound was fine. It only got to me when lyrics were involved and toward the end. Not much else to say really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nThis was tough to think about. How many cookie cutter personalities are in these shows? I like remembering one set of characters and easily distinguishing them from another set. The kids in this series were just half baked it seems. Male has a ghost, 2 females follow him, and the rest of the school is nonexistent. Everyone has \"feelings\" and all you can do is watch that boat float the horizon. They needed more background and story, plain and simple. Things felt disconnected over and over as the plot grew. There was no real connection left with whoever was involved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nThis was fine. I had issues with the snail paced story and lack of detail with characters but life goes on. The art work was wonderful and the story does leave a good taste with your soul. It has emotion and you should feel something either way. For that reason, I did think it was fair if not good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIn the end, try it if you think its up your ally. That is the same as I did and I got these results that I'm not sure about. The anime was very magnified on one relationship and no room to expand it. That makes the show slow and predictable at times. If your fresh to the romance genre, you'll probably have a better time with this. I've watched my fair share and so my judgement may be different from what you experience.",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, or Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. A tale about a maiden who lost the memories of her past and keep wandering in her school in order to retrieve them.\r\nThe story focuses on a young boy, Niiya Teiichi, and his adventures with the ghost of the maiden, and the Paranormal Investigation Club, which main objective is to retrieve her lost fragments of memories from her past. In this club we have Okonogi Momoe, a complete airhead, but always enthusiastic and ready to act.\r\nThen we have Kanoe Kirie, who seems to look at the growing relationship between Niiya Teiichi and the ghost with acertain suspicion and a taint of jealousy. \\n\r\nAnd last the two main protagonists. Kanoe Yuuko, the ghost of the maiden, who seem to love doing pranks and starting ghost rumors, and Niiya Teiichi, a normal boy at the exception that he is the only one with Kirie who can see the ghost.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a strange setting for a romance, but this part is well made and a relationship with a ghost is rare enough to keep it interesting. This anime is tagged as horror, so indeed there are a few dark parts in it, especially at the end, but far from enough to be a real horror anime. Still, the psychological aspect is present and isn't boring, though it holds no suspense.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant, being the opening or the ending, that I really loved, or the drawings (char designs, scenery, animations, everything is successful).\\n\\n\r\nBut then what falls apart, at least for me, was the characters personality. Yuuko is the exception though, she does have a consistent and attractive behavior (well, if we can say that for a ghost), which may seem weird when she is supposed to be the only \"not normal\" character. \\n\r\nLet's start with Momoe. Stereotypical girl, the naive but always strong girl, ready to support the MC in his toughest hardships. It reminded me of Chitanda in Hyouka, but with even less personality.\\n\r\nThen we have the  \"I will always support you no matter what it takes, even if it isn't what I truly wish deep in my heart\" girl, Kirie. She really fits the support role, as she has to support this relationship between the protagonists without a word to say or so. It kind of hurt me to see her being tormented as the story goes on, but I guess seeing someone suffer in the backstage isn't something I like.\\n\r\nLastly, the MC, not much to say, except that for someone admired by the few  people he frequents, he isn't smart at all. At taking decisions, he is definitely not the best, and I sort of regretted Houtarou (Hyouka again), who at least had the decence of thinking logically (most of the time). It might be a crucial point in this romance to be what it is, so I won't criticize much , but his personality added to the two girls' was really irritating to see sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nComes the two-three last episodes ... and then when I thought it wasn't a good anime at all, it deeply moved me, the anime pictured their emotions really well. And I remember that indeed, a romance with a ghost is not common, and can lead to an interesting development. Unfortunately all the previous episodes weren't of that quality, and contained a lot of fan service (I can go with it, but not when the plot is going nowhere and the characters development is boring).So after these ups and downs, I can say that I enjoyed this anime (I really appreciate it when the art is great, and in this case, it was), but I was sadly disappointed by these characters, that I found too slowpoke (the same reproach can be made for many animes, such as some in Baka to Test for example), definitely not my taste. But if you are fine with it/can overcome it, it is a nice romance show.",

It's pacing was simple and at a constant speed, slowly introducing plot that would come together at a certain point. Stick to it and it'll bring the surprise and satisfaction. \r\nI will admit, the anime plot is slightly different from the manga's. I was surprised at this. However, I was indulged in the art style and the component of its coloring scheme. Eventually, the plot ended up working out in a way I still respected. \r\nCharacter development was simple in my opinion; you can find many of these characters elsewhere in other various anime.However, development in these characters were still displayed beautifully. With it's compelling, dark theme, this anime was quite refreshing and comedic. It was cute in some ways, even humorous at times.\\n\\n\r\n The ost of this anime is gripping. It was a cool opening and various special endings that correlate with the plot. A specific vocal track in the anime can tug at your emotions, and some tracks can make your hair stand on end. \\n\\n\r\nIn the short length of this anime, you eventually do get the chance to bond and understand the characters, enabling some sort of emotional connection at specific points.\\n\\n\r\nMy main concerns were that this slightly reminded me of a harem at times, and there was a pacing issue at a particular episode which may have been rushed. In your already anime packed filled weekend, it wouldn't hurt to squeeze this in for fun.",

            "content": "I thought this anime was fantastic. I came for the horror, but ended up staying for the story that intertwined genres incredibly well. \r\nDisclaimer: You might not like this if you're strictly a horror buff. The tag(s) says horror but I don't think this anime services horror as much as it services romance and supernatural/mystery.\r\nStory - 8 \r\n8 is extraordinary in my book, probably the best I'd give in this type of genre (10 being rarities like Steins Gate). The story in this series is so good because at it's core, the romance has a very human theme of finding self-respect, and subsequently self-worth throughthe help of another's eyes. Yet, the anime intertwines this with it's supernatural elements so seamlessly. Not only does the delivery make for a great romance, but it makes the series a serviceable mystery and supernatural anime as well. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, I probably don't pay as much attention to art as others, but there were some nuances that I think makes this anime deserving of this score. The main one is the development of the main antagonist as \"it\" begins to transform. I also like how the anime depicted people who are under the influence of fear and I even liked how non-important characters were blacked out. The background elements kind of reminded me of a PG version of Devilman Crybaby. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nNothing too crazy here. The intro / outro was okay, nothing special. That said, whenever there's a scene in an anime that I know I'll remember due to the music (in addition to the scene obviously), it automatically deserves a good rating in my book. Without any spoilers, there's a scene towards / at the end of this anime that has incredible harmonization between what's happening and the music. Really amplifies the emotion and makes for a truly memorable moment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis would honestly be higher if it wasn't for the MC. Don't get me wrong I didn't mind the MC, I was indifferent about him (Didn't like or dislike him); however, he was indecisive more than once which definitely rubbed me the wrong way. Once is okay, but for him to show that again, albeit just for a little, was annoying. Other than that I thought all of the interactions between the MC and the supporting characters had actual substance that steered the anime towards it's ending. I especially enjoyed Yuuko's character. I thought she was annoying at first, but there was a reason for this and her development along those lines was extraordinary. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nBarring the in-depth synopsis, I thought this was very enjoyable. I'm not huge into romance (I came for the horror as mentioned earlier), but if it's done right I can binge this stuff. This was done right in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many others that try, I think this anime was able to use it's supernatural and mystery elements to bolster the romance in a way that's tough to do. Not only that, but it has a nice, clean-cut ending (always worthy of praise). To top it off, this series was enjoyable; it got better and better each episode as the story progressed. Great anime. Highly recommend.",

            "content": "Given that it is Halloween, I decided it fitting to rewatch this story about a ghost. This is the first time I've rewatched it, and with it now being over six years old I am happy to say that it still holds up well.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIt's about a girl ghost in a school. She's forgotten why she died, and thus, a boy in the school helps try to uncover the mystery of her death by opening a \"Paranormal Investigation Club.\" If you include the ghost, there are four members of the club. Two of them can see her, the other cannot. They are also the onlytwo in the entire school who can see her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is quite interesting. It's part supernatural, mystery, and romance, with some light comedy and horror elements sprinkled in. These various genres are juggled neatly, never to the detriment of the story or to each other. There are a few cliche character conversations which move the story forward. Yet for the most part, the themes are unique and the story has a powerful message to say about regret, love, and living with your faults as a person.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan service may feel excessive and even overbearing at times. Often it's not a problem, given Yuuko's capricious personality they are usually entertaining. Still, there are multiple \"accidental boob grabs.\" Although the situation is slightly different from what you might be used to- the girl, Yuuko, enjoys being touched. She is an incredibly lonely ghost who has been trapped at the school for 50 years after all. No one can see or hear her, so it's natural (and a unique aspect) for her to desire human interaction and touch. Still, the forced boob grabs felt a bit cringey at least once. One time, sure. But did it really need to happen three or four times?\\n\\n\r\nThe ending also could have been handled better. It leads up with a rather ominous feeling, but the last two minutes leaves with a \"Huh? Okay I guess...\" feeling. I wouldn't call it bad, though. There was also a single episode in the middle of the series which was a letdown. Thankfully, the rest of the short story arcs in the series proceeded smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis category has left some with mixed opinions. I'm in the \"loved it\" camp. The art style is unique, and rarely does it ever falter into average territory. It is quite pleasing, often aiding in what theme the particular scene in question is trying to highlight. The OP and Ending are also fluidly animated, and are one of the best OP/ED duos out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is great. I can't particularly fault it much there. The Opening and Ending songs are also great, pairing well with the fluid animation mentioned earlier. It loses some points for having a rather average dub. Even the subtitled version is nothing to write home about unfortunately. The male protagonist is a tad high pitched, and you can tell Yuuko's actress was lacking experience at the time (though she isn't bad).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this small cast of characters is solid. There are four main characters.\\n\\n\r\nTeiichi is the male protagonist. He's pretty standard as far as protagonists go, and definitely could have been better. Always tries to do the right thing, doesn't have inherent moral flaws, etc etc. There is an interesting aspect revolving around his own fears and regret, and that does tie into some of the overall themes of the show nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOkonogi is the primary comic relief. She can't see Yuuko, and thus isn't particularly involved in any of the more serious themes. As far as comic relief goes, she's decent.\\n\\n\r\nKirie is the other character besides Teiichi who can see Yuuko. As such, she is often involved alongside him in trying to find out about the mystery surrounding Yuuko's death and the school. She is harboring her own insecurities about herself, which is primarily resolved before the midway point of the series. She's a good character in her own right, and plays a role right up until the end.\\n\\n\r\nYuuko is the lead female, and a ghost who has no memory of her past. She is the true star of the series. Devilishly flirty and coquettish, her capricious nature never ceases to make her entertaining. At the same time, she is the central part of the story revolving around her fear, regret, and loneliness as she tries to accept who she really is. And, she is a beautiful woman. Absolutely, one of my favorite female characters of all time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia is an underrated gem. It's strong themes and great OST and animation are quite pleasing. Add in one of the best female lead characters out there and you're in for an enjoyable experience, even with some flaws here and there. \"Diamond in the rough\" comes to mind.\\n\\n\r\nHappy Halloween everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Fantastic, entertaining female lead\\n\r\n+Great OST\\n\r\n+Unique art style and animation\\n\r\n+Superb Opening and Ending\\n\r\n+Some strong themes\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Average dub\\n\r\n-Fan service occasionally feels excessive\\n\r\n-Conclusion could have been devised better\\n\r\n-A few cliches\\n",

            "content": "In every Japanese high school, there are clubs, ran by diligent students who wish to share their passions with others.  While there are of course some unique clubs out there, just about every school has at least one club dedicated to the paranormal, be they ghost hunters, researchers, or plain old horror buffs.  But there\u2019s one school, cobbled together from both new and old buildings alike, where their Paranormal Research Club is quite unique compared to the others.  Not only is it situated in the farthest reaches of the oldest section of the building, but it\u2019s leader is nowhere to be found.Try as you might ,you\u2019ll probably never see her...  That is, unless you catch her moving items out of the corner of your eye, or if you should happen to stumble on her remains.  You see, this club\u2019s mysterious Ghost President is, in fact, a ghost, and her club was formed on the idea of figuring out the truth about her past...  Her young life, as well as her untimely death.  Should you join this club, don\u2019t be scared.  She\u2019s nice.  At least, she\u2019ll try not to hurt you.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s a funny story for you...  I went into this series blind, knowing no information outside of what I could remember about it from a previous viewing back before it had a dub, and for the longest time, I was convinced that it was a Shaft title, most likely directed by Akiyuki Shino, as it had his style all over it.  There are quite a few anime out there that have an eclectic feel to their visuals, with a bizarre sort of cinematography that makes each shot transition feel random and disjointed enough to leave a jarring feeling behind, and while not all of them are by Shinbou, I generally feel the creepier ones tend to come from him, and this series had it\u2019s creep flag raised high and proud, but where most of Shinbo\u2019s work feels creepy in a skeevy, perverted sort of way...  Even when it\u2019s presented with some degree of subtlety, like it was in Madoka Magika...  This one was creepy in a way that felt more appropriate to the horror genre.  I thought, hey, I guess this means it\u2019s one of his better projects, where he used his weird penchants to achieve a greater effect, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, no, but I wasn\u2019t too far off.  This anime was actually produced by Silver Links, and it was directed by it\u2019s most prolific and prominent employee, Shin Onuma.  Want to guess where Onuma worked before he jumped ship to the newly founded Silver Link?  That\u2019s right, he previously worked at Shaft, and worked very closely with Shinbou.  There\u2019s so much overlap between them before 2009 that I actually found conflicting information, each of which gave one or the other credit for directing the second Negima series.  I looked through Onuma\u2019s filmography, and I was pretty impressed by what I saw there...  Out of the titles that I\u2019d seen, a lot of them were in fact titles that used a Shinbou sort of visual style, but with a smarter and more thoughtful approach.  That\u2019s not to say he shies away from the male gaze, or never accentuates the assets of his female characters, but he at least feels like he has the ability to turn such proclivities off whenever they\u2019re not called for, which is a quality I don\u2019t think Shinbou had very often.\\n\\n\r\nSince Dusk Maiden is a horror title, at least partially, Onuma does crank up the weirdness of his visual style to establish mood and create an unsettling atmosphere, or even to symbolically express the relationships between characters, and while it can get annoying once or twice, that\u2019s more a reflection on the content itself rather than the way it\u2019s being presented(more on this later).  It doesn\u2019t always work, but it at least consistently feels creative and ambitious, which I sadly can\u2019t say for the character designs.  The characters are drawn extremely to type, surpassing generic and moving all the way into cliche territory, even if it works in some cases, like in the design of the title character Yuuko, who looks like the archetypal Japanese beauty, with pale skin and long black hair, and a school uniform that Blood C had just made fun of a few years prior.  It works in her case, as you\u2019d expect a ghost to feel old-fashioned, but her love interest looks like every bland harem lead ever, the tsundere looks like your typical short hair, breast-envy tsundere, and don\u2019t get me started on the genki girl.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve done quite a few reviews where my access to a soundtrack has been limited or outright non-existent *Cough*Yurionice*cough* but with Dusk Maiden, I don\u2019t have the problem at all, because the official DVD set comes with two soundtrack CDs in the case.  There are now 45 tracks haunting my Itunes, but unfortunately, there isn\u2019t much I can say about the soundtrack as a whole, because it\u2019s kind of all over the place.  That\u2019s not to say any of it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s about as varied and unrestrained as the show\u2019s visual style, so there really aren\u2019t any common features to discuss.  It\u2019s a bunch of different kinds of tunes, and they all sound good.  Composers Kiego Hoashi and Ryuichi Takada clearly had a large order to fill, and I have to imagine that they exhausted themselves doing it.  I guess three of the biggest trends across the collection would be that most of them either go for a traditional Japanese sound, a tense feeling of dread and urgency, or the kind of perky and upbeat melodies that you\u2019d usually hear during casual scenes in any slice of life anime, but of a higher quality and less repetitive nature than your typical dating game background track.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few stand-outs, such as the theme for the mysterious villain Shadow Yuuko, which is both terrifying and full of very subtle foreshadowing.  Despair is an aptly titled tune that sounds like a violin playing heavily along to a somber music box, and it\u2019s also one of the few tunes I actually remembered from it\u2019s use in the series before checking out the soundtrack CDs.  This is also the case for Altar, one of the songs I noted as objectively terrifying during my viewing, as it can only be described as the theme to an upcoming blood ritual, with it\u2019s mixture of ominous ceremonial noises and childish accompanying choir.  I didn\u2019t really care much for the opening, at least on a visual scale, as it looks just as eclectic and offbeat as the show itself, but without nearly as much inspiration or direction, so it just feels like a bunch of random clips set to music.  I do think the song, Choir Jail by Konomi Suzuki, is very nice, as it\u2019s intense and emotional, and is able to lyrically capture some of the darker elements of Yuuko\u2019s situation.  I actually liked the ending theme better, as it was a much prettier song, with beautiful visuals that are actually allowed to linger, and you get to see Yuuko herself singing it, which is a nice tough.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters was really small, being that they didn\u2019t even introduce a fifth speaking role until episode 5, so Sentai Filmworks didn\u2019t have a very tough job to do when it came time to cast the dub.  I\u2019m pretty sure they knew what they were doing, though, because they put four of their best talents in the main roles, with a small group of other well known names floating in from time to time as either small guest roles or nameless extras.  They gave the title role to Emily Neves, one of the most in-demand voice actors in the industry, and in my opinion, the best new actor to debut in the 2010\u2019s.  She has a very wide range, as well as a chameleonic quality that easily puts her in a prime spot for numerous different roles, and it\u2019d be an understatement to say that Yuuko was a complex enough character to give Neves a lot to work with.  She\u2019s able to put her talents on full display with this character, to the point that she could honestly just submit this series as her demo reel if she ever needed one.\\n\\n\r\nClint Bickham hasn\u2019t done a whole lot of acting in his career, with his only consistently active years being in 2013 and 2014, but he\u2019s shown in other titles that he can play boring or generic harem leads while still sounding genuine and expressing believable emotion, which he does a fine job of here.  Brittney Karbowski was of course the perfect choice to play Momoe, the energetic, carefree and somewhat dimwitted comedy relief character, as she was basically able to cut loose and overact like a psycho in all of her melodramatic, loud, upbeat genki girl glory.  As for Jessica Boone in the role of Kirie...  Well...  I have nothing but respect for her, but my enjoyment of her performance in this series bears a direct correlation to my fondness for her character, and to put it nicely, I wasn\u2019t fond of her very often.  She does play another character briefly, but I can\u2019t really say who for spoilery reasons, but I like her better there.  It\u2019s a great dub that I\u2019d highly recommend, even if it\u2019s just for Emily Neves fans.\\n\\n\r\nSigh...  Here we go again.  It\u2019s another damned school club anime.  Ever since it was established that this particular sub-genre of Slice of Life was  marketable, and that they could make a successful and popular one through little to no creativity or effort, they\u2019ve been popping up everywhere, as excuses for story-tellers to cram a color-coded collection of waifus, or just a small harem, into one room so they could spend a season or two putting them through random stories.  Dusk Maiden isn\u2019t the first anime of it\u2019s ilk to base it\u2019s school club around an edgy sort of theme, hell, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s the first one to use a paranormal theme, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t take the formula and do something bold and new with it.  I don\u2019t  believe there\u2019s any sort of idea or subject matter that\u2019s doomed to failure from the start, and a good team can spin gold out of any sort of material you can imagine, so what exactly does this series bring to the table?\\n\\n\r\nWell, actually, it has quite a few things going for it.  I don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever said this about any other anime before, but I absolutely love the setting here.  Dusk Maiden takes place in a Japanese High School that\u2019s cobbled together in a make-shift fashion with old, historic buildings, as well as new construction, to make something of a Frankenstein school.  I\u2019m the type of guy who likes to explore whenever he enters new buildings, I always get into the video game frame of mind and start looking for loot or whatever the real life equivalent of easter eggs would be, and one of my favorite things for a school life anime to do is to set a few episodes in the old, abandoned school house.  Well, in Dusk Maiden, the old, abandoned schoolhouse is part of the school itself, and it sets an atmosphere that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in the Winchester mansion, a place I\u2019ve always wanted to visit.  The school is maze-like, it\u2019s full of secrets, and the way it\u2019s shot is so dark and creepy that I get excited at the possibility of what might happen in there.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not even it\u2019s best feature.  Yuuka, herself, is by far one of the best characters I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime, at least from a writing standpoint.  There\u2019s a lot I can\u2019t say about her, for fear of giving away some pretty heavy spoilers, and the whole show is basically a character study on her(even though I don\u2019t think it was trying to be), that almost every element of the story and plot are in some way connected to her.  For the sake of comparison, she\u2019s fleshed out and interconnected even more thoroughly than Haruhi Suzumiya was, and that\u2019s quite a feat.  She\u2019s introduced to us as a bored, happy go lucky ghost girl, living her life lack-a-daisically in her clubroom, which was formed for the sake of recovering all of her lost memories, and there are far more layers in that sentence alone than you could possibly guess.  There\u2019s only one thing about her I wasn\u2019t really fond of, and that unfortunately leads me to the show\u2019s greatest failing.  While there\u2019s a lot to like about Dusk Maiden, it is ultimately a slave to it\u2019s genre.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the first four episodes get off to a great start.  The pilot is written in an extremely clever way, setting up pretty much everything it has to, and introducing every single character at their best.  The following three episodes are backstory as to how Yuuka and Teiichi met, as well as how Momoe and Kirie entered into the picture, and the dynamics between them.  These episodes didn\u2019t feature anyone outside of the main four, so it was able to spend a lot of time on them, building up their relationship as a club and as friends, and dropping a ton of really smart clues about Yuuko\u2019s past and the identity of the mysterious enemy stalking them from the shadows.  Of course, the good times can\u2019t last forever, because this is a harem anime, and it just had to move into love triangle territory eventually.  Granted, the culture fest story ar does introduce a pretty relatable villain, but she doesn\u2019t stick around, leaving our little harem to it\u2019s own devices.\\n\\n\r\nBeing that this is a harem, we get all of the worst harem cliches.  The main male character is a boring, unremarkable wet sock, but all three of his co-stars are in love with him, and somehow, the one with no explanation gets off the easiest.  Yuuko\u2019s love for him basically boils down to the fact that he\u2019s the first person in the school to see and openly acknowledge her, which is kind of a low bar when you think about it, although it does make sense when you take the decades she\u2019s spent alone into account.  There\u2019s another reason that\u2019s eventually revealed, but it\u2019s kind of pointless, outside of the fact that it IS a reveal.  Momoe is in love with him because, as she puts it, he\u2019s really capable and knows how to take action, which kind of floats between vague bullshit and a complete misunderstanding, as she probably got that impression from all of the ghostly mysteries that Yuuko allowed him to solve.  \\n\\n\r\nKirie doesn\u2019t even have an explanation, as she just starts getting jealous of his relationship with Yuuko in episode 5, and from there, she spends the rest of the series either acting like a love-struck tsundere or dumping exposition and explaining things that most viewers would have been able to figure out on their own.  This is in spite of the fact that she was a much more interesting character up until that point, and her relationship to her ancestor Yuuko had far more promise to it.  Momoe at least stays consistent throughout this process, as she never stops being the comic relief dumbass of the group, but her love for Teiichi is so uninspired that at one point she actually proclaims, out loud, her joy over being useful to him.  As you might expect, all of this is peppered with the usual harem fare, like barbie-doll nudity, a swimsuit episode, and girls cooking for Teiichi with a heavy emphasis on the importance of feeding him with their chopsticks(Say ahh!  Christ, I\u2019ll never understand the romantic appeal of feeding someone like they\u2019re a fucking baby), but there is kind of a silver lining at the end of it all.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the will-they-won\u2019t-they hurdles are cleared, the actual romance between Yuuko and Teiichi is a really lovely one, and it\u2019s not hard to get invested in it.  Granted, there\u2019s very little substance to  the romance, and some of the more obvious issues with a human loving a ghost are largely avoided, and a poignant, beautiful ending is immediately ret-conned by the post credits sequence, and the two rejected romance options never let go of their obsession after he\u2019s officially off the table, but it\u2019s still very effective for what it is.  The harem elements absolutely cripple Dusk Maiden\u2019s potential, and the romance may be weaker than it seems on the surface, but thankfully, these elements are never placed front and center, and Yuuko\u2019s story is still strong enough to make the series worth watching.  If you squint hard enough, you could even see some messages hidden in the text, like that most people only see what they want to believe, you can\u2019t be a complete person if you cast aside negative emotions, and labyrinthian school buildings are fucking awesome.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia is available from Sentai Filmworks.  The original manga is not available stateside, but the DVD does come with two OVA episodes...  One that\u2019s pure comedy and pg-13 nudity, and one that\u2019s an extended version of the final episode, but I have no idea what\u2019s supposed to be extended about it.  The CD soundtrack, as I mentioned, is also included.\\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of this review came out more negatively than I wanted it to, but that\u2019s because all of this anime\u2019s best qualities are either subjective on my part or mired in deep spoilers, which made it\u2019s worst qualities so much easier to talk about.  I did, however, have a mostly positive experience with it, as behind all of the groan-worthy harem nonsense, there\u2019s an engaging story surrounding a really complex and interesting character.  The comedy is also largely effective, although it never quite reaches the precedent set by the pilot episode.  There are parts of it that remind me of Robert Westall\u2019s The Promise and the animated movie Paranorman, which can never be a bad thing, and it\u2019s strongly constructed mystery is far more memorable than it\u2019s cringe-worthy harem elements.  I wish the ending  had stuck to it;s guns rather than resorting to a cheap cop-out, especially since it never got a sequel to justify it, but I still really enjoyed the story up until that point, for the most part.  I give Dusk Maiden of Amnesia a 7/10.",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome Kiss X Sis. That better be a thing I swear. Do you like ghost stories? (I'm not talking about the ACTUAL anime known as Ghost Stories, of course lol omfral). Here's a better question. Wanna see a living human and a ghost f**k each other? Sadly you won't find that either, but what you will find is a pretty good Scooby doo remake in which shaggy kisses Scooby?!? \r\nFollowing the wonderful toxa we have our wonderfuller characters. To start off, we have our main character, niiya I think, idk so let's refer to him as blonde hair bitch. Blonde hair bitch is SOBLATENTLY AvERAGE, but he's pretty likeable as a character so I'll give him that. Alongside him are his two lesbian friends, banana girl and emo flat, who run the Joshua and Margaret Investigations club in which they sit around and try to live up to their ancient ancestors from the 60's, the Scooby Gang. One fateful day, blonde hair bitch falls on and meets an ancient ghost, yuuk- NO SAN. Seriously, I have heard the term \"Yuuko-san\" said SO MANY DAMN TIMES IN THIS ANIME, AND I WAS WATCHING IT SUBBED. Good god, I don't even wanna take Japanese next year if its that annoying in the English language. So let's refer to her as big boob bitch. Pretty fitting names. But what the hell is going on here? Well, its basically the daily misadventures of blonde hair bitch and his gay pride parade around his haunted school (for half the series at least), until an actual plot begins about halfway. PREPARE YOUR TISSUES, THEN BURN THE BECAUSE of how stupid the ending is. Better not spoil dis milk, so let's move forward.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Drink is a pretty good animation studio, but THIS is quite possibly the ABSOLUTE WORST ANIMATION EVER SEEN FROM THEM. I mean, seriously, the color palettes, the amount of detail and effort put into each frame, it's so STUPID. Hell, the animation in Souten no Ken: Regenesis is a UFOTABLE FILM BUDGET compared to this monstrosity. Are you guys seriously trying to put style into these character desings? Shame on you guys!!\\n\\n\r\nAll I remember when it comes down to music are the opening, ending, and the song \"Requiem\" from the last episode. The rest of the music was good I guess, idk, it was probably so good that it made me sad, so I threw it onto another version of myself who carries all of my hatred and sadness. The opening is so bad that it made its way into my top 5 anime OP's ever list. However, I must deduct a point because YUUKO-SAN! YUUKO-SAN! WHERE ART THOU YUUKO-SAN?!\\n\\n\r\nThat's really about all I can and want to say without spoiling anything, but right now I'm too tired so I'll probably update this review later. 7.8/10, needs more water.\\n",

What surprises me is the low rating this anime receives because this anime executes almost every single component of what makes a excellent anime pretty freaking well. Character development is prominent across the whole series and the story line is far from being cliche. The only complaint I have is the male MC's wimpy nature but I argue that the female MC's personality completely covers that up. Yuuko(name of femaleMC) has by far the most interesting personality I have ever witnessed in all of the anime I have ever watched, and you will experience the same if you give this a try. From naughty to nice, she is like the carry on a feeding team. She just makes this anime so breathtaking that I'm lost for words to describe anything more. I know I'm fangirling but you guys should definitely give this anime a go because it's legit so fun to watch.",

            "content": "Overall Impressions: Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is a good show all around.  It's entertaining, usually funny, and sometimes very dramatic when it wants to be, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.\r\nPersonally, I would liken this show to the Mark Z. Danielewski novel \"House of Leaves\".  Like House of Leaves (or at least its most internal story, the Navidson Record).  Part of this is the genre -- Both are stories that contain elements of horror but, ultimately, are more romances.  A larger part, however, is the novel use of the medium that both works indulge in.  As House of Leaves isknown for its avant-garde typesetting, so to does Dusk Maiden of Amnesia use shots and frame scenes in ways that are unconventional, but more literal, symbolic, or evocative to transport the viewer into its setting.  This is seen as early as the first episode, which puts a couple of characters into a cramped elevator and then follows them as they descend a few floors.  A more conventional show would still use 'normal' shots for this, filling the frame with a clear image of the space the characters occupy.  A slightly less conventional approach from that would be to treat the camera as a physical object that must be placed within the sealed bounds of the space with the characters, and thus rely on extreme closeups to communicate the sense of cramped tightness.  When Dusk Maiden tackles this scene, they instead place the characters in a small, cramped space that gradually moves across the frame's vertical length before resetting to the other end, communicating not only the cramped atmosphere, but also the motion of the scene external to the depiction of the characters while, unlike just about anything else, utilizing negative space within the frame.\\n\\n\r\nTricks, or perhaps techniques, like that are all throughout Dusk Maiden, and they almost all work incredibly well.  When two characters are separated in a philosophical sense, even if they inhabit the same physical space and could be shown in the same literal shot, we'll instead be treated (especially in the show's more dramatic moments) to an image of the two characters in two separate sub-frames, not allowed to be joined up to one another in the way the audience is privileged to see the world.  Images linger, stretch, grow, shrink, or are confined or released in such a way as to make the viewer experience, in a very visceral way, what the characters are going through; when a character is feeling sorrowful and isolated, every cut back to them might be shown in a smaller and smaller box in the center of the screen, the black space at the edge of the screen you wouldn't otherwise notice closing in around them.  It says more with less melodramatic manipulation than any shot of a sad or crying face full frame would have done.  Further, the show will shift art styles or utilize even less literal imagery in order to convey the mood of certain scenes, once again transporting the viewer into something far different than a world of dutch angles and harsh shadows that most horror works would deliver.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go so far as to say more shows should attempt this -- what's good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and Dusk Maiden's entire style of storytelling and art is probably not going to be effective, rather than distracting and annoying, if you apply it to a story that isn't trading heavily in the themes of sense and memory the way Dusk Maiden is.  Even aside from all that, when the animation and framing are at their most conventional and the show is just showing you literal happenings?  It's still a gorgeous show, drenched in sunset colors with just the right sorts of shadows all around to make a scene feel welcoming, bright, eerie, or threatening as needs be.  All in all, I can't fault the art in the least.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while I did liken the Romance-Horror combo package here to House of Leaves, I would say the tones of the work are fundamentally different.  I could go on about the art and drama of Dusk Maiden and make it sound, like House of Leaves, like an eerie, unsettling piece of work, it really isn't.  It's got horror and it's got romance, but where House has its unreliable narrator and uncomfortable satire of academic criticism, Dusk Maiden instead has comedy and character.  While the show gets darker as its running time goes on, it never quite drops the energetic, goofy moments.  It usually doesn't harm the drama it's going for, but the fact that it reaches for that comedy, and achieves it so often, gives it an entirely different layering and feel to that book, enough to, other than the former comparison of artistic techniques, lay the comparison to rest.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is very limited: you essentially have the two leads: Niiya Teiichi, our mild-mannered and exceptionally kind male lead (pretty par for the course); and Yuuko-san, the flirtatious and positive \"Dusk Maiden\", resident ghost and main love interest.  Beyond them, there are only two real recurring satellite characters: Momoe Okonogi, the high-strung and relentlessly positive girl who believes very strongly in ghost stories but can't see Yuuko or even notice most of her actions; and Kirie Kanoe, Yuuko's grand-niece, who can see her but also sees a horrifying shadowy monster and, while outwardly tough, has a lot of insecurities.  As you might expect, both of the living girls fall at least a little for Teiichi as well, but unlike a lot of shows that would avoid the foregone conclusion that the most developed and interesting member of the cast is going to be the romantic lead, Teiichi at least isn't wishy-washy or insecure about who he's most interested in.  They're all serviceable characters with at least a few notes that are explored, and at the very least I've got to say I very much like Kirie and enjoy when Okonogi is on screen\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story... I'm of a few minds about it.  It doesn't really kick in until a good way through the show, but on the other hand the early episodes (with the possible exception of episode 1) are well-used and do introduce elements that are necessary for when the plot kicks into high gear while building character for our four leads, which it's critical to have going into the \"full\" plot.  It is very much focused on romance, which usually makes it difficult to tell any other story alongside, but I personally think the show was successful in having at least a character-driven mystery with some very good depth, given that the subject of the mystery is one of the romantic leads, which strengthens it a good deal.  When the plot does get going, it's powerful, and I was not expecting it to be nearly this emotionally effective after the core silliness of the earlier parts of the show.  A good thing, overall.  The ghost story aspect, when it finally gets revealed, is well-done.  Not everything makes perfect sense, but every element was basically presaged and the presentation is spot on.  If I had one criticism, it's the ending.  Without spoiling anything, I liken it to a visual media favorite of mine, Labyrinth... it would be stronger if you cut a minute or two before the piece actually ends.  That said, I don't think the ending of Dusk Maiden bothers me as much as Labyrinth's inexplicable dance party, both because it's far more germane to the story being told, and because it actually gives the audience something of value back.  Dusk Maiden may throw away a powerful, poignant finale, but in return it receives a satisfying, comfortable one.  I guess which you would have preferred depends on what part of the show you engaged with most strongly -- ending early would better serve the avant-garde ghost story, but the full ending is the proper one for the fun paranormal romance, and thus despite me not being totally satisfied probably the better call for what the work actually is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is the epitome of everything wrong with Anime that ends before the Manga. The story is wonderfully crafted for the 1st 5 or 6 episodes and turns into a mess of Story inconsistencies. The amount of times I looked to do anything else besides watch the latter half of this show grew with each episode.\r\n     The Art is so well done. The Reddish almost Autumn color tint that the show did at the beginning was so tasteful I truly wish they did it throughout the whole show. When the show tried showing the Madness of Side charactersit truly creeped me out. But as with the Story it just doesn't hold up. I don't know if they needed to rush it out or because they ran out of material from the manga. It's just a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\n     The opening song is fantastic though there wasn't anything special with the art in at as it seemed to just take a bunch of scenes from different episodes and cut them into it. I had the unfortunate opportunity of only watching this in English so besides Yuuko's and Kirie's voices they are the only ones that really stood out, but don't get me wrong Okonogi, and Niiya's are reprehensibly bad. But I'm not going to lower my score just because i didn't watch the show in Japanese so i will give it the shows average score of 8. \\n\\n\r\n     The worst part of this show is it's characters by far. Yuuko despite her best efforts can not save this cast. Okonogi's is fighting to be one of the most annoying characters in anime history. Niiya's development as a character is just not there. If anything it's worse then it was when the show actually started. Not to mention Kirie is just kind there, with no real development added to her character either. I have never seen a character get as much screen time as her and not have her time to shine. \\n\\n\r\n     What truly hurt the show was it's ending. I'm not going to go into any detail about it but I'll just say that if it wasn't for the ending i would of gave it a 7 Overall.\\n",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia or Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is what I thought was going to be a story about how a ghost and a person falls in love and some how the ghost magically comes back to life and they live happily ever after! I was kinda right??? Oh well let's get into the review.. SPOILERS AHEAD PROBABLY \r\nStory 9/10: I really enjoyed the story line to this anime, the backstory they put into it was good aswell.. They didn't overdo it and pile it all into a point where you'd get bored and want to skip over it. They made it an equalpart where you won't get bored and would actually want to know what happened 60 years ago! Even though it would of been alot better if they had added in a bunch of actual ghosts instead of these stories then it would of made it 10 times better! No one doesn't love a good horror story to get your blood pumping... It wasn't your typical rom com, slice of life anime that you'd normally get! Instead it was changed up and it was a really good watch! One thing I wish I could of changed but this is my opinion and I was thinking long term with this.. At the end where it shows that she doesn't actually disappear and she comes back for whatever reason.. They would of made her come back to life and appeared in the basement of the club house alive and well! Even though it would of not made any sense but what would of happened if they extended it? Was their love really going to last? No.. What happens when they leave school? It's not like they can exactly stay in school their entire life.. But I think I'm thinking too much about this.. (Lmao)\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I really enjoyed the art on the series! The darkness to the entire thing made it really enjoyable to watch.. You could really tell at some parts where the colors would shine it why they would be there.. It's mostly always dark colored and it made it amazing to watch all together. I don't normally go for dark colored type anime so this was a nice refreshing change.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Could of been some different songs thrown in with some of the scenes but I still enjoyed most of the music and sound that came with the anime. It set the scene well at most times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: I enjoyed these characters alot better than other types of animes! There wasn't constant awkward moments whenever a romantic moment happened, there was a good balance of it. Each character seemed to work their way into the story line really well and that twist making Teiichi be the grandson of that girl that Yuuko saved was a good twist aswell.. I definitely did not see that coming! Really surprised me! It would of been good to see the grandmother and Yuuko to meet up and see how that played up in the season 2nd if it ever came! But beggars can't be choosers!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Would of been a 10/10 but something made me feel bored at some points and made me want to stop watching it.. After powering through I really did enjoy it and would highly recommend it!",

Making each scene a piece of art in and of itself.\r\nThe music is just, wonderful.

Nothing will happen that wasn't set up well in advance, or that is inconsistent with the other rules of this world.\r\nThis show is not perfect, saying that there aren't flaws would be foolish. Clumsy  boob-grabs happenseveral times through the show, as well as some other similar things. While this detracts from my personal enjoyment, as the reactions from both sides are predictable, this does tie in to what I was talking about earlier, about setups. The show loses some things from the manga, which I read almost immediately following the show. The dub is also one of the worst abominations to grace my screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, however, this show breezes its way to the top for me. The messages that the plotline brings are wonderful, the emotions incredibly well done, and one hell of a romance plot. This is the only show I have shown family members, and damn it bring emotion.",

Anyway, I didn't wait that this could be better than Another, from the Winter Season.\r\nAt the last chapter, my opinion is that Tasogare Otome x Amnesia is good anime that could be so much better.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIn the first part of the anime, the story isn't so serius: It is made of short stories with lots (lots) of fanservice. I was a little bit disapointed, but at the middle of the series the story turns more dramatic and it's more centred on Yuuko'spast and \"the Dark Yuuko\". This second part is so much good than the first. The best chapter of this anime is, without a doubt, is the chapter of Yuuko's story.\\n\r\nBut, if you are waiting for a horror anime with bloody parts, this is not the first anime I'ld recomend you. This is the worst thig of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia: there aren't any scary scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful. It has a good animation, the characters are good drawn and the enviroment is very nice, with beautiful colours and light effects. In some parts, it's a little bit \"artistic\" too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OST is good for ambientation, but the best of the sound are the opening and the anding. Both are very good themes, nice to listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nIn general, the characters are simple and stereotyped. Yuuko is the best character, she's the more \"special\" one, but the rest are mediocre: Teichi is the typical school boy and Okonogi a genki girl. Kirie was a normal tsundere in the best part of the series, but next she becomes more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is good. The story never catchs you a lot, but it's always interesting and funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIf you want to kill your time, Tasogare Otome x Amnesia isn't a bad option.

            "content": "A bittersweet supernatural-mystery-romance with some horror and psychological depth, likeable characters, and innovative animation.\r\nStory\r\nThe mystery played out well over the whole series, with a generally satisying conclusion, and there was a good combination of horror, humour, and romance. Plus we're left with the potential for a second series, which I would definitely watch.\r\nAnimation\r\nGreat animation, I like that they played around with different styles and effects to really add to the otherworldly atmosphere.\r\nCharacters\r\nOkonogi & Kirie were both interesting and likeable side characters. Teiichi was kind of bland, but he had his moments. For me Yuuko was definitely the stand-out character, which has a lot to dowith Hara Yumi's superb voice acting. Yuuko is really the focal point of the series in terms of plot, and thankfully she is also a complex and interesting character who can be hard to pin down, displaying a range of emotions. (Also, if there is a second season - more Yuuko fanservice please? XD)\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give the series a 7/10. I really enjoyed watching it, although I probably wouldn't re-watch as a lot of the appeal comes from he gradual revelations about Yuuko's past. However, Yuuko is definitely a character that will stick with me for a while ^.~",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\nThe story is hard to review without spoilers, but in terms of execution, the story, although fairly clich\u00e9d, is well-written and interesting. Although I felt it sort of dragged in the first half of the show with all the random 'let's run around and drop hints to the main mystery of the show then cover it up with comedy', the second half was very good and intriguing and drops a lot of the awkward humour and fan-service that was in the first half. The ending was predictable and I would've written it differently, however it wasn't bad and managed to give an emotional andsad ending while still giving us a happy end. There were some plot holes with the explanations, but nothing that took away from the story or wasn't too hard to overlook. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe color pallet used in the show was very fitting, relying heavily on darker tones and vibrant, warm colors. The box effect they did was somewhat overused and didn't seem incredibly well thought through, but they used colors and perspective well enough that it wasn't too bothersome. Excluding a few fantastic pieces, the sound was mostly forgetful. At the same time, they used what they had well, and the emotional scenes had very good songs that enhanced the mood quite well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere was nothing in particular that I disliked about the characters, but there was nothing much that I really liked, either. One of the biggest draws of the show for me was the chemistry between Yuuko and Teiichi, but individually nothing really stood out. The only thing I can say about them is that they were both nice. The side characters felt more like the standard tsudere and ditz friends that almost every other anime has, but at least the show never forgot about them and made them somewhat important in the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was well executed, but nothing was done that I hadn't seen in other anime. The only impactful scene was one of the scenes of an exchange between Yuuko and Teiichi in the last episode, but the scene was undermined by the ultimate ending of the show. The first half was interesting, but it dragged and seemed to rely purely on the mystery surrounding Yuuko and the comedy for it's entertainment. The second half was much better, but was still nothing incredibly different or special. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10",

            "content": "It has been quite a while since I have written a review but I find that I can\u2019t stay my hand from flying across the keyboard to pay respect to this show. In my humble opinion, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is one of the few recent examples of anime as an art form. While the series is inundated with what some consider common tropes of the anime industry; its execution weaves the usually meaningless amalgam of fan service high-school drama and supernatural phenomena into a storyline worthy of a top ten list. These factors combined with fact that the show explores a rather unique premiseand does so in a visually stunning manner creates what could be dubbed a modern masterpiece. Unfortunately Dusk Maiden of Amnesia has one fatal flaw that keeps it from attaining true masterpiece status. Like many of the better anime out there it is cursed with a short run lasting a total of twelve aired episodes with a thirteenth being included on the final blu-ray disc.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline:\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia fallows the exploits of a seemingly normal high school student named Teichi Niiya whose life is turned upside down upon a chance meeting with the legendary subject of Sanyo Academy\u2019s ghost stories Yuko. Referred to as Yuuko-san throughout the series this mischievous, bawdy and free spirited phantom becomes both the center of conflict as well as Niya\u2019s love interest. Oblivious to her dark and mysterious past and largely unable to interact with the living Yuko relies on Niiya and his newly formed Paranormal Investigation Club to delve into the enigma that is Yuko\u2019s former life. Alongside the cheerful and highly excitable  Momoe Okonogi and Yuuko\u2019s bitter yet emotive descendant Kirie Kanoe, Niiya sets to work unraveling the mysteries  surrounding Yuko\u2019s death.   However,  Niiya soon discovers that the stories related to Yuko uncover a warped version of her past that includes everything from from a pandemic to human sacrifice\\n\\n\r\nInitially Dusk Maiden of Amnesia begins in a traditional boy meets girl fashion and quickly spirals into dark and bone-chilling tale of the paranormal wherein Yuuko is divided into two separate and opposing entities.  The normal Yuko serves as the representation of her pure and unspoiled self whereas the dark twisted and almost demonic form of \u201cShadow Yuuko\u201d  is a literal embodiment of her counterpart\u2019s negative memories and emotions. This aspects creates an intriguing duality between Yuko and her darker self which is reminiscent of Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd protagonist Tokumi Nishijou given the fact that she seems to have the supernatural  equivalent of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)  wherein the the untainted persona imprints her negativity onto the other leaving the true form with a deliberate case of amnesia.. This transference and subsequent removal of  the negative  aspect of her consciousness the character of Yuko in many ways mirrors the division and partitioning experienced by those who have severe Multiple  Personality Disorder..\\n\\n\r\nIronically, Yuuko\u2019s psychological complex acts as catalyst for the romance that occurs between herself and Niya for the remainder of the series. When Yuko excises her feelings for him  Niiya is forced to declare his love for her in order to restore her recent memories.  In doing so, Niiya allows Yuko to recover some of the emotions she had previously cast off.  Eventually, through Niiya\u2019s acceptance of  her counterpart Yuko is able to merge with her darker self thus allowing her to recall her past and move on.  The romance between Yuuko and Niiya  is a well-developed one considering the length of the series. Even so, it was criminally short lived and left me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is one of the most soul-tearing, depression inducing climaxes ever to grace anime. In fact those who watch the final aired episode should be advised to have comfort food and a means by which to dry your tears on hand because you will ball like a toddle for the majority of the second half . It is almost a tragedy to watch these lovers as they share their final moments together culminating in one final kiss as Yuuko fades from existence.  Fortunately, the final seconds of the show are light-hearted and act as a contrast to the tone of the previous scene.  Oddly enough, Yuuko returns to Niiya causing the series to end on a happier note.\\n\\n\r\nStyle:\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia is surprisingly well done.  The animation is crisp and characters as well as backdrops and set pieces are extremely detailed.  However, in an anime filled with emotional extremes I find  that some of its more subtle scenes; this is  especially true with the opening and closing theme sequences wherein Yuko\u2019s lip flaps are synced with the vocal tracks so that she appears to be singing them. In-keeping with the theme of subtlety I find that anime like this are often dark and rely heavily shadows to create ambiance while Dusk Maiden of Amnesia  uses bright colors and intricate lighting effects to create beautiful backdrop that is a feast for the eyes. This is most apparent in twilight and night scenes when the viewer is treated majestic sunsets and an almost ethereal night sky.  These subtle details gives Dusk Maiden of Amnesia  a near magical feel like no other anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nSound Design:\\n\\n\r\nSound design is one area in which Dusk Maiden of Amnesia seems to lack slightly.  Aside from the opening theme\u201dChoir Jail\u201d very few tracks from the soundtrack are memorable much less noteworthy. This fact is made horrendously clear when viewing the Sentai Filmworks dub of the series.  While Emily Neves and Clint Brickham do a fair to descent job of voicing Yuuko and Niya others such as Jessica Boone and Brittney Karbowski are annoying to listen to.  This is why I would recommend  the subbed version.  Sorry Sentai, but you have only yourself to blame.\\n\\n\r\nDusk Maiden of Amnesia  is available for streaming on Crunchyroll.  I implore you fans please stream it legally. Doing so supports the anime industry. If you enjoy it buy it at Rightdtuf.   As a reviewer I think this is a series worthy of  anyone\u2019s collection. That being said, don\u2019t take my word for it.\\n",

            "content": "More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet\r\n-----------------------------\r\nTasogare Otome x Amnesia is one of the anime I followed weekly in 2012. However, following it weekly meant that each episode lost impact between te last and the next.\r\nRevisiting Tasogare after over a year made this all the more clear.\r\nStory\r\nIt's actually a pretty interesting story. While at first it seems like slice-of-life, with only a few hints at the real mystery - Yuuko's death - scattered here and there, midway through the show is when it starts to lay on the drama, mystery and horror. The last three episodes in particular are incredibly powerful- so much so that you could look back at the start of the show and wouldn't believe it's the same anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in Tasogare is pretty solid throughout its run. The style is reminiscent of Studio Shaft anime - mainly because of the director, Oonuma Shin. It's especially evident during the darker moments of the school festival arc, and the way the school's \"mysteries\" are initially relayed to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nColours are striking, especially when the anime moves into the late afternoon; the vibrant reds and oranges during these dusk moments are beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack often fits the situation - bright and happy during the more fun moments (i.e. the festival), yet darker and more depressing during the deeper moments (i.e. the second half of the anime). One track in particular, Requiem, did an incredible job of stirring the emotions during the final episodes; it fit so beautifully that I was nearly moved to tears. Nearly.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, Choir Jail, is up there as one of my favourite anime openings, fitting with the show's overall air of mystery. Likewise, the ending, Calendrier, is up there with my favourite ending themes, as its style is not something I hear often in anime, and is for me somewhat calming after the episode's events.\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors did well as their characters. Tsubasa Yonaga fit Teiichi rather well, I think, and Eri Kitamura as Kirie was a better fit than I thought - at least when her character wasn't overacting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, for the most part, all had a part in the series. Yuuko, the titular amnesiac maiden, was initially very energetic and fun to watch - until the series goes on, which pushes her development into overdrive. Teiichi gets flustered easily, but eventually stands up to protect what he loves.\\n\\n\r\nWe even have a pseudo-antagonist in Yuuko Kirishima, who appears during the Seikyou Festival. However, once that's over, the focus moves onto the darker side of things.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nTasogare Otome x Amnesia, for me, was a very enjoyable watch from start to almost finish. I say \"almost finish\" because... well, look it up online if you wish to be spoiled. The beautiful visuals and deepening mystery will keep drawing you in with each passing episode, and becomes incredibly enthralling towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying \"watch it immediately\", but this is one anime that was a joy to watch - bar the ending. At the very least, I would give this one a shot.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7.4\\n\r\nAnimation - 8.9\\n\r\nSound - 7.5\\n\r\nCharacters - 6.9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.0\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE - 7.54/10",

            "content": "Ghost. A fictional creature which some may believe it's real. In Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, the ghost is quite interesting in a sense that, she can both be the scariest thing in the world, or just a beautiful women who means no hard, depending on the heart of human. I believe that this fact is true, since in reality, people \"see\" ghost because they believe that they're true, and how they see things change depending on what they want. The way they explain the ghost is not really new, but still quite interesting. It's amazing how well this anime is, since unlike many others, thesetting is pure school. Even with such little background, the plot is quite a piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAlthough at first, I was quite confuse as to what is going on, since the first episode pretty much skipped some important events, but I guess it was the style they're using, since everything explained itself afterwards. It does have a good pace to it, but sometime, Tasogare feels like it moved way too abrupt and sometime a little hard to understand. This doesn't happen much, only a little bit in few of the episodes. Even though it is about ghost, it's not really scary, except in one episode later on, which pretty much gave me an exciting goosebumps. The story does make the anime good, and with such a good art, the story pulls people into it more. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThis style of art fits very nicely with the plot. The way they made the building, character design, background, lighting, etc., fits with this anime. Although I did say this, sometimes, it feels like the background is way too dark. Of course it's for the feel to make the scene scarier, but it seems too dark, and quite hard to see at some point, and with that, unnecessary darkness at times even when there's not really anything to that part. Not just the background that's not quite good, the motion and the position of the view is quite important, to get the viewer to lean in to the screen more, as in makes it seems more dramatic and all. At a point in the anime, the motion and the movement of the view changed pretty irritably. Changing the view abruptly too many times makes it annoying to look at, and it just doesn't fit well if people want to pay closer attention to look at what the situation looks like. The art could have done a better job, but the sounds of the people, and the nature really make it up.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nIt's a, somewhat, scary story, so there are going to be people screaming. The good thing about this anime is, the screams of the characters are not annoying at all. In fact, it fits well where it's suppose to, but the regular conversations are frustrating at times. The background music makes every scenery much, much better. Scarier, more dramatic, and even create a cute, happy background. It's great that the songs makes the plot more interesting, pulls in the viewers to the sad and scary parts. With that, the characters can have something to discuss about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nPeople are scared of ghost, if they believe in them. That's one part of why I hated scary movies. Every little things that happens can make characters goes berserk. This anime doesn't really do that. The way characters behaves are realistic, and more likely to the reality. The only problem is how quickly the characters hold himself in situations. Normal people usually don't accept situations that are new to them quite easily, but it seems like the male protagonist accepts things very quickly, too quickly. The characters are overall very good since they will not push viewers away by their behavior and what they do. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt's nice to get this type of ghost story every once in a while. The ideas are creative, and truly enjoyable. There were problem here and there, such as, the art at a couple of episodes, which is quite frustrating, but the plot, sounds, and characters are great. The best part is how they change the feelings of situations. In a moment it was a happy and nice scene, and the next was dramatic. Although not all the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime really light the day. It's not like it's the best or anything, it is pretty normal, but fun to watch. Besides the fact that there're supernatural beings, there's nothing that stands out too much about it. It does makes you feel very emotional later on in the anime, but only in one episode or two. I certainly hope people create more anime like this one, where it's relaxing to watch, and not much thinking is involve.",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome X Amnesia known in English as the Dusk Maiden of Amnesia is an incredible dramatic romance. Tasogare Otome X Amnesia focuses on a young man by the name of Teiichi Niiya who can see ghost and a young girl named Yuuko Kanoe. Yuuko is a ghost that has roamed the halls of Niiya's school's for decades and has no recollection of her death. Yuuko comes in contact with Niiya after he discovers her corpse by mistake and the two end up forming a close bond. Niiya along with Yuuko and Kirie Kane, the granddaughter of Yuuko's younger sister and an enthusiastic ghost hunternamed Momoe Okonogi form a club tasked with researching the ghostly mysteries of their school. Yuuko has made a name for herself as the school's number one specter, becoming the center of the school's seven mysteries. During the course of their investigations, there seems to be one clue after another that begins to fill in the pieces of Yuuko's broken memory.\\n\\n\r\nNiiya is a bit of a naive type of guy while Yuuko is more of a flirtatious and assertive type of person that isn't easily embarrassed. Tasogare Otome X Amnesia has a perfect transition from a comedic romance to a dramatic romance unlike some romance series that try desperately to transition from comedy to drama. The series begins as a comedy with Yuuko playing all kinds of pranks with her ghostly abilities while her fellow club members have to put up with it all. Yuuko's personality drastically changes after more of her memories begin to return to her and this is where the drama begins. Being a story focused on ghost, this anime wouldn't be complete without some horror and this series isn't actually scary but it can give you the creeps to a certain extent. The ending of Tasogare Otome X Amnesia may not match the dramatic tone of the series' second half but it definitely matches it's comedic moments from the first half. The most important part of this review is to note that Tasogare Otome X Amnesia is a very enjoyable show that you won't become bored of, always keeping you interested in what's going to happen next.\\n\\n",

This anime is a 13 part series that explores the paranormal mixed with romance and tragedy. \r\nThe story for me was highly enjoyable and engaging. Focusing heavily on the theme of the paranormal the lead character has the ability to see the resident school ghost. Together with two other support characters they from the school's paranormal investigation club lead by the \"ghost president\". They will try and unravel the mysteries of the school and uncover the past of Yuko. \r\nI found theseries had a good pace, I was hooked through the entire thing and I even shed a few tears at the end. If you like story driven anime and appreciate some romance in your anime then give this a shot. You might even think it's a 10!",

Up to episode 7 the story was basically quite pointless.\r\nThe art and sound were good.\r\nNow the characters. \r\nOnly Yuuko Kanoe had a backround story about her so she is obviously the most interesting one. Even though, Kirie Kanoe was pretty much my favourite since she helped out a lot and Momoe Okonogi was really funny and cute (she made the anime look like it belongs in the \"comedy\" genre). Lastly Teiichi Niiya even though he was the main character he didn't do much and he would probably have no idea whatto do to help Yuuko if he didn't get advice from Kirie every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i didn't like it as much as i thought i would since there wasn't much horror plus it had many \"accidental\" boob grabs in which case they were totally unnecessary since it's not in the ecchi genre, those \"comic\" (?) reliefs were such a turn off.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for a light ecchi+light comedy story, with a hint of horror at the end, this is the anime for you i guess.\\n",

It's really interesting to see how the story progresses.\r\nEnjoyment - 9\r\n- When I discovered this anime I didn't really expect much but after watching a few episodes, I got really interested in it and I really enjoyed watching it.\r\nCharacters - 10\r\n- The characters are well made and even though there are only a few of them, it doesn't really feel like there's anything missingbecause the whole story revolves around them.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Sound - 9\\n\r\n- The artwork is something else and the sounds/music used somewhat fit in with the situations/scenes where they are played.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\n- The key point, in my opinion, was that the end wasn't all that sad. This is one of my favorite anime, to say the least. I really enjoyed watching this anime and I hope you will enjoy it too :)\\n",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia has great art and sound direction. The first half was brilliantly written and consistent. TOxA always had this barely perceptible creepy and haunting feeling while a light story was playing. TOxA felt unique in this respect.\r\nUnfortunately the second half of TOxA lost this aspect. I have not yet read the manga for TOxA so this is not a preconceived bias. The second half was very hard to get through because one of my biggest pet peeves reared its ugly head. Characters suddenly acting out of character. The writing changed and became more...sentimental and oozing with flashbacks. Lastly, things became much morepredictable and less mysterious and ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this kind of change happens, I usually drop the anime but because the first half was so well done and because the second half wasn't completely unwatchable, I continued and finished it. Usually, when the second half goes sour, the ending is what truly kills an anime for me. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed with the ending, though I was sure I would be.\\n\\n\r\nIf the second half hadn't suddenly become much worse, I would have rated TOxA a 9.",

            "content": "Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, ok im being honest with this. I tought it was an another no worth watching anime. I avoided this anime VERY long because of these thoughts. Somehow i convinced myself to try it and i watched 1 episode.\r\nMy opinion was changed. It was really good and i watched 2 another episodes and so the whole anime.\r\nLet's say: it was not what i thought it whould be\r\nThe story  9/10\r\nThe story is very good and i enjoyed it, it was a little short.\r\nThe things i didn't like was that it was not \"dark\"enough. There are some parts that did not help todevelop the story and slowed it down.\\n\\n\r\nThe second part of the anime was what i expected, dark and mysterious. If they had done the first part better and left the not needed stuff behind they where able to creat a better( darker) story. And then this would be a masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nThe art 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a really good point of this show. The art is stunning. In some sceces it look like the sky is on fire. It is really good done and you get really into the mood of this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOk. The opening is good and the music get you in the mood, the soundeffects where great too. But the voices had coult done better\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis was well done too. But some characters where not needed and slowed the story down. i did not like this and it annoyed me.\\n\r\nThe characters who where important where really good. You see that the chararters develop and you'll see they relationships, personalities and thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\ni only can say that i really enjoyed that anime. altought there are some really annoying parts\\n\\n\\n\r\noverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much and i watched this show 2 times now. Altough i thougth this anime would have been much more mysterious and darker, it still is a good anime. I recomment it you. the  serie has only 13 episodes what is a little to short. and there are some parts what slow the story down and prevent it to turn into a darker anime. it is also not what you expect. it is beautifull and dark the same time. yuuki's past is terrifying and heartbreaking the same time. the atmosphere is the strongest part of this anime \\n\\n\r\nif you love romance,mystery, supernatural and/or horror you'll enjoy this show and i will really recoment it to you.\\n\\n\r\n- good points of the show\\n\\n\r\ngood story\\n\\n\r\nthe art is amazing \\n\\n\r\n- bad points\\n\\n\r\nthere happens a lot what slows the story down \\n\\n\r\nsome characters are not really needed",
