            "content": "Every Magi fan's favorite OP character Sinbad gets his own series. Being a big fan of Magi myself I was very excited about this.\r\nFair warning, if you haven't watched Magi, you really won't get the same satisfaction from watching this. I suggest watching the Magi series first before watching this.\r\nIt begins with Sinbad's birth. Showing the background story of how Sinbad ends up becoming the swashbuckling man he is in the Magi series. These episodes drew me in right away. If you're a fan of the Magi series you will really enjoy this part. I loved being able to see a baby Sinbad interact withhis family and grow into this heroic, lovable teenager. You get to see him conquer his first dungeon and decide that he wants to create his own country and change the world. It leaves you feeling satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nHowever after the first few episodes it becomes less about Sinbad's character and more about the characters that will end up joining him on his journey.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong I love the nostalgic feeling of seeing the characters from the Magi series pop up in this series. However, it cuts the character development of Sinbad short. It becomes more focused on the character development of his comrades and how each of them has come to make their decision to join him in his efforts to change the world. The most touching story was Ja'far's. His story and character development really provides those with prior knowledge about his character in the Magi series some interesting insight to when and how his unwavering loyalty began to blossom.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the development of Sinbad's character, it continues to stay the same after the beginning episodes for the most part. I understand maybe the creators wanted to keep the image of Sinbad as this all powerful character untarnished, but we didn't even get to see how he discovers the true power of his Djinn. \\n\\n\r\nAll we see after the first few episodes is how great Sinbad is and how wonderful he is at everything. I'm ready for his world to be shaken a little. To see him transform into the complex character that he is in the Magi series. Riding the waves between good and evil. Taking the path less travelled on. \\n\\n\r\nOnly in the very last episode do we see a small glimpse at an obsessive but mostly motivated look on the face of Sinbad as he contemplates his future. His curiosity about Magis grows intensely in this episode, and you can see in his face he is hungry for more knowledge. It foreshadows a possible adventure where he goes in search of a magi. This leaves a pretty good set up for the next season, which I expect to be a much more exciting season for Sinbad. I foresee some actual character changes and I'll remain hopeful for that.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the focus wasn't really on Sinbad so much as the people joining him on his journey I still enjoyed watching this. Seeing more of the unique world that Magi is set in, and getting to see the origin stories of Sinbad's party has been really great. It's an upbeat adventure and at times you'll find yourself smiling at the silly comedy. All that it is lacking is a bit of depth.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "And so ends, one of the most greatest anime of the season. This was  rather impressive and the anime does a rather good job at adapting the manga about probably the greatest character in Magi, who is known as Sinbad to a certain degree. In this review, I will try to leave it spoiler free.\r\nStory-9\r\nThe story is brilliant. Depicting the life of probably the strongest living character in Magi. This is a prequel series that shows us the life of Sinbad and his journey to change the world. Such as the struggles that he experiences and the people that he meets to get stronger.The pacing seems rather okay at times, sometimes it does feel a bit rushed, but apart from that I find it easy to get into the mood. I have found the story filled with adventure and comedic aspects that have honestly grabbed me, and have cracked me up.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art. Not much I can say about it. The characters are drawn rather well. Animation is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nHaving that amazing soundtrack present is what makes me engaged in Sinbad's story. Those opening and ending songs really grab you and make you want to join up with Sinbad as well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Actors-10\\n\r\nThey have managed to grab the same voice actors from the OVA and from the anime adaption, so I would deem this impressive. The characters in this anime feel like they are being voiced according to how they behave. They have such fitting voice actors for their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nLets just say that if you want to know more about the characters that Sinbad has worked with then go with the manga as well. You have Sinbad, Yunan, Ja'far, Dragul, Serendine, Badr (Sinbad's father), Esra (Sinbad's Mother), Barbarossa, Mystras, Spartos, Baal, Hinahoho, Pisti, Piprika, Zamil, Tabi etc. All these characters will be expanded on or introduced, the anime has gone through a few and helped set up the cast that Sinbad will be travelling with. Some of that cast has already been shown in the Magi Season 1 and 2 anime adaptions as well. So it would feel rather nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI am a major Magi fan. More Magi is never a bad thing. After waiting 2 or so years after the OVA(longer after Season 2), then you can realize how much of an amazing feel this is. This contains probably one of the most interesting characters throughout Magi. Finding out about his adventures and how he became the man that he is now is worth the adventure of watching this series. So, even though I didn't get a certain Fanalis or Magician I can say that I enjoyed the cast that we had and I found them rather hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this series. It does seem a bit funny at times, but just wait it will get so much better. Has always the manga is a preferred option, but this adaption is pretty good. The history of Sinbad, Sinbad's friends, family and so on. If you are here to witness who he was as a child, why he became who he is right now and what caused him to become great, then this is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nLet us all hope for that Season 2 everyone!",

            "content": "I have mixed feelings about the existence of the Anime.\r\nSo, as a fan of the Magie series, I am waiting for a third season of Magi... and when I ended the second season and the OVA of Sinbad with 5 episodes came out, I was like: Okay, it's cool, I want to know more about Sinbad and his comerades...\r\nBut the 5 episodes did not statisfied me a bit.\r\nSo now we have this! Why does it exist? The 5 episodes I have watched (OVA) are in this new Anime plus some other episodes (which are perfect, no doubt). \r\nBut why did they not countinued the OVAunder the titel of the OVA? Why did they not took out the 5 episodes, which we saw before, and made new content?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also must say, before my real review, I am afraid of the relase date of the third season of Magi, because the Sinbad series just had an open ending, which means that the fans want a Continuation ( I want it too! ). But what will happen to Magi?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI am the type of a person which loves historical events, like wars and political issues. In Magi or here in Sinbad also we have countries, wars, alliances and trades. I feel like I have found an Anime which shows me my whole interests in a bundle.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art is nothing new. Every other Anime is like that colorful and it remindes me of the Kyoto Animation Animes. So here I am a bit disappointed because it is nothing special.\\n\r\nWhat I disliked was the jumping between scenes. It was like they forget to show us a scene, when it comes to battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good though.\\n\r\nJust kid Sinbad was really big for a child, it didn't fit in the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI did not enjoy the opening, not the ending, there is no soundtrack which I can call for. \\n\r\nNothing special here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere was a bit too much kitsch in here. Sinbad which babbled too much about friendship. For example the Ja'far scene, where he cried a bit and Sinbad cames and rescued him. It could have been better. But it is okay. I am not complaining much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAlso Magi has many critical points, points which I did not like, but anyways I enjoyed it much, like this Anime. There was just one episode which was totaly needless (Artemyra Arc, when Sinbad got banned and was naked the whole episode).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAll in all: 6,4 but I give a 7.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Magi: Adventure of Sinbad has a lot less of the flavor that made the original Magi entertaining. That flavor mainly being the themes that were brought up about kingship, genocide and the morality of war and peace alongside a very interesting medieval and arab setting that was well explored. But most of that was left absent from this spin off or not touched upon to the degree in which the original series went to, which made it feel very underwhelming and more shounen-like and superficial. Now lets get on with it, and let me remind you that I watched the original two seasons of magitwo years ago so my memory isn't the best.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story begins with a boy being born, Sinbad of course, and when his conception took place the world's sky went crazy in a burst of magical energies because of how great he was and many characters from the original series looked on in awe and wondered \"wow a great power has entered the world\". This is where i immediately saw red flags for what the shows' story was going to become. The fact that the rukh (the magical energies of this world) reacted so heavily to his birth was because he was fated to be a great king. Which basically meant that because of luck or random chance he was fated to be great no matter what. It took away any chance he had of failing and removed a lot of his agency from his actions. Which means he is essentially doing everything he is doing because of destiny. Which makes the story seem less like an adventure and more like a checklist of things he has to do before he can become a king. While this could work from an existentialist perspective this show is very far removed from those ideas.\\n\\n\r\nSo back on track. Sinbad is born and many years later in his boyhood experiences the horrors of war which end up forcing his newfound friend and farther to lead each other to their deaths. This motivates him on a journey to create his own kingdom and bring peace to the world. So he is enlisted into a force to capture a dungeon (basically like a dungeon in an mmo and if you complete it you get the power of a god). In his exploits here he makes an interesting idealistic contrast of his want to bring peace to the world to that of the more selfish and fearfilled actions of the state. While it was somewhat interesting at first to see some kid give a finger to the man it got old after like, I dont know the second time he did it. And he does it a whole hell of a lot in this show. Basically the entire show is just comprised of him going to point A and B and pressing his very idealistic and unrealistic views on people and being so fucking OP because he is blessed by god that they just believe him after he shows his power. So things quickly get stale. It gets to a point where Sinbad and his crew are captured and stripped and then thrown into a giant pit which is also filled with deadly snakes, and as if acknowledging their own inability to fail then proceed to make gags about it for 10 minutes like the audience isn't even supposed to care. While it would be interesting to see the turn the story would take if he failed and he had to question how ridiculous his ideals for world piece are, it never happened, and a sequel may also never happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThis is definitely the shows greatest asset. The characters designs are vibrant, varied and interesting. The settings are also visually interesting with some great and consistent background art. The fights and general visual presentation is way above the standards set by the standard Toei or Pierrot shounen.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound just faded into the background for the most part for me and I never really got attracted to any of the pieces. I'm not sure if they were the same tracks used in Magi but I just wasnt feeling it. It wasnt bad enough to make a note of it but it also wasn't good. Then again that might also be influenced by the short run time and also my disinterest in the story. For several scenes they tried using electro music to make a moment more hype but was very off putting and clashed with the setting. It was also often overly bombastic like at the ends of character arcs where its expecting you to have a connection to a basic character you have only known for an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSinbad is boring. He is just goes through his same shtick of helping people and beating people who disagree with him over and over and never changes throughout the course of the series. Of course ignoring the first episode. He never really gets upset, doubts himself, doubts his friends, doubts his beliefs for long enough to make him feel human and in turn makes him very unrelatable. But what that does do is it makes him a good symbol for what a king is. Which is why the supporting cast follows him. An emotionally strong leader dead set in his ideals who backs down to know one and takes on the impossible. Which seeing how this show turns out makes me realize how he  was much better suited for his supporting role in the main series as a contrast to Alibaba. But he could still be an interesting character as long as the messages that he gives causes the supporting cast to change.\\n\r\nWhile this does happen the pay off is not there as most of the supporting cast is only given a few episodes at most to meet Sinbad, go \"wow he is so kakui\" and have a renewed belief in themselves. After that they are basically background decoration and don't do much for the story besides comic relief or running errands. Not to mention they are mostly one note and only act seriously when its required which can make it hard to get engaged with them especially with the little screen time they get. Especially characters like Ja'far who makes a complete 180 from a blood thirsty assassin into a cutie pie shota because magic and love. If only it was so easy.\\n\r\nBut there is still a glimmer of hope in the character Drakon, who was the leader of the troops sent into the dungeon with Sinbad. He was given his position because of his noble birth and ended up being a bit of a selfish snob because of it. So when he loses to sinbad and hears his ideals he rethinks and questions himself on why he cant win when he is trying his best and doing it for his country and his men and so he can come back alive to see the girl he loves. Only to discover that when he gets out of the dungeon he is shamed by his people for not being able to take the god of the dungeon for himself and he also discovers that the girl he loves has just entered a political marriage with his brother that doesnt care for her. This makes him a very interesting character in relation to Sinbad because he is going through a similar unfairness brought upon by war that Sinbad went through in his boyhood except he is in a position of power and therefore appreciates the benefits of a militaristic society and would be more apt to weigh the pros and cons. His character also changed a lot more slowly compared to the rest of the cast which felt more believable. But sadly the series ended and it went nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nMagi: Adventure of Sinbad is a good time passer just to see the magi aesthetic again but it never managed to become anything more than that. Even though the beginning had some interesting prospects they weren't realized because the show did not end.",

The action was well done for a fantasy anime, the adventure of the dungeons and different countries and the comedy of the crew that actually made me laugh out loud!\r\nThis anime definitely sets the ground works for more seasons which it truly deserves!!! There is so much more to exploreand to be honest I binged this whole anime in one day so I am sad there is no more :( but I really hope there will be another season, this anime is really under rated because it is a spin off series but to be honest you could watch this without having seen the other magi series.

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show more. As is the case with many people, I found Sinbad to be the most compelling character in the first two seasons of Magi. After watching this prequel, however, I'm wondering if the mystery and mystique surrounding Sinbad in the original Magi series is part of what makes him so compelling. Telling his backstory didn't seem to work as well as it should have. But it was still a fun show to watch.\r\nSTORY - 6/10:\r\nI felt like this was really where the show fell a little flat. What could have been an interesting story, outlining a long, hardjourney for Sinbad to become a king and form the Seven Seas Alliance turns out to be fairly rote and straightforward. After a couple interesting episodes involving his birth and parents and eventually capturing the first dungeon, the show basically devolves into small 2-3 episode arcs where he travels to some new country, gains an alliance with them really easily, and picks up a new crew member. It's almost like a grocery list - we know he has his little group of generals later on, so we're just going down the list, ticking them off one by one as he travels around. \\n\\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any real challenge. Most of these people are eager to leave with him, despite barely knowing him (I guess Jafar is a bit of an exception, at first). All the places he goes are supposed to be super xenophobic and hate outsiders, but a teenager is able to change their minds with little effort. He pretty much just has to show off his super powers and they all fawn over him and gush to join his peaceful alliance. Even something as simple as his djinn equip - in the original Magi, Alibaba's experience learning to use his djinn equip was emotional and difficult and helped shape him. He had to overcome something in order to gain that power. With Sinbad, he just figured it out offscreen and suddenly shows it off at the opportune moment. It's all too easy.\\n\\n\r\nI was really expecting Sinbad to have to overcome more difficulties in order to succeed. Everything just seems to come so easily. Hell, even when he's not sure what to do, a Magi shows up and just tells him!\\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is solid, and the animation is good. I don't know a whole lot about anime studios in Japan, but apparently this is done by a pretty new studio. They only have like 7 anime listed (as of this show's airing). All in all, I think this is a pretty good effort, style-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub. I thought the voice acting was good, the OST is solid and keeps the mood from the previous Magi seasons. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story section, I was a little disappointed with how easy things are for Sinbad. He literally pops out of the womb already OP - they actually have a scene where people around the world feel his presence through the rukh as he's born and say how he's going to change the world. I don't know where you go from there. The writer chose not to go very far at all. They just accept that Sinbad is a badass for life, and will power through any obstacle with ease. That tone might make for some cool moments or good wish fulfillment scenes, but it makes for boring character work. What we really want to see is Sinbad struggle a little. He shouldn't just innately be this person who is perfect in every way, wanting a peaceful world with no war, wanting to form his perfect country, understanding the ins and outs of trade, diplomacy, strategy, etc. I thought they were going to give us something good when Sinbad failed at trade upon first arriving in Rem. But no, the king of Balbad just hands him (literally) a win anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I give this a 7 instead of something lower is because they actually do some interesting things with the minor characters. Sinbad is the constant, never really changing, but how people around him react or are affected does influence the show and its direction. Jafar, in particular, has some emotional advancements. Hinahoho struggles through feelings of inadequacy. Drakon and Sinbad have a good vibe going, until Drakon just leaves. I liked the queen of the amazonian tribe, I wouldn't mind seeing more of her around. She seemed to understand the djinn and rukh and everything a lot more than Sinbad does. So a strong secondary cast of characters helps save what is otherwise just a show about Sinbad showing off.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nDespite the negatives listed above, I still enjoyed watching this show. I powered through it in a couple days. I think a lot of that enjoyment is nested in nostalgia, as I did really enjoy the Magi series before this instalment. Despite a lack of Aladdin, Alibaba, and Morgiana, this still definitely feels like a Magi show, and if you enjoyed the first two seasons, you'll probably enjoy this one too.\\n\\n",

The beginning has lots of feels, so be prepared. \r\nThe character style is great, they're very individualized, colourful and fit really well in the style of the anime.\r\nI loved Sinbad as soon as I met him.\r\nSinbad comes across his new comrades in unusual ways, but they make greatfriendships. \\n\r\nHe doesn't want any more people to suffer the way he has, he's resolved to change it all, to bring everyone happiness. It's just going to be a difficult road for him to get there but he's prepared for that.\\n\\n\r\nHe starts on his quest to capture dungeons and gain their powers and treasures. \\n\r\nThe story is really interesting, it's battles of Kings, gaining powers, traveling to different villages and laughs along the way. It has a very Aladdin-esque feel, which really helps the fantasy/magic genres.\\n\r\nIt's not always serious, there's a good mix of humor that really fits in. \\n\r\nI really enjoyed it, watching them all adventure together, become closer as friends and Sinbad working and getting closer to his goal. \\n\r\nJa'far, Hina and Mystras are great matches for Sinbad. They all compliment each other really well. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12 would probably be my favourite. ;)\\n\r\nI was hoping this would be good and it exceeded my expectations, I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to watch the rest of the series. \\n\r\nIf you like fun adventures, you'll love this.",

            "content": "Short description: It's Magi so it's always gonna be a good anime. But compared to the other seasons I have to say it's unsatisfying. This season should've told us a lot more about Sinbad's past and his crew members (or at least to have more consistent action scenes) and try less to make random jokes for an entire episode (episode 12 was barely watchable).\r\nI'll start of by saying that I really like the Magi series and I think that it's a unique anime with an outstanding plot, although I think it lacks pace, consistency and more and better battle scenes.\r\nThis season focuses on what Ipresume will be the main antagonist of the series (didn't watch the manga but it has been hinted pretty obvious). I think Sinbad shares a lot of similarities with Itachi from Naruto, but with different outcomes. Both we're born prodigies and both have a life dictated by faith. While we found out that Itachi was a good guy who sacrificed his life for a greater good, Sinbad seems a good guy with noble intentions who will \"probabily\" turn to the dark side.  I personally loved Itachi from the begining, but I hated Sinbad from the begining, since he seems like an arrogant prick.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough with comparisons, which many might not agree. Regarding this particular season, I was hoping to get to see how Sinbad conquered ALL the towers, which to my regret I didn't. I was hoping to see more consistent and more long lasting battle scenes, since he is the most OP character in the series. My favourite moment was when he scared off king Darius with his Bararaq Saiqa.\\n\\n\r\nScore: Why not heigher than 8? \\n\r\nI can't go any highger.It was more about trading, travelling and \"fun times\" and less about the actual plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not lower?\\n\r\nThis is a tough one, since I've complained this much. Maybe cause it's Magi, maybe cause I've been wanting to find out more about Sinbad, even though I didn't find as much as I hoped for. Treat my review as a 7.5 if u will.\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes: Maybe I'm being too harsh but that's because I really like this anime and I think the plot is there for an outstanding anime and I hope they will bring they A game with their following seasons.\\n",

            "content": "Personally I am a big fan of the the manga Magi so my opinion might be a little bias. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows Sinbad during his childhood, every event that takes place has a correlation to how Sinbad becomes who he is and what he achieved. The way that the story is told is based on the largest events that connected Sinbad to those who would help him created the Seven Seas Alliance \r\nArt:\r\nThe art-style is faithful to the manga and the animation is extremely smooth so it is definitely nice to watch. The only fault with the animation has to be what I like tocall the \"slide-show\" effect, where during certain scenes they will use a single frame to display an action such as a \"sword-clash\".\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is great, ti definitely builds excitement and comes on cue in all the right situations. The music style is a more modern music style rather than the orchestra that plays most of Magi's themes. That however isn't why I deducted a point, my reasoning is the limited amount of soundtracks in the anime, there is around 3-4 soundtracks that are repeated very often and while they are good, more variety would have created a different atmosphere during certain situations. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with both the Magi Sinbad adaption and the main series adaption was the amount of details that they skipped and the events that they changed. In this particular series they continue the trend by skipping character development chapters all for the sake of maintaining the action through a small 13 episode series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSeeing a younger version of Sinbad is definitely fun and intriguing especially since I am keeping up with the main manga. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the series and would definitely love to see a season 2. The way that they end the series leaves an opportunity for a season 2 and even gives a glimpse of events that would take place in the future.",

            "content": "Magi: SnB (or SoB because it has an alternate meaning) is an extension of the original Labyrinth/Kingdom of magic which, for reasons both because of and beyond me, I liked much more. That being said, this show also has some.... eh.... ego problems. To elaborate, Sinbad is OP, the show knows this, doesn't do anything about it and instead puts him on this massive f*cking pedestal screaming \"Look what we made, we're so good\"... Well Magi, there are a number of reasons for you being just plain wrong.\r\nHaving recently watched the first season of Magi (LoM), I wasn't sure what to expect from this prequelof sorts. On one hand, it could have been a load of pandering and displays of power, on the other, it could have been an onslaught of politics and sweet-talking.\\n\\n\r\nYou get both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nMagi has an overlaying issue where the hero is given this massive plateau of power and free access. He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and be as crude as he likes but never suffers the consequences. It goes without saying that no story is without its hero but no hero is without a burden. Likewise, every hero struggles, for that is what makes him a hero over a simple opportunist. Now, I could have just pulled those quotes out of my ass, or, I could be on to something. Regardless, Magi seems to struggle -ironically- to establish a protagonist who himself struggles and as a result, our hero is depicted as nothing more than an opportunist with a very big mouth.\\n\\n\r\nNarrowing down the previous paragraph, Sinbad is given somewhat of a silver spoon from birth. Being labelled the 'miracle child' who grew up in a poor village, he grows up to be both a powerhouse, wealthy business owner and a kings candidate. But you see, these are just titles, Sinbad, from episode 1, does not struggle. You could argue that his starting conditions could count as struggling but even at this stage, he has the power to take out groups of people and claim powers not even armies could claim. Why? because he's the miracle child? because he's the protagonist? because he was born that way? Who can tell, all I can say is that we are given the impression that Sinbad is leagues ahead of anyone else on the planet despite not having anything accept his determination... and I don't think that establishes a very balanced story.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, the story is much more engaging than that of the first season of Magi. While there is no 'struggle', we do get to see the plots of all of Sinbad's generals play out and in turn, watch them develop. The exploration and development of the world and its leaders is much more engaging and deserves credit. Likewise, the gradual progression of Sinbad's assets is a fun observation that we are regularly reminded of whenever a milestone in the story is reached and it gives us that sense of progress that we never really had in Magi: LoM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound-\\n\r\nMagi: SoB has a very standard art style yet does an amazing job of establishing atmosphere. This is critical when you establish your show on exploration and make your protagonists dream to be to 'have an understanding of the world' and SoB does this really well. Sound wise, we don't have all that much to say, we got the decent application and a few good mood setting jingles but overall, I wasn't too fond of it. That is subjective, though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nI realise that I unloaded a lot of 'character' stuff in the story section so, bar a few sentences about Sinbad, I will talk in a relatively broad manner.\\n\\n\r\nSinbad is a powerhouse, he has a childish personality that suits him way better in this show than it did in Magi: LoM. Likewise, you get to see a lot of Sinbad in action. Simply put, he is a bad ass, and the anime makes sure you know it. One thing I did find annoying was that there was quite a bit of conflict over whether Sinbad was a quirky, ignorant and bold character (as portrayed by his seductive side) or an intelligent and quick thinking bad ass (as portrayed by his warrior/politician side) and this kind of creates a two-faced character that doesn't acknowledge this fact.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other generals, their nature is very well cemented and their personalities are consistent throughout. One thing I will say about them is that despite their entertaining and unique nature, their development basically ends the moment they join up with Sinbad. No adaptation. No evolution. Well... maybe there is a tiny bit for the assassin kid but that's kind of the one apple in a barrel of oranges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nI must say, I actually really enjoyed this anime. Despite the fact that the conclusion was left wide open and there wasn't really all that much of an end of season pay-off, the journey was still fun and there was enough going on (as well as enough nods to LoM) to justify watching it, not to mention liking it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nI recommend that you watch this. It can be debated over whether or not you need to watch LoM to understand this season but despite a few unanswered questions and no telling where Sinbad ends up, there is plenty of material here to justify treating it as a prequel, maybe even an independent story, that you can watch right off the bat. I would really enjoy a follow up to this season, unfortunately, it tells a story that goes in hand with the 'real' story involving Alibaba... which is a shame because I honestly thought this story was much more interesting.",

            "content": "Magi: Sinbad no Bouken, or Magi: The Adventures of Sinbad is a pretty fun show, and I enjoyed the time I spent watching it.\r\nSinbad's rise to becoming the man we all know and love in The Labyrinth of Magic makes for a good story line, and it's fun to see the origin story of the eight generals as Sinbad meets them in his childhood. That being said, it's probably better to watch Magi: Labyrinth of Magic before you watch Adventures of Sinbad, as it's a prequel to that series. However, even if you watch this first, like I did, it's still a fun watch regardless.\r\nTheart and animation is good to look at, and the bright colours meant that visually, there was rarely a dull moment. The comedy was also pretty fun, and I loved how the main character Sinbad's personality carried over from Labyrinth to this show. Too often in prequels do characters seem like entirely different people to their future selves, but this is not the case in Adventures of Sinbad.\\n\\n\r\nOn the negative side of things, the story can be pretty slow at times, but this was more of a problem early on, as I feel it improved as the story continued. My other criticism is that sometimes in fight scenes, the enemies kinda waited around for the heroes to talk to each other, removing some of the flow from the battles, which were otherwise well animated and fun.\\n\r\nI hope this show gets a season 2 someday, as the season abruptly ended just as I was really getting into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Magi: Sinbad no Bouken and would give it an 8/10. It's quite light hearted and fun, so I wouldn't recommend it to people who only like their anime serious, but otherwise I think this is a show worth watching.",

I've watched 10/13 episodes which I think is enough to share my review. My review will contain pacing spoilers.\r\nCharacters: All characters are one dimensionally and/or tropey. There is no where near enough development to care much about any of them. \r\nArt: The art is enjoyable but the character designs can be bland.\r\nSound: Serviceable. \r\nStory: The story points are interesting. Because of the way the story is told it becomes unenjoyable and the characters become cardboard. The story needed 50 episodesinstead of 13. Watching this anime is like reading the summary of a story, you'll find out what happens to the characters but you won't care.",

Unlike other reviewers, I really don't think you need to watch the others first. This may have come later, but it is a prequel, and lays a good foundation, so you can watch it without ever watching the other ones.\r\n I really hope there is a second season. They certainly left room for a lot more content to come. Here's hoping!\r\n--Review Ends here--\r\nWriting longer reviews for the sake of writing long reviews is ridiculous. I have to keep writing in order to meet the minimumrequirements so here goes. Sinbad is great. A boy king wannabe with a bright future and very sincere eyes. He does crazy things with his djinn powers but we never see him practice so where does he find the time between being an actor  surviving in nature all naturale and seducing the ladles? Please tell me this is long enough!",

Plus, this is way better than the Animated Movie that Disney or whoever tried to do.\r\nThe art gets a 10 outstanding as always, with fluid motions and detailed looking characters.  Though the sound gets a 9 for not holding up as well as its counterparts.  It fits the mood, but none of the songs make me want to look it up on YouTube or anything.\r\nThe characters get a 6.  Sinbad is even more annoying and makes me lose respect for him.  Ireally don't like the characters that \"worry about people and want to help them, yet they ruin their lives and make it worse\".  At least Sinbad in the original anime, both seasons, knew he was a prick.  That feminist island bit also gave me a bad feeling in my mouth for the whole show, especially with that rant about the men seeming to enjoy it.  It makes a parallel to our world with the message, \"sure women [are oppressed], but it seems to work out for the system, so I don't see anything wrong.\"  Also, that bit were a man FINALLY conquers that terrible woman puts a bad taste in my mouth, bleh. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't all bad though, so the enjoyment gets an 8.  Some of the characters were funny, and previous background characters that didn't stick out to me as far as personality, were given more lines and background.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime gets an 8.  Some of the implications were terrible, but that was a one time incident with the female island.  Everything else was bearable, and even funny/a joy to watch.",

            "content": "Every Magi fan's favorite OP character Sinbad gets his own series. Being a big fan of Magi myself I was very excited about this.\r\nFair warning, if you haven't watched Magi, you really won't get the same satisfaction from watching this. I suggest watching the Magi series first before watching this.\r\nIt begins with Sinbad's birth. Showing the background story of how Sinbad ends up becoming the swashbuckling man he is in the Magi series. These episodes drew me in right away. If you're a fan of the Magi series you will really enjoy this part. I loved being able to see a baby Sinbad interact withhis family and grow into this heroic, lovable teenager. You get to see him conquer his first dungeon and decide that he wants to create his own country and change the world. It leaves you feeling satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nHowever after the first few episodes it becomes less about Sinbad's character and more about the characters that will end up joining him on his journey.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong I love the nostalgic feeling of seeing the characters from the Magi series pop up in this series. However, it cuts the character development of Sinbad short. It becomes more focused on the character development of his comrades and how each of them has come to make their decision to join him in his efforts to change the world. The most touching story was Ja'far's. His story and character development really provides those with prior knowledge about his character in the Magi series some interesting insight to when and how his unwavering loyalty began to blossom.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the development of Sinbad's character, it continues to stay the same after the beginning episodes for the most part. I understand maybe the creators wanted to keep the image of Sinbad as this all powerful character untarnished, but we didn't even get to see how he discovers the true power of his Djinn. \\n\\n\r\nAll we see after the first few episodes is how great Sinbad is and how wonderful he is at everything. I'm ready for his world to be shaken a little. To see him transform into the complex character that he is in the Magi series. Riding the waves between good and evil. Taking the path less travelled on. \\n\\n\r\nOnly in the very last episode do we see a small glimpse at an obsessive but mostly motivated look on the face of Sinbad as he contemplates his future. His curiosity about Magis grows intensely in this episode, and you can see in his face he is hungry for more knowledge. It foreshadows a possible adventure where he goes in search of a magi. This leaves a pretty good set up for the next season, which I expect to be a much more exciting season for Sinbad. I foresee some actual character changes and I'll remain hopeful for that.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the focus wasn't really on Sinbad so much as the people joining him on his journey I still enjoyed watching this. Seeing more of the unique world that Magi is set in, and getting to see the origin stories of Sinbad's party has been really great. It's an upbeat adventure and at times you'll find yourself smiling at the silly comedy. All that it is lacking is a bit of depth.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "And so ends, one of the most greatest anime of the season. This was  rather impressive and the anime does a rather good job at adapting the manga about probably the greatest character in Magi, who is known as Sinbad to a certain degree. In this review, I will try to leave it spoiler free.\r\nStory-9\r\nThe story is brilliant. Depicting the life of probably the strongest living character in Magi. This is a prequel series that shows us the life of Sinbad and his journey to change the world. Such as the struggles that he experiences and the people that he meets to get stronger.The pacing seems rather okay at times, sometimes it does feel a bit rushed, but apart from that I find it easy to get into the mood. I have found the story filled with adventure and comedic aspects that have honestly grabbed me, and have cracked me up.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art. Not much I can say about it. The characters are drawn rather well. Animation is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nHaving that amazing soundtrack present is what makes me engaged in Sinbad's story. Those opening and ending songs really grab you and make you want to join up with Sinbad as well.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Actors-10\\n\r\nThey have managed to grab the same voice actors from the OVA and from the anime adaption, so I would deem this impressive. The characters in this anime feel like they are being voiced according to how they behave. They have such fitting voice actors for their respective characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nLets just say that if you want to know more about the characters that Sinbad has worked with then go with the manga as well. You have Sinbad, Yunan, Ja'far, Dragul, Serendine, Badr (Sinbad's father), Esra (Sinbad's Mother), Barbarossa, Mystras, Spartos, Baal, Hinahoho, Pisti, Piprika, Zamil, Tabi etc. All these characters will be expanded on or introduced, the anime has gone through a few and helped set up the cast that Sinbad will be travelling with. Some of that cast has already been shown in the Magi Season 1 and 2 anime adaptions as well. So it would feel rather nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI am a major Magi fan. More Magi is never a bad thing. After waiting 2 or so years after the OVA(longer after Season 2), then you can realize how much of an amazing feel this is. This contains probably one of the most interesting characters throughout Magi. Finding out about his adventures and how he became the man that he is now is worth the adventure of watching this series. So, even though I didn't get a certain Fanalis or Magician I can say that I enjoyed the cast that we had and I found them rather hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this series. It does seem a bit funny at times, but just wait it will get so much better. Has always the manga is a preferred option, but this adaption is pretty good. The history of Sinbad, Sinbad's friends, family and so on. If you are here to witness who he was as a child, why he became who he is right now and what caused him to become great, then this is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nLet us all hope for that Season 2 everyone!",

            "content": "I have mixed feelings about the existence of the Anime.\r\nSo, as a fan of the Magie series, I am waiting for a third season of Magi... and when I ended the second season and the OVA of Sinbad with 5 episodes came out, I was like: Okay, it's cool, I want to know more about Sinbad and his comerades...\r\nBut the 5 episodes did not statisfied me a bit.\r\nSo now we have this! Why does it exist? The 5 episodes I have watched (OVA) are in this new Anime plus some other episodes (which are perfect, no doubt). \r\nBut why did they not countinued the OVAunder the titel of the OVA? Why did they not took out the 5 episodes, which we saw before, and made new content?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also must say, before my real review, I am afraid of the relase date of the third season of Magi, because the Sinbad series just had an open ending, which means that the fans want a Continuation ( I want it too! ). But what will happen to Magi?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI am the type of a person which loves historical events, like wars and political issues. In Magi or here in Sinbad also we have countries, wars, alliances and trades. I feel like I have found an Anime which shows me my whole interests in a bundle.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art is nothing new. Every other Anime is like that colorful and it remindes me of the Kyoto Animation Animes. So here I am a bit disappointed because it is nothing special.\\n\r\nWhat I disliked was the jumping between scenes. It was like they forget to show us a scene, when it comes to battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good though.\\n\r\nJust kid Sinbad was really big for a child, it didn't fit in the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI did not enjoy the opening, not the ending, there is no soundtrack which I can call for. \\n\r\nNothing special here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere was a bit too much kitsch in here. Sinbad which babbled too much about friendship. For example the Ja'far scene, where he cried a bit and Sinbad cames and rescued him. It could have been better. But it is okay. I am not complaining much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAlso Magi has many critical points, points which I did not like, but anyways I enjoyed it much, like this Anime. There was just one episode which was totaly needless (Artemyra Arc, when Sinbad got banned and was naked the whole episode).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAll in all: 6,4 but I give a 7.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Magi: Adventure of Sinbad has a lot less of the flavor that made the original Magi entertaining. That flavor mainly being the themes that were brought up about kingship, genocide and the morality of war and peace alongside a very interesting medieval and arab setting that was well explored. But most of that was left absent from this spin off or not touched upon to the degree in which the original series went to, which made it feel very underwhelming and more shounen-like and superficial. Now lets get on with it, and let me remind you that I watched the original two seasons of magitwo years ago so my memory isn't the best.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story begins with a boy being born, Sinbad of course, and when his conception took place the world's sky went crazy in a burst of magical energies because of how great he was and many characters from the original series looked on in awe and wondered \"wow a great power has entered the world\". This is where i immediately saw red flags for what the shows' story was going to become. The fact that the rukh (the magical energies of this world) reacted so heavily to his birth was because he was fated to be a great king. Which basically meant that because of luck or random chance he was fated to be great no matter what. It took away any chance he had of failing and removed a lot of his agency from his actions. Which means he is essentially doing everything he is doing because of destiny. Which makes the story seem less like an adventure and more like a checklist of things he has to do before he can become a king. While this could work from an existentialist perspective this show is very far removed from those ideas.\\n\\n\r\nSo back on track. Sinbad is born and many years later in his boyhood experiences the horrors of war which end up forcing his newfound friend and farther to lead each other to their deaths. This motivates him on a journey to create his own kingdom and bring peace to the world. So he is enlisted into a force to capture a dungeon (basically like a dungeon in an mmo and if you complete it you get the power of a god). In his exploits here he makes an interesting idealistic contrast of his want to bring peace to the world to that of the more selfish and fearfilled actions of the state. While it was somewhat interesting at first to see some kid give a finger to the man it got old after like, I dont know the second time he did it. And he does it a whole hell of a lot in this show. Basically the entire show is just comprised of him going to point A and B and pressing his very idealistic and unrealistic views on people and being so fucking OP because he is blessed by god that they just believe him after he shows his power. So things quickly get stale. It gets to a point where Sinbad and his crew are captured and stripped and then thrown into a giant pit which is also filled with deadly snakes, and as if acknowledging their own inability to fail then proceed to make gags about it for 10 minutes like the audience isn't even supposed to care. While it would be interesting to see the turn the story would take if he failed and he had to question how ridiculous his ideals for world piece are, it never happened, and a sequel may also never happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThis is definitely the shows greatest asset. The characters designs are vibrant, varied and interesting. The settings are also visually interesting with some great and consistent background art. The fights and general visual presentation is way above the standards set by the standard Toei or Pierrot shounen.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound just faded into the background for the most part for me and I never really got attracted to any of the pieces. I'm not sure if they were the same tracks used in Magi but I just wasnt feeling it. It wasnt bad enough to make a note of it but it also wasn't good. Then again that might also be influenced by the short run time and also my disinterest in the story. For several scenes they tried using electro music to make a moment more hype but was very off putting and clashed with the setting. It was also often overly bombastic like at the ends of character arcs where its expecting you to have a connection to a basic character you have only known for an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSinbad is boring. He is just goes through his same shtick of helping people and beating people who disagree with him over and over and never changes throughout the course of the series. Of course ignoring the first episode. He never really gets upset, doubts himself, doubts his friends, doubts his beliefs for long enough to make him feel human and in turn makes him very unrelatable. But what that does do is it makes him a good symbol for what a king is. Which is why the supporting cast follows him. An emotionally strong leader dead set in his ideals who backs down to know one and takes on the impossible. Which seeing how this show turns out makes me realize how he  was much better suited for his supporting role in the main series as a contrast to Alibaba. But he could still be an interesting character as long as the messages that he gives causes the supporting cast to change.\\n\r\nWhile this does happen the pay off is not there as most of the supporting cast is only given a few episodes at most to meet Sinbad, go \"wow he is so kakui\" and have a renewed belief in themselves. After that they are basically background decoration and don't do much for the story besides comic relief or running errands. Not to mention they are mostly one note and only act seriously when its required which can make it hard to get engaged with them especially with the little screen time they get. Especially characters like Ja'far who makes a complete 180 from a blood thirsty assassin into a cutie pie shota because magic and love. If only it was so easy.\\n\r\nBut there is still a glimmer of hope in the character Drakon, who was the leader of the troops sent into the dungeon with Sinbad. He was given his position because of his noble birth and ended up being a bit of a selfish snob because of it. So when he loses to sinbad and hears his ideals he rethinks and questions himself on why he cant win when he is trying his best and doing it for his country and his men and so he can come back alive to see the girl he loves. Only to discover that when he gets out of the dungeon he is shamed by his people for not being able to take the god of the dungeon for himself and he also discovers that the girl he loves has just entered a political marriage with his brother that doesnt care for her. This makes him a very interesting character in relation to Sinbad because he is going through a similar unfairness brought upon by war that Sinbad went through in his boyhood except he is in a position of power and therefore appreciates the benefits of a militaristic society and would be more apt to weigh the pros and cons. His character also changed a lot more slowly compared to the rest of the cast which felt more believable. But sadly the series ended and it went nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\r\nMagi: Adventure of Sinbad is a good time passer just to see the magi aesthetic again but it never managed to become anything more than that. Even though the beginning had some interesting prospects they weren't realized because the show did not end.",

The action was well done for a fantasy anime, the adventure of the dungeons and different countries and the comedy of the crew that actually made me laugh out loud!\r\nThis anime definitely sets the ground works for more seasons which it truly deserves!!! There is so much more to exploreand to be honest I binged this whole anime in one day so I am sad there is no more :( but I really hope there will be another season, this anime is really under rated because it is a spin off series but to be honest you could watch this without having seen the other magi series. I feel like this should've been a 24 episode anime so they could explore the characters more cause I really wanted to see more adventures!! \\n\\n\r\nLets all hope we get another season!!!!!",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show more. As is the case with many people, I found Sinbad to be the most compelling character in the first two seasons of Magi. After watching this prequel, however, I'm wondering if the mystery and mystique surrounding Sinbad in the original Magi series is part of what makes him so compelling. Telling his backstory didn't seem to work as well as it should have. But it was still a fun show to watch.\r\nSTORY - 6/10:\r\nI felt like this was really where the show fell a little flat. What could have been an interesting story, outlining a long, hardjourney for Sinbad to become a king and form the Seven Seas Alliance turns out to be fairly rote and straightforward. After a couple interesting episodes involving his birth and parents and eventually capturing the first dungeon, the show basically devolves into small 2-3 episode arcs where he travels to some new country, gains an alliance with them really easily, and picks up a new crew member. It's almost like a grocery list - we know he has his little group of generals later on, so we're just going down the list, ticking them off one by one as he travels around. \\n\\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any real challenge. Most of these people are eager to leave with him, despite barely knowing him (I guess Jafar is a bit of an exception, at first). All the places he goes are supposed to be super xenophobic and hate outsiders, but a teenager is able to change their minds with little effort. He pretty much just has to show off his super powers and they all fawn over him and gush to join his peaceful alliance. Even something as simple as his djinn equip - in the original Magi, Alibaba's experience learning to use his djinn equip was emotional and difficult and helped shape him. He had to overcome something in order to gain that power. With Sinbad, he just figured it out offscreen and suddenly shows it off at the opportune moment. It's all too easy.\\n\\n\r\nI was really expecting Sinbad to have to overcome more difficulties in order to succeed. Everything just seems to come so easily. Hell, even when he's not sure what to do, a Magi shows up and just tells him!\\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is solid, and the animation is good. I don't know a whole lot about anime studios in Japan, but apparently this is done by a pretty new studio. They only have like 7 anime listed (as of this show's airing). All in all, I think this is a pretty good effort, style-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub. I thought the voice acting was good, the OST is solid and keeps the mood from the previous Magi seasons. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nJust like the story section, I was a little disappointed with how easy things are for Sinbad. He literally pops out of the womb already OP - they actually have a scene where people around the world feel his presence through the rukh as he's born and say how he's going to change the world. I don't know where you go from there. The writer chose not to go very far at all. They just accept that Sinbad is a badass for life, and will power through any obstacle with ease. That tone might make for some cool moments or good wish fulfillment scenes, but it makes for boring character work. What we really want to see is Sinbad struggle a little. He shouldn't just innately be this person who is perfect in every way, wanting a peaceful world with no war, wanting to form his perfect country, understanding the ins and outs of trade, diplomacy, strategy, etc. I thought they were going to give us something good when Sinbad failed at trade upon first arriving in Rem. But no, the king of Balbad just hands him (literally) a win anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I give this a 7 instead of something lower is because they actually do some interesting things with the minor characters. Sinbad is the constant, never really changing, but how people around him react or are affected does influence the show and its direction. Jafar, in particular, has some emotional advancements. Hinahoho struggles through feelings of inadequacy. Drakon and Sinbad have a good vibe going, until Drakon just leaves. I liked the queen of the amazonian tribe, I wouldn't mind seeing more of her around. She seemed to understand the djinn and rukh and everything a lot more than Sinbad does. So a strong secondary cast of characters helps save what is otherwise just a show about Sinbad showing off.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nDespite the negatives listed above, I still enjoyed watching this show. I powered through it in a couple days. I think a lot of that enjoyment is nested in nostalgia, as I did really enjoy the Magi series before this instalment. Despite a lack of Aladdin, Alibaba, and Morgiana, this still definitely feels like a Magi show, and if you enjoyed the first two seasons, you'll probably enjoy this one too.\\n\\n",

The beginning has lots of feels, so be prepared. \r\nThe character style is great, they're very individualized, colourful and fit really well in the style of the anime.\r\nI loved Sinbad as soon as I met him.\r\nSinbad comes across his new comrades in unusual ways, but they make greatfriendships. \\n\r\nHe doesn't want any more people to suffer the way he has, he's resolved to change it all, to bring everyone happiness. It's just going to be a difficult road for him to get there but he's prepared for that.\\n\\n\r\nHe starts on his quest to capture dungeons and gain their powers and treasures. \\n\r\nThe story is really interesting, it's battles of Kings, gaining powers, traveling to different villages and laughs along the way. It has a very Aladdin-esque feel, which really helps the fantasy/magic genres.\\n\r\nIt's not always serious, there's a good mix of humor that really fits in. \\n\r\nI really enjoyed it, watching them all adventure together, become closer as friends and Sinbad working and getting closer to his goal. \\n\r\nJa'far, Hina and Mystras are great matches for Sinbad. They all compliment each other really well. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12 would probably be my favourite. ;)\\n\r\nI was hoping this would be good and it exceeded my expectations, I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to watch the rest of the series. \\n\r\nIf you like fun adventures, you'll love this.",

            "content": "Short description: It's Magi so it's always gonna be a good anime. But compared to the other seasons I have to say it's unsatisfying. This season should've told us a lot more about Sinbad's past and his crew members (or at least to have more consistent action scenes) and try less to make random jokes for an entire episode (episode 12 was barely watchable).\r\nI'll start of by saying that I really like the Magi series and I think that it's a unique anime with an outstanding plot, although I think it lacks pace, consistency and more and better battle scenes.\r\nThis season focuses on what Ipresume will be the main antagonist of the series (didn't watch the manga but it has been hinted pretty obvious). I think Sinbad shares a lot of similarities with Itachi from Naruto, but with different outcomes. Both we're born prodigies and both have a life dictated by faith. While we found out that Itachi was a good guy who sacrificed his life for a greater good, Sinbad seems a good guy with noble intentions who will \"probabily\" turn to the dark side.  I personally loved Itachi from the begining, but I hated Sinbad from the begining, since he seems like an arrogant prick.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough with comparisons, which many might not agree. Regarding this particular season, I was hoping to get to see how Sinbad conquered ALL the towers, which to my regret I didn't. I was hoping to see more consistent and more long lasting battle scenes, since he is the most OP character in the series. My favourite moment was when he scared off king Darius with his Bararaq Saiqa.\\n\\n\r\nScore: Why not heigher than 8? \\n\r\nI can't go any highger.It was more about trading, travelling and \"fun times\" and less about the actual plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not lower?\\n\r\nThis is a tough one, since I've complained this much. Maybe cause it's Magi, maybe cause I've been wanting to find out more about Sinbad, even though I didn't find as much as I hoped for. Treat my review as a 7.5 if u will.\\n\\n\r\nFinal notes: Maybe I'm being too harsh but that's because I really like this anime and I think the plot is there for an outstanding anime and I hope they will bring they A game with their following seasons.\\n",

            "content": "Personally I am a big fan of the the manga Magi so my opinion might be a little bias. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows Sinbad during his childhood, every event that takes place has a correlation to how Sinbad becomes who he is and what he achieved. The way that the story is told is based on the largest events that connected Sinbad to those who would help him created the Seven Seas Alliance \r\nArt:\r\nThe art-style is faithful to the manga and the animation is extremely smooth so it is definitely nice to watch. The only fault with the animation has to be what I like tocall the \"slide-show\" effect, where during certain scenes they will use a single frame to display an action such as a \"sword-clash\".\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is great, ti definitely builds excitement and comes on cue in all the right situations. The music style is a more modern music style rather than the orchestra that plays most of Magi's themes. That however isn't why I deducted a point, my reasoning is the limited amount of soundtracks in the anime, there is around 3-4 soundtracks that are repeated very often and while they are good, more variety would have created a different atmosphere during certain situations. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with both the Magi Sinbad adaption and the main series adaption was the amount of details that they skipped and the events that they changed. In this particular series they continue the trend by skipping character development chapters all for the sake of maintaining the action through a small 13 episode series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSeeing a younger version of Sinbad is definitely fun and intriguing especially since I am keeping up with the main manga. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the series and would definitely love to see a season 2. The way that they end the series leaves an opportunity for a season 2 and even gives a glimpse of events that would take place in the future.",

To elaborate, Sinbad is OP, the show knows this, doesn't do anything about it and instead puts him on this massive f*cking pedestal screaming \"Look what we made, we're so good\"... Well Magi, there are a number of reasons for you being just plain wrong.\r\nHaving recently watched the first season of Magi (LoM), I wasn't sure what to expect from this prequelof sorts. On one hand, it could have been a load of pandering and displays of power, on the other, it could have been an onslaught of politics and sweet-talking.\\n\\n\r\nYou get both.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nMagi has an overlaying issue where the hero is given this massive plateau of power and free access. He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and be as crude as he likes but never suffers the consequences. It goes without saying that no story is without its hero but no hero is without a burden. Likewise, every hero struggles, for that is what makes him a hero over a simple opportunist. Now, I could have just pulled those quotes out of my ass, or, I could be on to something. Regardless, Magi seems to struggle -ironically- to establish a protagonist who himself struggles and as a result, our hero is depicted as nothing more than an opportunist with a very big mouth.\\n\\n\r\nNarrowing down the previous paragraph, Sinbad is given somewhat of a silver spoon from birth. Being labelled the 'miracle child' who grew up in a poor village, he grows up to be both a powerhouse, wealthy business owner and a kings candidate. But you see, these are just titles, Sinbad, from episode 1, does not struggle. You could argue that his starting conditions could count as struggling but even at this stage, he has the power to take out groups of people and claim powers not even armies could claim. Why? because he's the miracle child? because he's the protagonist? because he was born that way? Who can tell, all I can say is that we are given the impression that Sinbad is leagues ahead of anyone else on the planet despite not having anything accept his determination... and I don't think that establishes a very balanced story.\\n\\n\r\nOn a positive note, the story is much more engaging than that of the first season of Magi. While there is no 'struggle', we do get to see the plots of all of Sinbad's generals play out and in turn, watch them develop. The exploration and development of the world and its leaders is much more engaging and deserves credit. Likewise, the gradual progression of Sinbad's assets is a fun observation that we are regularly reminded of whenever a milestone in the story is reached and it gives us that sense of progress that we never really had in Magi: LoM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound-\\n\r\nMagi: SoB has a very standard art style yet does an amazing job of establishing atmosphere. This is critical when you establish your show on exploration and make your protagonists dream to be to 'have an understanding of the world' and SoB does this really well. Sound wise, we don't have all that much to say, we got the decent application and a few good mood setting jingles but overall, I wasn't too fond of it. That is subjective, though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nI realise that I unloaded a lot of 'character' stuff in the story section so, bar a few sentences about Sinbad, I will talk in a relatively broad manner.\\n\\n\r\nSinbad is a powerhouse, he has a childish personality that suits him way better in this show than it did in Magi: LoM. Likewise, you get to see a lot of Sinbad in action. Simply put, he is a bad ass, and the anime makes sure you know it. One thing I did find annoying was that there was quite a bit of conflict over whether Sinbad was a quirky, ignorant and bold character (as portrayed by his seductive side) or an intelligent and quick thinking bad ass (as portrayed by his warrior/politician side) and this kind of creates a two-faced character that doesn't acknowledge this fact.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other generals, their nature is very well cemented and their personalities are consistent throughout. One thing I will say about them is that despite their entertaining and unique nature, their development basically ends the moment they join up with Sinbad. No adaptation. No evolution. Well... maybe there is a tiny bit for the assassin kid but that's kind of the one apple in a barrel of oranges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\r\nI must say, I actually really enjoyed this anime. Despite the fact that the conclusion was left wide open and there wasn't really all that much of an end of season pay-off, the journey was still fun and there was enough going on (as well as enough nods to LoM) to justify watching it, not to mention liking it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\r\nI recommend that you watch this. It can be debated over whether or not you need to watch LoM to understand this season but despite a few unanswered questions and no telling where Sinbad ends up, there is plenty of material here to justify treating it as a prequel, maybe even an independent story, that you can watch right off the bat. I would really enjoy a follow up to this season, unfortunately, it tells a story that goes in hand with the 'real' story involving Alibaba... which is a shame because I honestly thought this story was much more interesting.",

            "content": "Magi: Sinbad no Bouken, or Magi: The Adventures of Sinbad is a pretty fun show, and I enjoyed the time I spent watching it.\r\nSinbad's rise to becoming the man we all know and love in The Labyrinth of Magic makes for a good story line, and it's fun to see the origin story of the eight generals as Sinbad meets them in his childhood. That being said, it's probably better to watch Magi: Labyrinth of Magic before you watch Adventures of Sinbad, as it's a prequel to that series. However, even if you watch this first, like I did, it's still a fun watch regardless.\r\nTheart and animation is good to look at, and the bright colours meant that visually, there was rarely a dull moment. The comedy was also pretty fun, and I loved how the main character Sinbad's personality carried over from Labyrinth to this show. Too often in prequels do characters seem like entirely different people to their future selves, but this is not the case in Adventures of Sinbad.\\n\\n\r\nOn the negative side of things, the story can be pretty slow at times, but this was more of a problem early on, as I feel it improved as the story continued. My other criticism is that sometimes in fight scenes, the enemies kinda waited around for the heroes to talk to each other, removing some of the flow from the battles, which were otherwise well animated and fun.\\n\r\nI hope this show gets a season 2 someday, as the season abruptly ended just as I was really getting into it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Magi: Sinbad no Bouken and would give it an 8/10. It's quite light hearted and fun, so I wouldn't recommend it to people who only like their anime serious, but otherwise I think this is a show worth watching.",

I've watched 10/13 episodes which I think is enough to share my review. My review will contain pacing spoilers.\r\nCharacters: All characters are one dimensionally and/or tropey. There is no where near enough development to care much about any of them. \r\nArt: The art is enjoyable but the character designs can be bland.\r\nSound: Serviceable. \r\nStory: The story points are interesting. Because of the way the story is told it becomes unenjoyable and the characters become cardboard. The story needed 50 episodesinstead of 13. Watching this anime is like reading the summary of a story, you'll find out what happens to the characters but you won't care.",

Unlike other reviewers, I really don't think you need to watch the others first. This may have come later, but it is a prequel, and lays a good foundation, so you can watch it without ever watching the other ones.\r\n I really hope there is a second season. They certainly left room for a lot more content to come. Here's hoping!\r\n--Review Ends here--\r\nWriting longer reviews for the sake of writing long reviews is ridiculous. I have to keep writing in order to meet the minimumrequirements so here goes. Sinbad is great. A boy king wannabe with a bright future and very sincere eyes. He does crazy things with his djinn powers but we never see him practice so where does he find the time between being an actor  surviving in nature all naturale and seducing the ladles? Please tell me this is long enough!",

            "content": "I give this story an 8.  I love looking at Sinbad's story growing up, and it's entertaining.  Plus, this is way better than the Animated Movie that Disney or whoever tried to do.\r\nThe art gets a 10 outstanding as always, with fluid motions and detailed looking characters.  Though the sound gets a 9 for not holding up as well as its counterparts.  It fits the mood, but none of the songs make me want to look it up on YouTube or anything.\r\nThe characters get a 6.  Sinbad is even more annoying and makes me lose respect for him.  Ireally don't like the characters that \"worry about people and want to help them, yet they ruin their lives and make it worse\".  At least Sinbad in the original anime, both seasons, knew he was a prick.  That feminist island bit also gave me a bad feeling in my mouth for the whole show, especially with that rant about the men seeming to enjoy it.  It makes a parallel to our world with the message, \"sure women [are oppressed], but it seems to work out for the system, so I don't see anything wrong.\"  Also, that bit were a man FINALLY conquers that terrible woman puts a bad taste in my mouth, bleh. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't all bad though, so the enjoyment gets an 8.  Some of the characters were funny, and previous background characters that didn't stick out to me as far as personality, were given more lines and background.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime gets an 8.  Some of the implications were terrible, but that was a one time incident with the female island.  Everything else was bearable, and even funny/a joy to watch.",
