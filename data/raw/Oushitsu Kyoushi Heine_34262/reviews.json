            "content": "The Royal Tutor: A show that most expected to be shounen-ai or a rip-off of Ouran Highschool Host Club, but actually wasn't.\r\n*SPOILER FREE*\r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nHeine Wittgenstein is the new royal tutor for four of the princes of Grannzreich. The princes have pushed away their previous tutors, but Heine strives to make a bond with them to show them that a teacher should be someone they can trust and depend on. Overall, the whole idea and execution of this was pretty heartwarming, and if you like that kind of stuff you'll likely find this series enjoyable. Underneath this, there is a mystery plot and some reallynice backstory elements that are revealed as the show goes on, and, by the end, they come together in a great way. At the same time, the plot isn't anything new or groundbreaking, it's just the execution that made it stand out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNot too much to say about my rating besides I simply liked how it looked. The shading was pretty unique and the art style itself is very neat, so it was something I looked forward to each episode. Also, a big part of the art style: Chibis. EVERYWHERE. At least once in every episode (If not more, with exception to some serious ones) the art style switches to a chibi one, which you will either find adorable or highly annoying. Personally, although I was annoyed at first, I ended up liking it because it adds to the character's personalities in some scenes. So, be warned, CHIBIS.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAgain, not much to say here besides I liked it. The music went well with the setting and story and made the series even more enjoyable. On occasion, there were some sound effects that were overexaggerated, which came off as weird, but not annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\r\nInitially, each prince has their own quirk that makes them stand out and easy to remember. Although they may seem one-sided at first, there is a lot more to them that is revealed as the series goes on. Overall, character development was one of the best parts about this because it was clear and understandable. Some backstory is tied into this as well and it's all done in a great way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI looked forward to new episodes of this anime, but it was kind of slow at first, so it may be a hit-or-miss thing. It's definitely not the best I've seen but it kept my interest with a decent story and nice execution.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Average story with an interesting plot\\n\r\n- Each episode adds to the personality of characters and character development is portrayed really well\\n\r\n- Pretty art and nice music\\n\r\n- Nothing seemed rushed and everything flowed together smoothly\\n\\n\r\nCons: .\\n\r\n- Plot reveals can be slow at times\\n\r\n- Seemed like the series was going nowhere for a bit\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI definitely recommend watching this series, it's heartwarming and has great with characters with equally great character development. Hope this helped!",

It's not boring at all, it managed to entertain me in every episode.\r\nThe story isn't very complicated. It sticks with the same idea until the end. No unnecessary side-stories, so If you like the idea itself, you definitely should don't have to worry about wasted potential.\r\nCharacters have very diffrent personalities, althrough they may seem a bit exaggerated, but I didn't found any of them annoying or tiring and felt their emotions.\r\nThe graphics itself is veryadorable, however you may be tired of many chibi artwork. But scenery is made really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very average, so don't expect excellent soundtrack of this one.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing, this anime is truly something, what should gain more attention. If you are like me and prefer to watch anime that are enjoyable with not much action into it, you should take a closer look at this anime. It's funny and adorable, so I strongly reccomend it to you.",

            "content": "Not bad. \r\nLet me just remind you that this is not a Yaoi or Shounen-Ai anime. So be at ease, there's no Yuri on Ice vibe on this.\r\nThis show might not be the best this season, but it is still good. Unlike other average shows out there, you easily get bored, but this is different from the rest of average shows. This show is fun, and I know you'll get fond of it. \r\n This show is about a mysterious Short Royal Tutor who got recommended by the king. \r\nThe Duty of the royal tutor is to shape these Four royal teenage princes to bethe future king. Each prince has its own individual character and story. That's why Heine did lot of adjustments just to be accepted as their official tutor. The story is basically about the innocence of four princes. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development of this show is likable. You'll grow fond of everyone's character.    Since the characters  are still teenagers,  you'll probably encounter some childish attitudes. But it fits them perfectly since this is not your typical Prince show where the prince has a very mature attitude and thinking. And this is what makes the show fun to watch due to the innocence of everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fun, it's not boring. It anticipates me waiting every episodes to come out weekly. I just want to watch and have fun, and this show fits perfectly in this category. No drama, No horror, No actions, jusf a calm comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are hesitant about this show, if you already watched Sakamoto Desu ga?, then you'll probably like this show. It has the same vibes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall my rate would be 7.5. To put it simple this is your average anime, but you just love watching it. It never bores you.\\n\\n",

( especially that butler that stays with the king like damn he fiiinnneee)\r\nThe voice actors fit the characters well and was perfect. The music was really good as well.\r\nILOVED the characters even the villains. All their personalities r complex like they do have some cliche factors but they're so different...( it's hard to explain )\\n\\n\r\ni loved every minute of it. The ending was satisfying and it was overall just a great anime. It was a short but memorable anime with a lot of morals and comedy and just a great addition to ur list.\\n\r\nI HIGHLY recommend that everyone watch it when ur bored or maybe searching for a new anime with a perfect blend of everything. \\n\r\nPLEASE watch it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTAY SAFE BE BRAVE.

            "content": "I was going to wait before I review this show, since I didn't want to jinx it but I'll flat out say it: The Royal Tutor is one of my favorite animes of this season. \r\nThe Royal Tutor accurately portrays something that knows EXACTLY what it is, and executes that perfectly. There's nothing that's going haywire in this show at all. Nothing has been overextended in order to seemingly gain more. It stays in its boundaries and merely perected on what makes it good.\r\nFor me, the best point of Royal Tutor is how simply perfect everything in the shows feels woven up into. The characterdevelopment is definitely driving highlight of the show, as we're watching a tutor nourish four princes so that they can be fit for Kingship.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty in this show definitely isn't depth, but rather, how it reflects how nice something can be if its simply just goes with what it has and perfects it the best it can. The Royal Tutor does that perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of hopping on things to garner it more attention, it takes its strongest point and refines it. The character development and watching these Princes interact every week is nothing less than pure satisfaction. Watching them grow with their own unique personality traits as they go about the daily lives under the guidance of their Tutor, Heine.\\n\\n\r\nMoving plot aside for a minute, the overall beauty and artwork of this series is something to adore as well, as the characters are all very beautiful.(Although that is subjective.) \\n\\n\r\nMoving back to the main point, each character is so distinct and have their own little quirks which simply make them more enjoyable. The interaction between each personality and their new Royal Tutor reflects the beauty of this anime. By capturing the beauty in character interaction and character development, Royal Tutor shows that it can shine w ithout having to much depth to the whole plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with good character development, lovely interaction and distinctive characters, and an overall comedic and warm show: The Royal Tutor is definitely one you should check out. Its an anime I can safely say captures what character development should look and feel like to a watcher.\\n",

            "content": "The Royal Tutor: Haine is an anime that has, so far, met my expectations. It is rather calm, slice-of-life anime that centers around the meticulous balance between teaching academics and teaching life lessons. \r\nThe only problem that I have with this show is that... I don't think it's going to be anything groundbreaking. The first three episodes have been rather formulaic from the standard world-building and \"character development\" that occurs at the beginning of any show. I put \"\" around character development because this show tries to convince the viewers that its characters are unique because of its use of \"individual interviews\" that give amore personalized understanding of each character. However, when you step away from that perspective, these characters becomes nothing more than cookie-cutter stereotypes floating around in anime. These somewhat cliche characters coupled with its rather slow narrative progression creates a rather average first impression.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, this show is held up by decent artwork contrasts between the chibi artwork and the serious 3D character models. They work well to speed up the pace of the show and make light-hearted interactions that hide this anime's, so far, weak plot. The sound is nothing extraordinary either. I do enjoy the light piano motifs throughout the show, and the VAs are not that bad either, I really enjoy Keisuke Ueda's performance as Heide. The rest of the cast does a solid job as well. I would not expect any breakout performances from this rather young group of VAs though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show has the potential to go somewhere. The plot has a solid foundation, and the characters have fit within their archetypes. It is all about the execution of its story that wrap this all together. At its best, this show would be around an 8/10, and at its worst it would be a 3/10. The show has room from growth, but not the ability to be fantastic because it is about as formulaic as a 5 paragraph essay. I hope that this show breaks out of its mold soon, or else, this show is going to be forgotten within this anime season. (6.5/10)",

            "content": "Don't be tricked by my seemingly low score, I'm very stringent when it comes to scores and to earn a 10/10, it has to be flawless, one of the best things I've ever seen, to get a 9/10, it has to be at least so enjoyable that I can't stop watching as if spellbound with no(to me) bad parts. To reach an 8/10, it's still extremely good without any striking/notable boring or crappy/irritating parts, a show that I got pretty immersed into and are kinda sad ended because I would've wanted to see more.\r\nSure, there were bad parts about it too, like the fact thatit's a bit overly simplistic with illogical conclusions to many things, it just wouldn't work out like that if it was real. The story itself was fairly shallow too and it's fairly slow-paced. Then there's the art, where my main complaint is actually the ways this author chose to draw children, at least \"noble\" children, the little princess looks pretty damn creepy, she doesn\u2019t even look like a living thing, she looks more like a very disproportionate(even when it comes to anime) doll, I think the colours used also makes it feel even more unnatural. Whoever drew her should learn how to draw young children properly and not try to make them look cuter by making their eyes literally fill half their faces. No matter what people say, when it comes to characters like the princess, looks DO matter if we are to like them. Well, she's not even important and like the rest of the female characters, is almost never shown since the main focus is the princes and the teacher.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was nothing that major. It wasn't supposed to be a very realistic story in the first place. The drama is well-placed and so is the comedy. The comedy doesn't stand out too much, but it did make me laugh now and then. It's a fairly slow show but it has a very peaceful feeling, calming me down without boring me, like a cup of tea after a busy day. What stands out the most in this show is probably the characters themselves. Most of them warms the heart to some extent, they're pretty fleshed out and feel real, something many anime/manga/novels fail to do nowadays. They're not restricted to simply one or two personality traits which they show every time, no, they can display many types of emotions and feelings and they can do things outside of their main trait. They feel pretty human, being vibrant and lively. We can also see them clearly developing as they mature and absorb the teachings of the mc.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's a great show. When I first saw it, I was pretty much against watching it since it had the same vibe as some other shows that I wasn't fond of and also seemed to be more akin to a shoujo anime than anything else(like the fact that there's almost ONLY guys and the art style too), but I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a heartwarming, slightly humorous story with some light drama about the relationship between a teacher and his students(not so much about the studying itself, at least not the studying we're used to, being more about experiencing things and learning stuff that they're bad at, like expressing emotions, learning how to handle fear against studying, learning how commoners live etc). There might be no notable girls, but that's simply only because romance was never even a slight element of this anime. It would remove the focus from what matters if females were running around and disturbing the teaching and relationships, it would also force the author to juggle with more balls instead of focusing on what he's supposed to do. I feel like it was the correct decision to not include any female presence.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, watch at least an episode or two before deciding if it's to your liking or not, it's not the type of anime that you can watch a few minutes of and decide that it sucks, it's not nearly high-paced enough for that.",

            "content": "Yes, the Royal Tutor.... a wonderful enjoyment indeed. I didn't expect too much, going by the opening and the premise, but was pleasantly surprised along the way.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story starts out pretty bland, a man is sent to the royal palace to teach the four princes to be able to become the next king. The first very generic Harem - feeling is destroyed after 2 or 3 episodes, where it becomes clear that there's more to it than what it seems. The story development is relatively confusing at the beginning, almost as if the creators didn't really know where to go with the story- OR they tried to hide the actual storyline under a bunch of comedy and schooling activities. However, because of this, the anime does a great job keeping its viewers coming back - it drops very clear but subtle hints that you will find out more in the episodes to come and still leads you astray to not find out what exactly it could be.\\n\r\nThis, on the other hand, leads to some instances being a bit over the top and blown out of proportion (that might only be my opinion though).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nI am very weak to art that is both fluffy and sexy at the same time. I love the play on light that's going on with the characters' eyes and hair. Moreover, nothing seems out of place, no weird hair or eye colours, no outlandish clothes or whatnot, there's not even the typical \"conspiciously light patch\" (something in the picture is drawn differently, so you know it's gonna move).\\n\r\nThe colour schemes are all very nice and in harmony, also, to a certain degree, realistic.\\n\r\nAnd the landscape, well... I can't be impartial here. I'm from Vienna. I can clearly see that the whole Anime is blatantly based on that city, and Austria in general (honestly, just google pictures of the Hofburg or the Opera, you'll see). Needless to say, I found it hillarious.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nSound is something where, the less I have to say, the better it is. I can easily give a high rating when I didn't notice the music at all. The thing that annoyed me here was that, apparently, there exists a total of 1 song for everything, and that got boring after some time. Other than that, hey, no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharakter - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is basically the center of this anime. The princes have very different personalities and problems, and Haine tries sorting them out and/or learns to deal with them. Much like in a Harem.  But there is noticable development, the characters are not just your usual tropes - they show more and more actual personality, which makes for a very believable setting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nYes. I did. A lot. It's fun - it's cute - it gets you into the story. Even though it's nothing ground breaking or world changing, it's very nice, and structured extremely well, not too fast, not too slow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nI would definitely ask you to watch the show. As a bonus, read up on Vienna as a city, then the anime gets immensely pleasing. It's nice and fluffy.\\n\r\nIT'S REAL FLUFFY. So go try it.\\n\\n\r\nBonus:\\n\r\nThere's this very quiet voice in my head that tells me it seems like a shounen ai - but then again, you can always interpret something like that. Another marker that it's not intended as such is that I, a hardcore shipper, didn't even think twice about shipping anyone in the anime, which I attribute to the well thought out character balancing.\\n",

            "content": "Confession: Just completed episode 7. This is my main show for the season.\r\n------------------------\r\nI came for the art, I stayed for the character development. \r\n*This is not a yaoi/shounen-ai.\r\nStory: Starts with a base plot of introducing the mysterious new tutor to the four princes. After that is just wonderful, progressive character development in a slice-of-life setting with a royal twist. Seeing the characters improve is what keeps the show going. Also, light-hearted and silly humour. The story acts as more of a background so the episodes don't directly connect one after the other, giving it a more relaxed pace. A fun and energetic show that leavesme wanting more each time. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation is actually beyond my expectations. I find that normally, shorter anime are susceptible to falling short in terms of quality but it's pretty good so far. The art itself is great! The style is pretty detailed, but the colouring stands out even more so. I think it's the shiny hair and eyes that get me. The backgrounds are also well-done, and give you a sense of the privileged lifestyle the princes live. Overall there is good consistency.\\n\\n\r\nSound: So far the background music is good, but not as outstanding as the OP and ED, which are fun to listen to. The voice actors are doing a great job of matching their respective characters' energy and emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The tutor's background is shrouded in mystery so far, but he remains humble and compliments the princes' personalities. Supporting characters also help with driving the plot. Each prince is unique in their own way. They start off with somewhat cliche traits, but the reason I've become attached to this show is because I got to see them develop and grow. This will become evident through observing their background and interactions. This is the show's greatest strength in moving forward and keeping my attention. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you're into silly, light-hearted shows with satisfying character development and not-so-heavy plot then give this show a try. This would also make a comfortable re-watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Of course it depends on the kind of anime you like and you can be disappointed.\r\nIt's an historical anime, so the characters wear elegante and chic clothes. That has a lot of comedy and slice of life. Each episode you become more and more fascinated with the story and the characters. It has a bit of drama (a bit indeed). So, if you're a crybaby like me you will probably cry. Or not. Just watching to know.",

This show does a wonderful job presenting each of them in their own way, and they're all represented equally. \r\nThe balance between comedy and drama is spot on, everything happens for a reason. There were very few repetitive scenes, but they weren't fillers, they were acceptable based on the context. I was totally hooked the entire time. \r\nThe animation is flawlessand stunning. The characters are extremely expressive, there is never a dull moment with them. The hair and eyes were especially well done. They also had the perfect use of chibis, reminiscent of Black Butler for me. Funny and adorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound enhanced the show in a way that was natural and not distracting. Both the opening and the closing were excellent. \\n\\n\r\nI cried, I laughed, I got goosebumps, I want a second season. I miss them already.",

Plus, the character development is very clear. Haine, the royal tutor clearly helps us show that princes are growing, and treat them evenly. Not only does Haine teaches the princes, but as I said we learn life lessons from him too. \r\nIf you're into lifelessons then this would be the anime for you, and don't worry it's definitely not boring. This anime also has comedy and finding out about the Haine's past. \\n\\n\r\nWhat he did in the past may not be serious, but by Haine keeping it away, it shows he cares for the king and princes. It is also heartwarming, but I shouldn't say anything because I don't want to accidentally spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, this is a good anime, and recommended to those into comedy, life lessons, and heartwarming surprises.",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nA royal tutor teaching and grooming the princes to be good enough to take the throne. Another good laid-back type of anime with pretty boys. Relatively good pacing in terms of plot and having comedy as the genre lives up to this anime. Very funny one indeed (cute too), due to the chibi scenes and the personality of most of the characters. Watching this anime will give you a bit of the \u201cOuran High School Host Club\u201d vibe, which is great since I love that anime so much. Plot can sometimes be pretty unpredictable and unexpecting to some viewers. Also, later on in eachepisode, each character will have a story about themselves and slowly know about Heine\u2019s past. Lastly, the anime managed to end off with a good ending, made me smile so much ^^ \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nWas quite shocked to hear the voice actor for Heine. Did not expect it as his appearance doesn\u2019t suit the voice given. That\u2019s where this saying comes into play \u201cDo not judge a book by its cover\u201d. Personality of his definitely suits the voice. Ever since episode 1, I really, really love Heine. Good at everything, cool, cute, sarcastic at times, funny and knows his way of doing things. Compared to the majority, Heine\u2019s my favourite out of all the characters while next to him is Kai. Each of them have really interesting personalities and I will not be describing all of them as you will see it for yourself in the anime as it progresses. It\u2019s the characters and their development that keeps me going. Side characters were given a fair amount of show time too.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nPretty good and adorable, due to the chibi scenes. Manages to portray the emotions of the characters well through chibi art too. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGreat ending and opening songs. Found myself watching them instead of skipping it through a few times. However, there's one episode that you should look out for. The ending song is very different compared to the other episodes. It's my first time seeing such an anime doing that sort of ending too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime as it's a great one. Definitely worth a shot as you will be in for lots of laughs and some sad moments as well. I binged most of the episodes and will be reading the manga now that I\u2019ve finished the anime. Unfortunately, the translated manga seems to not have caught up with the anime yet. I hope for a season 2 where they\u2019ll show who became the king in the end but with how they ended, I\u2019m not too sure too\u2026\\n",

            "content": "The only limit this anime had was the episode count, really.\r\nStory:\r\nIn its essence, it's a growing up story for four royally spoiled teenage boys. Each of the four princes are to be given equal attention by the tutor and so naturally, they all got equal characterization. While the plot is not complex or sophisticated, it's a heartwarming tale of four boys growing up to become wonderful and mature adults. Despite its simplicity, this deserves high marks for how well it is done. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThere are essentially 5 main characters in this anime and each of them receive almost equal development. The show does a splendid jobpainting a picture of what these four princes are like at the start - mostly arrogant or spoiled with their own idiosyncrasies that make them who they are. As the episodes go by, each of the princes learns something from their experiences and their tutor's guidance that helps them get pass their weaknesses as a character. Heck, even the tutor himself learns a thing or two by the end, albeit not as much as his pupils.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nExcellent, for an anime. The character designs almost try to mimic the illustration styles of light novel illustrators. The backgrounds are equally vivid and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nUnfortunately the weakest point of the series. There aren't any particularly memorable tracks in the OST. The OP and ED do their job though and are thus quite adequate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, this one an anime that I very much looked forward to every week just because I could feel a connection to the characters in it. It might not be a change-the-world plot like Gundam 00 or Code Geass, nor is it an over-the-top masterpiece like Kill-La-Kill. It might not even contain philosophical themes and endless symbolism like Utena, but for a 12-episode show, it is like a good Macross show where the characterization makes it shine.\\n\\n\r\nWho's this for:\\n\r\n-fans of anime with a European setting\\n\r\n-Slice of life fans\\n\r\n-those who enjoy growing up stories\\n\\n\r\nWho's this not for:\\n\r\n-if you just wanted action porn\\n\r\n-if you want strong female characters. Sorry, the only females are the maids and the princess who's too young to be important yet\\n\r\n-if you want a sophisticated plot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Although this has a very bishounen artstyle and pretty much a male cast, rest assured that it's actually a very refreshing series with pretty much nonexistant yaoi/shounen ai vibes. \r\nSTORY:\r\nTruthfully as I have been watching this series I can't tell where it's gonna go, and that's a great thing. The plot is neither shallow or cliche and each episode makes you wonder and learn more and more. Overall we find out about each prince and their flaws and strengths and watch them grow, but this series takes on such a refreshing perspective of what may be some typical prince issues. \r\nART:\r\nWell I may be biasedas a female, but this is very pretty art. I've also been impressed with the backgrounds of western historical towns and castles. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nThe sound fits just right to where it needs to be used. I find the opening and ending alright, catchy but I'm not totally in love with them. I like the voice actors a lot for their roles, and although Heine's may be so unexpected I like that it is mature because that's exactly how his character is. The voice actor is also great at portraying his pettier more comedic moments as well. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nWhen this series first started off its introductions the only character I was entranced by was the main one, Heine, as he seemed more atypical. The other cast of the 4 princes seemed to fulfill a lot of typical bishounen tropes of the tsundere, playboy, elitist, and cold hearted types. But despite this, The Royal Tutor explores all their characters positively and really does well in expanding their characters. We get to see their strengths and fears and Heine plays a pivotal role in directing their development, as he was meant to. I've been really impressed with some of the dialogue that provides a genuine sense of personality to the cast.  \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI've pretty much really enjoyed this a lot more than I intended to, as I was initially drawn to how pretty it looked. But Heine continues to impress me and I really like his character.",

However, a familiar plot could be entertaining if the presentation of the idea is done well and for this case, yes, it successfully entertains me. I jumped into the anime blind and didn't know what to expect nor what kind of story this is so I'm pleasantly surprised. The plot is simple and very easy to understand which I believe would be a good anime for beginners or for someone who just wants to get out from anime slump.\r\nThe flow of theplot is well paced and there's not so much plot hole. However, I am very interested to know about the first prince. If there's any second season, it would be nice to include the first prince also. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is laced with serious and touching moments, with a sprinkle of humour. These are great combinations in my opinion yet it could be a double edge sword if each elements are not balanced well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEach princes have their own distinct personality and I enjoy getting to know each of the princes personally through each episode. However, the presence of the first prince is very limited and the main character, sensei is not explored enough in my opinion. Heine could be such an interesting character if his background and past are explained further. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character would be the King himself, Victor just because I love his soft side and his king side. The duality of King Victor is entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nGraphic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love how the anime is a mixture of beautiful, serious art with a cute chibi ones. I laugh everything the art changes to chibi version. It's adorable and it suites the scene. It makes the scene funnier and cuter. \\n\\n\r\nOver all: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally think that this is a nice anime to watch. It would be not in my all time favourite list but if I am asked whether this anime is good, I would say I enjoy it. I recommend this to beginners, those who are in anime slump and also for those who wants to watch anime while 'on the go' for it's simple plot and great pace. \\n",

I think the plot can be a bit slow moving and a bit repetitive with the -prince has a bad trait-> Heine helps to fix said trait->Heine acknowledges prince for who he is->everyone gets closer- in the beginning but each episode focuses on the adorable personality issues of all the characters and Heine has a past himself that we dive into.\r\nI don't think the art is anything too spectacular, but there is definitely nothing wrong with it and this anime's focus isn't to have the most beautiful scenes in anime. The focus of this anime is character growthand it is definitely meeting that goal!",

The princes have pushed away their previous tutors, but Heine strives to make a bond with them to show them that a teacher should be someone they can trust and depend on. Overall, the whole idea and execution of this was pretty heartwarming, and if you like that kind of stuff you'll likely find this series enjoyable. Underneath this, there is a mystery plot and some reallynice backstory elements that are revealed as the show goes on, and, by the end, they come together in a great way. At the same time, the plot isn't anything new or groundbreaking, it's just the execution that made it stand out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNot too much to say about my rating besides I simply liked how it looked. The shading was pretty unique and the art style itself is very neat, so it was something I looked forward to each episode. Also, a big part of the art style: Chibis. EVERYWHERE. At least once in every episode (If not more, with exception to some serious ones) the art style switches to a chibi one, which you will either find adorable or highly annoying. Personally, although I was annoyed at first, I ended up liking it because it adds to the character's personalities in some scenes. So, be warned, CHIBIS.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAgain, not much to say here besides I liked it. The music went well with the setting and story and made the series even more enjoyable. On occasion, there were some sound effects that were overexaggerated, which came off as weird, but not annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\r\nInitially, each prince has their own quirk that makes them stand out and easy to remember. Although they may seem one-sided at first, there is a lot more to them that is revealed as the series goes on. Overall, character development was one of the best parts about this because it was clear and understandable. Some backstory is tied into this as well and it's all done in a great way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI looked forward to new episodes of this anime, but it was kind of slow at first, so it may be a hit-or-miss thing. It's definitely not the best I've seen but it kept my interest with a decent story and nice execution.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Average story with an interesting plot\\n\r\n- Each episode adds to the personality of characters and character development is portrayed really well\\n\r\n- Pretty art and nice music\\n\r\n- Nothing seemed rushed and everything flowed together smoothly\\n\\n\r\nCons: .\\n\r\n- Plot reveals can be slow at times\\n\r\n- Seemed like the series was going nowhere for a bit\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI definitely recommend watching this series, it's heartwarming and has great with characters with equally great character development. Hope this helped!",

No unnecessary side-stories, so If you like the idea itself, you definitely should don't have to worry about wasted potential.\r\nCharacters have very diffrent personalities, althrough they may seem a bit exaggerated, but I didn't found any of them annoying or tiring and felt their emotions.\r\nThe graphics itself is veryadorable, however you may be tired of many chibi artwork. But scenery is made really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very average, so don't expect excellent soundtrack of this one.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing, this anime is truly something, what should gain more attention. If you are like me and prefer to watch anime that are enjoyable with not much action into it, you should take a closer look at this anime. It's funny and adorable, so I strongly reccomend it to you.",

So be at ease, there's no Yuri on Ice vibe on this.\r\nThis show might not be the best this season, but it is still good. Unlike other average shows out there, you easily get bored, but this is different from the rest of average shows. This show is fun, and I know you'll get fond of it. \r\n This show is about a mysterious Short Royal Tutor who got recommended by the king. \r\nThe Duty of the royal tutor is to shape these Four royal teenage princes to bethe future king. Each prince has its own individual character and story. That's why Heine did lot of adjustments just to be accepted as their official tutor. The story is basically about the innocence of four princes. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development of this show is likable. You'll grow fond of everyone's character.    Since the characters  are still teenagers,  you'll probably encounter some childish attitudes. But it fits them perfectly since this is not your typical Prince show where the prince has a very mature attitude and thinking. And this is what makes the show fun to watch due to the innocence of everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fun, it's not boring. It anticipates me waiting every episodes to come out weekly. I just want to watch and have fun, and this show fits perfectly in this category. No drama, No horror, No actions, jusf a calm comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are hesitant about this show, if you already watched Sakamoto Desu ga?, then you'll probably like this show. It has the same vibes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall my rate would be 7.5. To put it simple this is your average anime, but you just love watching it. It never bores you.\\n\\n",

There's nothing that's going haywire in this show at all. Nothing has been overextended in order to seemingly gain more. It stays in its boundaries and merely perected on what makes it good.\r\nFor me, the best point of Royal Tutor is how simply perfect everything in the shows feels woven up into. The characterdevelopment is definitely driving highlight of the show, as we're watching a tutor nourish four princes so that they can be fit for Kingship.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty in this show definitely isn't depth, but rather, how it reflects how nice something can be if its simply just goes with what it has and perfects it the best it can. The Royal Tutor does that perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of hopping on things to garner it more attention, it takes its strongest point and refines it. The character development and watching these Princes interact every week is nothing less than pure satisfaction. Watching them grow with their own unique personality traits as they go about the daily lives under the guidance of their Tutor, Heine.\\n\\n\r\nMoving plot aside for a minute, the overall beauty and artwork of this series is something to adore as well, as the characters are all very beautiful.(Although that is subjective.) \\n\\n\r\nMoving back to the main point, each character is so distinct and have their own little quirks which simply make them more enjoyable. The interaction between each personality and their new Royal Tutor reflects the beauty of this anime. By capturing the beauty in character interaction and character development, Royal Tutor shows that it can shine w ithout having to much depth to the whole plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with good character development, lovely interaction and distinctive characters, and an overall comedic and warm show: The Royal Tutor is definitely one you should check out. Its an anime I can safely say captures what character development should look and feel like to a watcher.\\n",

            "content": "The Royal Tutor: Haine is an anime that has, so far, met my expectations. It is rather calm, slice-of-life anime that centers around the meticulous balance between teaching academics and teaching life lessons. \r\nThe only problem that I have with this show is that... I don't think it's going to be anything groundbreaking. The first three episodes have been rather formulaic from the standard world-building and \"character development\" that occurs at the beginning of any show. I put \"\" around character development because this show tries to convince the viewers that its characters are unique because of its use of \"individual interviews\" that give amore personalized understanding of each character. However, when you step away from that perspective, these characters becomes nothing more than cookie-cutter stereotypes floating around in anime. These somewhat cliche characters coupled with its rather slow narrative progression creates a rather average first impression.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, this show is held up by decent artwork contrasts between the chibi artwork and the serious 3D character models. They work well to speed up the pace of the show and make light-hearted interactions that hide this anime's, so far, weak plot. The sound is nothing extraordinary either. I do enjoy the light piano motifs throughout the show, and the VAs are not that bad either, I really enjoy Keisuke Ueda's performance as Heide. The rest of the cast does a solid job as well. I would not expect any breakout performances from this rather young group of VAs though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show has the potential to go somewhere. The plot has a solid foundation, and the characters have fit within their archetypes. It is all about the execution of its story that wrap this all together. At its best, this show would be around an 8/10, and at its worst it would be a 3/10. The show has room from growth, but not the ability to be fantastic because it is about as formulaic as a 5 paragraph essay. I hope that this show breaks out of its mold soon, or else, this show is going to be forgotten within this anime season. (6.5/10)",

The most prominent part of this show is its characters development. Even tho its supposed to be centered around the prince we got some twist and backstory toward the end.\r\nThe art is really good and the princes are all good looking. I could feel that this show was made for the fangirls. We have a lot of chibis but it didn't disturb me. \r\nThe show can be really funny while still remainingserious when it needs to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i really enjoyed this show.

            "content": "Don't be tricked by my seemingly low score, I'm very stringent when it comes to scores and to earn a 10/10, it has to be flawless, one of the best things I've ever seen, to get a 9/10, it has to be at least so enjoyable that I can't stop watching as if spellbound with no(to me) bad parts. To reach an 8/10, it's still extremely good without any striking/notable boring or crappy/irritating parts, a show that I got pretty immersed into and are kinda sad ended because I would've wanted to see more.\r\nSure, there were bad parts about it too, like the fact thatit's a bit overly simplistic with illogical conclusions to many things, it just wouldn't work out like that if it was real. The story itself was fairly shallow too and it's fairly slow-paced. Then there's the art, where my main complaint is actually the ways this author chose to draw children, at least \"noble\" children, the little princess looks pretty damn creepy, she doesn\u2019t even look like a living thing, she looks more like a very disproportionate(even when it comes to anime) doll, I think the colours used also makes it feel even more unnatural. Whoever drew her should learn how to draw young children properly and not try to make them look cuter by making their eyes literally fill half their faces. No matter what people say, when it comes to characters like the princess, looks DO matter if we are to like them. Well, she's not even important and like the rest of the female characters, is almost never shown since the main focus is the princes and the teacher.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was nothing that major. It wasn't supposed to be a very realistic story in the first place. The drama is well-placed and so is the comedy. The comedy doesn't stand out too much, but it did make me laugh now and then. It's a fairly slow show but it has a very peaceful feeling, calming me down without boring me, like a cup of tea after a busy day. What stands out the most in this show is probably the characters themselves. Most of them warms the heart to some extent, they're pretty fleshed out and feel real, something many anime/manga/novels fail to do nowadays. They're not restricted to simply one or two personality traits which they show every time, no, they can display many types of emotions and feelings and they can do things outside of their main trait. They feel pretty human, being vibrant and lively. We can also see them clearly developing as they mature and absorb the teachings of the mc.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it's a great show. When I first saw it, I was pretty much against watching it since it had the same vibe as some other shows that I wasn't fond of and also seemed to be more akin to a shoujo anime than anything else(like the fact that there's almost ONLY guys and the art style too), but I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a heartwarming, slightly humorous story with some light drama about the relationship between a teacher and his students(not so much about the studying itself, at least not the studying we're used to, being more about experiencing things and learning stuff that they're bad at, like expressing emotions, learning how to handle fear against studying, learning how commoners live etc). There might be no notable girls, but that's simply only because romance was never even a slight element of this anime. It would remove the focus from what matters if females were running around and disturbing the teaching and relationships, it would also force the author to juggle with more balls instead of focusing on what he's supposed to do. I feel like it was the correct decision to not include any female presence.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, watch at least an episode or two before deciding if it's to your liking or not, it's not the type of anime that you can watch a few minutes of and decide that it sucks, it's not nearly high-paced enough for that.",

            "content": "Yes, the Royal Tutor.... a wonderful enjoyment indeed. I didn't expect too much, going by the opening and the premise, but was pleasantly surprised along the way.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story starts out pretty bland, a man is sent to the royal palace to teach the four princes to be able to become the next king. The first very generic Harem - feeling is destroyed after 2 or 3 episodes, where it becomes clear that there's more to it than what it seems. The story development is relatively confusing at the beginning, almost as if the creators didn't really know where to go with the story- OR they tried to hide the actual storyline under a bunch of comedy and schooling activities. However, because of this, the anime does a great job keeping its viewers coming back - it drops very clear but subtle hints that you will find out more in the episodes to come and still leads you astray to not find out what exactly it could be.\\n\r\nThis, on the other hand, leads to some instances being a bit over the top and blown out of proportion (that might only be my opinion though).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nI am very weak to art that is both fluffy and sexy at the same time. I love the play on light that's going on with the characters' eyes and hair. Moreover, nothing seems out of place, no weird hair or eye colours, no outlandish clothes or whatnot, there's not even the typical \"conspiciously light patch\" (something in the picture is drawn differently, so you know it's gonna move).\\n\r\nThe colour schemes are all very nice and in harmony, also, to a certain degree, realistic.\\n\r\nAnd the landscape, well... I can't be impartial here. I'm from Vienna. I can clearly see that the whole Anime is blatantly based on that city, and Austria in general (honestly, just google pictures of the Hofburg or the Opera, you'll see). Needless to say, I found it hillarious.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nSound is something where, the less I have to say, the better it is. I can easily give a high rating when I didn't notice the music at all. The thing that annoyed me here was that, apparently, there exists a total of 1 song for everything, and that got boring after some time. Other than that, hey, no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharakter - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is basically the center of this anime. The princes have very different personalities and problems, and Haine tries sorting them out and/or learns to deal with them. Much like in a Harem.  But there is noticable development, the characters are not just your usual tropes - they show more and more actual personality, which makes for a very believable setting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nYes. I did. A lot. It's fun - it's cute - it gets you into the story. Even though it's nothing ground breaking or world changing, it's very nice, and structured extremely well, not too fast, not too slow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nI would definitely ask you to watch the show. As a bonus, read up on Vienna as a city, then the anime gets immensely pleasing. It's nice and fluffy.\\n\r\nIT'S REAL FLUFFY. So go try it.\\n\\n\r\nBonus:\\n\r\nThere's this very quiet voice in my head that tells me it seems like a shounen ai - but then again, you can always interpret something like that. Another marker that it's not intended as such is that I, a hardcore shipper, didn't even think twice about shipping anyone in the anime, which I attribute to the well thought out character balancing.\\n",

This is my main show for the season.\r\n------------------------\r\nI came for the art, I stayed for the character development. \r\n*This is not a yaoi/shounen-ai.\r\nStory: Starts with a base plot of introducing the mysterious new tutor to the four princes. After that is just wonderful, progressive character development in a slice-of-life setting with a royal twist. Seeing the characters improve is what keeps the show going. Also, light-hearted and silly humour. The story acts as more of a background so the episodes don't directly connect one after the other, giving it a more relaxed pace. A fun and energetic show that leavesme wanting more each time. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation is actually beyond my expectations. I find that normally, shorter anime are susceptible to falling short in terms of quality but it's pretty good so far. The art itself is great! The style is pretty detailed, but the colouring stands out even more so. I think it's the shiny hair and eyes that get me. The backgrounds are also well-done, and give you a sense of the privileged lifestyle the princes live. Overall there is good consistency.\\n\\n\r\nSound: So far the background music is good, but not as outstanding as the OP and ED, which are fun to listen to. The voice actors are doing a great job of matching their respective characters' energy and emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The tutor's background is shrouded in mystery so far, but he remains humble and compliments the princes' personalities. Supporting characters also help with driving the plot. Each prince is unique in their own way. They start off with somewhat cliche traits, but the reason I've become attached to this show is because I got to see them develop and grow. This will become evident through observing their background and interactions. This is the show's greatest strength in moving forward and keeping my attention. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you're into silly, light-hearted shows with satisfying character development and not-so-heavy plot then give this show a try. This would also make a comfortable re-watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Plus, the character development is very clear. Haine, the royal tutor clearly helps us show that princes are growing, and treat them evenly. Not only does Haine teaches the princes, but as I said we learn life lessons from him too. \r\nIf you're into lifelessons then this would be the anime for you, and don't worry it's definitely not boring. This anime also has comedy and finding out about the Haine's past. \\n\\n\r\nWhat he did in the past may not be serious, but by Haine keeping it away, it shows he cares for the king and princes. It is also heartwarming, but I shouldn't say anything because I don't want to accidentally spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, this is a good anime, and recommended to those into comedy, life lessons, and heartwarming surprises.",

In each episode, there were different advises for different situation that they come across, and they learn from it. \r\nThe art design and character that I've seen varied. The background, furniture, and surroundings that I've seen was very detailed.

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nA royal tutor teaching and grooming the princes to be good enough to take the throne. Another good laid-back type of anime with pretty boys. Relatively good pacing in terms of plot and having comedy as the genre lives up to this anime. Very funny one indeed (cute too), due to the chibi scenes and the personality of most of the characters. Watching this anime will give you a bit of the \u201cOuran High School Host Club\u201d vibe, which is great since I love that anime so much. Plot can sometimes be pretty unpredictable and unexpecting to some viewers. Also, later on in eachepisode, each character will have a story about themselves and slowly know about Heine\u2019s past. Lastly, the anime managed to end off with a good ending, made me smile so much ^^ \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nWas quite shocked to hear the voice actor for Heine. Did not expect it as his appearance doesn\u2019t suit the voice given. That\u2019s where this saying comes into play \u201cDo not judge a book by its cover\u201d. Personality of his definitely suits the voice. Ever since episode 1, I really, really love Heine. Good at everything, cool, cute, sarcastic at times, funny and knows his way of doing things. Compared to the majority, Heine\u2019s my favourite out of all the characters while next to him is Kai. Each of them have really interesting personalities and I will not be describing all of them as you will see it for yourself in the anime as it progresses. It\u2019s the characters and their development that keeps me going. Side characters were given a fair amount of show time too.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nPretty good and adorable, due to the chibi scenes. Manages to portray the emotions of the characters well through chibi art too. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGreat ending and opening songs. Found myself watching them instead of skipping it through a few times. However, there's one episode that you should look out for. The ending song is very different compared to the other episodes. It's my first time seeing such an anime doing that sort of ending too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime as it's a great one. Definitely worth a shot as you will be in for lots of laughs and some sad moments as well. I binged most of the episodes and will be reading the manga now that I\u2019ve finished the anime. Unfortunately, the translated manga seems to not have caught up with the anime yet. I hope for a season 2 where they\u2019ll show who became the king in the end but with how they ended, I\u2019m not too sure too\u2026\\n",

            "content": "The only limit this anime had was the episode count, really.\r\nStory:\r\nIn its essence, it's a growing up story for four royally spoiled teenage boys. Each of the four princes are to be given equal attention by the tutor and so naturally, they all got equal characterization. While the plot is not complex or sophisticated, it's a heartwarming tale of four boys growing up to become wonderful and mature adults. Despite its simplicity, this deserves high marks for how well it is done. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThere are essentially 5 main characters in this anime and each of them receive almost equal development. The show does a splendid jobpainting a picture of what these four princes are like at the start - mostly arrogant or spoiled with their own idiosyncrasies that make them who they are. As the episodes go by, each of the princes learns something from their experiences and their tutor's guidance that helps them get pass their weaknesses as a character. Heck, even the tutor himself learns a thing or two by the end, albeit not as much as his pupils.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nExcellent, for an anime. The character designs almost try to mimic the illustration styles of light novel illustrators. The backgrounds are equally vivid and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nUnfortunately the weakest point of the series. There aren't any particularly memorable tracks in the OST. The OP and ED do their job though and are thus quite adequate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, this one an anime that I very much looked forward to every week just because I could feel a connection to the characters in it. It might not be a change-the-world plot like Gundam 00 or Code Geass, nor is it an over-the-top masterpiece like Kill-La-Kill. It might not even contain philosophical themes and endless symbolism like Utena, but for a 12-episode show, it is like a good Macross show where the characterization makes it shine.\\n\\n\r\nWho's this for:\\n\r\n-fans of anime with a European setting\\n\r\n-Slice of life fans\\n\r\n-those who enjoy growing up stories\\n\\n\r\nWho's this not for:\\n\r\n-if you just wanted action porn\\n\r\n-if you want strong female characters. Sorry, the only females are the maids and the princess who's too young to be important yet\\n\r\n-if you want a sophisticated plot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Although this has a very bishounen artstyle and pretty much a male cast, rest assured that it's actually a very refreshing series with pretty much nonexistant yaoi/shounen ai vibes. \r\nSTORY:\r\nTruthfully as I have been watching this series I can't tell where it's gonna go, and that's a great thing. The plot is neither shallow or cliche and each episode makes you wonder and learn more and more. Overall we find out about each prince and their flaws and strengths and watch them grow, but this series takes on such a refreshing perspective of what may be some typical prince issues. \r\nART:\r\nWell I may be biasedas a female, but this is very pretty art. I've also been impressed with the backgrounds of western historical towns and castles. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nThe sound fits just right to where it needs to be used. I find the opening and ending alright, catchy but I'm not totally in love with them. I like the voice actors a lot for their roles, and although Heine's may be so unexpected I like that it is mature because that's exactly how his character is. The voice actor is also great at portraying his pettier more comedic moments as well. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nWhen this series first started off its introductions the only character I was entranced by was the main one, Heine, as he seemed more atypical. The other cast of the 4 princes seemed to fulfill a lot of typical bishounen tropes of the tsundere, playboy, elitist, and cold hearted types. But despite this, The Royal Tutor explores all their characters positively and really does well in expanding their characters. We get to see their strengths and fears and Heine plays a pivotal role in directing their development, as he was meant to. I've been really impressed with some of the dialogue that provides a genuine sense of personality to the cast.  \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI've pretty much really enjoyed this a lot more than I intended to, as I was initially drawn to how pretty it looked. But Heine continues to impress me and I really like his character.",

However, a familiar plot could be entertaining if the presentation of the idea is done well and for this case, yes, it successfully entertains me. I jumped into the anime blind and didn't know what to expect nor what kind of story this is so I'm pleasantly surprised. The plot is simple and very easy to understand which I believe would be a good anime for beginners or for someone who just wants to get out from anime slump.\r\nThe flow of theplot is well paced and there's not so much plot hole. However, I am very interested to know about the first prince. If there's any second season, it would be nice to include the first prince also. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is laced with serious and touching moments, with a sprinkle of humour. These are great combinations in my opinion yet it could be a double edge sword if each elements are not balanced well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEach princes have their own distinct personality and I enjoy getting to know each of the princes personally through each episode. However, the presence of the first prince is very limited and the main character, sensei is not explored enough in my opinion. Heine could be such an interesting character if his background and past are explained further. \\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character would be the King himself, Victor just because I love his soft side and his king side. The duality of King Victor is entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nGraphic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love how the anime is a mixture of beautiful, serious art with a cute chibi ones. I laugh everything the art changes to chibi version. It's adorable and it suites the scene. It makes the scene funnier and cuter. \\n\\n\r\nOver all: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally think that this is a nice anime to watch. It would be not in my all time favourite list but if I am asked whether this anime is good, I would say I enjoy it. I recommend this to beginners, those who are in anime slump and also for those who wants to watch anime while 'on the go' for it's simple plot and great pace. \\n",

I think this show strikes a good balance between artistic rendition and realistic settings\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are a very strong part of the show. They all feel like real people and it is very enjoyable to watch them interact and to see the way their choices pan out over the course of the show. For how exaggerated these characters might seem I could believe they exist in our world easily and I commend the show for that.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was very enjoyable and had a good mix of art story and characters. I think this is a very well developed show and I am surprised it is so well hidden.",

I can't wait for new story and I can't wait for some misterjes to be resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw of it is that story doesn't go as fast as I hoped it would, but it simply doesn't have to.",

            "content": "A halfway-interesting variation on the subgenre of CGDCT that has been popularized by Umaru and KareKano, wherein the characters spend a lot of time in a Super Deformed state. As far as the chibi goes, it's played well for the first few episodes before it becomes totally stale. \r\nThe art is probably the series' greatest strength, save for when they spam the SD style (to be fair, it is funny sometimes). The intro and outro are godawful for my Western sensibilities. The seiyuu for the tutor\u2014Heine Wittgenstein\u2014is often the sole redeemer of the sound.\r\nThe four princes are tropes you've seen a million times; it becomesmore apparent once the show begins to focus on one prince per episode. If the show wants to be deep, it's very lazy about it\u2014one of the episodes features characters named Dmitri and Smerdyakov, but it was clear that none of the creators had read \"The Brothers Karamazov\" and just wanted points for the reference. Similarly, when Wittgenstein first took out his riding crop, I thought they were going to make a joke about how Wittgenstein (in real-life) used to physically abuse children who gave wrong answers. [The irony is that he, unlike any of the show's characters, would make for a good anime.]\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing new or enlightening about this series, but it's not a bad watch by any means.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Oushitsu Kyoushi Heine. It's not often to find a good teacher anime as of late. Many shows have tried the super teacher theme, and very few have done it right. This happens to be one that has.\r\nThe story revolves around 4 princes and their royal tutor. As the royal tutor he is charged with treating the kings 4 children equally, and grooming them for the throne. The show is episodic, each episode has its own issue which generally relates to a certain princes issue. Each prince has his own personality and strength and our MC Heine reaffirmstheir strength while twisting their weakness and making it work for them.\\n\\n\r\nThough each princes story was entertaining it was a bit bland on the world building. The fact that they are princes mattered in the most loose since. I knocked a few points off because I felt the world around the princes didn't matter, which clashed with the main theme a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. The soundtrack wasn't up my alley.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show. Heine our main character is the main source of comedy. He is a \"Full grown adult\" but has the appearance of a child. He's the mysterious super teacher archetype character but they don't go overboard making him crazy or fantastical. The princes all have their own personality, but describing them here would be a spoilers. I however really loved how they handled them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this anime. I don't think Ill watch it again unless a season 2 comes out, which is possible. However I really want to hand it to the people behind the series. To write a story so its interesting, yet to not overstep you bounds and turn it into a crazy mess is rare. Each character was believable, and you get attached to them in a natural way. The side stories that crop up feel well thought out. The ending wraps everything up yet it also allows you a hope for a season 2. The comedy though thin was a well placed. The drama not overbearing, which I cant praise enough.\\n\\n\r\nIn short I suppose the biggest strength of this anime is that it felt like it was a completed idea. You don't really wonder if they had different writers or a change in sensibilities along the way. If you like the first episode you'll like the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Pretty good. Enjoyable characters, good pacing, solid story with a solid ending. Give it a shot.",

            "content": "Now, I had my doubts about this series and to be truthful, I had found it while looking at a 'yaoi list for 2017'. I had read the comments of said listing to find out it wasn't yaoi but I still decided to look into it. From the cover art, I felt it was visually appealing and upon reading what it was about, I felt it could be done well or be total trash.\r\nSo I took the gamble, and give this show a try. Now, I was going to attempt watching it subbed, as I do most anime, but I had not been up tospeed to reading subs as of late to when I found there was a dub, I decided to give that a shot so that I may also give my thoughts on that as well, as many people wish to know how dubs turn out.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I think I will talk of that first. As far as dubs go, this was fairly well done. The voice fit nicely, and none were grating on the ears. If you saw the face, it was often the voice you'd think would be there. I will admit that at times, the voices did sound strained, it was mostly when the character should be shouting but were holding their voice back in a more controlled tone. When you think of the setting of the story, it does make sense. Royalty needing to control their emotions so as to not show their true self. So, aside this little bit, I still think it fit in some extent.\\n\r\nIf dubs had a rating section, I'd give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the show itself. The story was very engaging, it often had me on the edge of my seat and waiting for more. I wanted to learn more, about the princes, and the royal tutor himself. Even the King, who was a character all of his own and not simply a slid in side character, so to say.\\n\r\nStory has been giving a rating of 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very appealing to the eye, having stunning effects and yet keeping a simple and yet elegant touch. I have to say I found myself admiring the hair, both in design and color. As an artist myself, it has inspired me to try and do a similar style.\\n\r\nArt has been given a rating of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and effects of the show are very well done. I have to say that I did find myself either humming or singing along with the opening. It fits splendidly with the tone and feel of the show. And it didn't get tedious so that one could listen to it every episode it comes on. The ending was also very pleasing but I have to say that I did not pay as much attention to it, as it had a common feel to it that I often overlook.\\n\r\nSound has been given an 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all diverse and widely presented. No one had a standard personality, every one was unique and different. Even the guards who were simply side characters. I felt a connection with each that easily made the show more enjoyable. And there was clear development, you can easily see it happen with each new episode. And by the final one, you can see how they've all grown.\\n\r\nCharacter has been given a rating of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it very much, from it's stunning story telling to it elegant flow of events and character development. It was a experience to learn about each character, important and not. And any new character that popped up, always gave an explanation or an idea of what their role could entail. It had me on edge and in depth from start to finish.\\n\r\nEnjoyment has been given a rating of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 10 for a thorough presentation and well thought out story. So much so that I will have to look into the manga now that the final credits had rolled. I must learn more about the characters and their world, for it had caught my attention. I hope this review has helped in your choice to watch it. \\n\\n\r\n~Crusnik",

But as it went on, I started to enjoy this a lot more then I thought I did.. Yes it does have that ' fan service' feel too it, but don't be scared to try this out, its not cringy, every episode was entertaining, there wasn't any boring filler episodes.. Every episode will make yousmile, laugh and cry. \\n\r\nThe most part of this anime I have to say I loved the most, where all the characters. none of them fell into a shadow  of another, all characters where equally interesting, every prince had there own unique personality. I thought I knew who my favouite prince was, but after competing it all, I just cannot decide! \\n\r\nOf course the main character Heine's was just fantastic. He showed very little personality, but he just gave so much.. \\n\r\nThis anime will give you a lot of feels, and make you appreciate things more and to also judge less!\\n\\n",

I never thought that I will like this anime this much. \r\nThe main focus of this anime is definitely its characters. Each character is very relatable. Although their personalities are still pretty cliche but I still love it. I didn't find any characters in this anime to be annoying. Every character has their childish side and this anime shows how they develop to become a full noble prince.\r\nThe OP and ED theme are both catchy enough. The visuals are nothing special. The dance sequence by the voice actors for the EDtheme is pretty well choreographed and fluid. For an idol fan like me, they did impress me. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation done by studio Brain's Base is spectacular and detailed. They put a lot of effort into the last episode and I love it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending for this series is very satisfying and the developments given to the characters didn't went to waste. Although the ending is predictable, nevertheless they still did a good job at executing it, \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime if you like anime like Assassination Classroom or you just want a heartwarming SOL anime.",

Well not unique or original. We had Great Teacher Onizuka and Denpa kyoushi before this.\r\nArt -  7\r\nThe art is decent. well.. Good for a comedy anime. the chibi moments were funny.\r\nSound - 8\r\nOP-ED was okay.\r\nVoice acting is really good considering the fact that most of main characters are voiced by fairly new voice actors and those who have not voiced many roles.\r\nMusic-7\r\nOST is composed by Keiji Inai. The man behind the soundtrackof \"Is it Wrong to pick girls in a Dungeon\" and \"Heavy Object\". The soundtrack is decent for a comedy anime and fits the atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8 \\n\r\nI really like the main character. he's kind of overpowered. All four Princes have their own unique personalities and get good development throughout the series. which is quite surprising coming from comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this series. Even though it's tagged as a comedy it has equal amount of good drama. This series is a mix of Barakamon, Denpa Kyoushi and G.T.O...

            "content": "When I was scoping out the Spring 2017 Anime line-up, The Royal Tutor didn\u2019t really hit my radar. From the synopsis and the preview graphics that had been released, I honestly thought it was going to be a very cheesy show with some strong boy-love vibes. As a person who doesn\u2019t usually go for the boy-love genre, I wasn\u2019t interested in it at all. But something about it, and I have no fricking clue what, told me to at least watch the first episode so I could confirm my feelings. I\u2019m really glad that I listened to that tiny, not-so-weird-at-all-little-voice-in-my-head because this series ended upbeing surprisingly decent.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I began it I got a very strong Ouran High School Host Club aura from it. You\u2019ve got four boys who very quickly get unique names via our Heine-sensei, and they each have a relatively tropey persona. Initially, this made me very hesitant in watching the second episode. No offence towards Ouran, but this trope is so fucking overdone that I didn\u2019t want to deal with another show that revolved around it. Luckily, my fascination with the mysterious tutor outweighed my frustration and I continued onwards.\\n\\n\r\nMy expectations for the show started to grow, but didn\u2019t really turn into anything fantastic as I watched. Mid-way through the season when we still hadn\u2019t learned anything about the Royal Tutor\u2019s past, I began to feel highly sceptical about the writing. I knew that we were running out of episodes and time for a good, fluid explanation of how a teacher could also be so skilled in combat as to equal a highly-seasoned warrior. There were some very vague hints, but not much else to go on. I also found there to be a slight imbalance on the attention given to each of the four boys, where a couple of them received a lot more screen time than the others. These two aspects actually filled me with a bit of anxiously negative anticipation. I\u2019ve seen it many times before. A show starts off wonderfully, but then it overreaches and falls terribly short in its execution. Luckily, that didn\u2019t really happen with The Royal Tutor.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s far from being a glorious masterpiece, it has a decent number of facets that make it quite an enjoyable anime series. The first are the characters themselves. We get to learn about each one of the boys and why they are so vehemently against tutors and education. The reasons aren\u2019t superficial. They are laced with insecurities and bad experiences. Occasionally a reason for one son will seem minor in comparison to another, but it just adds an empathetic dimension to their personas that makes you want to root for their success. I like that these boys aren\u2019t perfect. Their flaws make them that much more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe tutor himself is someone who reminded me of Onizuka from the anime series GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka. He is a man who took the time to understand the underlying issues that kids have in order to better tackle them with a fitting solution. Heine and Onizuka knew that kids aren\u2019t going to respond to a one-size-fits-all solution. Each kid is different with unique issues and problems. To help said kids, you really have to be willing to get to know them and distinguish them as individuals in a way most people don\u2019t want to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I mentioned earlier I was worried about the imbalance of screen-time for the boys? It turns out that some of the boys needed the extra attention because their problems needed that extra support. It also played very well towards plot progression because the imbalance was created to fit the unique issues and insecurities that each of the sons were going through. For example, one of the kids is a very shy and timid person with a fearsome outwardly appearance. He wasn\u2019t shown nearly as much as I had hoped (he became my favourite character because I could relate to him like you wouldn\u2019t believe) because of this demeanour. It wouldn\u2019t have made sense for him to be sprouting up all over the place, unlike the youngest brother who\u2019s a social whore.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes in the show were also a bit comforting. Most of it had to deal with accepting yourself for who you are, even if other\u2019s can\u2019t accept you. It was dealt with in a positive way that doesn\u2019t negatively portray awkward social skills, or fetishise issues involving a lower intelligence, etc. etc. I like that the changes that the boys make are gradual instead of just being an instant fix as soon as they comprehend the lessons they\u2019re learning. There\u2019s also a bit of focus on not judging anyone by their appearance or initial mannerisms because there\u2019s a huge chance that you will be wrong about them, friendships come in all shapes and sizes, and soft things will always be cute.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these elements made for a pleasant watching experience, however, it does have its faults. The humour, while being kooky and a light-hearted means at softening tough topics, is really predictable at times and felt cheesy and out-dated. The story in its entirety is of average quality and can make you feel pretty indifferent about whether you\u2019re having a good time or not. Although I do like the characters, nothing within the The Royal Tutor truly made me anticipate the next episode with impatient, passionate glee. I felt so apathetic about having to wait a week for new content, or when the content finally did arrive I\u2019d watch everything else before really getting to this. The only thing that I was super fricking curious about was Heine\u2019s past, which was a small bit of a let-down because the morsels of clues left in the wake of one episode to the next made it sound like Heine would have a really badass history. Instead the truth was disappointing and anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself is pretty much typical; nothing extraordinary or breath-taking. It\u2019s clean and seemingly well-developed. I found the outdoors scenery to be more pleasant than the interiors. There are a lot more details that go into creating the environment and atmospheres amidst nature than within buildings. We see this with the mansion, or palace, as it just felt like an atypical reproduction of a European mansion that seems quite standard in anime with such structures. Within a local caf\u00e9 in town, we get a similar situation. The caf\u00e9 does look to be quite large and it is nicely presented, but it doesn\u2019t encapsulate the same sort of attention to details that the natural atmospheres do.\\n\\n\r\nMid-way through the series, we do get a whisper of a small plot that\u2019s being hatched to affect who will inherit the throne if and when the king passes on. This is something that felt extremely out of place to me for multiple reasons. Firstly, it randomly just pops up at the finale of an episode or two and then isn\u2019t brought up again until a few episodes later. Secondly, when it is brought up, it\u2019s only for a couple of minutes; not nearly enough to make any sort of impact. It makes one last appearance during the final episodes, and it honestly felt like the only reason it was tossed into the series to begin with was to add some tension and intrigue to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The Royal Tutor is a good, fun average anime to check out. The cast is engaging and you can\u2019t help but feel for them in certain situations. The story is very chill and simple, as is the animation and music. But if you\u2019re in the mood for something that\u2019s going to blow your mind, or totally make your jaw drop, then this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\n6 tortes outta 10!\\n",

            "content": "This was my favourite anime of the season and is pretty high up there overall. While at the beginning I thought it would be lacking in plot and just be about cute princes the plot development was great and kept me on the edge of my seat.\r\nMore into the plot I've given the story a 10 as, the backstories of each prince and Heine himself are great, they actually make sense in terms of storytelling and characterisation while allowing the plot itself to develop. The underlying issue about who is trying to sabotage the princes and the lack of knowledge about Heine's past keeps thestory interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline allowed each character to develop while viewers gain insight into their past and the challenges they must overcome.  I really loved this aspect as not many anime choose to have a holistic focus on so many main characters. In terms of each character individually, they were all very well fleshed out and character relationships were great. Due to this I've also given characters a 10.\\n\\n\r\nI've given the art style an 8 because while it was good to look at, and tied the story together it was nothing amazing. Even so, the character designs and overall aesthetic looked great.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the sound was a 7, I'm basing this mainly on the introduction and ending songs as there wasn't much music throughout, or not that I noticed much. Both introduction and ending song were great and I encourage viewing them, they fit with the theme of the anime and worked very well. What drags this score down is the lack of sound elsewhere. While I typically don't focus on sound and did't notice anything bad about in the anime sound wasn't really used to change the mood.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, watching it was fun and the numerous cliff hangers made waiting for each new episode a challenge. I've given the enjoyment value a 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs such I really recommend watching this anime if you get a chance. While it seems aimed towards a female audience don't let character design fool you, the storyline and character development make up for any issues. Overall I've rated this anime a 9 and will hope for a second season.",

I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible.\r\nFirst off, don't let the fact that it has an all male cast taint your view. This is not yaoi or shounen ai.\r\nThe story is pretty simple, there are four prince brothers who are in desperate need of an education before they are eligible for the throne.\r\nThe story starts when their latest tutor shows up, will he leave in a hurry like the others before him? or will he be able to do the impossible and mold these young men into proper candidatesfor the throne.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this show. It has stunning visuals that use light reflection in such a beautiful way. The background art is beautiful, the characters all have their own unique look. There is also a good amount of chibi used in the humorous moments that really sell the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something fun to watch with a good amount of humor and some emotional moments, you should give it a try.\\n\\n",
