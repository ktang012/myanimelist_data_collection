            "content": "From the time we are young, are parents all/ teach us certain things. No matter what these deal with, there will usually be a very common theme: what society wants us to do.\r\nYes, from a very young age, most of us will be told to continue the flow of society's ideas, and to never question them. But, what makes these ideas right?\r\nThis is the question that we are faced with while watching Arakawa Under the Bridge, a story about, well, living under a bridge. A bridge under which almost no laws will ever reach you, with the possible exception of public indecency...\r\nWe see a romancethat blossoms under this bridge, as Ko, a man whose parents who have installed far beyond just the rule that society is always correct, is pulled into entering a relationship with Nino, a person who claims to be a Venusian, on his belief that anything that anyone does is solely for gain and must be repaid. This belief that his father installed in him, however, quickly begins to fade as he subconsciously begins to reject the notion that society is always correct, and slowly embraces his new life under the bridge.\\n\\n\r\nOur story continues, with him continuing to meet more people under the bridge, and slowly coming to realize, yet again, that he can't really know what exactly is \"right\" and \"wrong\". Indeed, our story continues to progress in this vein, with Ko growing to accept the actions of the others all living under the bridge.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the residents of this area also have to have a job (with the acceptation of a couple), and they all help each other in whatever sane ways they can, before their actions degrade into insanity, one of the real main sources for comedy in Arakawa Under the Bridge. Indeed, one of the most enjoyable elements of the show was all of our unique characters interacting in unique ways.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these unique characters served to bring something special to the show; they all served a function for the community, while also bringing interesting elements the the show. They all have some kind of eccentricity that is very much ingrained in their character, or at least something that would render them unable to live in a regular society. These eccentricities were again, the source of nearly 100% of the comedy for the show, and the main thing that kept it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what really disappoints is how often the characters are left completely untouched in terms of development. We don't get any back story on some of the characters, and on others, we only get tantalizing hints. This is, for some, the most irritating element in the entire show; we can almost never figure out the pasts of some of the most unique characters that we have ever seen. It is truly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nIf lack of characters development holds down the show the most, the next most irritating element is the art style. As it's shaft, we can really expect to see insanity in the rat as well, and so we do. It's really quite irritating to those who don't enjoy the Shaft animation style to b subjected to these incredibly well drawn scenes being forced down to mediocrity by terrible illustrations, which can really limit and interfere with the show for those who are not true connoisseurs of the Shaft art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound also was only a slight break from the weaker elements of this show. It was really fair: there wasn't anything that really weighed it down , but there wasn't anything that really aided it in this department either. The voice actors were average, the sound effects were average; everything really failed to go beyond the average bound. Our opening and ending were also really, well, average, leaving the anime with average sound.\\n\\n\r\nWhile sound did not contribute to my enjoyment of the show, it certainly didn't hurt it. This show was highly enjoyable to anyone who liked the style of comedy, wasn't valued away by Shaft's art, and in general likes comedies and romances. I had a great deal of enjoyment from this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, now the question is, will you enjoy it? The best way to determine that is, especially if it sounds interesting, watch a couple of episodes. By that point, you will have gotten a good taste of the random art interferences and random characters that contribute to the general eccentricity of the show. You will have also seen the types of jokes told; if they seem like they'll get old, then you should leave. The jokes will often repeat, especially if the are part of a character's intrinsic personality. In other words, you will like this show if you like the first couple of episodes, aren't thrown off by the random art you see there, like the characters, and don't mind the general premise of the show in this regard. If it sounds interesting, give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nSo long Arakawa Under the Bridge. It's been awesome!!",

            "content": "Charming. This is what I constantly thought of when watching Arakawa Under The Bridge. Despite the insane plot and the ridiculous characters, this show was full of charm. Whether there was a hint of deeper meanings between it's comedic outtakes, or its abundance of heartwarming scenes, there never once was a dull moment during my time at under the Arakawa Bridge!\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Arakawa Under The Bridge is something that tends to turn many people off due to it's nonlinear approach. The story goes as follows; a guy who believes in never owing anybody anything gets his life saved after falling off a bridge bya strange girl. This creates a debt the size of well, his life! In order to repay this girl, he must show her what it means to love thus making him her lover. This sudden turn of events begins as he lives with the girl under the bridge where she and a bunch of other strange folk coincidentally happens to live! Sounds a lot to swallow? Don't worry, the story is way easier to grasp than what it seems.You see, to show someone what it means to love is such a universal topic that the entire series tends to be just about the guy and all the residents of Arakawa Bridge doing miscellaneous things each episodes. The series is jam packed with tons of comedy but also without realizing it, full of many other things. This leads me back to what I previously said; this show is FULL of charm. What Arakawa does best is to add heavy themes such as Acceptance, Regret, or being yourself while still keeping things to a lighthearted, comedic level. I loved when a funny situation would occur but at that exact same time, the main protagonist may learn something new about himself, or slowly, the girl would realize bit by bit what it truly means to love. Because of this, swallowing the insanity surrounding the show is much less a chore and much more a joy!\\n\\n\r\nDespite this: although I found the story one of the greatest aspects of the show, the opposite can be said for some. For starters, as previously said, this story is non linear to a tee. There is no single episode dedicated to, \"What it means to love.\" Instead the story is really told through the character's every day encounters and actions with the members of the Arakawa River. While I found it interesting, this in turn can make people not want to watch the show if they were looking for a more direct plot. Furthermore, when the story did try to create a straightforward scenario near the last quarter of the series, I found that to be the weakest part of the series and I was anxiously waiting when that encounter can be settled and got back to more random tasks with the residents. Also, the outrageous surrounding of the show is of course not for everyone. This is indeed a WAAY over the top comedy, with no bars held back and if that's not your cup of tea, than this show won't change your mind otherwise.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art of the show in general would be classed as standard fair for the anime at that time. However, since \"Shaft\" were the developers for this show, (Madoka Magica, Bakemonogatari) you can expect to get some eye popping, over the top art work. the opening theme is especially easy to notice; full of vivid colors and beautiful scenery. Overall, the outrageous art of the show only added to fit  the whole tone the show was trying to portray. Quickly though, the live action segments with the Kappa at the end of each episode is probably some of the most hilarious scenes I have ever seen. PERIOD.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound of Arakawa under the bridge is not anything spectacular. There were no background music that particulary stood out to me, and instead I found myself simply engrossed in the dialogue to even notice. The opening and endings on the other hand is definitely worth mentioning. The opening theme of the show, Venus To Jesus is a light, moderate pace tune which is easily a good listen and can be enjoyed without any context. It definitely fits the lightheartedness of the show. The ending, Sakasama Bridge is a personal favorite. this once again, is a light, moderate paced song, but the melancholic feeling it gives off, really helps to describe  the feel of those more heartfelt scenes in the show. Plus it's by Suneohair, whose also done works in shows such as, Honey and Clover! Last, without spoiling anything, there's a song titled, \"Losers Wail\" and if the title alone doesn't convince you how funny it is, than prepare to wail yourself if you do get the chance to listen to it!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTalking about the characters in Arakawa under the bridge is difficult. You see, each resident of the Arakawa River is strange in it's own way, but only adds to the charm. For instance, you have a a Church Sister (who's not really a sister) that came from the military and acts like the Terminator, but with more dialogue.  Not satisfied? You also have a Rock Star with a Star for a head, as well as Kappa (A frog like person). At first, these different personalities might be unsettling, but really, these Character really help to bring this story to life. You see, one of the main themes that Arakawa Under The Bridge tries to tell is acceptance no matter who you are. Despite these crazy appearances, I found myself genuinely liking these characters because of just how well the chemistry these social misfits had with one another. Whether they had a comedic relationship or a serious one, I enjoyed each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nA flaw to these characters however is that they're really isn't that much character development. Aside from our main lovers, Ko and Nino; despite how much screen time the rest of the cast received, they remained static from start to beginning. You may get a bit of story from the individual characters, but they don't really grow as a person. If there was a particular person you might not have liked then unfortunately they will most likely stay that way until it's comedic conclusion. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge is INSANE! (In the good way of course!) Going into the show, I was a bit skeptical due to the amount of pure outragousness it posed. While it was still there, everything seemed bearable and in fact, better than what I expected it to be. I was also anxious to figure out what the crazy people of under the Arakawa Bridge would do next, and even though it's not genre breaking, it's originality and heart should be something that grabs viewers and drops them into unfamiliar, but wonderful territory! Welcome to Arakawa Under the Bridge!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Never judge a book by its cover, or in anime's case, never judge an anime by the first episode. Arakawa under the Bridge started out (for me) as a fairly pretentious and rather bland series, and I fully expected that I would be ready to drop it by around episode 5 or maybe even sooner. Now that isn't saying the first episode was bad by any means, it just didn't stand out at all to me, it was a regular opening describing the 2 leads and giving a good amount of exposition. As the episodes progressed, I slowly began to enjoy Arakawa more and more,and began to see something special in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nLets start with the characters. Arakawa has a vast array of characters, adding new ones almost every episode to add to the viewers pleasure. Every character is, at first glance, rather one dimensional. As is standard with most comedies, every character will have some sort of \"gag\" around them that is generally hyped upon every time you meet that character. For example, the main character has an issue with owing people favors, and as such, there are many scenes in which he will need to rely on someone and will go to any great lengths to repay the favour, and really almost every character is like this in their own way. Now really, for a comedy this isn't a bad thing, the laughs may be a little obvious but its still always funny to see the guy freak out at having to pay back Nino for saving his life or whatever the favor of the moment is. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there is something peculiarly special about the cast of Arakawa. As the series progresses, little \"hints\" thrown about a lot, about the past of the character in question. This is especially prominent in Nino, the heroine, but is noticeable in many of the side characters as well (Sister's apparent past war ties, or the school kids apparently being experimented on). Whenever I notice one of these hints, I like to imagine what was it that brought this person to live under a bridge. What was his / her past life truly like? Was it a long journey to finally find this home? These questions build up and will probably remain forever un-answered but that's just part of the charm. The bit of mystery surrounding each character really helps build a strong connection with them, and greatly increases the viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nOne final thing that really showed me a better side to Arakawa is the plot of the thing. Now you could say, \"But how is watching the daily lives of some quirky characters living under a bridge that exciting. As far as anime goes, its not exactly revolutionary.\" And while this is true, the plot isn't going to wow anyone, does one thing right, and that's make one reflect on their own life. As you sink into this show, you begin to see that a lot of it is comparing normal life to the random lifestyle that the folks under the bridge follow. This is particularly emphasized by the fact that the protagonist is a Rich boy at the head of society. When comparing the two, one starts to realize that maybe this insane, random lifestyle of weird people in funny masks is really the less \"insane\" of the two. It shows us, that really, life should be lived how you want it to be, not whats necessarily best for you. We see that Kuo is at the head of the world, rich, handsome, with a silver tongue, he seems to have it all. And yet, which does he enjoy more, teaching under this god forsaken bridge, or following in his father's footsteps. Well its only 7 episodes in as I write this review so only time can tell, but I can be certain that this is the main message of the anime: Look at yourself and decide what you want to do... then do it! \\n\\n\r\nNow no show is perfect and of course Arakawa is no exception. The music isn't that exciting, and the art is a little weird at times (but still pretty decent). While the cast is many, the amount does bite it in the behind a little bit due to being only 13 episodes long, meaning that each character doesn't get quite as much screen time as one may like. The humor for the most part is funny, with a few exceptions, but most likely you'll get a good few chuckles out of it by the end. If I had to hate one thing about this anime, I'd say its the constant cuts to a close up of Kuo's eye... seriously its kinda unsettling whenever they do that.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough rambling from this coot, I'll finish off by saying that I will always recommend this anime no matter how bad the ending may turn out to be. Its funny, the characters are lovable, the premise is interesting, and overall, it holds together extremely well. Enjoy",

            "content": "'Arakawa Under the Bridge' is about Ichinomiya Kou, an elite (someone who holds a high ranking position or works in a blue-chip company. A \"winner\" in Japanese society) who's been taught to never get indebted to anyone, gets careless one day over Arakawa  and gets saved by a girl. The girl's name is Nino, who turns out to be a denpa-kei (people with \"overactive imagination\" or nutcase, e.g. Nodame) who claims to be from Venus, and doesn't want anything in return. After a long debate, she tells Ichinomiya that there is one thing that he can do for her: \"Let me fall in love.\"And so, Ichinomiya starts living under the bridge in Arakawa as Nino's boyfriend in order to repay his debt.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa (\"Rough River\" in kanji) is a major river that runs through Tokyo. This is the river you have to cross to get to Saitama, and I can tell you it's very wide river that you do not want to fall into.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nI must admit that my expectation for this show after the first episode was really high because the setting of an elite suddenly living the poor man's lifestyle, and the general atmosphere was really similar to 'Koi ni Ochitara', a dorama series that's very dear to me. I found 'Arakawa's setting to be very intriguing with both Ichinomiya and Nino having interesting personality, and a funny encounter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and character setting had a great potential. This show could've gone three directions:\\n\\n\r\n      1. Focus on Ichinomiya and Nino's relationship as a romance anime.\\n\r\n      2. Focus on Ichinomiya alone for discovery of small joys in life and gradual change of character belief, slice of life.\\n\r\n      3. Focus on side characters for pure comedy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nInstead, they went for no focus or central theme. Just a bunch of weirdos doing random things in the riverbank with very limited story or character development. Humor in this show was mostly physical, unintelligent slapstick, but wasn't really funny because the pacing is too slow for that. The side characters were a ridiculous bunch that had no distinct personalities that made them particularly lovable. They were all cardboard characters who received zero character developments. In the end, it seemed like the author was trying too hard to make unique characters just to make this show different.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say episodes 1, 4, 8, 12 where they focused on romance (#1) or slice of life (#2) were very strong and moving episodes, but otherwise all fillers. Story and character development was way too slow to be interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 6/10\\n\r\nGeneral animation by Shaft, there are lots of eye zoom-ins, but otherwise nothing out of the ordinary. The peaceful atmosphere of Arakawa riverside with vivid, light colors was visually pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality was very inconsistent though. Episode 1 and some slow, dramatic scenes have movie-grade background detail and attractive characters, but the rest is super-simple (difference especially noticeable in sky grass texture).\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters seem somewhat realistic despite simplicity. The style is really similar to 'Nodame Cantabile', but the character designs for 'Arakawa' is actually better. The rest, while they are supposed to look out of place... never grew on me. It just seemed like a cosplay contest in a really unlikely place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nRidiculous number of big-name and experienced cast, even for the minor characters. Overall, voice acting is pretty good, but it doesn't really sound like any of them really put in too much effort.\\n\\n\r\nBGM is pretty average, but used in all the right places.\\n\\n\r\nTheme songs, on the other hand, were excellent. OP was cute and fun with retro graphics that worked really well to boost Nino's character. ED is a really good song that makes you reflect back on the episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\r\n'Arakawa Under the Bridge' had the potential to become a really touching and inspiring show if only they just focused on romance or slice of life. Instead, it became something I can't exactly describe, in a bad way.\\n\r\nSomething went really wrong with series composition that ruined a good original work.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much only 4 episodes of material was in the first season, dragging on to the next. This is one of a rare non-prime-time anime series that I actually wished was shorter. I will be watching the next season in hope of a major turnaround.",

            "content": "So, this show is a random humor enthusiast's heaven. It is sometimes funny, sometimes stupid, and often both. \r\nThat could be the end of my review right there, but there's always more to talk about. For example, the art. The art is great. It is produced by shaft, directed by Akiyuki Shinbou, and is typical of Shinbou/shaft. If you are unfamiliar with shaft/Shinbou style artwork (most famous for Bakemonogatari), it is basically a collage of unconventional anime styles, that shifts around depending on the story. Lots of random fast cuts to land/city-scapes, sudden changes in the detail of animation, etc. It all is used ina way that seems to compliment the zany and random story. Also, in a great innovation, we now have windmill hair!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fun, even though the lyrics are silly. I'm a huge fan of the OP, not just for the song, but for the artwork that goes with it. The characters? Well, they are a bit cardboard, more or less used as gags to perpetuate the random humor. The story? Once again, just used to perpetuate the random humor. There is an underlying message in this show, that we don't have to do what society tells us, and sometimes it's better just to be ourselves, no matter how crazy that is :) Not a particularly deep message, but it goes well with the focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Well, here's our problem. Everything in this show is sacrificed for the sake of random humor. Now personally, I wasn't too amused. I have trouble finding stuff amusing just because it is random. I mean, sure, when it's completely left-field, randomness is funny, but in this case it became a constant barrage of randomness and ceased to be terribly funny. It was still often funny despite this, but just as often it was stupid. My brain definitely turned off as I watched this.\\n\\n\r\nMany have recommended it to all Bakemonogatari fans, and I can't really agree with that. Bakemonogatari was a much smarter, character driven, and creative anime. Many fans will be dissapointed. That said, if you like Bakemonogatari, you might like this, so give it a chance. If you like random humor, then you will love this show. If you only like intelligent anime, then this show isn't for you.",

            "content": "Often times people like to think of themselves as \u201cthe normal one.\u201d \r\nAt least this is the case for Kou, a self-proclaimed part of the \u201celite.\u201d From the day he was born Kou was taught to never be indebted to someone. For the most part Kou does a pretty good job of it too, that is until he loses his pants and falls into the Arakawa River. Now we have one indebted Kou, and a savior named Nino that wants Kou to help her experience love. He accepts, and begins living under the Arakawa Bridge with a group of bizarre social misfits. \r\nIt sounds abit absurd I know; but this absurdity is what makes it so great. Arakawa Under the Bridge uses a unique mix of absurdism and slapstick humor with a few deeper messages added along the way to bring you a really nice comedic experience overall. The story itself is lacking as show isn't episodic but can appear to be that way at times because of the absurd things happening. The story really takes the backseat and suffers to let everything shine through in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the artwork found throughout this series... well, this is SHAFT we are talking about here. They are a studio known for their odd visuals and cinematography. You know, the people that brought you Bakemonogatari and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Although it is less experimental in art style than the previously mentioned series, it is still up to standard with any of their works and at times can even make for some really nice scenery porn. \\n\\n\r\nThe Arakawa Bridge is called home by a village chief that thinks he is a Kappa, a killer nun, a literal rock-star, a Martian, two runaway guinea pigs from a laboratory, and of course the main character Kou. All of the characters are as absurd as they sound and maybe even more. They are the focal point in which many, if not all of the jokes in Arakawa come from. As you can tell the cast of characters found throughout Arakawa are not your average run of the mill people, and although they lack depth they are definitely the highlight of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Arakawa Under the Bridge is suiting. The soundtrack wasn\u2019t mind-bogglingly amazing but it was still good. The background music enhanced the comedic moments so they did their job quite nicely. The opening of Arakawa Under the Bridge is definitely more satisfying visually than musically and I felt the same way about the ending too. As far as sound goes the voice acting was definitely the highlight, the voice actors did an absolutely incredible job making the jokes told in the show that much more memorable.   \\n\\n\r\nIt is true that people often think of themselves as \u201cthe normal one.\u201d But after watching Arakawa Under the Bridge I think it is safe to say that normality is relative. It constantly wears this theme on its sleeve while presenting is odd, yet surprisingly pleasant form of absurdist comedy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll be the first to say that I don\u2019t like absurdist comedies. I have just never found them that funny, but Arakawa Under the Bridge was a pleasant surprise. I found myself laughing from the beginning of one episode to the end, which is a huge win in my book. I strongly believe this anime is a must watch for all comedy lovers. \\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory- 4\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nCharacters- 8\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nOverall- 7.4\\n",

The humor can be hit and miss, so it's hard to recommend this show after one or two episodes. But I like the voice acting - Maaya Sakamoto (Haruhi from Ouran Host Club, Ryougi Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai, Lightning from JPN FFXIII, etc.) acts out Nino, and I enjoy her brusque voice so I'll be following this series for a couple more episodes.\r\nOne last tip: There's a reason why Nutbladder's subs appear first, and that group's work is clearly a speed sub. I'm hardly in the place to criticize anyone'swork, and speed is a factor too, but I would watch another group's fansubs for better translation of finer grammatical points. I'm watching with Formula subs right now and rewatching the first ten minutes of the first episode, there's a pretty vast difference in quality. I haven't checked out other groups' fansubs, but I'll eventually get around to it and let you guys know.",

            "content": "5.0/10\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThere are certain tropes that exist within the realm of anime, well, less obviously, comedy anime. Said tropes seem to inhabit the majority of these programs and, to my dismay, negatively influence my enjoyment of these products. Tropes are not inherently bad, as they are a kind of backbone for every piece of entertainment. However, certain tropes you, as a viewer, can grow to harbor an inner disdain for. \r\nComedy anime, especially of the romantic nature, tends to exude and indulge in these tropes to the point where they instantly put me off of a show. One of said tropes is the idea that ourprotagonist needs to have some kind of moral or ethical restriction or rule imposed upon them by nothing but their own will or experience, which often rings hollow since it is such a preposterous idea, to begin with. This trope, I'll agree, is present in a lot of anime, especially Shounen action, but it also persists in comedy for no reason other than to create over-the-top situations, naturally. \\n\\n\r\nThis is just one of those tropes that always rubs me the wrong way because it never breeds situations that I believe or find funny, and while comedy is generally unbelievable, there does need to be an air of verisimilitude that inhabits the scene for it to work in context. \\n\\n\r\nWith this knowledge, we enter \"Arakawa Under the Bridge\". \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Character, Delivery, Execution]\\n\\n\r\nThe trope here is utilized of course. Our protagonist, Kou Ichinomiya, kindly nick-named \"Rec\" or \"Recruit\" early on in the series, is a rich business elite who grew up with a tough, no-frills father that seemed to not care much about him at all. He taught him one lesson, to never take favors from anyone as you never want to be indebted. \\n\\n\r\nSo here stands Rec, on a bridge, pantsless, and wondering what he did to deserve to be stripped by a group of schoolboys. Here comes Nino, fishing his pants up from a hanging railing and handing them over to him. At first he rejects her assistance but then comes around to accepting her favor and is therefore forced to become indebted to her. She asks him to be her lover and well... you can probably guess where this goes. He is forced to be the lover of this surprisingly attractive strange girl who lives under the bridge. Woe is Rec. \\n\\n\r\nUnder the bridge, Rec meets a group of equally strange and zany characters that have all kinds of odd interests and hobbies. Ranging from a man in a Kappa costume who believes he's actually a Kappa, serving as the chieftain of this little group, to a man who is perpetually in love with Nino whilst also wearing a star-mask and making bad music. The designs here are all distinct and quite good, actually, specifically the gun-toting nun and peppy, yet clumsy farmer girl. This group of somewhat loveable and oafish characters don't get much development, as the series' thirteen episode stretch is more oriented around sketch comedy. \\n\\n\r\nUnrelated skits backend each episode. These episodes are split up into multiple \"chapters\", each one signifying a different theme or concept and play out in one to ten-minute sketches that don't correlate with one another until the main psuedo-arc of the series comes into play. It's a cute format that is in-line with something like Nichijou, a favorite of mine. Unlike Nichijou, \"Under the Bridge\" doesn't have as much diversity or prowess in its execution, and unfortunately, a lot of the comedy falls flat. More on that later. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, these colorful characters are not at all detailed enough, in my opinion. It's not like they have to be since there are plenty of comedy series' out there that don't have three-dimensional characters, but they make up for that in pure wit and amazing comedic chops. With \"Under the Bridge\", there is a specific effort for emotional moments and moments of actual romance, and unfortunately, they all fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is sad because the series is definitely at its best when it is being funny. Even if it isn't always funny. The first episode, also, doesn't feel like anything else in the series because it is substantially better paced and entertaining than anything else in this series, which is somewhat low on highlights and more just showing blips of inspiration a few moments of joy every episode. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Comedy in Anime]\\n\\n\r\nSince I don't have too much to say about this series apart from \"it's okay\" and \"occasionally funny\" and \"somewhat unremarkable\", I rather focus on the broad experience I've had with comedy anime and the \"style\" is is often off-putting for me. I don't even think it is a cultural thing since there are plenty of anime that have had me laugh and there are plenty of Japanese films that are equally hilarious as some of the better productions coming out of Hollywood.\\n\\n\r\nNo, it's something more. It feels like so much comedy in this series, as well as a lot of the comedy anime I've seen hits the same way, with the same delivery, and the same kinds of shots and effects and even voice acting. Honestly, a lot of it seems very repetitive to an almost ludicrous level. \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the way humor is handled at all. Jokes seem to go on for far too long, their punchlines run their course and instead of cutting, they either repeat the punchline or exposit the punchline, which makes it far too obvious and very clunky to sit through. It happens a lot. For example, a scene would lead up to a pretty decent punchline, and then, for no reason other than to explain to the viewer what is happening, the main character or whoever else would just yell out exactly what the punchline was.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I call 'reactionary humor', where the writers try to add another moment of comedic timing and delivery through a character's reaction to the piece of comedy, however, it is so rarely funny. Especially since it is delivered the same way every damn time. It's always yelled loudly with a multi-colored background and action lines. It doesn't look good, it doesn't sound good, and quite honestly, it ruins the joke. \\n\\n\r\nThis problem persists throughout this series and throughout a lot of comedy anime because I guess a wacky face that I've seen a hundred times in a hundred different anime is enough to be a punchline now? So there's the problem, this odd, clashing style really detracts from the punchlines. I suppose it works for many, this very abrasive, loud, and reaction-based style of comedy. However, for me, it really doesn't do anything and \"Under the Bridge\" was brimming with it.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Aesthetic and Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThis is all solid. The SHAFT style is ever present. It feels a bit too much like Monogatari at times, but I suppose that style is what defines studio SHAFT at this point. It is especially jarring when the protagonist, Rec, is voiced by the same VA as Araragi from Monogatari. \\n\\n\r\nThe style here, while visually solid, isn't really necessary. I never felt the indulgent need for it, similar to Monogatari, and it very rarely actually affected the core of the show, which is the comedy. There are some pretty scenes, but in general, the entire show takes place in one, very green, very bridge-oriented location that isn't all too interesting after the first couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both solid, providing something that wasn't outstanding, but definitely is worth noting as a positive for this show's sound. Then again opening and endings in anime tend to blend together for me, so who am I to judge. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's okay. That's the best thing I can say about this series. There were stretches where I was bored and genuinely uninspired by what's happening on screen. There were moments where I enjoyed seeing these characters interact and seeing their little world grow, and there were, very rare moments of actual, laugh-out-loud comedy that was delivered well. Unfortunately, this makes for an unremarkable package that I don't see myself recommending to people who aren't already fans of anime-style reactionary comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing this series, one of my friends called it \"Monogatari-lite\", and in a way, it is. The style is not as interesting, neither are the characters, or the setting, or anything, really, but the presentation is in line with what SHAFT has done with Monogatari and I, for the life of me, can't figure out why. There is no reason to include this kind of aesthetic in a show like this, and SHAFT shouldn't be pigeon-holed into over-relying on their developed style, which was pioneered by Shinbou. They are perfectly capable of utilizing something different like with Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is solid, and the voice acting is generally really unremarkable. The most impressive voice work has to come from Chiwa Saito, who plays the cute young kid, Stella. Thi character is a brat and often changes metaphoric forms, which prompt the VA to have quite a few different inflections for this character that are not only endearing but are bordering on funny, too. \\n\\n\r\n\"Arakawa Under the Bridge\" is a fairly unremarkable series wrapped up in the guise of something better. The style doesn't seem to fit, although it is visually pleasing, and everything from the story to the characters tends to flatline more so than anything else. Even if the characters themselves are well-designed. The attempts at romance fall completely flat due to the totally ridiculous premise, which fits the show's comedic tone but doesn't actually make for a believable romance or likable romantic prospects. The father/son relationship is a bit more interesting but honestly isn't explored enough to call well-done. Overall, it's \"just there\" as a series that I think doesn't do enough to actually maintain interest through the meat of its execution, which is the humor and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is fine, although ill-fitting, and the music is decent, too. But ultimately, there's a dissonance between what works and what doesn't, and I will always find myself wishing that this series portrayed a more captivating world. \\n\\n",

I liked Bakemonogatari but hated Vampire Bund so when it was Arakawa's turn, I was quite apprehensive of what to expect but from the first episode, this series has surprised me with a twisted storyline and weird characters that turn weirder and weirder still - in a good way though. \r\nOf course, Hiroshi Kamiya and Maaya Sakomoto are total win under the skins of Rec and Nino. Being the main pair, they still have a lot of ground to cover around eachother as Nino's a Venusian(!) and Kou's a stickler for not being indebted. I even like the supporting characters: Star, Chief, Sister, Maria, Stella and P-ko - not in any particular order. \\n\\n\r\nThis is for those who enjoy something different that is much more situation driven rather than character driven.

            "content": "[Updated: Eps watched -5]\r\nSHAFT is the producer of Bakemonogatari, and uses similar presentation methods in this series. The problem is: Bakemonogatari is more of occult, suspense and mystery while Arakawa Under the Bridge is something like gag humour.\r\nNote: After ep 2, the anime seems to fare better in its own style.\r\nStory:6\r\nTo be honest ep 1 and 2 gave me a headache. A wide variety of characters introduced, the main characters were presented, and tons of poorly used impact-scenes. From ep 3-5 the story seems more smooth and less gag-likke. Which is good, since some fundamentals had finally been touched on.\r\nUnfortunately, too many characters had beenintroduced right from the start, some airtime for each side character sometimes are only a few secs or none at all. Control of characters were pretty good, although overall, the story just seems to be too unstable. Scenes sometimes skipped here and there, little coninuation at times and most importantly, travelling too much between gag, slice of life and romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nNormal for SHAFT I believe. Good graphics and animation. But why do bubbles seem to come out anywhere and everywhere? Eye scene is overused, reminds of Bakemonogatari. Certain impact (animation aspect) destroyed the mood for laughter (aka light mood). \\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\\n\r\nOP: Ep1-4's OP's animation was unique, and light, but made relatively no sense in contrast to the series' storyline. Song was good.  Ep 5\\n\r\ns OP seems to be made in a jokingly manner, but was really interesting, some ppl might download the scene and worship it (lols).\\n\\n\r\nED: Both animation and song were good. It introduces several characters from \"under the bridge\". \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was mostly good, but sometimes were over-done, especially the cries of shock from \"Recruit\". \\n\\n\r\nSound usage is gradually getting better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nInteresting. But interesting doesn't cut it. Most characters aren't unique in their own right (As in they are not defined by their personalities, more of their physical differences). But some character development has already being done on \"Recruit\", and his past slightly explored into. This is a huge bonus, since we will be seeing him often in the series.\\n\\n\r\nUp to episode 5, we can see some unique personalities, but as usual, side characters get very little scene coverage, as the storyline jumps here and there still. Bad thing here is that too many characters seem to be introduced, and some were rarely utilised. Character development seems to be slowing down.\\n\r\nYes, knowing their personalities is good, but I would prefer to see a deeper character formed than many shallow ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nUp to ep 2, I really didn't like it much. Cause of the very choppy manner the show was presented. A lot of things were unexplained, impact was used a bit too much, and most importantly, it seemed like serious gag humour.\\n\\n\r\nEp3-5 gradually included more serious scenes, and the story has become much stable (compared to till ep2). More work still needs to be done though, since this show is moving in a few ways, can't decide what genre is it focusing on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\r\nOverall, I do wonder how does Recruit live his outside world. Lol, in realistic terms that is completely impossible, since he's a CEO or something.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I may have wrote my previous review (up to ep 2) a bit too harshly. I do hope this updated review would give you readers a better insight into this series. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading;)",

            "content": "Comedy is a tough aspect to grade, since it is largely subjective in nature. Just because I find Kramer and Jerry arguing about the trajectory of someones spit on Seinfeld hilarious, doesn't mean others will. Likewise, just because someone else finds a guy walking into a woman's bath by incident and getting knocked into the stratosphere for it amusing, certainly doesn't mean I do. \r\nBut, and I think most other people will agree, some of the best comedy is stuff that actually has an underlying message to it. When humor can actively facilitate an overall message that the work in question has, then it allworks on multiple fronts. And, well, this is something that Arakawa Under The Bridge does well.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa starts with the protagonist, Ichinomiya Kou, standing on a bridge completely pants-less. It is here when he meets a rather strange girl known as Nino and it is also here where we learn of his fear of owing anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to anyone what so ever. It is readily apparent from the on set that Kou has some rather deep sitting issues with his father, almost a sort of phobia if you will.\\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. Arakawa is most definitely a comedy first and foremost, but themes such as running away from problems, parental issues, and so on are lightly, and rather effectively,  touched upon during the course of the series. But, it certainly never becomes heavy handed in this matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Arakawa is a treat with very well done character design, particularly Nino and the other female characters, and just overall interesting visual touches here and there. Shaft has the usual visual touch, but not quite as heavily as Sayanora Sensei, EF, or their other works. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, the musics generally pretty good. But, the voice work in particular is striking with some very big names in the series particularly Sugita Tomokazu (Haruhi, Gintama), Fujiwara Keiji (Baccano, FMA), and many more. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable, with pretty much every one of them having some sort of..personality quirk. Whether you have the cross dressing \"Sister\", The Kappa costume wearing Village Chief, The rockstar wanna be Star shaped mask wearing Hoshi, the insult throwing Maria, and so on..it's almost guaranteed that you'll find something to amuse you in some form.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my biggest issue with the series, the characters don't change and we just don't learn anything at all about the vast majority of them. Not that Kou doesn't try to learn, it's just that the other characters either avoid his questions or outright lie to him. It's arguable, of course, whether or not this is an actual fault or not...it's just the way these people live their lives and it effectively ties into the central plot point. But, it still hurt my enjoyment a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nAt it's heart Arakawa Under The Bridge is a sort of coming of age story in which Kou tries to come out from under his fathers shadow and live his own life under the bridge. Some of the comedy is random in nature, but most of it seems to hit on the underlying message. It isn't deep stuff, but this series did very effectively what it intended to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWell done character designs, good background art, and very consistent animation. The Shaft \"style\" isn't quite as glaringly obvious as most of the shows from the company, except for the OP, ED, and a few other instances. \\n\\n\r\nIt has to be said that Nino is probably one of the most obviously beautiful female characters I've seen. The other female characters are well designed as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSolid music, with well know voice actors doing the same great work they always do. Not much to complain about here. Though, there also isn't anything particularly amazing in this compartment, either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are likable, memorable, funny, and just overall well done. Unfortunately, they go out of their way not to talk about themselves and Kou is pretty much the only character to go through some form of change. Still, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nConsistently funny unlike most comedy series I've seen and the characters are very likable. I enjoyed the message this series brought to the table as well. An easy series to marathon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nMemorable, funny, and many other things. Arakawa is a great comedy series up there with stuff such as FMP: Fumofu, Minami-ke, and a few others. Definitely recommended for those looking for a good time.",

One man living under a bridge, and the small community that he spends his time with. It received plenty of positive reception from the reviewers on MAL, so I dove right in. And what I found was a charming, albeit eccentric slice-of-life that quickly became one of my favorites in the genre.\r\nFirst and foremost, this is a character driven show. By no means will anything happen beyond the two main conflicts (the main character's acceptance into the community, and the other big one, which I won'tmention for the sake of those who have yet to see \"Under the Bridge\"), and your enjoyment of this series will rest solely on your ability to enjoy this type of show.\\n\\n\r\nIf shows like \"Azumanga Daioh\", \"K-On!/!\" or \"Minami-ke\" were your cup of tea, then by all means hop right into AUtB. However, if you fall into the group of individuals who found these shows completely pointless and a waste of your time, you might want to sit this one out. Having said that, this one in particular is heavy on the comedy, and if it can't make even the most stone faced of otaku crack a smile, then give up on life. Or lighten up, life doesn't always have to be about epic battles and heart-wrenching love stories.",

            "content": "Note: This review will cover both seasons.\r\nCommon sense. It is the set of knowledge and comprehension of the world that society expects you to have. Now imagine a place containing a seemingly jumbled society of unique characters where common sense is naught. The phrase itself hasn\u2019t even entered its lexicon. And yet, strangely, the society is perfectly functional. This is the Arakawa riverbed.\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge starts off as a rather bizarre romance. Ichinomiya Kou, a self-proclaimed elite, all-around prodigy, falls into the Arakawa River and nearly drowns. He is saved by Nino, an enigmatic young woman who proclaims that she is a Venusian. However,Kou was always taught to never be indebted to another person, and now, he owes the biggest debt of all to Nino for saving his life. As a result, Nino has a simple yet imposing request: to fall in love and live with her under the bridge. Thus begins one of the most unique romances in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it had the potential to be anyway. Alas, the romance is awkwardly paced and its progress is minimal. The series is mainly an absurdist gag comedy fueled by the ridiculous antics of its equally ridiculous (but far from unfunny) characters. Despite its interesting, auspicious premise, there really isn\u2019t much of a plot. It just follows the daily lives of the citizens of the Arakawa riverbed. Sure, the second season features the \u201ctrip to Venus\u201d plot, but it was abandoned midway and was rather unfulfilling. That said though, the comedy, on the other hand, is hilarious. Over time, the humor did begin to either stale, feel forced, or just become plain stupid, even by Arakawa\u2019s standards. Certain jokes began to feel predictable. However, at its best, Arakawa had a number of side-splitting moments (in both seasons) where I just burst out laughing uncontrollably. Few anime can do that to me, so I commend Arakawa for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has an eclectic assortment of interesting and peculiar supporting characters. The Village Chief, a man in a green costume who claims to be a 620-year old kappa, despite the obvious zipper running down his back, and also gives each person living in the Arakawa riverbed their name (Kou becomes \u201cRecruit\u201d or \u201cRic\u201d). Sister, a bellicose yet ironically calm muscle-man who dresses like a nun. Hoshi, a man wearing a star-shaped mask who vies for Nino\u2019s affection. These are just some of the oddities you\u2019ll find in Arakawa, and most of them, save a few (such as the Amazoness), are endearing characters. A few characters do get tiring after a while though, especially since some of the gags become overused.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is fairly limited. Kou gets the most since he\u2019s the one forced to adapt to new conditions, and we also learn quite a bit about Hoshi, but no one else other than Nino, who ultimately remains an enigma even after the second season, gets much development. Given the nature of the show, that\u2019s fine, but I really would have liked to see more from the Chief and Nino. You see, Arakawa contains some unexpectedly dark implicit themes. They are subtle, but they include failure, rejection, and disillusionment from society and reality. These are people living under a bridge, away from society, after all. They must have some sort of dark past, as evidenced by Hoshi. Understanding the Chief\u2019s reasons for establishing this place and deliberately lying about his true self is key to understanding this society. Maybe that\u2019s too deep for a comedy as outrageous as this, but Arakawa also likes to insert some philosophical crap in the beginning of each episode, so maybe not\u2026? Either way, with its premise, I definitely wanted to learn about Nino\u2019s past and the truth behind her Venusian origins. Unfortunately, the second season never resolves what it starts and the Venus storyline is instead replaced by a shitty fighting tournament.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the animation is a bit inconsistent. It can be crisp and beautiful, but it can also be dull and uninspired at times. Also, whenever a character is walking directly towards or away from the camera, they never seem to gain any distance. I know this has been a problem in many anime in the past, but you would think animation studios would have figured out how to correct this by now. Furthermore, there\u2019s an odd tendency for the animators to zoom in on people\u2019s eyes, especially Kou\u2019s. As for the music, it\u2019s average and very forgettable, except for the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s. I don\u2019t generally care much for OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s, but these ones are notable. The two ED\u2019s by Suneohair are fantastic indie rock songs, and in fact, I have one of the songs, \u201cSakasama Bridge\u201d from the first season, on my iPod, one of only two songs from anime on it. The OP\u2019s are both decent pop listens as well.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Arakawa is a hilarious comedy with an enjoyable, intriguing cast of characters. The humor of the second season does drop in quality and become more hit-or-miss, but there are still a few laugh-out-loud moments that are sure to please. As a comedy, this is one of the funniest anime I\u2019ve seen. But if you\u2019re expecting the mystery behind Nino to be answered, you\u2019re in for a disappointment. While the possibility for a third season is viable, since the manga is still ongoing, I don\u2019t think the humor can take another hit.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8",

After the first episode, however, it's clear that the main focus of the story is the people who live under the bridge. While Ko and Nino bond throughout the series, Ko's interactions with the secondary characters are the main attraction. The short mini-story format to each episode helps keep the whole feeling of the show light and easy-going.\r\nArt: An interesting mix of styles are used throughout the series. You have some very beautiful backgrounds and character portrayal during themore moving parts, and silly faces for almost every other time. The constant switching suits the zany feel of the show. The character designs are all varied, and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song is very upbeat and cute. The background music and sound effects were suitable for the various situations Ko found himself in. The voice acting was excellent, and I think the actors captured the feeling of their characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The cast is an interesting collection of weirdos. I loved the different histories, personalities and energy each player brought to the show. Whether it was Star's constant competing with Ko, or Sister's \"badass nun with guns and cookies\" attitude, each character was a pleasure to watch. I was not surprised by the lack of character development, since the crew is so zany; any attempt to change them would take away form the fact that they are all so strange. Ko goes through some development, and the second-to-last episode was very touching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not really reading anything about the show, I went into it thinking it would be more dramatic, or romantic. I was happily surprised by the more comical, slice-of-life approach. I was laughing every episode, and I really enjoyed watching Arakawa!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Arakawa Under the Bridge:\\n\\n\r\nhilarious, random, silly, weird, touching",

            "content": "Life is the crazily raging river running from past to future. There is a bridge called society and expectations that lets us cross over the river, should we, like most people take it. \r\n----\r\nThe story of  'Arakawa under the bridge' revolves around male protagonist Ichinomiya Ko, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, an elite of society in every regard (good at everything), and has strong family tradition to never rely on anyone. The opening episode is him on this bridge crossing over the river. Much like how he is progressing forward, but crossing over what true \"life\" is. \r\nIn an unexpected turnof events, Ko meets the female protagonist Nino who saves his life. Feeling indebted to Nino, Ko attempts to pay her back and follow the family policy of never relying on anyone. Oddly enough, Love becomes the one thing that bind Ko to Nino. The other residents of the river are slowly introduced and thus begins the crazy daily happenings of Life under the bridge as Ko learns about himself and people under the bridge, develops to a different human being, and as he fights of his father's plots to take him back. \\n\\n\r\nThe only flaws to the story I found was that it didn't quite settle on a solid \"plot\" or a \"slice of life\" direction. Many episodes seemed to be uncorrelated and had no continues plot, while other had more serious plot ideas (ie. v.s the Ichinomiya group). If there was a more serious direction it may have been more easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the series is quite beautifully and uniquely done, particularly as it involved drawing irregular characters, like buff nuns, frequently. Directed by Akiyuki Shinobu (Negima!, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei), and animated by Shaft Studio (Monogatari, Negima!, Sayonary Zetsubo Sensei) I expected no less than absolute quality, which they did deliver.\\n\\n\r\nThe clarity of the animation style (thicker outlines) combined with the environmental designs had me hooked from the beginning. The detail used in the setting (the bridge, river, grass) was exceptional, but cannot be compared to Makoto Shinkai (5cm per second). Overall, I really enjoyed Shaft's output and consistency in animating the odd characters while maintaining environmental clarity and integrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issues i found with the animation was the lack of diversity in environment. This may be a \"me only\" thing, but I found that they used the same settings for pretty much everything, that the \"backdrop\" for a scene \"here\" or scene \"there\" would be used over and over. It'd barely noticeable, but for me I'd like to have a larger diversity of areas.\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the series never disappointed me. To begin, OP \"Venus to Jesus\" by Etsuko Yakushimary caught my ear. The opening had a very unique feel to it and the song is a bit awkward but yet sounds great. It caught me unexpectedly as I'm usually exposed to the more clich\u00e9 opening (ie. j-rock/hip). Aside from the tender opening, the ending was interesting as well with \"upside-down bridge\" by Suneohair producing a contrast from the opening, but really helped to close the episode off. The random OP in a certain episode also added to the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound throughout the series was great, background themes worked well and weren't over used, coupled with the character voicing that were consistent with the characters made this series have the irregular slice of life atmosphere I appreciate. It also helped to mediate the plot in areas where silence or other themes would've been awkward. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issues I found with the \"sound\" was that nothing really \"stood out\" beyond what is said above. There isn't the strong immortalized emotional melodies during emotional scenes, or distinct \"theme\" music for characters per se. \\n\\n\r\n------\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a broad and diverse bunch who carried unique pasts (most of which we'll never know about) and who provide very critical social commentary. A brief introduction of the characters will prove to show the diversity and commentary.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist Ichinomiya Ko, nicknamed \"Ric\" or \"recruit\" is the new addition to the riverbank and the story flows showing his development as he expressed the usual and societal ideologies of \"life\" and \"values\". Being, in reality, a super successful elite, he represents what regular people aspire to. Oddly enough in the upsidedown world of Arakawa, he is meerly the a \"leech\" in the least. His confrontations with his short comings and with other things he finds valuable in life are the key points of his developement and will keep you thinking. Voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya (Teiria-Gundam00, Izaya-Durara, etc), the expressions of Ko to situations is diverse and draws attention and sympathies.\\n\\n\r\nFemale protagonist, Nino, is the self proclaimed Venusian who brings Ko, as a lover into the group. Little is known about her and her past. But she expresses the purest form of humanity, much like a child she accepts things and takes things oddly seriously. Her love for Ko is uniquely expressed and her lack of expression makes her very interesting to watch. She directly contrasts Ko in both values and traditions as she knows seemingly nothing of the surface world, or its values. She knows of love and caring for other people, sometimes blissfully ignorant of many facts. Her comments about Ko's responses to kindness, or forcing him to show it provide insightful commentary for how society perceives those around them. \\n\\n\r\nThe village chief, or the kappa,  is a self proclaimed Kappa who is obviously some guy in a costume. The general hilarity of seeing a character completely believing in their own decided existence makes him fun to watch, particularly how his character does not change. Kappa, dare I say represents nature or the earth. Part of life, yet barely recognized (and recognized less and less though the years). \\n\\n\r\nHoshi, or Star, is the rival of Ko for the love of Nino. He is also a musician. The comedy of him and Ko's onesided rivalry is fun to watch in itself. But, truly it is his expressions in situations and how he completely delves into the world of Arakawa and combines it into his rivalry that is the most interesting. I think he is a major reason that Ko is able to integrate into the community, and an even greater reason that Ko is able to truly appreciate Nino. Hoshi represents one extreme of expressionism, muscianship. In society, those that pursue music to an over extent are critqued and excluded. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters that are introduced each present their own very unique expressions of reality and uniqueness. Each commenting on individual ghosts of past and on societal reconciliation with said people. For the sake of length, I've excluded an indepth analysis of the other Characters:\\n\r\n- Sister (the Military male Nun)\\n\r\n- P-ko (the cute gardener girl)\\n\r\n- Iron Twins (the two kids with iron helmets)\\n\r\n- Maria ( sadist, and farmer)\\n\r\n- Stella (the little girl)\\n\r\nand other minor characters (Takai, Billy, Jacqueline, Last Samurai, Shimazaki, father Ichinomiya, etc). \\n\\n\r\nIf you'd like to hear my opinion about these characters please PM me.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw I found was that the characters were used very \"on and off\" the only character that was used consistently was Ko (expectedly). There are episodes that will no even touch upon characters for a long time. Billy, Jacqueline, and Last Samurai for example, do not even get fully introduced until the last episode of this season. \\n\\n\r\n------\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, not only because it had me laughing, crying, or nervous at the right times, but rather because of it's awkward uniqueness that resonates with the human soul. I started this series hoping for nice rom-com, which is supplies, but I found a deeper social commentary in the series. I was, throughout the series, reflecting on where my sympathies lie, and like any other anime fan ... What would I do if I met these characters in reality? \\n\\n\r\nThe abnormalities of the people in the series, in real life, would be the people we deem to be crazy, that we can't spend another day with. Indeed, having done lots of work with people in poverty, there are many people with delusions out there. In reality, we cast them aside, or rather acknowledge their insanity. Even though they live in crazy communities, we neglect their reality. \\n\\n\r\nSo when did crazy become so normal? I don't know at what point in the series that I finally accepted the Mayor as being a Kappa, or that Hoshi was a star, or Nino was actually from Venus. In fact, near the end I became part of Arakawa, finding Ko's surface level ignorance to be odd, finding that Ko was the crazy one. \\n\\n\r\nSo this was most enjoyable to me because It actually made me realize how immersed is was in the world or Arakawa.\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an amazing first season. PM me if you have any thoughts or comments about my review. I hope you check this series out. \\n\\n",

I do know this, it had me laughing like a maniac the first episode through and if an anime can do that, it's worth watching to the end. I like that it's really just weird and the characters ae weird, but behind everything it's just a kind of oddball romance and it's cute to see the interaction between Rec and Nino, especially how Nino teaches Rec a few things without her even noticing. I think this is going to be a cute comedy witha nice romantic underlining. I can't wait to see it develop further. Plus, it can be funny as hell.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8- Oddball comedy with a romance lining. FUNNY.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7-8- I'm on the fence here. Some shots of Nino are stunning, and some scenes are beautiful. But it's not consistent. And Rec looks odd most of the time, though he has his fair share of 'good' shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: -- Again, not paying much attention. The OP is cute though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7-8- They've already introduced a good bit of weird characters, and Rec gets some back-story right off the bat, but really I'm curious to learn about all the other characters! Especially Nino, who is she really? Where did she come from? Why is she there? Why won't she leave the bridge?? And...what's wrong with everyone else??! But maybe (if this is that kind of anime) we'll never get an answer to those questions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8-9- Super funny. 'Nuff said! But really, it'll make you laugh out-loud like a little kid most of the time (though other times it's just weird). I'm waiting for the romance to kick-off though,",

That being said, if the remaining episodes can manage to keep up the enjoyable, absurdist humour that the first has offered, then Arakawa Under the Bridge should be another enjoyable series for this year.\r\nThe art in this anime was generally quite impressive; the animations flow nicely and drawings are polished and detailed. The same can be said about the sound as well, with the music and effects suiting the light-hearted feel of the story well.\r\nKou instantly reminded me of 'Zetsubou-Sensei' (regardless of the factthat they have the same voice actor) which was nice from a SZS fan's perspective, but the two other characters that were shown in this episode (Nino and 'The Chief') both felt like characters you might've seen before somewhere else, but with something new and fresh that keeps things interesting.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the first episode of this anime was pretty enjoyable and I hope I can say that again at the end of this series because this is definitely a show with potential.",

            "content": "From the time we are young, are parents all/ teach us certain things. No matter what these deal with, there will usually be a very common theme: what society wants us to do.\r\nYes, from a very young age, most of us will be told to continue the flow of society's ideas, and to never question them. But, what makes these ideas right?\r\nThis is the question that we are faced with while watching Arakawa Under the Bridge, a story about, well, living under a bridge. A bridge under which almost no laws will ever reach you, with the possible exception of public indecency...\r\nWe see a romancethat blossoms under this bridge, as Ko, a man whose parents who have installed far beyond just the rule that society is always correct, is pulled into entering a relationship with Nino, a person who claims to be a Venusian, on his belief that anything that anyone does is solely for gain and must be repaid. This belief that his father installed in him, however, quickly begins to fade as he subconsciously begins to reject the notion that society is always correct, and slowly embraces his new life under the bridge.\\n\\n\r\nOur story continues, with him continuing to meet more people under the bridge, and slowly coming to realize, yet again, that he can't really know what exactly is \"right\" and \"wrong\". Indeed, our story continues to progress in this vein, with Ko growing to accept the actions of the others all living under the bridge.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the residents of this area also have to have a job (with the acceptation of a couple), and they all help each other in whatever sane ways they can, before their actions degrade into insanity, one of the real main sources for comedy in Arakawa Under the Bridge. Indeed, one of the most enjoyable elements of the show was all of our unique characters interacting in unique ways.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these unique characters served to bring something special to the show; they all served a function for the community, while also bringing interesting elements the the show. They all have some kind of eccentricity that is very much ingrained in their character, or at least something that would render them unable to live in a regular society. These eccentricities were again, the source of nearly 100% of the comedy for the show, and the main thing that kept it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what really disappoints is how often the characters are left completely untouched in terms of development. We don't get any back story on some of the characters, and on others, we only get tantalizing hints. This is, for some, the most irritating element in the entire show; we can almost never figure out the pasts of some of the most unique characters that we have ever seen. It is truly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nIf lack of characters development holds down the show the most, the next most irritating element is the art style. As it's shaft, we can really expect to see insanity in the rat as well, and so we do. It's really quite irritating to those who don't enjoy the Shaft animation style to b subjected to these incredibly well drawn scenes being forced down to mediocrity by terrible illustrations, which can really limit and interfere with the show for those who are not true connoisseurs of the Shaft art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound also was only a slight break from the weaker elements of this show. It was really fair: there wasn't anything that really weighed it down , but there wasn't anything that really aided it in this department either. The voice actors were average, the sound effects were average; everything really failed to go beyond the average bound. Our opening and ending were also really, well, average, leaving the anime with average sound.\\n\\n\r\nWhile sound did not contribute to my enjoyment of the show, it certainly didn't hurt it. This show was highly enjoyable to anyone who liked the style of comedy, wasn't valued away by Shaft's art, and in general likes comedies and romances. I had a great deal of enjoyment from this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, now the question is, will you enjoy it? The best way to determine that is, especially if it sounds interesting, watch a couple of episodes. By that point, you will have gotten a good taste of the random art interferences and random characters that contribute to the general eccentricity of the show. You will have also seen the types of jokes told; if they seem like they'll get old, then you should leave. The jokes will often repeat, especially if the are part of a character's intrinsic personality. In other words, you will like this show if you like the first couple of episodes, aren't thrown off by the random art you see there, like the characters, and don't mind the general premise of the show in this regard. If it sounds interesting, give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nSo long Arakawa Under the Bridge. It's been awesome!!",

            "content": "Charming. This is what I constantly thought of when watching Arakawa Under The Bridge. Despite the insane plot and the ridiculous characters, this show was full of charm. Whether there was a hint of deeper meanings between it's comedic outtakes, or its abundance of heartwarming scenes, there never once was a dull moment during my time at under the Arakawa Bridge!\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Arakawa Under The Bridge is something that tends to turn many people off due to it's nonlinear approach. The story goes as follows; a guy who believes in never owing anybody anything gets his life saved after falling off a bridge bya strange girl. This creates a debt the size of well, his life! In order to repay this girl, he must show her what it means to love thus making him her lover. This sudden turn of events begins as he lives with the girl under the bridge where she and a bunch of other strange folk coincidentally happens to live! Sounds a lot to swallow? Don't worry, the story is way easier to grasp than what it seems.You see, to show someone what it means to love is such a universal topic that the entire series tends to be just about the guy and all the residents of Arakawa Bridge doing miscellaneous things each episodes. The series is jam packed with tons of comedy but also without realizing it, full of many other things. This leads me back to what I previously said; this show is FULL of charm. What Arakawa does best is to add heavy themes such as Acceptance, Regret, or being yourself while still keeping things to a lighthearted, comedic level. I loved when a funny situation would occur but at that exact same time, the main protagonist may learn something new about himself, or slowly, the girl would realize bit by bit what it truly means to love. Because of this, swallowing the insanity surrounding the show is much less a chore and much more a joy!\\n\\n\r\nDespite this: although I found the story one of the greatest aspects of the show, the opposite can be said for some. For starters, as previously said, this story is non linear to a tee. There is no single episode dedicated to, \"What it means to love.\" Instead the story is really told through the character's every day encounters and actions with the members of the Arakawa River. While I found it interesting, this in turn can make people not want to watch the show if they were looking for a more direct plot. Furthermore, when the story did try to create a straightforward scenario near the last quarter of the series, I found that to be the weakest part of the series and I was anxiously waiting when that encounter can be settled and got back to more random tasks with the residents. Also, the outrageous surrounding of the show is of course not for everyone. This is indeed a WAAY over the top comedy, with no bars held back and if that's not your cup of tea, than this show won't change your mind otherwise.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art of the show in general would be classed as standard fair for the anime at that time. However, since \"Shaft\" were the developers for this show, (Madoka Magica, Bakemonogatari) you can expect to get some eye popping, over the top art work. the opening theme is especially easy to notice; full of vivid colors and beautiful scenery. Overall, the outrageous art of the show only added to fit  the whole tone the show was trying to portray. Quickly though, the live action segments with the Kappa at the end of each episode is probably some of the most hilarious scenes I have ever seen. PERIOD.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound of Arakawa under the bridge is not anything spectacular. There were no background music that particulary stood out to me, and instead I found myself simply engrossed in the dialogue to even notice. The opening and endings on the other hand is definitely worth mentioning. The opening theme of the show, Venus To Jesus is a light, moderate pace tune which is easily a good listen and can be enjoyed without any context. It definitely fits the lightheartedness of the show. The ending, Sakasama Bridge is a personal favorite. this once again, is a light, moderate paced song, but the melancholic feeling it gives off, really helps to describe  the feel of those more heartfelt scenes in the show. Plus it's by Suneohair, whose also done works in shows such as, Honey and Clover! Last, without spoiling anything, there's a song titled, \"Losers Wail\" and if the title alone doesn't convince you how funny it is, than prepare to wail yourself if you do get the chance to listen to it!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTalking about the characters in Arakawa under the bridge is difficult. You see, each resident of the Arakawa River is strange in it's own way, but only adds to the charm. For instance, you have a a Church Sister (who's not really a sister) that came from the military and acts like the Terminator, but with more dialogue.  Not satisfied? You also have a Rock Star with a Star for a head, as well as Kappa (A frog like person). At first, these different personalities might be unsettling, but really, these Character really help to bring this story to life. You see, one of the main themes that Arakawa Under The Bridge tries to tell is acceptance no matter who you are. Despite these crazy appearances, I found myself genuinely liking these characters because of just how well the chemistry these social misfits had with one another. Whether they had a comedic relationship or a serious one, I enjoyed each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nA flaw to these characters however is that they're really isn't that much character development. Aside from our main lovers, Ko and Nino; despite how much screen time the rest of the cast received, they remained static from start to beginning. You may get a bit of story from the individual characters, but they don't really grow as a person. If there was a particular person you might not have liked then unfortunately they will most likely stay that way until it's comedic conclusion. \\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge is INSANE! (In the good way of course!) Going into the show, I was a bit skeptical due to the amount of pure outragousness it posed. While it was still there, everything seemed bearable and in fact, better than what I expected it to be. I was also anxious to figure out what the crazy people of under the Arakawa Bridge would do next, and even though it's not genre breaking, it's originality and heart should be something that grabs viewers and drops them into unfamiliar, but wonderful territory! Welcome to Arakawa Under the Bridge!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Never judge a book by its cover, or in anime's case, never judge an anime by the first episode. Arakawa under the Bridge started out (for me) as a fairly pretentious and rather bland series, and I fully expected that I would be ready to drop it by around episode 5 or maybe even sooner. Now that isn't saying the first episode was bad by any means, it just didn't stand out at all to me, it was a regular opening describing the 2 leads and giving a good amount of exposition. As the episodes progressed, I slowly began to enjoy Arakawa more and more,and began to see something special in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nLets start with the characters. Arakawa has a vast array of characters, adding new ones almost every episode to add to the viewers pleasure. Every character is, at first glance, rather one dimensional. As is standard with most comedies, every character will have some sort of \"gag\" around them that is generally hyped upon every time you meet that character. For example, the main character has an issue with owing people favors, and as such, there are many scenes in which he will need to rely on someone and will go to any great lengths to repay the favour, and really almost every character is like this in their own way. Now really, for a comedy this isn't a bad thing, the laughs may be a little obvious but its still always funny to see the guy freak out at having to pay back Nino for saving his life or whatever the favor of the moment is. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there is something peculiarly special about the cast of Arakawa. As the series progresses, little \"hints\" thrown about a lot, about the past of the character in question. This is especially prominent in Nino, the heroine, but is noticeable in many of the side characters as well (Sister's apparent past war ties, or the school kids apparently being experimented on). Whenever I notice one of these hints, I like to imagine what was it that brought this person to live under a bridge. What was his / her past life truly like? Was it a long journey to finally find this home? These questions build up and will probably remain forever un-answered but that's just part of the charm. The bit of mystery surrounding each character really helps build a strong connection with them, and greatly increases the viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nOne final thing that really showed me a better side to Arakawa is the plot of the thing. Now you could say, \"But how is watching the daily lives of some quirky characters living under a bridge that exciting. As far as anime goes, its not exactly revolutionary.\" And while this is true, the plot isn't going to wow anyone, does one thing right, and that's make one reflect on their own life. As you sink into this show, you begin to see that a lot of it is comparing normal life to the random lifestyle that the folks under the bridge follow. This is particularly emphasized by the fact that the protagonist is a Rich boy at the head of society. When comparing the two, one starts to realize that maybe this insane, random lifestyle of weird people in funny masks is really the less \"insane\" of the two. It shows us, that really, life should be lived how you want it to be, not whats necessarily best for you. We see that Kuo is at the head of the world, rich, handsome, with a silver tongue, he seems to have it all. And yet, which does he enjoy more, teaching under this god forsaken bridge, or following in his father's footsteps. Well its only 7 episodes in as I write this review so only time can tell, but I can be certain that this is the main message of the anime: Look at yourself and decide what you want to do... then do it! \\n\\n\r\nNow no show is perfect and of course Arakawa is no exception. The music isn't that exciting, and the art is a little weird at times (but still pretty decent). While the cast is many, the amount does bite it in the behind a little bit due to being only 13 episodes long, meaning that each character doesn't get quite as much screen time as one may like. The humor for the most part is funny, with a few exceptions, but most likely you'll get a good few chuckles out of it by the end. If I had to hate one thing about this anime, I'd say its the constant cuts to a close up of Kuo's eye... seriously its kinda unsettling whenever they do that.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough rambling from this coot, I'll finish off by saying that I will always recommend this anime no matter how bad the ending may turn out to be. Its funny, the characters are lovable, the premise is interesting, and overall, it holds together extremely well. Enjoy",

            "content": "'Arakawa Under the Bridge' is about Ichinomiya Kou, an elite (someone who holds a high ranking position or works in a blue-chip company. A \"winner\" in Japanese society) who's been taught to never get indebted to anyone, gets careless one day over Arakawa  and gets saved by a girl. The girl's name is Nino, who turns out to be a denpa-kei (people with \"overactive imagination\" or nutcase, e.g. Nodame) who claims to be from Venus, and doesn't want anything in return. After a long debate, she tells Ichinomiya that there is one thing that he can do for her: \"Let me fall in love.\"And so, Ichinomiya starts living under the bridge in Arakawa as Nino's boyfriend in order to repay his debt.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa (\"Rough River\" in kanji) is a major river that runs through Tokyo. This is the river you have to cross to get to Saitama, and I can tell you it's very wide river that you do not want to fall into.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER: 5/10\\n\r\nI must admit that my expectation for this show after the first episode was really high because the setting of an elite suddenly living the poor man's lifestyle, and the general atmosphere was really similar to 'Koi ni Ochitara', a dorama series that's very dear to me. I found 'Arakawa's setting to be very intriguing with both Ichinomiya and Nino having interesting personality, and a funny encounter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and character setting had a great potential. This show could've gone three directions:\\n\\n\r\n      1. Focus on Ichinomiya and Nino's relationship as a romance anime.\\n\r\n      2. Focus on Ichinomiya alone for discovery of small joys in life and gradual change of character belief, slice of life.\\n\r\n      3. Focus on side characters for pure comedy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nInstead, they went for no focus or central theme. Just a bunch of weirdos doing random things in the riverbank with very limited story or character development. Humor in this show was mostly physical, unintelligent slapstick, but wasn't really funny because the pacing is too slow for that. The side characters were a ridiculous bunch that had no distinct personalities that made them particularly lovable. They were all cardboard characters who received zero character developments. In the end, it seemed like the author was trying too hard to make unique characters just to make this show different.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say episodes 1, 4, 8, 12 where they focused on romance (#1) or slice of life (#2) were very strong and moving episodes, but otherwise all fillers. Story and character development was way too slow to be interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 6/10\\n\r\nGeneral animation by Shaft, there are lots of eye zoom-ins, but otherwise nothing out of the ordinary. The peaceful atmosphere of Arakawa riverside with vivid, light colors was visually pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality was very inconsistent though. Episode 1 and some slow, dramatic scenes have movie-grade background detail and attractive characters, but the rest is super-simple (difference especially noticeable in sky grass texture).\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters seem somewhat realistic despite simplicity. The style is really similar to 'Nodame Cantabile', but the character designs for 'Arakawa' is actually better. The rest, while they are supposed to look out of place... never grew on me. It just seemed like a cosplay contest in a really unlikely place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nRidiculous number of big-name and experienced cast, even for the minor characters. Overall, voice acting is pretty good, but it doesn't really sound like any of them really put in too much effort.\\n\\n\r\nBGM is pretty average, but used in all the right places.\\n\\n\r\nTheme songs, on the other hand, were excellent. OP was cute and fun with retro graphics that worked really well to boost Nino's character. ED is a really good song that makes you reflect back on the episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\r\n'Arakawa Under the Bridge' had the potential to become a really touching and inspiring show if only they just focused on romance or slice of life. Instead, it became something I can't exactly describe, in a bad way.\\n\r\nSomething went really wrong with series composition that ruined a good original work.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much only 4 episodes of material was in the first season, dragging on to the next. This is one of a rare non-prime-time anime series that I actually wished was shorter. I will be watching the next season in hope of a major turnaround.",

            "content": "So, this show is a random humor enthusiast's heaven. It is sometimes funny, sometimes stupid, and often both. \r\nThat could be the end of my review right there, but there's always more to talk about. For example, the art. The art is great. It is produced by shaft, directed by Akiyuki Shinbou, and is typical of Shinbou/shaft. If you are unfamiliar with shaft/Shinbou style artwork (most famous for Bakemonogatari), it is basically a collage of unconventional anime styles, that shifts around depending on the story. Lots of random fast cuts to land/city-scapes, sudden changes in the detail of animation, etc. It all is used ina way that seems to compliment the zany and random story. Also, in a great innovation, we now have windmill hair!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fun, even though the lyrics are silly. I'm a huge fan of the OP, not just for the song, but for the artwork that goes with it. The characters? Well, they are a bit cardboard, more or less used as gags to perpetuate the random humor. The story? Once again, just used to perpetuate the random humor. There is an underlying message in this show, that we don't have to do what society tells us, and sometimes it's better just to be ourselves, no matter how crazy that is :) Not a particularly deep message, but it goes well with the focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Well, here's our problem. Everything in this show is sacrificed for the sake of random humor. Now personally, I wasn't too amused. I have trouble finding stuff amusing just because it is random. I mean, sure, when it's completely left-field, randomness is funny, but in this case it became a constant barrage of randomness and ceased to be terribly funny. It was still often funny despite this, but just as often it was stupid. My brain definitely turned off as I watched this.\\n\\n\r\nMany have recommended it to all Bakemonogatari fans, and I can't really agree with that. Bakemonogatari was a much smarter, character driven, and creative anime. Many fans will be dissapointed. That said, if you like Bakemonogatari, you might like this, so give it a chance. If you like random humor, then you will love this show. If you only like intelligent anime, then this show isn't for you.",

            "content": "Often times people like to think of themselves as \u201cthe normal one.\u201d \r\nAt least this is the case for Kou, a self-proclaimed part of the \u201celite.\u201d From the day he was born Kou was taught to never be indebted to someone. For the most part Kou does a pretty good job of it too, that is until he loses his pants and falls into the Arakawa River. Now we have one indebted Kou, and a savior named Nino that wants Kou to help her experience love. He accepts, and begins living under the Arakawa Bridge with a group of bizarre social misfits. \r\nIt sounds abit absurd I know; but this absurdity is what makes it so great. Arakawa Under the Bridge uses a unique mix of absurdism and slapstick humor with a few deeper messages added along the way to bring you a really nice comedic experience overall. The story itself is lacking as show isn't episodic but can appear to be that way at times because of the absurd things happening. The story really takes the backseat and suffers to let everything shine through in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the artwork found throughout this series... well, this is SHAFT we are talking about here. They are a studio known for their odd visuals and cinematography. You know, the people that brought you Bakemonogatari and Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Although it is less experimental in art style than the previously mentioned series, it is still up to standard with any of their works and at times can even make for some really nice scenery porn. \\n\\n\r\nThe Arakawa Bridge is called home by a village chief that thinks he is a Kappa, a killer nun, a literal rock-star, a Martian, two runaway guinea pigs from a laboratory, and of course the main character Kou. All of the characters are as absurd as they sound and maybe even more. They are the focal point in which many, if not all of the jokes in Arakawa come from. As you can tell the cast of characters found throughout Arakawa are not your average run of the mill people, and although they lack depth they are definitely the highlight of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Arakawa Under the Bridge is suiting. The soundtrack wasn\u2019t mind-bogglingly amazing but it was still good. The background music enhanced the comedic moments so they did their job quite nicely. The opening of Arakawa Under the Bridge is definitely more satisfying visually than musically and I felt the same way about the ending too. As far as sound goes the voice acting was definitely the highlight, the voice actors did an absolutely incredible job making the jokes told in the show that much more memorable.   \\n\\n\r\nIt is true that people often think of themselves as \u201cthe normal one.\u201d But after watching Arakawa Under the Bridge I think it is safe to say that normality is relative. It constantly wears this theme on its sleeve while presenting is odd, yet surprisingly pleasant form of absurdist comedy. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll be the first to say that I don\u2019t like absurdist comedies. I have just never found them that funny, but Arakawa Under the Bridge was a pleasant surprise. I found myself laughing from the beginning of one episode to the end, which is a huge win in my book. I strongly believe this anime is a must watch for all comedy lovers. \\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory- 4\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nCharacters- 8\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nOverall- 7.4\\n",

The humor can be hit and miss, so it's hard to recommend this show after one or two episodes. But I like the voice acting - Maaya Sakamoto (Haruhi from Ouran Host Club, Ryougi Shiki from Kara no Kyoukai, Lightning from JPN FFXIII, etc.) acts out Nino, and I enjoy her brusque voice so I'll be following this series for a couple more episodes.\r\nOne last tip: There's a reason why Nutbladder's subs appear first, and that group's work is clearly a speed sub. I'm hardly in the place to criticize anyone'swork, and speed is a factor too, but I would watch another group's fansubs for better translation of finer grammatical points. I'm watching with Formula subs right now and rewatching the first ten minutes of the first episode, there's a pretty vast difference in quality. I haven't checked out other groups' fansubs, but I'll eventually get around to it and let you guys know.",

            "content": "5.0/10\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThere are certain tropes that exist within the realm of anime, well, less obviously, comedy anime. Said tropes seem to inhabit the majority of these programs and, to my dismay, negatively influence my enjoyment of these products. Tropes are not inherently bad, as they are a kind of backbone for every piece of entertainment. However, certain tropes you, as a viewer, can grow to harbor an inner disdain for. \r\nComedy anime, especially of the romantic nature, tends to exude and indulge in these tropes to the point where they instantly put me off of a show. One of said tropes is the idea that ourprotagonist needs to have some kind of moral or ethical restriction or rule imposed upon them by nothing but their own will or experience, which often rings hollow since it is such a preposterous idea, to begin with. This trope, I'll agree, is present in a lot of anime, especially Shounen action, but it also persists in comedy for no reason other than to create over-the-top situations, naturally. \\n\\n\r\nThis is just one of those tropes that always rubs me the wrong way because it never breeds situations that I believe or find funny, and while comedy is generally unbelievable, there does need to be an air of verisimilitude that inhabits the scene for it to work in context. \\n\\n\r\nWith this knowledge, we enter \"Arakawa Under the Bridge\". \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Character, Delivery, Execution]\\n\\n\r\nThe trope here is utilized of course. Our protagonist, Kou Ichinomiya, kindly nick-named \"Rec\" or \"Recruit\" early on in the series, is a rich business elite who grew up with a tough, no-frills father that seemed to not care much about him at all. He taught him one lesson, to never take favors from anyone as you never want to be indebted. \\n\\n\r\nSo here stands Rec, on a bridge, pantsless, and wondering what he did to deserve to be stripped by a group of schoolboys. Here comes Nino, fishing his pants up from a hanging railing and handing them over to him. At first he rejects her assistance but then comes around to accepting her favor and is therefore forced to become indebted to her. She asks him to be her lover and well... you can probably guess where this goes. He is forced to be the lover of this surprisingly attractive strange girl who lives under the bridge. Woe is Rec. \\n\\n\r\nUnder the bridge, Rec meets a group of equally strange and zany characters that have all kinds of odd interests and hobbies. Ranging from a man in a Kappa costume who believes he's actually a Kappa, serving as the chieftain of this little group, to a man who is perpetually in love with Nino whilst also wearing a star-mask and making bad music. The designs here are all distinct and quite good, actually, specifically the gun-toting nun and peppy, yet clumsy farmer girl. This group of somewhat loveable and oafish characters don't get much development, as the series' thirteen episode stretch is more oriented around sketch comedy. \\n\\n\r\nUnrelated skits backend each episode. These episodes are split up into multiple \"chapters\", each one signifying a different theme or concept and play out in one to ten-minute sketches that don't correlate with one another until the main psuedo-arc of the series comes into play. It's a cute format that is in-line with something like Nichijou, a favorite of mine. Unlike Nichijou, \"Under the Bridge\" doesn't have as much diversity or prowess in its execution, and unfortunately, a lot of the comedy falls flat. More on that later. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, these colorful characters are not at all detailed enough, in my opinion. It's not like they have to be since there are plenty of comedy series' out there that don't have three-dimensional characters, but they make up for that in pure wit and amazing comedic chops. With \"Under the Bridge\", there is a specific effort for emotional moments and moments of actual romance, and unfortunately, they all fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is sad because the series is definitely at its best when it is being funny. Even if it isn't always funny. The first episode, also, doesn't feel like anything else in the series because it is substantially better paced and entertaining than anything else in this series, which is somewhat low on highlights and more just showing blips of inspiration a few moments of joy every episode. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Comedy in Anime]\\n\\n\r\nSince I don't have too much to say about this series apart from \"it's okay\" and \"occasionally funny\" and \"somewhat unremarkable\", I rather focus on the broad experience I've had with comedy anime and the \"style\" is is often off-putting for me. I don't even think it is a cultural thing since there are plenty of anime that have had me laugh and there are plenty of Japanese films that are equally hilarious as some of the better productions coming out of Hollywood.\\n\\n\r\nNo, it's something more. It feels like so much comedy in this series, as well as a lot of the comedy anime I've seen hits the same way, with the same delivery, and the same kinds of shots and effects and even voice acting. Honestly, a lot of it seems very repetitive to an almost ludicrous level. \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the way humor is handled at all. Jokes seem to go on for far too long, their punchlines run their course and instead of cutting, they either repeat the punchline or exposit the punchline, which makes it far too obvious and very clunky to sit through. It happens a lot. For example, a scene would lead up to a pretty decent punchline, and then, for no reason other than to explain to the viewer what is happening, the main character or whoever else would just yell out exactly what the punchline was.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I call 'reactionary humor', where the writers try to add another moment of comedic timing and delivery through a character's reaction to the piece of comedy, however, it is so rarely funny. Especially since it is delivered the same way every damn time. It's always yelled loudly with a multi-colored background and action lines. It doesn't look good, it doesn't sound good, and quite honestly, it ruins the joke. \\n\\n\r\nThis problem persists throughout this series and throughout a lot of comedy anime because I guess a wacky face that I've seen a hundred times in a hundred different anime is enough to be a punchline now? So there's the problem, this odd, clashing style really detracts from the punchlines. I suppose it works for many, this very abrasive, loud, and reaction-based style of comedy. However, for me, it really doesn't do anything and \"Under the Bridge\" was brimming with it.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Aesthetic and Sound]\\n\\n\r\nThis is all solid. The SHAFT style is ever present. It feels a bit too much like Monogatari at times, but I suppose that style is what defines studio SHAFT at this point. It is especially jarring when the protagonist, Rec, is voiced by the same VA as Araragi from Monogatari. \\n\\n\r\nThe style here, while visually solid, isn't really necessary. I never felt the indulgent need for it, similar to Monogatari, and it very rarely actually affected the core of the show, which is the comedy. There are some pretty scenes, but in general, the entire show takes place in one, very green, very bridge-oriented location that isn't all too interesting after the first couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both solid, providing something that wasn't outstanding, but definitely is worth noting as a positive for this show's sound. Then again opening and endings in anime tend to blend together for me, so who am I to judge. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's okay. That's the best thing I can say about this series. There were stretches where I was bored and genuinely uninspired by what's happening on screen. There were moments where I enjoyed seeing these characters interact and seeing their little world grow, and there were, very rare moments of actual, laugh-out-loud comedy that was delivered well. Unfortunately, this makes for an unremarkable package that I don't see myself recommending to people who aren't already fans of anime-style reactionary comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDescribing this series, one of my friends called it \"Monogatari-lite\", and in a way, it is. The style is not as interesting, neither are the characters, or the setting, or anything, really, but the presentation is in line with what SHAFT has done with Monogatari and I, for the life of me, can't figure out why. There is no reason to include this kind of aesthetic in a show like this, and SHAFT shouldn't be pigeon-holed into over-relying on their developed style, which was pioneered by Shinbou. They are perfectly capable of utilizing something different like with Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is solid, and the voice acting is generally really unremarkable. The most impressive voice work has to come from Chiwa Saito, who plays the cute young kid, Stella. Thi character is a brat and often changes metaphoric forms, which prompt the VA to have quite a few different inflections for this character that are not only endearing but are bordering on funny, too. \\n\\n\r\n\"Arakawa Under the Bridge\" is a fairly unremarkable series wrapped up in the guise of something better. The style doesn't seem to fit, although it is visually pleasing, and everything from the story to the characters tends to flatline more so than anything else. Even if the characters themselves are well-designed. The attempts at romance fall completely flat due to the totally ridiculous premise, which fits the show's comedic tone but doesn't actually make for a believable romance or likable romantic prospects. The father/son relationship is a bit more interesting but honestly isn't explored enough to call well-done. Overall, it's \"just there\" as a series that I think doesn't do enough to actually maintain interest through the meat of its execution, which is the humor and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe presentation is fine, although ill-fitting, and the music is decent, too. But ultimately, there's a dissonance between what works and what doesn't, and I will always find myself wishing that this series portrayed a more captivating world. \\n\\n",

I liked Bakemonogatari but hated Vampire Bund so when it was Arakawa's turn, I was quite apprehensive of what to expect but from the first episode, this series has surprised me with a twisted storyline and weird characters that turn weirder and weirder still - in a good way though. \r\nOf course, Hiroshi Kamiya and Maaya Sakomoto are total win under the skins of Rec and Nino. Being the main pair, they still have a lot of ground to cover around eachother as Nino's a Venusian(!) and Kou's a stickler for not being indebted. I even like the supporting characters: Star, Chief, Sister, Maria, Stella and P-ko - not in any particular order. \\n\\n\r\nThis is for those who enjoy something different that is much more situation driven rather than character driven. There's lots of comedy and funny moments that make you LOL more than you thought it would. \\n\\n\r\nSo, overall 9 for personal liking of the show.\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 8.5\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n",

            "content": "[Updated: Eps watched -5]\r\nSHAFT is the producer of Bakemonogatari, and uses similar presentation methods in this series. The problem is: Bakemonogatari is more of occult, suspense and mystery while Arakawa Under the Bridge is something like gag humour.\r\nNote: After ep 2, the anime seems to fare better in its own style.\r\nStory:6\r\nTo be honest ep 1 and 2 gave me a headache. A wide variety of characters introduced, the main characters were presented, and tons of poorly used impact-scenes. From ep 3-5 the story seems more smooth and less gag-likke. Which is good, since some fundamentals had finally been touched on.\r\nUnfortunately, too many characters had beenintroduced right from the start, some airtime for each side character sometimes are only a few secs or none at all. Control of characters were pretty good, although overall, the story just seems to be too unstable. Scenes sometimes skipped here and there, little coninuation at times and most importantly, travelling too much between gag, slice of life and romance.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nNormal for SHAFT I believe. Good graphics and animation. But why do bubbles seem to come out anywhere and everywhere? Eye scene is overused, reminds of Bakemonogatari. Certain impact (animation aspect) destroyed the mood for laughter (aka light mood). \\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\\n\r\nOP: Ep1-4's OP's animation was unique, and light, but made relatively no sense in contrast to the series' storyline. Song was good.  Ep 5\\n\r\ns OP seems to be made in a jokingly manner, but was really interesting, some ppl might download the scene and worship it (lols).\\n\\n\r\nED: Both animation and song were good. It introduces several characters from \"under the bridge\". \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was mostly good, but sometimes were over-done, especially the cries of shock from \"Recruit\". \\n\\n\r\nSound usage is gradually getting better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:5\\n\r\nInteresting. But interesting doesn't cut it. Most characters aren't unique in their own right (As in they are not defined by their personalities, more of their physical differences). But some character development has already being done on \"Recruit\", and his past slightly explored into. This is a huge bonus, since we will be seeing him often in the series.\\n\\n\r\nUp to episode 5, we can see some unique personalities, but as usual, side characters get very little scene coverage, as the storyline jumps here and there still. Bad thing here is that too many characters seem to be introduced, and some were rarely utilised. Character development seems to be slowing down.\\n\r\nYes, knowing their personalities is good, but I would prefer to see a deeper character formed than many shallow ones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nUp to ep 2, I really didn't like it much. Cause of the very choppy manner the show was presented. A lot of things were unexplained, impact was used a bit too much, and most importantly, it seemed like serious gag humour.\\n\\n\r\nEp3-5 gradually included more serious scenes, and the story has become much stable (compared to till ep2). More work still needs to be done though, since this show is moving in a few ways, can't decide what genre is it focusing on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:6\\n\r\nOverall, I do wonder how does Recruit live his outside world. Lol, in realistic terms that is completely impossible, since he's a CEO or something.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, I may have wrote my previous review (up to ep 2) a bit too harshly. I do hope this updated review would give you readers a better insight into this series. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading;)",

            "content": "Comedy is a tough aspect to grade, since it is largely subjective in nature. Just because I find Kramer and Jerry arguing about the trajectory of someones spit on Seinfeld hilarious, doesn't mean others will. Likewise, just because someone else finds a guy walking into a woman's bath by incident and getting knocked into the stratosphere for it amusing, certainly doesn't mean I do. \r\nBut, and I think most other people will agree, some of the best comedy is stuff that actually has an underlying message to it. When humor can actively facilitate an overall message that the work in question has, then it allworks on multiple fronts. And, well, this is something that Arakawa Under The Bridge does well.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa starts with the protagonist, Ichinomiya Kou, standing on a bridge completely pants-less. It is here when he meets a rather strange girl known as Nino and it is also here where we learn of his fear of owing anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to anyone what so ever. It is readily apparent from the on set that Kou has some rather deep sitting issues with his father, almost a sort of phobia if you will.\\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. Arakawa is most definitely a comedy first and foremost, but themes such as running away from problems, parental issues, and so on are lightly, and rather effectively,  touched upon during the course of the series. But, it certainly never becomes heavy handed in this matter at all.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Arakawa is a treat with very well done character design, particularly Nino and the other female characters, and just overall interesting visual touches here and there. Shaft has the usual visual touch, but not quite as heavily as Sayanora Sensei, EF, or their other works. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, the musics generally pretty good. But, the voice work in particular is striking with some very big names in the series particularly Sugita Tomokazu (Haruhi, Gintama), Fujiwara Keiji (Baccano, FMA), and many more. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likable, with pretty much every one of them having some sort of..personality quirk. Whether you have the cross dressing \"Sister\", The Kappa costume wearing Village Chief, The rockstar wanna be Star shaped mask wearing Hoshi, the insult throwing Maria, and so on..it's almost guaranteed that you'll find something to amuse you in some form.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my biggest issue with the series, the characters don't change and we just don't learn anything at all about the vast majority of them. Not that Kou doesn't try to learn, it's just that the other characters either avoid his questions or outright lie to him. It's arguable, of course, whether or not this is an actual fault or not...it's just the way these people live their lives and it effectively ties into the central plot point. But, it still hurt my enjoyment a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nAt it's heart Arakawa Under The Bridge is a sort of coming of age story in which Kou tries to come out from under his fathers shadow and live his own life under the bridge. Some of the comedy is random in nature, but most of it seems to hit on the underlying message. It isn't deep stuff, but this series did very effectively what it intended to.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nWell done character designs, good background art, and very consistent animation. The Shaft \"style\" isn't quite as glaringly obvious as most of the shows from the company, except for the OP, ED, and a few other instances. \\n\\n\r\nIt has to be said that Nino is probably one of the most obviously beautiful female characters I've seen. The other female characters are well designed as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSolid music, with well know voice actors doing the same great work they always do. Not much to complain about here. Though, there also isn't anything particularly amazing in this compartment, either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are likable, memorable, funny, and just overall well done. Unfortunately, they go out of their way not to talk about themselves and Kou is pretty much the only character to go through some form of change. Still, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nConsistently funny unlike most comedy series I've seen and the characters are very likable. I enjoyed the message this series brought to the table as well. An easy series to marathon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nMemorable, funny, and many other things. Arakawa is a great comedy series up there with stuff such as FMP: Fumofu, Minami-ke, and a few others. Definitely recommended for those looking for a good time.",

            "content": "When I heard the premise for \"Arakawa\", I was immediately attracted to it. Something so strange, but yet simple. One man living under a bridge, and the small community that he spends his time with. It received plenty of positive reception from the reviewers on MAL, so I dove right in. And what I found was a charming, albeit eccentric slice-of-life that quickly became one of my favorites in the genre.\r\nFirst and foremost, this is a character driven show. By no means will anything happen beyond the two main conflicts (the main character's acceptance into the community, and the other big one, which I won'tmention for the sake of those who have yet to see \"Under the Bridge\"), and your enjoyment of this series will rest solely on your ability to enjoy this type of show.\\n\\n\r\nIf shows like \"Azumanga Daioh\", \"K-On!/!\" or \"Minami-ke\" were your cup of tea, then by all means hop right into AUtB. However, if you fall into the group of individuals who found these shows completely pointless and a waste of your time, you might want to sit this one out. Having said that, this one in particular is heavy on the comedy, and if it can't make even the most stone faced of otaku crack a smile, then give up on life. Or lighten up, life doesn't always have to be about epic battles and heart-wrenching love stories.",

            "content": "Note: This review will cover both seasons.\r\nCommon sense. It is the set of knowledge and comprehension of the world that society expects you to have. Now imagine a place containing a seemingly jumbled society of unique characters where common sense is naught. The phrase itself hasn\u2019t even entered its lexicon. And yet, strangely, the society is perfectly functional. This is the Arakawa riverbed.\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge starts off as a rather bizarre romance. Ichinomiya Kou, a self-proclaimed elite, all-around prodigy, falls into the Arakawa River and nearly drowns. He is saved by Nino, an enigmatic young woman who proclaims that she is a Venusian. However,Kou was always taught to never be indebted to another person, and now, he owes the biggest debt of all to Nino for saving his life. As a result, Nino has a simple yet imposing request: to fall in love and live with her under the bridge. Thus begins one of the most unique romances in anime history.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it had the potential to be anyway. Alas, the romance is awkwardly paced and its progress is minimal. The series is mainly an absurdist gag comedy fueled by the ridiculous antics of its equally ridiculous (but far from unfunny) characters. Despite its interesting, auspicious premise, there really isn\u2019t much of a plot. It just follows the daily lives of the citizens of the Arakawa riverbed. Sure, the second season features the \u201ctrip to Venus\u201d plot, but it was abandoned midway and was rather unfulfilling. That said though, the comedy, on the other hand, is hilarious. Over time, the humor did begin to either stale, feel forced, or just become plain stupid, even by Arakawa\u2019s standards. Certain jokes began to feel predictable. However, at its best, Arakawa had a number of side-splitting moments (in both seasons) where I just burst out laughing uncontrollably. Few anime can do that to me, so I commend Arakawa for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has an eclectic assortment of interesting and peculiar supporting characters. The Village Chief, a man in a green costume who claims to be a 620-year old kappa, despite the obvious zipper running down his back, and also gives each person living in the Arakawa riverbed their name (Kou becomes \u201cRecruit\u201d or \u201cRic\u201d). Sister, a bellicose yet ironically calm muscle-man who dresses like a nun. Hoshi, a man wearing a star-shaped mask who vies for Nino\u2019s affection. These are just some of the oddities you\u2019ll find in Arakawa, and most of them, save a few (such as the Amazoness), are endearing characters. A few characters do get tiring after a while though, especially since some of the gags become overused.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is fairly limited. Kou gets the most since he\u2019s the one forced to adapt to new conditions, and we also learn quite a bit about Hoshi, but no one else other than Nino, who ultimately remains an enigma even after the second season, gets much development. Given the nature of the show, that\u2019s fine, but I really would have liked to see more from the Chief and Nino. You see, Arakawa contains some unexpectedly dark implicit themes. They are subtle, but they include failure, rejection, and disillusionment from society and reality. These are people living under a bridge, away from society, after all. They must have some sort of dark past, as evidenced by Hoshi. Understanding the Chief\u2019s reasons for establishing this place and deliberately lying about his true self is key to understanding this society. Maybe that\u2019s too deep for a comedy as outrageous as this, but Arakawa also likes to insert some philosophical crap in the beginning of each episode, so maybe not\u2026? Either way, with its premise, I definitely wanted to learn about Nino\u2019s past and the truth behind her Venusian origins. Unfortunately, the second season never resolves what it starts and the Venus storyline is instead replaced by a shitty fighting tournament.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the animation is a bit inconsistent. It can be crisp and beautiful, but it can also be dull and uninspired at times. Also, whenever a character is walking directly towards or away from the camera, they never seem to gain any distance. I know this has been a problem in many anime in the past, but you would think animation studios would have figured out how to correct this by now. Furthermore, there\u2019s an odd tendency for the animators to zoom in on people\u2019s eyes, especially Kou\u2019s. As for the music, it\u2019s average and very forgettable, except for the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s. I don\u2019t generally care much for OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s, but these ones are notable. The two ED\u2019s by Suneohair are fantastic indie rock songs, and in fact, I have one of the songs, \u201cSakasama Bridge\u201d from the first season, on my iPod, one of only two songs from anime on it. The OP\u2019s are both decent pop listens as well.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Arakawa is a hilarious comedy with an enjoyable, intriguing cast of characters. The humor of the second season does drop in quality and become more hit-or-miss, but there are still a few laugh-out-loud moments that are sure to please. As a comedy, this is one of the funniest anime I\u2019ve seen. But if you\u2019re expecting the mystery behind Nino to be answered, you\u2019re in for a disappointment. While the possibility for a third season is viable, since the manga is still ongoing, I don\u2019t think the humor can take another hit.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8",

            "content": "Thanks for taking the time to read my review of Arakawa Under the Bridge! \r\nStory: I found the premise of the show to be very intriguing. After the first episode, however, it's clear that the main focus of the story is the people who live under the bridge. While Ko and Nino bond throughout the series, Ko's interactions with the secondary characters are the main attraction. The short mini-story format to each episode helps keep the whole feeling of the show light and easy-going.\r\nArt: An interesting mix of styles are used throughout the series. You have some very beautiful backgrounds and character portrayal during themore moving parts, and silly faces for almost every other time. The constant switching suits the zany feel of the show. The character designs are all varied, and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song is very upbeat and cute. The background music and sound effects were suitable for the various situations Ko found himself in. The voice acting was excellent, and I think the actors captured the feeling of their characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The cast is an interesting collection of weirdos. I loved the different histories, personalities and energy each player brought to the show. Whether it was Star's constant competing with Ko, or Sister's \"badass nun with guns and cookies\" attitude, each character was a pleasure to watch. I was not surprised by the lack of character development, since the crew is so zany; any attempt to change them would take away form the fact that they are all so strange. Ko goes through some development, and the second-to-last episode was very touching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Not really reading anything about the show, I went into it thinking it would be more dramatic, or romantic. I was happily surprised by the more comical, slice-of-life approach. I was laughing every episode, and I really enjoyed watching Arakawa!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Arakawa Under the Bridge:\\n\\n\r\nhilarious, random, silly, weird, touching",

            "content": "Life is the crazily raging river running from past to future. There is a bridge called society and expectations that lets us cross over the river, should we, like most people take it. \r\n----\r\nThe story of  'Arakawa under the bridge' revolves around male protagonist Ichinomiya Ko, born with a silver spoon in his mouth, an elite of society in every regard (good at everything), and has strong family tradition to never rely on anyone. The opening episode is him on this bridge crossing over the river. Much like how he is progressing forward, but crossing over what true \"life\" is. \r\nIn an unexpected turnof events, Ko meets the female protagonist Nino who saves his life. Feeling indebted to Nino, Ko attempts to pay her back and follow the family policy of never relying on anyone. Oddly enough, Love becomes the one thing that bind Ko to Nino. The other residents of the river are slowly introduced and thus begins the crazy daily happenings of Life under the bridge as Ko learns about himself and people under the bridge, develops to a different human being, and as he fights of his father's plots to take him back. \\n\\n\r\nThe only flaws to the story I found was that it didn't quite settle on a solid \"plot\" or a \"slice of life\" direction. Many episodes seemed to be uncorrelated and had no continues plot, while other had more serious plot ideas (ie. v.s the Ichinomiya group). If there was a more serious direction it may have been more easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the series is quite beautifully and uniquely done, particularly as it involved drawing irregular characters, like buff nuns, frequently. Directed by Akiyuki Shinobu (Negima!, Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei), and animated by Shaft Studio (Monogatari, Negima!, Sayonary Zetsubo Sensei) I expected no less than absolute quality, which they did deliver.\\n\\n\r\nThe clarity of the animation style (thicker outlines) combined with the environmental designs had me hooked from the beginning. The detail used in the setting (the bridge, river, grass) was exceptional, but cannot be compared to Makoto Shinkai (5cm per second). Overall, I really enjoyed Shaft's output and consistency in animating the odd characters while maintaining environmental clarity and integrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issues i found with the animation was the lack of diversity in environment. This may be a \"me only\" thing, but I found that they used the same settings for pretty much everything, that the \"backdrop\" for a scene \"here\" or scene \"there\" would be used over and over. It'd barely noticeable, but for me I'd like to have a larger diversity of areas.\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the series never disappointed me. To begin, OP \"Venus to Jesus\" by Etsuko Yakushimary caught my ear. The opening had a very unique feel to it and the song is a bit awkward but yet sounds great. It caught me unexpectedly as I'm usually exposed to the more clich\u00e9 opening (ie. j-rock/hip). Aside from the tender opening, the ending was interesting as well with \"upside-down bridge\" by Suneohair producing a contrast from the opening, but really helped to close the episode off. The random OP in a certain episode also added to the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound throughout the series was great, background themes worked well and weren't over used, coupled with the character voicing that were consistent with the characters made this series have the irregular slice of life atmosphere I appreciate. It also helped to mediate the plot in areas where silence or other themes would've been awkward. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issues I found with the \"sound\" was that nothing really \"stood out\" beyond what is said above. There isn't the strong immortalized emotional melodies during emotional scenes, or distinct \"theme\" music for characters per se. \\n\\n\r\n------\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a broad and diverse bunch who carried unique pasts (most of which we'll never know about) and who provide very critical social commentary. A brief introduction of the characters will prove to show the diversity and commentary.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist Ichinomiya Ko, nicknamed \"Ric\" or \"recruit\" is the new addition to the riverbank and the story flows showing his development as he expressed the usual and societal ideologies of \"life\" and \"values\". Being, in reality, a super successful elite, he represents what regular people aspire to. Oddly enough in the upsidedown world of Arakawa, he is meerly the a \"leech\" in the least. His confrontations with his short comings and with other things he finds valuable in life are the key points of his developement and will keep you thinking. Voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya (Teiria-Gundam00, Izaya-Durara, etc), the expressions of Ko to situations is diverse and draws attention and sympathies.\\n\\n\r\nFemale protagonist, Nino, is the self proclaimed Venusian who brings Ko, as a lover into the group. Little is known about her and her past. But she expresses the purest form of humanity, much like a child she accepts things and takes things oddly seriously. Her love for Ko is uniquely expressed and her lack of expression makes her very interesting to watch. She directly contrasts Ko in both values and traditions as she knows seemingly nothing of the surface world, or its values. She knows of love and caring for other people, sometimes blissfully ignorant of many facts. Her comments about Ko's responses to kindness, or forcing him to show it provide insightful commentary for how society perceives those around them. \\n\\n\r\nThe village chief, or the kappa,  is a self proclaimed Kappa who is obviously some guy in a costume. The general hilarity of seeing a character completely believing in their own decided existence makes him fun to watch, particularly how his character does not change. Kappa, dare I say represents nature or the earth. Part of life, yet barely recognized (and recognized less and less though the years). \\n\\n\r\nHoshi, or Star, is the rival of Ko for the love of Nino. He is also a musician. The comedy of him and Ko's onesided rivalry is fun to watch in itself. But, truly it is his expressions in situations and how he completely delves into the world of Arakawa and combines it into his rivalry that is the most interesting. I think he is a major reason that Ko is able to integrate into the community, and an even greater reason that Ko is able to truly appreciate Nino. Hoshi represents one extreme of expressionism, muscianship. In society, those that pursue music to an over extent are critqued and excluded. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters that are introduced each present their own very unique expressions of reality and uniqueness. Each commenting on individual ghosts of past and on societal reconciliation with said people. For the sake of length, I've excluded an indepth analysis of the other Characters:\\n\r\n- Sister (the Military male Nun)\\n\r\n- P-ko (the cute gardener girl)\\n\r\n- Iron Twins (the two kids with iron helmets)\\n\r\n- Maria ( sadist, and farmer)\\n\r\n- Stella (the little girl)\\n\r\nand other minor characters (Takai, Billy, Jacqueline, Last Samurai, Shimazaki, father Ichinomiya, etc). \\n\\n\r\nIf you'd like to hear my opinion about these characters please PM me.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw I found was that the characters were used very \"on and off\" the only character that was used consistently was Ko (expectedly). There are episodes that will no even touch upon characters for a long time. Billy, Jacqueline, and Last Samurai for example, do not even get fully introduced until the last episode of this season. \\n\\n\r\n------\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series, not only because it had me laughing, crying, or nervous at the right times, but rather because of it's awkward uniqueness that resonates with the human soul. I started this series hoping for nice rom-com, which is supplies, but I found a deeper social commentary in the series. I was, throughout the series, reflecting on where my sympathies lie, and like any other anime fan ... What would I do if I met these characters in reality? \\n\\n\r\nThe abnormalities of the people in the series, in real life, would be the people we deem to be crazy, that we can't spend another day with. Indeed, having done lots of work with people in poverty, there are many people with delusions out there. In reality, we cast them aside, or rather acknowledge their insanity. Even though they live in crazy communities, we neglect their reality. \\n\\n\r\nSo when did crazy become so normal? I don't know at what point in the series that I finally accepted the Mayor as being a Kappa, or that Hoshi was a star, or Nino was actually from Venus. In fact, near the end I became part of Arakawa, finding Ko's surface level ignorance to be odd, finding that Ko was the crazy one. \\n\\n\r\nSo this was most enjoyable to me because It actually made me realize how immersed is was in the world or Arakawa.\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an amazing first season. PM me if you have any thoughts or comments about my review. I hope you check this series out. \\n\\n",

I do know this, it had me laughing like a maniac the first episode through and if an anime can do that, it's worth watching to the end. I like that it's really just weird and the characters ae weird, but behind everything it's just a kind of oddball romance and it's cute to see the interaction between Rec and Nino, especially how Nino teaches Rec a few things without her even noticing. I think this is going to be a cute comedy witha nice romantic underlining. I can't wait to see it develop further. Plus, it can be funny as hell.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8- Oddball comedy with a romance lining. FUNNY.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7-8- I'm on the fence here. Some shots of Nino are stunning, and some scenes are beautiful. But it's not consistent. And Rec looks odd most of the time, though he has his fair share of 'good' shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: -- Again, not paying much attention. The OP is cute though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7-8- They've already introduced a good bit of weird characters, and Rec gets some back-story right off the bat, but really I'm curious to learn about all the other characters!

The humour comes mostly from its weird cast of characters, which often results into something called \u2018dry humour\u2019.\r\nThe characters make this show great for me. They are unique in their own way and I mean this, they are very unique. They are a bunch of weird people living under a bridge, and without a doubt, they believe everything they do is the most normal thing ever and I love it. Theylive in peace with one another even though they differ so much. They are accepting a person for who they are which is a wonderful thing. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it even more enjoyable is how you were expecting a sort of normal main character getting his life thrown around by these weird people, but he is weird himself. How amusing. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is all about its comedy, but there is a certain amount of character development in it. There is more to this show than meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nSo the conclusion is, everyone with a taste for dry humour will enjoy this thoroughly. \\n",

I just felt in love with the OP song and the ending song is really nice...........you will find a very decent voice acting in this anime\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER[7]: One word that describes the character is \"Decent' nothing much to say in this field Every character is very funny you will enjoy them\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT[8]: this is the only thing that kept me hooked up to this anime till the very end and not to mention the OP song I just love it without any doubt one of my favourite OP song ever but not sure if I should start the second season or not\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nif you are looking for some decent comedy which defies logic and plot then go for it.....   but if you are looking for some romance or some serious plot then go somewhere else \\n\r\nyou have come to the wrong place",

And th soundtrack is AWESOME, i listen to the ending song of season 1 almost every day. Suneohair FTW!!!\r\nThis show is one of the most fun and random shows i've seen, and it was a great time watching the MC adaptto life going from the rich kid life to living under a bridge with other bridge dweller cats. \\n\\n\r\nOkay besides all that, this show is SO troll funny humour, weird relationships between characters, and a very wide variety of the kinds of characters, and there something i guess you could call character development in this show, (i dont even know what happens to some of the characters over the course of the show LOL.) \\n\\n\r\nGreat watch, would recommend to someone who is looking for some laughs, a charming cutesy show (it has its moments i promise,) and some ideas from your parents that just might make you think a little bit..",

I strongly recommend it, definetly one of the best pieces of art i will ever see or feel in my heart.\r\nCharacters in this anime are crazy enough to laugh a while and to tell you the story, so do not worry about being bored while watching. Never skip reflectionsat the start, they really add a deeper sense to everything, and maybe if you just see it as a normal comedy anime you have not understood everything.\\n\\n\r\nTake your time to watch this hearthwarming story, if I had the opportunity to watch it again I would do it without asking.

The art is the usual anime style but with occasional flourishes of color and pop art cuts with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about the characters under the bridge interacting with one another, usually with Kou playing the straight-man within the interaction or being teased. Other than that, not much actually happens in terms of a plot or characterization. There might be little hints here and there of the characters and what they are doing under the bridge but mainly not much happens. I could definitely see this being a problem for someone that really wants a plot or experience a story. However, that's not what this anime is for. This anime is for when you don\u2019t want to think about stuff like school, work, personal problems, or atrocities that happen to people all the time and just want to unwind. For that purpose, I find it's perfect. \\n",

Is this show hilarious? Absolutely. \r\nAnd those confused with the romance genre tag: It's not a romantic-comedy like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, but rather a comedy-romance, focused much on the first part than the latter.\r\nBut would I recommend this series to anybody I see? Yes. But would I recommend them to finish both seasons... No. In fact, I'd actually tellthem to drop this mid-series for a reason I will explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is the type of comedy I just couldn't see coming. It mainly comes from characters who just blow expectations you'd see from an anime. But this type of anime has a critical flaw. As you watch more of this kind, the element of surprise dwindles, making each successive episode less funny than the rest. I've come to a problem with this section as I was watching the second season, and the comedy just wasn't fresh anymore. Either take a break from this series while you watch this or drop it. This isn't the best show for binge watching IMO.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the element of surprise is fresh, the story is a 9/10. But with more exposure, it just becomes an average routinical comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Works fine to tell the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nBeing a comedy, there just isn't need for many background tracks (although Konosuba revealed how much vibrance it could bring with just soundtracks). One thing that Kinda bugged me throughout the series was the fact that the VA for Kou was VA for Araragi and I just wasn't able to get Araragi out of my mind for the first few episodes. Well, it might be just me every time I hear Hiroshi Kamiya's voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe way that these characters are just out of the Earth (and one literally) is what makes this entire comedy work.\\n\r\nThere is a diverse spectrum of characters, all of which are perfectly suited for comedy. And what is fantastic about this series that even the side characters have importance in the comedy, unlike how some cliche anime just throws them away or kills them for 3 seconds of emotion. Those who live under the Arakawa Bridge will make you laugh, I'm sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nPretty funny series overall. No complaints. I wouldn't say that this is the masterpiece of comedy, but it made me just laugh really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nFunny and above average anime that just makes you wonder what would happen next.\\n\r\nBut drop this series once you feel like this gets repetitive. I personally gave a lower score to the second season because it just didn't feel as funny anymore. It wasn't much different from the first season, but being exposed to the characters for quite some time didn't make the series as funny as it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nTL DR; Funny series that is an expert at the element of surprise. However, it will fade as you watch more episodes, and I'd recommend dropping this series once the comedy starts to feel like a routine.",

            "content": "So I actually saw this show quite a while ago, but avoided it because of the \"low\" rating of 7.7. Normally this wouldn't matter very much, but judging from the type of show this was, it seemed like a mediocre comedy with a generic life lesson. And you know what, I can totally see how that's true for a lot of people. However, this show really struck a chord with me. If you like the random humor of (older) Gintama and the artsy feel to Bakemonogatari (aka Shaft), then you will at least not regret watching this show. In order to truly enjoy it, however,I think you need to have some experience with rejecting society. And I'm not talking about people who are picked on for being different--I'm talking about the other way around. I'll go into this in more detail in the character section, but I think this is why the show was a hit for me and a miss for others. Also, this is my first review... so bear with me!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nThis show is not plot driven, so it's difficult for me to score it according to story. The scenario in itself is good, and it was well executed so that you can seamlessly accept the way things play out. However, there's no obvious progression of events. It's just like a slice of life--the daily shenanigans of these weirdos as they live day to day. To be fair, things are tied together by two things: 1) the romance between Rec and Nino 2) Rec's transformation as he slowly accepts and in turn is accepted by the Arakawa community/family. But this progression is slow and gradual and random--just like real life! Honestly, the weakest part of the story was the last few episodes regarding Rec's father. I enjoyed the occasional flashbacks/hints at Rec's relationship with his father, but I felt the show would have done better to continue its nonlinear explication vs turning to the standard format; it just didn't fit with the rest of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art, with no real complaints (although I'm not an expert). The typical artsy style of shaft was well done, and it nicely added to the surreal environment of the Arakawa community. In general, I thought the show did a wonderful job of visually communicating the emotions of the characters and mood of the setting. Also, the little bits with live action Chief were great--it's easy to forget how ridiculous something in an anime would look until you see it in real life. Although I'm not saying much, I really did think the art was beautiful, and I like Shaft's style anyway (dat head tilt), so that's why I gave it a 9/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music didn't seem special, but the voice acting was spectacular! There was lot's of great talent (not just Tomokazu Sugita!), and I felt they really made the comedy hit home. Every character had a strong personality, and the voice actors really made those personalities come alive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nAh, the best part. The characters were my favorite part of this show--as they should have been, since this show was character driven. I've read quite a few people say that these characters were all cookie cutter... but I disagree. Although you could place pretty much all the characters into one of the common \"types,\" I think that doesn't make them bad characters. In fact, I think the types just reflect the types of people there are! To me, none of the characters seemed bound to a stereotype... it just seemed like the stereotype fit the kind of person they happened to be: the musician/artist who thinks he's better than he his, the salary man who runs away and distracts himself with an obsession/hobby, the guy who acts like a total idiot but actually hides a little wisdom. Even if their delusions or idiosyncrasies went beyond what is encountered in real life (in all but the most extreme cases), it was the right amount of exaggeration necessary for an anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nBut what was really genius about the show was that these people all chose to leave society of their own volition. Of course, they wouldn't have wanted to leave it they weren't already a misfit, but they were the ones who ran away--they were not cast out. They decided that the \"real world\" was no good, and so they left to live in their own little world. And I think this is why I really loved these characters--they had obviously experienced hardship... real hardship... and instead of facing it head on, they did what a lot of people do: they ran away, not only physically (by being homeless) but also mentally (by having delusions). Furthermore, one can easily see the common thread of human-ness that ties everyone together despite the superficial insanity. All the relationships have a level of depth and authenticity that makes a crazy show feel strangely real. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I've seen people complain about is the lack of character development (with a couple exceptions). However, I think that this is actually just another strength of the show. It's good to see the growth of Rec--he is the main character and this experience MUST change him. However, the other characters (except for Nino with her first love) have had no significant lifestyle change; there's no reason for an obvious change. This show is not showing how Rec's new life changed him and those around him--it's showing Rec's evolution as he starts understanding the strange new people he meets. The show slowly reveals the complexity behind the side characters that already exists rather than giving them new depth through \"character development.\" Of course, if the show were to continue for a long time, then some change would be necessary--it's just that I see no need for change within the short time frame of these 13 episodes (also we can't see change if we don't even fully understand the character in the first place!).\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI really liked this show a lot. I connected to the characters, and I truly felt their humanity shine through all the craziness. It had a really nice message that wasn't just \"be yourself\" (although that was one message)--it was also about how people can find happiness even after going through hardship. There's no reason to be serious and depressed if things don't go your way--you can start a new life and enjoy it for what it is! It's okay to forget your problems for a little while and be silly; it's okay to do things differently; it's okay to run away a little bit... Of course, there still needs to be some degree of responsibility, but I think the show does make this point as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 was because the message didn't feel very powerful. I think it was an important message, I think it was well done, and I did shed a tear or two, but I never felt that this show changed my life. It was very well done and very touching, but I can't say that its impact was strong enough to justify a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI really liked this show, and I think anybody who likes goofy comedy with a touch of surrealism will enjoy it too. However, I can see why some would get bored if they're looking for a more plot-driven/action filled/\"intelligent\" anime. But I still think it's worth a try no matter what!",

So, the story is absolutely ridiculous, all the characters are crazy ( I mean , they live under the bridge without any reason to do so ) and there is no main plot, there is a lot of smaller stories and thoughts that we follow. How, you ask, is it possible that this anime is even watchable let alone enjoyable? It's really simple, the key is in thesimplicity of the story. Each episode is filled with comedy and ridiculousness and it is amazing how fast the episode ends. You just go with the flow. On the first glance, the anime doesn't really look promising, but believe me, as the episodes go by, you will see more and more of the deep thougts that are hidden behind the daily lives of our citizens under the bridge.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt is mainly good, I remeber there were a few scenes where it could have been better, but all in all I enjoyed the way the characters were designed and the backgrounds were beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound in this anime is perfect, it really matches all the scenes. I especially loved the ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the key point of this anime. Each character is explained through the episodes, and each has his own share of circumestances. As our mc is \"normal\" among them all, we are watching the acts of the other citizens under the bridge from his point of view. The more he spends time with the bunch under the bridge, the more he begins to question all that he took for granted, even the meaning of being 'normal'. Mc is the character that really develops throughout the series and that is what I liked the most. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI laughed throughout the whole series, I really enjoyed the character development  and  I loved the way the story was told - simple but brilliant.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really think that being able to tell deep thoughts in a comedy with crazy characters and even crazier events, in which our mc is frequently found, is a talent in itself. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a laugh or a good slice of life anime with a little bit of romance in it.",

            "content": "After two big disappointments with Soul Eater and Occult Academy I decided on watching 2 respected animes yesterday. One which has been very good so far, Durara!! (I only watched 12 episodes so far) and the other which is very good, but that could've been a masterpiece - Arakawa Under The Bridge. Before anyone says anything I didn't watch the 2nd season. I'm just analyzing the first season for what it was.\r\n*Note: I've finished watching the 2nd season and it's exactly the same as the 1st. A little bit more boring, actually, but it's still enjoyable.*\r\nAn overly proud man who accepts no favors fromanybody is saved by a self-proclaimed Venusian woman. He can't feel at ease unless he pays her back. What she asks in return is nothing else than to be loved. Ko (the man) agrees with her and is then forced on start living under the bridge with Nino (the girl). He then, finds out that there are many other people living under the bridge. The first one he meets, the mayor (a guy wearing a kappa costume) names him Recruit and thus, his life with Nino under the bridge starts.\\n\\n\r\nI must say, the first two episodes were perfect. Full of comedy, interesting twists and the promise of one of the best plots you could find in an anime. But it stopped there. \\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who felt like that while watching it. I truly believe that lots of other viewers were expecting a lot of character development, such as the reasons why those people decided to live there, what happened in their past and why most of them try hiding their real identity (Star is the only one with some consistent background in the whole first season). I must admit that I was also expecting some romance development, which is really rare for me in a series. I thought Ko and Nino made a really interesting couple, and think they could have provided some unique moments during the first season. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this was my major let down with Arakawa. After watching the first two episodes I thought I was about to watch a masterpiece for sure, but their resolution on focusing on the comedy only and on some cliche situations (like the conflict between Ko and his father) was a definite waste, in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI won't deny that I enjoyed watching it a lot. Despite the average story, the art is really beautiful with expressive characters and beautiful landscapes. The seiyuus did an amazing work as well, even when the other sound aspects weren't that special: an okay soundtrack, op & ed.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been a masterpiece. I hope the second season makes amends for the first one.",

I really enjoyed the relationships that the characters formed supported by the uniqueness of the characters themselves. Those who enjoy the 'feeling' of the first episode will be pleased to hear that the later episodes hold the same feeling. \r\nThe storyline followed a blurry line that seemed to stray from the 'main progression'  though looking back after watching the whole series those straying episodes did not run too far offthe path and helped to progress the story, if only a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all extremely unique in their design but hold a sense of familiarity. As with most  stories of any kind, they are the embodiment of targeted emotions or characteristics that we all have (nothing new there) however, what makes them unique is their actions and trains of thought are frighteningly easy to make sense of. The best way to describe the character dynamic is the the main character unknowingly falls into one of the mad hatter's tea parties.\\n\\n\r\nAll said, this anime is a light one but one to watch, have a laugh, and forget about how hard life is for a few episodes with all of the characters' mind-numbing antics (in a good way).",

There was also an interesting back story for the main character, Rec, as well as for his love interest, Nino. However, I felt like the second season ended without much resolution. I was left with so many questions still unanswered. I wish there was a third season!\r\nArt:\r\nDecent. There were some pretty moments, especiallywhen it came to the scenery in the background, but the art for the characters was nothing extraordinary. Still, I've seen far worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is mainly a comedy, so the intro and credit music were nothing stunning, just funny and up-beat to fit the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAgain, I felt that Rec and Nino began to be developed into interesting, dynamic characters, but I think the series ended just short of its full potential. The supporting characters were hilarious and charming, though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWatching Arakawa is a great way to pass an afternoon. I was amused the entire time and I laughed a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would recommend watching this anime as long as you are looking for something light-hearted and quick.

However, it's proved to be much more than that to me. Arakawa presents an environment packed full of character development and relationships that simply draw the viewer in.\r\nArakawa has a large amount of characters, and the story, for me, revolves around how all the characters branch out and form relationships with eachother, but the truly unique aspect of Arakawa to me is the way the that relationships... grow. \r\nIn the first few episodes, I thought that the romance between ric and nino wasjust a forced, cold,  and unloving one, which I also believed would eventually lead to the show's demise. However, their relationship quickly strengthens and as the story progresses,you start to feel the love and romance between the two. Along with ric and nino, Arakawa develops relationships between all of the characters - in a very dynamic way.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching Arakawa Under The Bridge, the viewer is drawn into the hearts of each character and faces the obstacles presented to the cast while they make their residence under a great bridge that they like to call home.",

            "content": "Anime: Arakawa Under the Bridge (Season 1 & 2)\r\nGenre: Comedy, Romance\r\nAge Rating: Good for All\r\nStudio: Shaft\r\nMusic: Hoshi\r\nAuthor: Hikaru Nakamura\r\nDub/Sub: Subtitles\r\nEcchi Level: Conservative\r\nOoOoO\r\nThe story starts off with Kou Ichinomiya, a traumatized young man who has had it beaten into his head by his father that the only way to live life successfully is to never be in anyone's debt. So when a young girl by the name of Nino saves his life, he tries to bribe her to cancel what he owes. When she rejects his offer however, in a fit of madness, he asks her if there is any way he can pay her back.And much to his surprise (and my own), she asks if he'll teach her about love.\\n\\n\r\nThe result is the pair of them becoming \"lovers.\" And I used that with the lightest possible definition of the word. Because seriously, I've seen the Amish make more progress than this pair. That aside, he decides to move into the area in order to get to know his new lover better, and finds out that she lives with some pretty crazy characters. There's a kappa, a star man, a pair of twins wearing armored helmets, a cocatoo and a bee woman (best romance of the whole series tbh), a haircutting samurai, a man dressed as a nun, a lolita killing machine, a ditzy farmer, a man with a very restricted walking pattern, and a psychopathic rancher.\\n\\n\r\nIf I'm going to be honest about this series, I chuckled quite a bit. But I never outright laughed. Maybe that's just me, but this is my review, so take that as you will. The chaos that can come from having a fairly diverse cast like this can definitely churn a few laughs out of anyone, but it doesn't seem to do so for me if it's unfocused. And my kami is this anime unfocused. This is one of the few anime I've ever seen where the script could have been made up solely by spinning a prize wheel. The only plot we have up to this point is the whole \"lovers\" angle, a few jealous people, and the strange story about Nino's heritage. Other than that, you'd likely be better off spilling over a can of Alphabet Soup to try and predict where it's going. There's a bit of plot gravity at the end of season 1, but out of two seasons, that's not much.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing this series gets a gold star for is it's references. Season 1 Episode 1 there's a Phoenix Wright reference, and I fucking loved it. There are also other videogame and anime references that I will let you find on your own. Other than that, nothing stuck out to me besides a diverse cast. The music, the animation...oh, and about the subtitles, there are some instances where they shift away before anyone except maybe Lucy from Fairy Tail to read. It rarely happens, but it is a thing that happens.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of those issues, this anime commits one of the worst sins an anime can commit. The one enraging sin that has been done by only one other anime on my review list to date. This anime has MORE SCENES AFTER THE CREDITS! Not \"Next time on Arakawa Under the Bridge!\" But actual pieces of the anime sliced off and placed after the credits. I hate this, and it needs to stop forever. I shouldn't have to worry about whether I missed something after watching the full episode. This isn't a goddamn Marvel movie.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to go ahead and speed ball the last few issues I had with the series below to make it easier for you.\\n\\n\r\n~Some characters are repeat characters. They're the same character type that has already been used in the series before, just copied and pasted over a new one.\\n\r\n~Some characters just vanish. There was one character introduced early on in season 2 that seemingly just disappeared into nothingness. No explanation whatsoever.\\n\r\n~ZERO...RESOLUTION...AT ALL! I'll go more into this in the spoilers section, but it's the truth, and it's infuriating.\\n\r\n~There's this thing that the series does...where it shows a closeup of an eye with a clicking sound, and it milks the fucking hell out of this so much it makes me want to twitch.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest can be found in spoilers. Enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It's not a bad anime, it just doesn't seem to have any direction whatsoever. If you can turn your brain off and enjoy the laughs, then go for it. But for me personally, I don't like there being no resolution at all. Even FLCL (Fooly Cooly), one of the biggest names in the anime genre of \"What the fuck is happening right now!?\" had direction and resolution. This does not. So, as long as you're fine with zero questions being answered, and nothing every progressing, then it's not a bad time. Also, it's the least romantic \"romance\" anime that I've seen in a while, so don't expect much to come from that. From what I can tell, the manga stopped over 2 years ago, so this may be all we get. So that's a thing you have to come to terms with if you want to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nOoOoO\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER TALK:\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Jaqueline. Because ever since Dark Stalkers, something about a lady in a bee costume gets me going. Honestly, I did like Nino, but with no character resolution for her, I just can't see myself giving it to her.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER TALK: If you decided to skip to this part to find out what you'd be missing out on by watching this series, then welcome! Here's a rundown for you.\\n\\n\r\n~The kappa is a guy in a suit, but we never see what he actually looks like.\\n\r\n~The kappa is a guy in a suit, but we never find out why he wears the suit.\\n\r\n~Why does Hoshi's mask come in two layers?\\n\r\n~Why does Hoshi wear his mask almost every second of every day?\\n\r\n~What does Hoshi look like under the mask?\\n\r\n~Is Noni actually Venusian? Or is she just crazy?\\n\r\n~Who the fuck are the twins and do they actually have psychic powers?\\n\r\n~Who the fuck is Maria and why can she take out a rock mid-air with a knife?\\n\r\n~It goes out of its way to show us that the kappa and star man are just costumes, but then shows us an actually man-ckatoo?\\n\r\n~Who was the guy that threatened Shimazaki? I assumed it was Chief, but it was never elaborated on?\\n\r\n~Was he also the same guy who fixed the issue at the end of season 1?\\n\r\n~Why in Kami's name does Takai act like a love sick tsundere if he just wants to act as Rec's father figure?\\n\r\n~Why must Amazoness insist on wearing makeup?\\n\r\n~Will Shiro's wife actually turn into a Chornish Hen if he stepps off of the color white?\\n\r\n~Where the fuck did Nino's bed come from?\\n\r\n~Why is Billy so fucking awesome?\\n\r\n~Where the fuck did the Earth Defense guy go?\\n\r\n~How did Rec build a goddamn house on top the bridge pillar practically overnight?\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there are more, but these are the ones that I just shotgunned off the top of my head. If you watch, you'll probably catch a lot more. Or if you have watched, then I'm probably missing some here. But as it stands, I can't recommend this to anyone who wants more than just junkfood qualities from their anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, kudos to you if you caught the joke at the top of the review. Because for the fucking life of me I couldn't find out who the Music Director was.",

The character is superb because everyone is unique on its own.\r\nWell, let me give you a bit of a clue about what this show is all about\r\n\"A man on a journey to find what the true meaning of common sense\". I mean, if everyone you encounter was hundredth as crazy as these characters,you'll go insane as well. The comedy revolves around comic relief and gag. There's also good romance here and there slip in between.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I think this is a good comedy show if you like something around the concept of \"Gintama\" and \"Monogatari\"",

            "content": "Another great anime produced by SHAFT, this along with sayonara zetsubou sensei and bakemonogatari is just awesome work from the studio. The humour is sort of non cliche and I enjoy it very much, those who are familiar with sayonara zetsubou sensei might get a feel to it, not exactly similar, but both unique in its own way. The romance element added into the story adds colour to the whole anime in a very organized way, can't seem to find a proper word to explain that sorry but in description, there is not too much emphasize on it but just enough in somewhat creating anamusing plot. The anime just gives you a feel of a faint plot with all the humour but along the way there appears to be more to it, remains a mystery to me still, I haven't touch the manga so I can't be too sure with the plot involved however, that only made the anime much much more enjoyable to me. women claims to be an alien, man claims to be a kappa, man dressed as a nun, man claiming to be a star, as in the stars you see in the skies I will leave the rest to your imaginations. Now more on the characters, I am surprised how every single character in the anime is very interesting, even those with minor screen time, every single one compliment the humour in the story and just gives you a random and mysterious feel on all of them and as the story progresses, hints of history is revealed on some of the characters and the indirect and random approach is very smart. Honestly I enjoy every single episode, but it is just me, I am captured by arakawa under the bridge's pretty art, great soundtrack, the voice actors are very good, I think the main character ichinomiya kou is voiced by the same person who voiced Itoshiki Nozomu (sayonara zetsubou sensei), the humour is top notch, I find the faint-like plot very clever and the characters are amazing. Overall, this is a clever and hilarious anime and is definitely worth a watch, no harm will come to you, I promise. ;)",

            "content": "[English and Spanish review]\r\n[English]\r\nWhy should you watch Arakawa?\r\nBecause one thing that I love about anime is that it always surprise me with creative and original stories: this is one of that. The clash of two worlds: the main character, a CEO with daddy issues that is only worried about work, money and success, meets a girl who lives under the bridge and her \"weird\" neighbors (but what is \"weird\"?). \r\nThe animation is so fast that you cannot even blink: each second you get a new image, with different colours, desing, perspective, emotion (I'm not an expert so it's difficult to explain!) so you have tobe very focused! Amazing soft colours.\\n\r\nAnd of course, it's a comedy! and a really funny one, with an absurd humor. But don't think it just jokes... the beggining of every episode there is a deep short reflexion about human life.\\n\r\nFinally, one notable thing in my opinion: Arakawa is not the main character's name. Arakawa is the name of the river under the bridge.  IT is the true main character. Think about that when you watch it!\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I love it?\\n\r\nI love every single character, except the main one! (weird!) but it is the necessary other side of the mirror. I guess I see things about myself that I don't like on him  (like the daddy issues). So you might get to know more about yourself watching this anime, which are you life goals, what are the real important things in life. And it is hilarious. The only negative aspect: I don't like the opening!\\n\\n\r\n[Spanish]\\n\r\nPor qu\u00e9 hay que ver Arakawa?\\n\r\nPorque una cosa que amo del anim\u00e9 es que siempre me sorprende con historias creativas y originales: esta es una de esas. El choque de dos mundos: el personaje principal, un gerente con traumas paternales que solo se preocupa por su trabajo, el dinero y \u00e9xito, conoce a una chica que vive bajo un puente con sus vecinos \"raros\" (\u00bfpero qu\u00e9 es ser \"raro\"?)\\n\r\nLa animaci\u00f3n es tan r\u00e1pida que no puedes pesta\u00f1ear: cada segundo ves una nueva imagen, donde cambian los colores, el dise\u00f1o, la perspectiva, la emoci\u00f3n (\u00a1no soy una experta, as\u00ed que es dif\u00edcil de explicar!) as\u00ed que tiene que estar muy concentrado! Los colores pasteles son geniales.\\n\r\nY, por supuesto, \u00a1es una comedia! y una realmente divertida, con un humor absurdo. Pero no creas que solo son bromas... al comienzo de cada episodio hay una peque\u00f1o profunda reflexi\u00f3n sobre la vida humana. \\n\r\nFinalmente, una cosa notable, en mi opini\u00f3n: Arakawa no es el nombre del personaje principal. Arakawa es el nombre del r\u00edo bajo el puente. \u00c9l es el verdadero personaje principal. Piensa en eso cuando lo veas!\\n\\n\r\nPor qu\u00e9 me encanta?\\n\r\nMe encantan cada uno de los personajes, \u00a1excepto el personaje principal! (raro!, no?) pero es el infaltable otro lado del espejo. Creo que veo ciertas cosas de m\u00ed misma que no me gustan, reflejadas en \u00e9l (como los traumas parentales). As\u00ed que tal vez puedas aprender m\u00e1s de ti mismo viendo este anim\u00e9, cu\u00e1les son tus metas en la vida, cu\u00e1les son las cosas realmente importantes de la vida. Y es hilarante. El \u00fanico aspecto negativo: no me gusta el opening!\\n",

            "content": "This series have a very good concept to it and it has one of the best characters imo, it  reminds me alot of Gintama, the originality of each character and the depth they gave to each one of them is pretty insane !! it's the opposite of most of the anime out there, you will find the story very strong but the characters who are in it is so boring and poor written,but the case here is the complete opposite..\r\nI believe what makes this anime so enjoyable is the characters and their personalities, they're original, funny, relatable (ye.. I know..), and you will wishthat they could make a whole show  about only one character ! this is how much attached you will get to them..\\n\r\nand the fact that they didn't only focus on the main characters is pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, the sound and the voice actors cast are THE BEST..\\n\r\nbut the reason that I gave it 8/10 is\\n\r\nsince it has a \"romance\" category you will expect alot more about that, but for your surprise they didn't focus in romance at all.. well, there's couple of scenes but I feel like they didn't took it serious enough..\\n\r\nand this is my only problem with this show, I know you shouldn't expect much, it's not a shoujo or drama anime after all .. but if things were more serious when it's supposed to be it would be way better imo\\n\\n\r\nand I feel like the story lack some progress to get you hooked to it..\\n\r\nsometimes in the middle, things will get a lil bit dull and maybe boring in the first episodes.. I think that explains why I start watching this show in 2014 and I just finished it after two years..\\n\\n\r\nputting that aside, if you want a cheerful funny slice of life (kinda) anime I promise you, you will enjoy this show very much! it will gives you a different experience from all the other typical anime shows that you watched",

            "content": "*This Review applies for both Season 1 and Season 2*\r\nVery rarely I will find a series with such an absurd premise that is so very very funny. Arakawa Under the Bridge I will dare say tops on my list of funniest animes. I have seen this series about 3 times (Both Season 1 and 2)\r\nSummary: Born into a wealthy familly, Ichinomiya Kou experienced the harshness of the business world early. The Ichinomiya family lives by the creed never to owe anyone anything. One day after Kou's pants are taken by a group of teens and put on the top of the bridge, Kou happens tofall off into a river while retrieving them. It is there he happens to be saved by a strange blonde woman. Unable to let a debt such as this go by he promises to give the woman anything she wishes for. The woman's wishes for Kou to love her, as if fulfilling a wish like that wasn't hard enough he finds out that she thinks shes from the planet Venus. Follow Kou as he triest to fulfill this request while encountering the many other strangers that live under the bridge.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: The whole plot is so unique and always keeps me laughing. Very rarely will I find a plot like this that's partly based in reality, and partly just absurd. I'll try my best not to spoil but this series doesn't have a real solid plot or goal. If you're looking for a series with a solid storyline this probably isn't the best place to find it. Though when this series did decide to buckle down and try to get serious it still had me on the edge of my seat with laughter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This series had some of the most Ludicrous and strangest characters I have ever seen. Not to say I didn't love them all. Each character came with their own absurd and extravagant personality that just made me love them all. Aside from Kou and Nino there aren't really that many character developments but their uniqueness makes up for it entirely.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art was okay, nothing too bad or too good I would have to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One of the things I really enjoyed about this series were the sound tracks. All of the opening and endings songs were really good, and went well with the series. (They were just as strange as it was)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall this series is a Gem to me. I had found it with no prior knowledge, just watching it because I was bored, but I have never once regretted it. This series is filled with Ludicrous characters and absurd events, that made me laugh and always brightened my day. If you're looking for a hard core story with lot of plot developments that gets really dramatic this probably isn't the series you're looking for, but if you're looking for a series that will leaving you laughing with characters you'll end up really loving this is probably the place. Arakawa Under the Bridge 9/10",

            "content": "The art and setting are the only things i find unbearable in this series. There is no background given for the setting and the plot revolves around a guy who follows a strong family principle of not being in debt of anyone, through which he's bound to accompany a strange and outwardly deranged girl and her group of equally outwardly deranged people, who apparently are elites in certain skills they have. There is only one kind of comedy involved in the whole series which is hyping up something and providing an unexpected comic twist to it, and it has been done exceptionally well. \r\nWhat disappointedme or to be more precise what was unsettling to me was that the only setting or background used in this series is the river bed and very limited set of sounds. There is no background about the characters given and the story starts abruptly and continues with its comic tone. This kind of setting suits a theatre performance at best. But still i'm inclined to rate this anime as being very good because somehow if you can get through that unsettling feelings it turns out to be an anime which is fresh with new concepts and avoids cliches. So i'd still recommend you guys to check this title just to appreciate what the creators of this anime have done in new. But be sure you can't expect great things from the plot, which you might find in any average anime. It has a kind of melancholic atmosphere all the time.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been watching anime for more than a decade and I\u2019ve watched so many series with so much similarities. Honestly, it can really be boring and I ended up being fed up. And so, it is always refreshing to see something so original.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nThis series is anything but clich\u00e9. There is so much uniqueness in this series that it\u2019s almost like a sin. Nowadays, there are thousands and thousands of animes and manga so it\u2019s really hard to create such original story. After watching this series you can\u2019t help but be amaze how magnificently it is done. Indeed, the plotmight be common with the story about a guy from the rich world and a girl from the poor world but the storyline in this series has made that kind of common plot to the next level. This is far beyond your typical couple from different worlds because they are literally from different worlds. The guy is from the rich world and the girl is from a very weird as in WEIRD world. Plus, the setting is under a bridge! And finding love in the weirdest and unusual place. How original can that be! Another amazing thing is how the seriousness and the gags are balance. Just when you thought that it is a serious scene you will end up laughing your hearts out. And if you think that this is all about laughter then you are horribly wrong because it actually have a very solid storyline that you will definitely anticipate to unfold. It even have a very cute love story and not just for comic relief but a serious growing sweet love. Surprisingly enough, I am the type who always wants to see the main plot unfolds immediately but in this one I couldn\u2019t care less. I just love and enjoy their everyday lives and that shows how amazing it is. Even though every episode may not be that important to the main plot, it is still interesting to watch and makes you want more of it. I also love the lines whether it\u2019s for comedy or serious dialogues which is very important for me because it always leave a strong impression.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe one that shows how original this series the most are the characters. The characters are so original and unique. In fact, in my more than 10 years of anime life I\u2019ve never seen such characters. You might see them on hardcore fictional type of stories but the characters in this series can actually be real. They might be crazy but they are actually real people who just created a community under the bridge. Each of them is unique and has their own weird personalities. They\u2019re weirdness is just so hilarious. And their past and real identity is also very interesting because of its mysteriousness. Speaking of mysteriousness, the most enigmatic of them all is Nino who claims she is from Venus. Her weirdness is just like a character of a child who still has a lot to learn. Of course, Ric who stumbles in the world of the weirdoes. He believes that everyone is not normal and he is the only one with a straight mind but if everyone around you is the same and you\u2019re the only whose not then you might as well think that you are actually the weird one. I like all of them from supporting characters to main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe animation was magnificently done whether the scene is for laughter or for serious conversation. The colors and the landscape are breathtaking. Scenes where important lines are delivered are amazingly done. The seiyus are well picked and it\u2019s like a gathering of all the most famous and talented seiyus. Seeing the lineup of seiyus gives an assurance that the characters will be great and their lines will be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWith so much originality, it is no wonder why this series is considered one of the most famous animes of today. It will be a sin not to watch this and not love it. \\n",

It's not like your typical anime, the fun quirky characters like Sister, Hoshi, P-ko, and Stella make this anime anything but ordinary. I loved the characters, they really made the story interesting. I feel like Ric really went through some good character development when he met the residents under the bridge. Very enjoyable, I'm kind of surprised that this is not a very popular one. 10/10 would recommend.",

            "content": "It's hard to know where to start reviewing such a fever dream of an anime, but I will attempt to. The \"plot\" consists of a successful CEO named Ichi almost drowning, before being saved by a strange blonde girl named Nino. Not wanting to be indebted to anyone due to his family motto, he agrees to become her \"lover\" and live with her under the bridge he fell from. It turns out there is a community of eccentrics living under the bridge.\r\nThat is both the premise and the plot. The anime mainly consists of Ichi meeting various members of the community and the wacky anticsthat ensue. So if you are after an anime with a coherent and strong storyline, this is most definitely not for you. The show is also listed as a \"Romance\" on this site, but this is sort of debatable. The romance aspects of the show are very few and far between, perhaps this will be more prevalent in the second season, if I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so the main genre of this anime is certainly comedy. For me, it was hit and miss. There is certainly a lot of good comedy in this anime, mostly absurdist, sometimes referential (such as a straight up rip of Bisky from HxH). Sometimes the humour was drowned out by the utterly frantic editing style of the show, which if you have watched it you will know what I mean, I really cannot describe it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also quite a heartwarming anime and has good messages about how to live life, and Ichi actually goes through some pretty solid character development. Other character's stories are quite heartwarming too like that of Hoshi. Although, I personally would have liked to have known some more about how the community came to be and more character backgrounds (although that would probably be against the message of the show). Some moments also seem not to make much sense, such as how Stella is able to transform and everyone is able to see this occur. It is pretty confusing. Some characters are also just plain unlikable douches, like Maria, who gets way too much screentime and does nothing but insult the actually likable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are ok with meandering, slow paced shows, but also ok with insanely fast editing and no logic, this show may be for you. For most people, it will probably just come across as nonsensical and rather pointless. I thought it was ok, so I give it a...\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

The animation is beautiful and the set-up and it's potential for commentary on modern society extremely promising. I liked the slow development of the relationship between Kou and Nino. Unfortunately, I couldn't stay invested as the characters began to feel flat and the development too slow.\r\nThere aren't many pieces of anime out there that deal with actual homelessness (Tokyo Godfather being one of the few I can think of. Travel/Journey style shows don't count). For that reason I was hoping to see more of a light-hearted exploration of whatthat means to different people, and within Japanese society. \\n\\n\r\nI really loved the first few episodes and they are definitely worth watching. I also have no issue with primarily gag-anime, but unfortunately the problem here is the lack of balance.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my own rating system:\\n\r\n2/3 stars for characters and relationships\\n\r\n1/3 stars for plot and storyline\\n\r\n3/3 stars for formal elements\\n\r\n0/1 stars for my special award",

The music is catchy and true to the story.  I like that the voice actors dont have annoying voices and are clear and easy to understand but are not boring. \r\nThe characters are just outstanding, not at all typical.  In fact, thecharacters are really what make up the plot.  They all have real personalities and stories behind them, which is what makes each and every one so interesting.  However, much of the characters' pasts are not revealed.  Just enough. :P\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime immensely and am so excited for the next season for whatever, \"Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge\".   Ive already started and all I can say is that its definitley not horrible like a lot of the sequels out there that follow the anime that could have ended after season one.",

As I consider it as one of the best I had the chance to watch, it's kind of sad for me to read so many bad reviews.\r\nStory\r\nAs in many other animes, the first episodes are here to introduce the main characters and their relationships. The story doesn't go fast as the main idea in my opinion is to follow the subtle transformation of Kou, the rich kid living under a bridge. As he tries, more or less, to become part of these parallel society, we can see all the mistakes given by thedeformation of our society: What is really meaningful ? What defines success ? How do we act to be \"normal\" ? And is it really \"normal\" ?\\n\r\nAll those questions are asked in a love comedy register, with absurdist humour, making each episode an explosion of laugh and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound\\n\r\nI really loved the visual of these anime. Draws and animations are simple but beautiful. They are all part of the ambiance. With the music, they have a unique personality. I don't like animes where you could take a scene, put it in any other, and it would fit in. That's not the case of Arakawa under the bridge. The colours, the character design, the music, the visual spirit, all work with the story and the emotions you feel when watching it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nMaybe the better point of these anime. The characters are colourful, unique and appealing. They are like a big family of so various peoples. Joyful and funny. Each of them has its own reason to live here, and they made me wonder : If I wanted to go out of these societies, what would be my reasons ? Where would I be useful ?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime is all about emotions. I laughed so hard ! Always wanting to know what they will invent next. Watching one episode can make my day better. If you like absurdist humour, this one is for you.\\n\\n\r\nTl;Dr\\n\r\nA unique piece of work with appealing characters, absurdist humour and underlying questions about society and our life priorities. One of the best I've watched.",

The underlying theme of society's \"norms\" and the concept of people simply acting as they are taught, are so clearly evident in the main character as he embarks on what can only be described as a hangover of a journey.\r\nDespite the at times unclear story, the characters can simply notbe hated, overall Arakawa under the Bridge was a great laugh and I recommend it highly.",

I wouldn't say Arakawa Under the Bridge is necessarily one of those. Most of the time you get straight faced people creating the comedy effect, but the characters in Arakawa are weirdos who are actually pretty normal inside. It's kind of the opposite of what you usually get in shows with serious people who do or say weird things. Because of this slight difference, Arakawa's comedic effects are more natural, meaning it's not necessarily the situations that make the story entertaining butthe characters themselves, even when you don't have a storyline. The show doesn't even need those serious speeches that you often see to make it meaningful. Arakawa can leave you warm-hearted in the most subtle way, and I think that's its greatest accomplishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Most people look past the true depth in this show due to all the slapstick jokes, and gimmicky humor, but there is some subtle beauty in this show that sits right under the surface. The premise of accepting who you truly are as an individual, and not letting social norms effect that idealistic image you strive for is the strongest driving theme throughout the show.\r\nOk, so the story is fairly vague, not much actual \"plot\" apart from the initial incident of finding thisbridge community, and the various escapades within this curious place. But the show does make good work of making the best out of the small advances we see throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt is very well done, the gradient art style is very appealing, and refreshing. Although you can say the actual character art feels a few years behind, I think it adds to the show as a whole, giving a different feel then more modern art gives off. Overall, I really did think the art was fairly strong throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is ok, not really that memorable apart form the ending song, which I happen to love. It really captures the fragile feel of the anime, and speaks more in emotions and feels than literal meaning. Take that how you want, it's more of a hit or miss sort of thing.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of criticizing of the characters, especially considering new developments throughout the story. Don't get me wrong, I do thing character development is very importnat in almost all animes, but I give a small exception to this show. The point is less on seeing these characters change, more so to understanding their past, and learn who they are. We get to peel back their obscure exteriors, and understand them in a strangely intimate way, getting a little slice of what makes them need this bizarre community so much.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot. It's one of the most refreshing shows in ages, especially considering how I've been putting off watching it for a good 6 months, I am glad I finally got around to it. I think that one of it's major problems this show has are that people can't get past all the slapstick to really soak up the real genius, and introspective beauty this show has to offer. It's all right there, you just have to be willing to look for it just a little.\\n\\n\r\nExcuse any small mistakes throughout this review, I'm not too good at writing these sorts of things, and thank you if you bothered to read through the whole thing.",
