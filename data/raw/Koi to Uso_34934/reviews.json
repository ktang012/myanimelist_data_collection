            "content": "Love relationships are inherent in our daily lives. Most of us have experienced and we know how difficult it can be to maintain this relationship for various reasons. Discord, differences of opinion, lack of confidence etc. Sometimes we question ourselves and we try to understand why the couple did not last. But in Koi to Uso couples are created from a database measuring the compatibility between two individuals. The logical question is: can we trust these statistics? Does not reality go beyond theories?\r\nBut... Koi to Uso doesn't seem to waste its time. And I find a melodramatic and insane triangle love (rectangle?) again.\r\n(Light spoilers fromthere because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)\\n\\n\r\nFor synopsis, read MAL summary. \\n\r\nKoi to Uso is one of those drama series where I felt uncomfortable when I watched the characters talking, interacting, because the writing was bad. At times I persuaded myself that they would act differently, more maturely and that the characters would evolve in a logical way, at least. But, they didn't. I had fun with this series, I admit. I wanted to slap Yukari many times when I saw him blushing stupidly when a girl told him she loved him. It was a little insane since I found that this character had no really significant quality. Nice? Meh, a classic character as you could see with MCs in many harems and others.\\n\\n\r\nFor the other characters, I don't really want to participate in the fighting between #teamRirina and #teamMisaki because I don't see the interest. If I have to judge their beauty, they are quite equal. As for their personality, they are nice, yeah. One is a rather \"tolerable\" tsundere and the other a gentle mysterious girl who loves Yukari since childhood. (two clich\u00e9s yeah !) There is no real rivalry between the two girls. Surprisingly none seems embarrassed to see Yukari flirting freely and indifferently. Each has accepted her position, one as a future bride (because the government says it) and the other as an \"impossible\" love. I find this aspect absolutely senseless and unrealistic. As if someone logical could accept that his boyfriend spends his time with another girl, as if nothing had happened.\\n\\n\r\nI could possibly think that Misaki is a Samaritan and is so altruistic that she is willing to sacrifice her happiness for others. But... it seems so wrong. Since later she will cry again almost regretting having let Yukari go out with Ririna. And then I just wanted to shake up and tell her: \"But why did you do this at first?\" And we have no explanation, so I'm forced to tell myself that she's a masochist: she likes to suffer unnecessarily. Concerning Ririna, she is a tsundere. She wants comprehensive although it is always a little ridiculous. For example, when she suggests to Misaki and Yukari to kiss in her room to show her. Because this idiot has never seen two people kissing apparently, but in Koi to Uso world, this type of personality exists. After all, she agrees to go out with Yukari when she knows that Yukari loves Misaki. In a way, she is as masochistic as Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yukari?\\n\r\nOh God, this character is absolutely horrible. But really! I don't know what I can say. He is nice but terribly silly, stupid, awkward and is only a mass of cliches. He has a mentality of a child and doesn't understand his responsibilities. He doesn't understand that he must choose (since his two lovers are masochists, let us not forget) but at no time does he take his courage with both hands. It is only a spectator who leaves (and kisses) one of the two girls. He is undecided and seems to have an emotional intelligence worthy of a four-year-old child. In addition, with the other two girls, there is another character named Nisaka, the other male protagonist. (I almost forgot it so transparent he's, excuse me)\\n\\n\r\nNisaka is a Yukari's classmate. He also seems to know Misaki. Hmm... he doesn't seem really interested in women and he is... hung-up? Yeah, surely and we also see that he seems to love Yukari. (But why is Yukari so beloved? It will remain a mystery.) Unfortunately or not, we don't have much information about this character. We don't know its true intentions and the anime doesn't try to make it more important. He made an impressive performance in the play, apparently, according to the audience, but that's all. It would have been interesting to know whether M-M relations were accepted in this society which married only men and women together. I'm not interested in yaoi or anything like that but mentioning homosexual relationships could have been relevant.\\n\\n\r\n*Big spoiler*\\n\r\nProbably the worst scene I've seen in this series: the one where Yukari and Ririna are on the bed so they \"train\" to kiss each other. Before that, many couples (including them) had lessons about using condoms and different ways to have sex. They also watched a porn video. And so... the couples were able to be excited enough to engage in similar acts. But... but... Yukari and Ririna don't seem to have acquired the maturity necessary to understand the notion of marriage, couple or sexual relations. They are 16 but are still ignorant. And so Yukari seems to have great difficulty in having sex. It was so ridiculous when I saw him blushing and shaking. Ririna did not want either. And guess? Because they didn't want to betray Misaki. Yeah, the same girl who told them earlier to go out together anyway. Aaaah so cringe !\\n\r\n*End big spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the general context with these laws about the birthrate, we don't have much more information except: \"Japan was a country known for low birthrates but thanks to the new directives, everything is arranged, meh. We know the people who are responsible for the changes in society but not more. Besides, when I watch Koi to Uso, I don't even feel that their society really differs from the current Japanese society. People don't really complain, everyone seems happy (eg Yukari's parents, Rrina's parents). Apparently a law (worthy of a dictatorship) doesn't seem to bother anyone (except our love triangle). And what a coincidence because there were no rebel groups or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the opening theme is quite refreshing and melancholic ending as well. I appreciate both of them. Regarding the OST, nothing memorable but I would gladly check if some can satisfy me. Animation is enough for a school-life/romance series. I didn't like the chara design with their huge eyes but after two episodes, I was no more disturbed. I even think that Misaki and Ririna are sublime. (I have weird tastes, don't be shocked). Some scenes were relatively mesmerizing, especially when our 4 protagonists look at the fireflies while thinking about their future prospects. (in their romantic relationships)\\n\\n\r\nI'm really pleased to see this series come to an end. I don't plan to read the manga. Koi to Uso seemed to start with a more original plot with atypical arranged marriages... but nothing is explored. And add unbearable characters and you can't decently enjoy the series. Personally, their reactions were so stupid and inconsistent that I still found the show to be fun. Fun because stupid. I didn't get bored but it certainly wasn't for incredible romance or stereotyped characters.",

            "content": "Love and Lies is a 12 episode anime where love takes the form of lies and each of the characters are like walking chalkboards, constantly scratching upon each other. Japan for some reason deemed it fit to pass on the torch of its current social crisis to the biggest intellectual heavyweight of a medium out there. By presenting a theoretical scenario in which society as a whole is shaped a certain way in order to entertain the idea of Japan's birth rates not being in the gutter, we are hence introduced to another run-of-the-mill-overdramatized-romance-love-triangle-rectangle-harem-cocktease. And impressively enough, its' atrocious and unexplained setup remarkably gives somethinglike Eromanga a whole new level of credibility. While its' innovativity didn't didn't speak for much in the minds of the masses, at least it had the audacity to try and push forward a healthy agenda. \"It might be grasping at straws, but she's still fertile\". Meanwhile on the other end of the spectrum, we have an anime that is centered around this very same nuanced topic, yet fails to provide any substantial worth at all to the table in regards to social commentary, or much of anything, really. About midway through it crumbles down under the weight of its nonexistent ruleset and unexplored concept, but impale me with a cactus if these redundant melodramatic pieces need consistency within anything but MUH FEELS.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some thought that resides strictly within the compounds of the show does delve into questioning the validity of a clearly-corrupt system via the characters, I find it extremely difficult to believe the writer herself put any while actually writing this story. In anything but an ideal world, the idea of these arranged marriages would be doomed from the get-go. And in an ideal world, there'd be no need for them in the first place. So in the end, all we're left with is a hypothetical scenario that is not and can not be founded in reality by any stretch of the imagination, ever. Thus the series is forced to revolve around this lofty joke of a scenario, and revolve around it, it does. Not only would it be a shitty situation on an emotional and mental basis for most young people, but for some reason it is able to reach the back ends of society as well. If you decide against being being a mindless drone (which is somehow a rare occurance, seeing as teenagers love losing their freedom of choice, being enslaved, etc), it is for some reason able to influence your academic standing for the worse, with no apparent reason anywhere in sight. \\n\\n\r\nImagine being on the short end of an abusive relationship. The person you're paired with treats you like dirt, and you might be in love with someone else. So what happens when you try turning your life around for the obvious better? You get shunned by society, your future put at risk and ironically enough get deemed a lesser human being than your peers. How or why rejecting an arranged marriage is the end all be all of a person's highschool life is beyond me. May as well write \"SEX OFFENDER\" on the entrance exam sheet in big, bald letters just so everyone is aware what a menace to society these rebellious teens really are. Case and point - Marriages are apparently all sunhshine and rainbows where nothing bad can ever occur, and likewise all people are inherently bound to accept the iron fist of free will.\\n\\n\r\nDespite there being enough conveniences and unexplored scenarios relating to the story to where'd I'd call plotholes, the worst detractor evidently might just be how poorly the author invisioned this artifical caricurature of a modern society of hers to function. If anything, this red string of science would eventually end up bringing the country's mortality rate to new peaks entirely, as suicide is already enough of an epidemic currently as is. Therefore, not only does it serve as a weak ass plot, but it also contradicts the very nature of the idea that is combating low birth rate for which it initially set out to do. The only counter-argument ever provided against any of this is that it works cuz.. science, 'n stuff. Because we all damn well know scientists ought to seize and take notice of all of our behavoural patterns, personality traits and preferrable positions in bed. If we've come this far, Koi to Uso's neo-Japan should be an island paradise, barely short of eden. Technology, banzai.\\n\\n\r\nNeji is either the biggest excuse for a human being I've had the displeasure of setting my eyes upon or the typical Japanese beta male, I really don't know anymore. This man trembles in fear and is required to turn the other cheek as the thought of looking another person into the eyes instills such immense dread into the very fiber of his being, especially when one such person happens to be a moderately cute girl who he ends up accidentally wooing by giving a slight demonstration of his immeasurable bravery. Neji knows no fear, ladies and gentlemen, as he only takes 3 full hours to hand over a chopped up piece of his eraser to this desperate damsel in distress. Upon recieving the rougher edge of said eraser, cute girl is suddenly transformed into the love of his life the moment she thanks him for being such an indecisive, although considerate, loser. This is what the main characters' infatuation for one another stems from, sadly enough. I can only assume that it is because of this, I, in recent memory oftentimes encounter myself subconsciously wandering off into the deepest and darkest recesses of my mind, only to spend endless hours upon hours wondering if our species was doomed from the very beginning. Cue the oversatured Nietzsche quote, please.\\n\\n\r\n\"\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33. \ud835\ude08\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36 \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34, \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36.\".. That's the one. Despite what the aformentioned may make you believe, make no mistake. Neji is quite the player. No, he is THE player. The aftermath of being such an immense pussy his entire life inevitably resulted in his very body transforming itself into a pussy magnet. But his savagery doesn't stop there. The pure sight of Neji's huge pussy makes him irresistable to guys as well, although that's another story entirely. I'm sure that by now most of HanaKana's characters would be able to compete in some sort of national women's marathon for constantly running away from their male counterparts in these drama series so much. What seperates her from Orange's Naho is the old saying about the shy ones being the kinkiest out the bunch, which surely ought to hold some truth this time around. Forest sex, anyone?\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, Erasergal is probably to be considered the story's main heroine. It's been an entire year since I rose above and beyond the wish-washy poetry of my collegues by writing an intellectual diatribe for last summer season's Orange, yet it remains as fresh as ever in my mind. As such, there are some paralells to be drawn between the two heroines from the overall feel of the shows to even matching haircuts. Evidently so, what makes Erasergal stand out as the superior/updated version of Naho is the fact that she actually gets shit done on her own accord. No Kakeru-kun is needed here, when she wants some good ol' forest sex, good ol' forest sex will be had. With every tool at her desposal and virtually very little competition, she takes Nejima by the balls and French-kisses him until they run dry. Quite commendably so, really. Apart from her subpar taste in men, HanaKana does this girl justice. She has no problem cucking her friend out of the relationship with her fiance and rocks some cute bangs while doing it. #HanaKanaPleaseGetSomeDiversityYourEntireCastingCatalogueIsBangs\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the heaps of praise I could give to her character in comparison, she is overall extremely willy-nilly in what she wants. It's like she's got severe bipolar disorder and gets caught up in the moment so heavily one episode, only for next week to flush it down the unkempt toilet like it's all bygones and make-believe, cus it'd make harem member #2 sad. Regardless of harem member #2 consciously going out of her way to get them to shag in front of her very eyes. Whatever, logic isn't this show's forte and it slowly devolves into an endurance test of how many mental flops Erasergal can do per 20 minutes, before breaking out into wishful tears full of regret and getting comforted by Nejima who is at this point having a mental breakdown over the overwhelming guilt and being an overall pansy who shouldn't be loved by anyone other than his own mother.\\n\\n\r\nRirina is the second most prominent member of the Nejima Fan Brigade. Despite of her shortcomings and lack of comprehension for her own feelings, she is cute. However, the shortcoming that serves to seperate her from the other members is the overwhelming fact that she is, in fact, a cuck. And I do not use this term lightly or as a form of internet slang in hopes of coming off as hip. Ririna is full-fledged Resident Cuckold in the flesh. The real thing. This girl literally goes out of her way to force her future husband into a make-out sesh with some girl she's known for a day's time. Her backstory is that of loneliness and sorrow, as she's never had any real friends to speak of. Yet when she does acquire the faintest signs of friendships, she successfully serves as a gap closer which would in turn make her the ultimate third wheel, essentially sending her back to square one. Because she admires their unadulterated romance. The irony is that the romance in this show is BAD. Anywhom, Nisaka does well to point this out before going on some completely idiotic tantrum about how the after-effects of cucking can harm Nejima's academic performance. But good on him for trying.  #TeamCuck\\n\\n\r\nLast and dead least in the race for Neji's heart, there is the sole male companion of the gang. Nisaka is sharp, easily embarrassed and full of angst. Why is he full of angst? Either because he's gay, or he's gay and his taste in men is subpar. While to some extent I want to applaud the writer for going this extra mile, is this really anything beyond a fan ship from a fujoshi's hidden locker? Surely, no one in their right mind thought this ship was ever setting sail. Perhaps after years of discrimination in Japan, being gay is the new blockbuster recipe after Yuri on Ice. His voice is good to the ears, but as a non-13 year old girl I sure was not hoping for any.. unforseen unpleasantries to occur between the two boys. #NejiDroppedTheSoap\\n\\n\r\nFinally; Shuu Igarashi, being the only female cast member able to contain her overarching lust over Nejima's shallow manhood personally comes as a huge disappointment. While equipped with a design that reeks of Eromanga's Sagiri that suddenly started hanging out with the wrong crowd and recently got out of rehab with a whole new jaded outlook on life, she is also appointed as being the granddaughter of Lady Democracy from whom the red string of science originated AND Misaki's bff. Due to the extreme position she holds in the story you'd think she'd be able able to grant some clearance as to either of the afromentioned, but no. It's a blank state of mind in which this moody little snowflake operates, being the single biggest cocktease in existence. She is revealed a laughable 2 episodes before the finale and in that short time nothing but her backstory is provided. Oh, and that she orchestrated the entire fall of Nejima. I honestly wouldn't have known she was anything beyond Misaki's over-obsessive stalker had her MAL profile not been indicitive of something else. Thanks, MAL Re-Write!!!\\n\\n\r\nSuMmArY\\n\\n\r\nBoring series filled with plot and character inconsistency buzzword, buzzword, buzzword - IT SUCKS. Taking place in a twisted reality in which emotion and freedom of choice are exchanged with a lofty system that doesn't even work, and the goverment's tax money is spent to gather 16 year olds to mass porn sessions where they can beat off in unison. Devoid of logic, full of corny scenes and dialogue that does get a bit experimental and even overboard for the standard \"By Fujoshi, For Fujoshi\" formula. Which will sadly be all but lost on the vivid fandom consisting of 13-year old girls and a few other unfortunate souls. I would ironically request some alluring Nisaka fanart, but this anime will be long forgotten by the time its' fanbase learns to draw art more impressive than doodles of their cute elementary-school boy crushes.\\n",

You love the first turn, the second turn isn't that amazing, and after more turns, you just want to get down and forget the experience.\"\r\nThe story was interesting at the beginning but then transformed into a mess to the point that it was unexplained and inconceivable possible that happens. The partners and couples are selected by \"Japan's officials\" at the age of 16, so you will need to marry with them because the law demands it. \r\nThe writers created a weird love square and combined with a failed character progression titled it \"Koi to Uso.\" I can'tlie that the story is average from the perspective of the characters. The main character Yuraki Nejima failed to express his feelings. He loved Misaki Takasaki since the middle school. When the government selected his partner, he couldn't fight for his hidden love even when she said to him that she loved him. Also, it is incomprehensible why Ririna tried several times to be the backer of Nejima and Takasaki's relationship under the wrong argument that she doesn't know the meaning of LOVE. Ironically, she ended loving Nejima. Well, that was expected so I am not spoiling anything. The other character Yuusuke Nisaka is Nejima's best friend and loves him in silence (love square design). In other words, you can see this as a harem where all the main characters love Nejima, and this one is just so silly that doesn't decide about his life and his feelings. One day he loves Takasaki and after some hours is worried why the other girl didn't send him a message. Maybe he just loves all them. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, they lack a creative background. The love started with an eraser, literally. A failed progression and a failed character background in progress. Characters that are a pool of mixed feelings and don't take any coherent decision. For example, I love you but will love another person in 3, 2, 1. You will say that these actions are because are young but not. It is because the script created shallow characters and not insecure ones so we could mistake insecurity sometimes with silliness. \\n\\n\r\nThe art. it is weird. From some angles it is good, but then you look another angle, and that big puppies eyes aren't that cute as we believed. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was normal, but it didn't help. Both the OP and ED weren't that bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was average, and it didn't conclude the story. The lace of the destiny is hooked to ... ALL them. We didn't get an appropriate conclusion to this story. We got an ending that will add a message like \"for more information, please buy the manga.\"\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story isn't great and needs lots of work to keep us entertained. It is unconcluded and is the reflection that this show was very average.   \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Drama series with love as a central theme tends to draw a variety of audiences. When I seek one of these shows, relationship dynamics is something I trust for the series to capitalize. Koi to Uso (Love and Lies) is one of those series that define love more than just holding hands, dating, or kissing. It\u2019s an anime that dances around the idea of love and drawing the audience into a world of drama.\r\nGetting into this show was actually quite easy. The premise is simple to understand and as a manga reader, I went into this show with tolerable expectations. The first few episodes easilyestablishes the principle character cast \u2013 Nejima, Nisaka, Ririna, and Misaki. These four characters have distinctive personalities that makes them different from one and other. The story interconnects their lives as the setting takes place in the future. Government created the Yukari Law in which young people after 16-years old would be assigned marriage partners. So you\u2019re probably asking thinking \u201chmm, a show that builds relationship through a system. Where\u2019s the love in that?\u201d On the surface, that logic would makes sense but it\u2019s obvious that certain characters have real feelings for each other. For instance, Nejima has a strong attraction towards Misaki. However, his actual marriage partner is a girl named Ririna who is also interested in the idea of love. The three art part of love triangle that explores human emotions, growth, and emotional relationships.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I can\u2019t really say this show does an adequate job at developing its story. At its core, it puts emphasis on the theme of love. The show invites questions that makes us wonder what love actually is. What is romance? How do couples build on a love relationship? Why do we feel attracted to certain people and vice versa? For starters, the first few episodes makes it clear that romantic feelings is based on attraction. However, it does get into the emotional elements soon as we learn more about the characters. Human emotions are exposed such as happiness, jealousy, fear, hate, sadness, anger, pain, and pleasure. Yet at the same time, it often feels like this series tries to do too many things at once. Every episode dedicates a variety of human emotions at once that sometimes feel too much to take in. For instance, the first two episodes explores emotions of happiness, pleasure, but also fear. Koi to Uso translates to Love and Lies and that by itself draws the attention of romance. It\u2019s a very complex subject that even to today, there\u2019s no right answer. \\n\\n\r\nBy no shadow of a doubt, relationships is a very important focus in the show. The central focus is the love triangle between Nejima, Misaki, and Ririna. If we look at these characters individually, they are rather different. Nejima is the nice guy that tries this best to appeal others but sometimes makes himself look like a fool. He is what I\u2019d label as the \u201cAverage Joe\u201d. On the other hand, Misaki is portrayed as the \u2018next door girl\u2019 type that many guys dreams to date. However, she also has her own insecurities and often shows emotional moments when she is with Nejima. Finally, Ririna has the personality of an ice queen. She rarely opens herself to others but at the same time is fascinated by the idea of love. As Nejima\u2019s marriage partner, it\u2019s obvious that she also feels an attraction towards him. Yet, Ririna seems to support Nejima and Misaki\u2019s relationship. However, I think the main problem falls onto the shoulder of main male protagonist Nejima. I\u2019ll be honest here\u2026he is a very uninteresting character. He\u2019s not just average but also lacks any dominate traits as a male. He is like a beta male that always struggles to keep up with the alpha pack. Although some people may argue that he carries a lot of responsibilities (as a guy that chosen by the Yukari system), Nejima still stands out as a weak character. The guy spends way too much thinking rather than acting on his instincts. Although he takes a more initiative in later episodes, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that his character as a whole makes him underwhelming. Misaki and Ririna stands out better as characters on their own although the lack of characterization on them holds them back. Honestly, I wish the show capitalize more on their characters individually. Surprisingly, Ririna stands out as the most interesting character in the show for me. She may be a tsundere but it\u2019s entertaining to see how she reacts to certain situations. Remember, this show explores the theme of love and Ririna is fascinated by it. That fascination leads her to get involved in many situations in this story.\\n\\n\r\nOutside these three characters, we also have Nisaka, the mysterious bishounen that other girls seems to adore. His relationship with Misaki is a big question mark and it even provokes feelings of jealousy from Nejima. While I can\u2019t really say this show has mystery, it does invite theories and questions about who he really is. Beyond that, it doesn\u2019t seem like the show capitalizes on his character much and feels like he\u2019s just there. That\u2019s actually a big problem I have with the show. Every episode seems to build a bit more and more to connect the characters together but in reality, nothing really happens. It feels like a loop and nothing really is achieved in the end. We don\u2019t really get a clear answer on who Nisaka really wants to marry in the end and to that, I can\u2019t help but hit my head on a desk.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Koi to Uso being a drama heavy show, it still finds room to add comedy. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really praise it as it\u2019s pretty dry and feels the same almost every episode. Misunderstandings, sexual fantasies, lewd jokes, and awkward character interactions are what\u2019ll often see. To be honest, I think this show can be enjoyable if you feel attached to certain characters. Luckily for me, I occasionally find Yukari and Ririna\u2019s relationship to be memorable because of their conflicting personalities and the fact that they can connect more on a personal level. Beyond that, this show feels like reading some romance novel where the author isn\u2019t even sure on who root for.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, this show\u2019s animation style is strange. It\u2019s neither good nor bad but peculiar in the sense that it doesn\u2019t look very realistic. Character eyes look abnormally big, fan service seems to happen randomly at times, and expressions seems forced. The character designs are acceptable enough with Misaki and Ririna standing out as the pretty girls at school. Nisaka also has the pretty boy look that makes him look irresistible to the ladies. Unfortunately, Nejima\u2019s character design makes him feel out of place compared to these three. As a show with drama and romance, you can also expect kissing. Tons of it actually. By the time I finished this anime, I lost the count of times Nejima has kissed the main girls. Oh and of course, the show adds saliva and fan service during make out scenes to make them more \u201crealistic\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack makes me wonder if the show knows what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s pretty light-toned and make scenes more melancholic than they should be. The OP and ED theme songs has some noticeable lyrics and symbolism, in particular the red strings of fate. However, what does really stand out is the character voice acting. From all the characters, Misaki probably stands out the most as her character displays the most emotions in her voice. At times, Ririna also stands out especially during tense moments between her and Nejima. Still, the other character voice mannerisms aren\u2019t anything to write home about. Shu sounds like an emotionless doll while Nejima\u2019s voice is just as average as his character.\\n\\n\r\nKoi to Uso is a watchable drama show at best and an trashy romance at worst. The show tries to get the audience invested into the characters but it doesn\u2019t succeed with all its goals. It exposes the weakness of the story when it puts way too much emphasis into the love triangle of the main characters. Hardly anything actually happens! Not to mention, the main male protagonist doesn\u2019t step it up to deliver a strong performance. Nejima holds the show back and is really feels disappointing after watching his role throughout every episode. Up to a certain point, I think this series\u2019 drama is really aimed at specific audience. It's still a fine anime in general but far from perfection. By the time I finished the anime, it feels like a show that couldn\u2019t connect its dots.\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review assumed that you have already watching Koi to Uso and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may be some spoilers in character analysis.  \r\nBased off the popular manga of the same name Koi to Uso which translates literally into love and lies makes use of a theme that\u2019s not often seen in animes which is marriage. The premise of this story is that in this world that the anime is set in Lies are forbidden and Love is doubly forbidden which sets the stage for the story. In this world as a result of populationdecline the government in an effort to control this crisis comes up with a complicated plan that it hopes will solve this problem. \\n\\n\r\nIn this plan when you turn sixteen you are assigned a marriage partner by the government thus eliminating all the work involved for a marriage as this will be taken care off. Thus, the premise here is that of a governmental marriage that is arranged by them that matches a boy and girl that reaches the age of 16 that is paired according to the compatibility of their genes. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot follows the life of 15-year-old Yukari Nejima as he faces this requirement of society as he comes to age and faces the choice of whether to confess his love to his childhood crush and establish a relationship with her and break the law or agree to his arranged marriage and marry a stranger that was chosen for him. \\n\\n\r\nYukari \\n\\n\r\nYukari Nejima portrayed by veteran voice actor Ryota Osaka of Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A 16-year-old high school boy that is just entering the age where he knows and understands what love is this is also the age where he dreads the most due to the law. Personality wise Yukari was a calm, kind and honest person that was shown to be very loyal to his friends. In the beginning of the series Yukari was also on the bit of a quiet side and had a tendency of becoming nervous when he is talking with people. Like most teenagers of his age Yukari views love with something akin to disdain and like most people dreads the fact that he will be assigned a random partner to him that he will eventually be married too. Though Yukari understands the necessity of the law and the background behind It Yukari is someone that should have the choice of choosing the person that they will spend the rest of their lives with and as a result he doesn\u2019t hide his disdain about the law. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series Yukari was someone that got nervous and scared rather easily and did not like being put into situations where he will be forced to make a heavy decision that will have long lasting impacts. Indeed, when Yukari does get nervous in this early stage of his personality Yukari falls back into one of his hobbies which is making elaborate objects like funeral mounds that for some reason he has a deep interest in. These objects that he creates I feel were quite interesting to see as they are very detailed which from the level of a high school student is impressive. A peculiar trait of Yukari\u2019s that I find interesting is that when he\u2019s in production mode Yukari also goes into explanation mode as well and the long winded but detailed explanations that he gives on the most random of subjects was pretty interesting and funny. As the series goes on however Yukari notably gets braver as a result of not just confronting his feelings for Misaki but also develop feelings for his assigned partner Ririna as well. He also become more responsible and less of a scatterbrain and willing to shoulder the many responsibilities that he has until now been trying to escape from. This is a result of the friendships and bonds that he has been able to forge with his friends and also his assigned partner Ririna. As a character, I was impressed by Yukari\u2019s growth and development and I was quite surprised that the weak willed and indecisive Yukari that we see in the beginning would later develop into someone that was willing to confront his feelings and be much braver than he was before. I felt that his voice actor Ryota Osaka really did a great job portraying the character of Yukari.    \\n\\n\r\nMisaki \\n\\n\r\nMisaki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of the irregular at magic high school and Psycho pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and acts as one of the two heroines of the show. A high school student that is similar in age to Yukari and is also in the same class as him Misaki is considered to be the class idol as she is both pretty and kind that only serves to enhance her position within the class. A childhood friend of Yukari Misaki is a kind, honest and caring person that as a result makes it easy for her to make friends and bond with people. Apart from her base traits Misaki has also been shown to be rather perceptive and understanding of other people\u2019s feelings especially the main character of Yukari. This I feel is a result of her being a childhood friend of Yukari\u2019s. In the beginning of the series it is shown that Misaki while trying to remain distant is well aware of the fact that Yukari has feelings for her something that she too also has but is reluctant to commit due to the law that acts as the centerpiece of this anime. When it became apparent that their love for each other will not be able to work due to the law however Misaki\u2019s personality starts to gradually change. Initially Misaki opted to squash the feelings of love and desire that she had for Yukari due to the friendship that she establishes with Yukari\u2019s partner Ririna and also because she was reluctant to break the law as well content with just looking at Yukari and being with him when they are in class. However, as the series progresses however and as Yukari and Ririna\u2019s marriage plan gets ever closer Misaki\u2019s feelings and actions soon begin to change as she starts to resent Ririna and starts taking actions that run contrary to her earlier personality. \\n\\n\r\nA surprising relationship that Misaki managed to establish in the series was the friendship and bond that she managed to establish with Ririna Yukari\u2019s assigned wife. In the beginning of the series after they met each other for the first time Misaki was shown to be friendly to Ririna but not completely hating her for being Yukari\u2019s assigned wife instead of her. Indeed, the two of them were able to hit it off pretty well in their first meeting and gradually become good friends trading secrets and gossip whenever possible. As the series goes on this changes as Misaki\u2019s bottled up feelings soon turn to resentment which causes her to start to take actions that will please her but trample on the relationship that she has with Ririna. This however is conflicted with Misaki\u2019s desire to maintain the friendship between the three of them thus causing a struggle inside Misaki. The character of Misaki I felt was an interesting one mainly because Misaki herself isn\u2019t a simple one-sided character and instead has different sides to her character that depend heavily on the kinds of feelings that she is feeling. The development of her character and the emergence of the many sides to her character I felt was done pretty well as you can never tell what she will be doing next thus adding unpredictability to her character. Kana Hanazawa I felt did an excellent job portraying the many different sides of her Misaki. \\n\\n\r\nRirina\\n\\n\r\nRirina Sanada played by veteran seiyuu Yui Makino of Sakurada reset fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the series. A 15-year-old high school girl of a rather rich household Ririna is the girl that was assigned as Yukari\u2019s assigned wife as part of the selections that the red string of fate law determined. A modest, kind and intelligent young girl that as benefit of someone from a rich household also radiates a sense of elegance and nobility. Ririna is someone that can be best described as a true maiden as like Yukari she has no experience of love at all. However unlike Yukari she also doesn\u2019t even have a crush that she longed for in the past either. In the beginning of the series Ririna like Yukari didn\u2019t have a high opinion on the law that will bind her and Yukari together as husband and wife and indeed didn\u2019t actually have a high opinion of Yukari either. However, as the series progresses Ririna\u2019s impression of Yukari gradually changes as a result of seeing Yukari become braver and more willing to challenge the law that governs them and indeed by the end of the series it has become apparent that she indeed has fallen for him as well. \\n\\n\r\nThough Ririna\u2019s initial personality was quiet and composed and had the elements that you will normally see in a rich girl it\u2019s interesting to note that she has none of the usual traits of one as she is neither arrogant or haughty but is rather kind and understanding to others and always willing to listen to them. In the beginning while quiet and composed Ririna was considered by many to be hard to approach and did not really laugh much and the fact that she had a habit of speaking her mind despite the situation only served to reinforce this. As a result of meeting not just Yukari but also Misaki as well however Ririna\u2019s personality begins to change and she gradually becomes more cheerful, happy and positive which also allows her to break out of the nickname that her school friends gave her and allow her to make her first friend. The reaction that Ririna made as she made her first friend which was Misaki I felt was actually pretty funny but also heartwarming to see. Within her personality Ririna has a number of prominent traits that serve to enhance her personality and character. One of the first prominent traits that Ririna has is the fact that despite not knowing what will happen in the future Ririna is someone that when set on a path that she is determined to follow she will follow it to the very end demonstrating how brave and determined she is. Ririna has also been shown to be a very dutiful person and willing to take responsibility for actions that she has caused something that I think is admirable for someone her age. Of Ririna\u2019s character naturally the most prominent thing about her is the manner of how she sees Yukari and Misaki\u2019s relationship that stems from her interest in romance novels and media. It was actually quite funny in seeing Ririna learn about what love is by trying to cause the two of them to match up. As a character, I thought that Ririna was an interesting character whose development I thought was done pretty well. Her views on love itself while unusual I felt matched pretty well with the theme of this show. I felt that her seiyuu Yui Makino really did a great job in portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe arts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good and I especially loved the settings of the school and the various areas that the cast go to in the series. The school during the culture festival for the school I felt was done pretty well. with regards to the culture festival I felt that the costumes that Nisaka and Misaki wore during their little play was designed pretty well and were actually pretty nice. The designs for the characters I felt were pretty good though in this regard I felt that Misaki and Ririna were the only ones that were done well. Animation wise I felt that it was pretty smooth and clear with a good balance of colors for the outfits that the characters wore. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with regards to both the scene music and the opening and ending themes. The opening theme for the series which was Kanashii Ureshii by Fredrick and Can\u2019t you say I felt was especially well done and matched well with the series. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the series I felt was actually pretty strong and easily one of the series best points. Kana Hanazawa who voiced the character of Misaki and Yui Makino who voiced the character of Ririna I felt deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their characters. The character of Misaki I felt was a complex character that was easy to portray but I felt that Kana really did a great job in her portrayal of her. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Koi to Uso was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points that made it so was its interesting premise, story, excellent voice acting and character development and its ability to provoke questions for the audience. The premise for the show naturally is the complex system that the government in the anime created and implemented. While the law itself is fictional the problem that it seeks to address with it which is population decline is not and is rather a serious problem that several countries in the real-world face including Japan. The usage of a real-world problem into an anime that was solved by a fictional law itself was an interesting premise and one that I applaud. In addition to addressing the problem of a declining population this premise also created an interesting theme of whether marriage should be happiness for only yourself or should your happiness be also to benefit the country that you live in as well. Very few animes are able to provoke such deep questions which is another thing that I like about this anime as it provokes the audience to think and look beyond the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series I felt was done pretty well and I felt it was anything but simple as it was full of revelations and unexpected events. Key to this is the struggles that the characters of Yukari, Misaki and Ririna experience for the love that the three have. In particular the complex character and ever-changing attitudes of Misaki only served to make the story more and more interesting as it kept the audience engaged in trying to guess what will happen next. The friendship and bonds that Yukari establishes with Misaki and Ririna I felt was also one of the strong points of the story and seeing it evolve over the series was interesting. The central concept of the series is love and lies and in this I felt that it was done rather well though in this regard the character that best displayed it was Misaki.  The ending itself I felt was interesting and served well to show the results of the culmination of the bonds that Yukari managed to establish with both Ririna and Misaki and helped highlight the fact that love itself is not as simple as people think it is. Sometimes a lie is necessary if you want to remain happy. \\n\\n\r\n However, while I really enjoyed the anime and the story for it there are some things that I felt could have been done better. The character of Nisaka who is the main characters best friend within the series though a main character in his own right wasn\u2019t given much development and indeed his relationship with Misaki and their mutual hatred for each other wasn\u2019t explained really well. But despite such blemishes Koi to Uso was one anime that I really enjoyed thanks to the excellent premise, story and top-notch voice acting from Kana Hanazawa and Yui Makino so I would say that my final score will be a 9/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "-This review has spoilers. You have been warned.-\r\nJapan has a declining birthrate. To combat this, the Japanese Government thought it'd be a BRILLIANT idea to create a law that forcefully marries two 16 year old kids in hopes that they'd make kids. No mention of riots, arguments about the law, no characters even seem to question the law in general, they just all accept it as it is. So, we're off to a rocky start already.\r\nOur main character, who I will refer to as Paste because he's just a copy/paste character from every other anime, is your average teenager and anime protagonist. Boring as helland no redeeming qualities. Paste somehow fell in love with one of the two main love interests because he shared an eraser with her...i'm not kidding they fall in love because of an eraser. Speaking of this eraser, FOR SOME REASON, they both have treasured this eraser for their remainder of their lives. All the way from Elementary School to High School. This eraser is basically God's wingman. It just has to exist for people to love each other. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Paste liked Eraser (the girl) a lot. Before he gets his notice, he confesses his feelings. Turns out they both have the hots for each other. This is when the show reveals its true colors. Eraser MOUNTS Paste on a park bench at night and just starts tongue sucking him in public. \\n\\n\r\nUH OH, it's Paste's birthday, he gets his marriage notice via text. And would ya lookie there, it's Eraser's name! They can straddle each other all they want from now on. But wait, the text for some reason glitched, and suddenly shows another girls name, who will be referred to as Wafer because I could go for a KitKat or something right now. \\n\\n\r\nReasonably, Paste and Eraser are like \"What the heck, this can't be right, what happened to the text message!\" (which even if the data got corrupted, hacked, or displayed wrong it would be logged in the phone but the characters aren't gonna question it like everything else in this show.) Next thing you know, you have the Ministry of Hormonal Teens popping up at 12AM at night as Eraser straddles Paste and gives him an official confirmation. Not sure how they found him randomly in the middle of the night, but OKAY, we're gonna move forward and not question it.\\n\\n\r\nThus begins the \"Love and Lie\" shenanigans. From this point on it is nothing but Wafer, who is cute as heck but dumb as bricks, putting Eraser and Paste together and watching them kiss/grope each other because it's interesting or something. The show also tries to complicate it by saying Wafer actually likes Paste, and doesn't want to admit she wants to stop making them kiss. Which if you are like me, you probably think that it is stupid. \\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse they introduce a gay character, who is Paste's friend, but also like's Paste. This gay character (who will now be referred to as Bae) is unfortunately the BEST character in the ENTIRE show. He actually has a personality! And he never gets the limelight. This guy actually had to tell Wafer that she liked Paste and maybe forcing him and Eraser to kiss is the reason why she feels bad...\\n\\n\r\nReally, the show just suffers from poor writing. Despite all the characters being on screen, I don't feel like I know any of them. That's probably why i'm using nicknames because I can't remember their names. They just aren't memorable. The show is just a vanilla porn without the porn. I'm not even sure if it classifies as ecchi. I've said this before but the show is just overly hormonal kids getting overly hormonal in sexual situations. It's more awkward to watch than it is entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nFor the positives...well, there just aren't a lot. It has a unique visual style. Nothing that i'd probably remember, but something I could maybe recognize. \\n\\n\r\nI'm probably being way too harsh on the show as many other people seem to be enjoying it, but I am finding hard to suspend my disbelief and revel in the world the creators put me in. It's just bad. Go watch Clannad if you want good bug-eyed romance.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do watch. Remember, Bae is best character.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Japan establishes futuristic e-Harmony & forces 16 year olds to marry who they are assigned. 4 people find themselves entangled in a four way love rhombus. Will Arrange Marriage or Love Marriage win? Find out next time in KTU.  \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 3/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 5/10]\r\nWhat do you get when you want to deal with a serious issue like Japan's decline in child birth & marriage but still want to attract people from various age groups to explore Love? You get Love and Lies. A show where you end up lying to others telling them how much you loveit when in reality you don't. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is futuristic Japan adopts the arrange marriage policy labelling it \"The Red Thread of Science\". Where the government chooses your partner, based on \"hard-core algorithm.\" The public has no clue how the math works but at age 16, you are paired up with your \"one calculated love\" and you meet up and starting sexing it up right away. They even have sexual concentration camp to facilitate the process. If you don't follow it you are punished with unimaginable torture. However, enter MC, Nejima, an idiot infatuated with his school crush, Misaki, who gets paired of with a tsun chick, Ririna, and thus begins the game of Love and Lies. Will the boy end up with the girl he loves or the girl he got assigned? \\n\\n\r\nThe way the show started, it had an interesting premise. They want to explore what love really is and can one really calculate it. Even today, no one really knows the concrete answer to that despite all the online matchmaking websites with their take on different algorithms. With the central theme being love and relationships, people are easily hooked on to the show. So in the beginning the plot was interesting. They introduced the dilemma pretty early and each episode they explore different emotions associated with love, like Happiness, Confusion, Jealousy, Sadness and so on. However mid-way the show takes a huge nose dive. They introduced another character, Nisaka (a boy) who has a crush on the MC, Nejima. Now you had a 4 way love rhombus with a hint of Harem mixed in. It was really unnecessary. If they just kept the dilemma to the love triangle and explored the caveats of love it would've been better imo. As the show goes on, the characters try to unearth the science behind the algorithm while figuring out who to choose in the end. Each episode ends with a bit of twist so viewers still remain motivated to watch the next episode.  \\n\\n\r\nIf the story didn't have enough bumps and cracks, the characters with their lack of personality and substance definitely did. The MC, Nejima, makes you viciously angry. He is too nice and too dumb who just panics at every trivial matter that makes it hard for viewers to really connect with. Then you have Mikasa & Ririna, a sappy confused girl who just loves to tease vs a tsun confused girl who just loves to be teased. Then you have Nisaka, the token closeted homosexual, to cover the void in \"Japan's Hard-core Algorithm\" that didn't account for same gender love. Overall, the characters are just too flat and hard to sympathize, with their daily struggle in finding whatever love they desire. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the failure in story and characters, the OP and ED songs are one of the best in this season. The background score is wonderful to listen to on its own. Although the animation at first will throw you off. I mean, we all know anime characters have big eyes, but this show takes big eyes to the next level. They almost look like aliens but I think the show creator did this to emphasize how much emotion people can show through their eyes. Regardless, the show is animated well with great CGI blending and the blue filter effect is maintained throughout the anime. The show had great cinematography and intense kissing animations that almost made it borderline hentai. Altogether, It fit the anime and gave it a soul that the story and characters lacked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite its wonderful premise, the anime just didn't fully tackle what's better, arrange marriage or love marriage. It was sort of fun to watch each week and mid way through I wanted to drop it but glad I didn't because near the end it picked up once again. The characters are a bit bland and the love rhombus was sort of intriguing. However, maybe sticking to the core of the anime and exploring the emotions behind love in a more in-depth manner would've done justice to this anime. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. Also, tell me, do you believe in love marriage or arranged marriage?  \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "** Minor Spoilers throughout** \r\nKoi to Uso is the worst show I have ever watched. It is a romance anime without the romance. It is worse than shitcom. Worse than any other 5 minute \"WTF\" show. It was physically and mentally painful to get through this show, and I continued watching only because I am a masochist. However I would urge others to watch this show so they can have a solid basis concerning what a \"Bad\" anime is- the worst of the worst- an absolutely shit show. \r\nThe first episode introduces us to the absolute worst MC of any show, let alone anime, inexistence. It is almost as if the show is self-aware because the MC openly admits how shitty he is. However instead of normal shows where the MC is being hard on himself for little to no actual reasons- he is fully deserving of the \"Worst Main Character\" award. He has no personality. He has no interests. The only times we see him on screen is when he is interacting with other characters. He has a gimmick interest to make him \"quirky\" but in reality he is 1 dimensional, boring, and totally undeserving of having very character fall in love with him. Do you want a drinking game for this show? Every time the MC makes a stupid face and gets nervous take a shot. You will die 5 minutes into any given episode (including the OP). It is the most annoying thing I have ever experienced. \"Oh no my assigned wife is in a bathing suit let me blush and make a wacky face and say *Japanese um* a lot\". \"Oh no I see my crush let me act like a little bitch and make a weird face\". \"Oh no my crush is wearing a new shirt let me make a stupid face and laugh like an idiot\". \"Oh no my crush is 50 feet away from me let me start shaking and having an internal meltdown\". UGH \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about love, you should know prior to watching this show that the main romance in this show has blossomed and was kept secret because one time the MC gave his eraser to this girl because she forgot hers at home. I shit you not. This girl tells the MC that she has loved him for the past 5 years or so because of that moment. It is not as if they really interacted prior to their feelings being known. This concept is totally ridiculous. The show (poorly) sets up a setting where people are assigned who they are supposed to marry. Instead of having some intimate romance and in-depth internal struggles related to societal pressure and consequences in this made-up world: They decide to pick some cheesy interaction to make two young teens fall in love and then create a melodramatic show out of it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is barely utilized and is used as a gimmick premise to create a generic harem love triangle/rectangle \"romance\". For instance, there is one character in the show who is either gay or bi. Instead of looking at what happens to gay people in this society or their internal struggles (since society would seemingly pair them with a member of the opposite sex to increase the birth rate)- they are just used as an addition to the harem cause ooh you weren't expecting a gay person to enter the situation did you. Another instance is in the first episode there is a message sent to a cell-phone that contradicts the married \"match\" that the MC receives. Instead of maybe using this as an opportunity to explore internal politics within this marriage assignment system they just use it to force conflict and more melodrama. Instead of exploring how society actually functions with these assigned marriages they just leave it at \"its good\" and don't  actually show how this society operates or the major issues within it (apart from the OP and his little harem). \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis only briefly highlights a major writing error in this show: Tell don't show. See usually when you write a piece like an essay or script for a show- you want to show ideas and concepts through actions rather than just telling about it. This show feels like it was written by a middle schooler while daydreaming and the result is the characters sounding like robots. They always have monologues that assume the audience is stupid. Instead of showing a character is mad at you through them avoiding you or through failed actions to get their attention they will have the MC talking to himself saying stuff like \"Girl #2 has not spoken to me in a week. This makes me very upset because I want to talk to Girl #2. I wonder if she is mad at me. I hope I can fix this\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nApart from the writing, the directing is like its from a hentai. There will be lots of kissing in this show. And it is very cringy. Apart from the massive cringe you will experience due to the MC not having a personality and not knowing how to interact with anyone (though they still fall in love with him because... well the writers wanted a romance ok), the kissing scenes are just... extra. They make it a purpose to show the tongues moving on each other, and they add these \"realistic\" sound effects, and they try and show the spit that hangs from the lips when they break away. Its like some form of weird form of softcore porn... but anime version. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI can go on and on about all the faults in the show, but to prevent myself from writing a book on this show I will outline them here: \\n\\n\\n\r\n- Generic MC to the point of being unlikable and not possessing a personality. He makes watching the show really difficult and I have never disliked a character in any book/movie/show as much as I hate him \\n\r\n- Generic side-characters used for the purpose of having cute designs so that people can \"choose\" which character they want to win\\n\r\n- Terrible Plot Development and uninspiring story given the premise \\n\r\n- Unrealistic character motivations and actions- people falling in love with each other for no reason at all, at least none that we can see on screen. If anything, the show gives us reasons to hate the MC not love him.  \\n\r\n- Overly cringe-worthy scenes, directing, writing. \\n\r\n- Boring melodrama with the plot making little progress towards the end of the show\\n\r\n- No real conclusion at the end of the final episode \\n\r\n- Setting and premise are not utilized to any form of their potential, instead being used as gimmicks. \\n\r\n- No intelligent social commentary on a show that can relate to modern Japan with their birth rate crisis \\n\r\n- Subjective opinion, but I thought the art style was... bad\\n\r\n- Concepts are brought in to produce conflict and then forgotten about\\n\r\n- Even without the cringe this show produces, it is just boring and meant to be watched in the background while doing something more meaningful with your time. \\n\\n",

It's good.\r\nSPOILLERS BELLOW\r\nI usually do not write reviews.\r\nBut what MAL community did to this show is ridiculous and a reflection of a broken system and, honestly, mediocre people.\r\nI take MAL way more serious than I should. I actually use data from this website for my Master's thesis. So when shit like this happens I get really mad.\r\nThe first thing I wanna discuss is: Is this show as bad as its score and some reviews would suggest?\r\nThe answer is no. This show is a perfectly good Drama.It's not flawless. But under any circustance ever this show should be ranked bellow Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, for example.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this was recommended to me, Alongside Aho Girl, I almost shrugged it away. Why would I watch a show with a bellow 7 score? Romance and Drama on MAL are usually naturally low scored because it's basically a teenage sausage fest here. But this was way too low, even for a Romance.\\n\r\nOne day I was bored and decided to give a few episodes a try. And boy, apart from a few gratuitious fanservice and a little bit of lazy infodump, this show was not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nI can give you several hypothesis for why this was not well received:\\n\r\nIt's a Romance and HEAVY on the Drama side;\\n\r\nIt has a gay character;\\n\r\nIt sorta has a love triangle;\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, about the show:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting. They actually have a personality.\\n\r\nThe plot moves forward in most events.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good, with a very good OP and ED.\\n\r\nHanazawa Kana and Shinnosuke did a very good job on the acting side, as one would expect from them. The other actors were also not bad.\\n\r\nThe art is good.\\n\r\nThe premise is interesting and forms a good setting.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it.\\n\\n\r\nBellow I will talk about most things I read in previous reviews:\\n\\n\r\n\"The writting (dialogue) is bad\"\\n\\n\r\nMate, I watched this in Japanese (with english subtitles and later with portuguese subtitles), and there is nothing wrong with the writing on this show. I understand quite a bit of Japanese as well btw. Nothing felt contrived or forced.\\n\\n\r\n\"The premise (matchmaking based on machine learning) is unexplored/ The premisse is dumb\"\\n\\n\r\nAgain, my topic of research is Machine Learning, and with enough data, this is not impossible. Then again, this is fiction. There are several impossible em ridiculous things in Steins Gate, for example, but no one would give that good show a low rating because of that.\\n\\n\r\nSome people brought up that \"People would kill themselves\", \"People would riot\". How many fucking times the show need to shovel into your goddamed face that the system works. We see a billion happy couples in the fucking screen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, for a ROMANCE/DRAMA this show explored too much of how things work. This is not Scifi.\\n\\n\r\n\"Neji is weak/cuck/beta  /   Neji is a copypaste from every other harem show\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you use the words \"cuck and \"beta\" inironically you can honestly go fuck yourself. But to the anyone who are tired of seeing \"weak\" protagonists that can't make a decision or get nervous/anxious: Why are you watching a fucking drama? Shouldn't you be outside being a socially successful extrovert?  Neji honestly felt very real.\\n\\n\r\n\"Characters can't make decisions/ characters are poorly written\"\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever loved someone who is in a relationship? Have you ever loved your best friend? Have you ever loved your bestfriend's spouse? Relationships are complicated. Specially when you are young. I see adults who I think are pretty smart making bad decisions or even not making decisions at all. All the fucking time. Do you wanna see some random normal weak ass dudes punching each other on your action shows? Then why do you want Romance and Drama to not use exageration? That's how the Genre works you fucking moron.\\n\\n\r\n\"This is a harem show\"\\n\\n\r\nDude, do you think harem is every show where more than one person likes the protagonist? That's a ridiculous and shallow definition. What defines a Harem is SEVERAL characters loving the protagonist FOR NO REASON and also a SHALLOW DEVELOPMENT of most of the love interests. Is Onegai Twins a harem? Vampire Knight? Yeah...\\n\\n\r\n\"The show consists almost entirely of misunderstandings and coincidences\"\\n\\n\r\nEveryone hates Gokai(misunderstanding) driven plot. It's annoying and it's why I gave up on Gamers. This show is not like that. Again, people with no/shallow experience with the genre thinking Drama = Gokai.\\n\\n\r\n\"The art is kinda weird/The eyes annoy me\"\\n\\n\r\nYet the same people rate Clannad higher than most shows. I liked it. But this is a matter of preference. When you are judging the art of an anime you are supposed to judge detail level, pallet choice, animation... stuff like that. That's why even though Clannad has aliens as characters the score is still high.\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a great show. It's a good show at best.But it really pisses me off. I really take this site seriously and I almost skipped a perfectly enjoyable show because people are mediocre.",

However, Koi to Uso is a romance show that is different from most in the best possible ways.\r\nWhat makes it exciting and enjoyable to watch is the unique plot and that it is impossible to tell what will happen next and how it will end. In addition, the show doesn\u2019t shy away from sexual matters. In fact, what tends to take a typical romance show at least an entire seasonto portray, happens between the MC and a female character in the very first episode. I knew after finishing the first episode that this show is unique.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 8 episodes, I am not disappointed with any aspects of the show. The characters are just as engaging as the storyline. They all have their personal burdens, and the show makes me feel invested in their struggles.\\n\\n\r\nOther shows this season seem to overshadow Koi to Uso because it isn\u2019t getting the attention and praise it deserves. I decided to watch it on a whim, and I am enraptured. I\u2019m so glad that I gave this hidden gem a chance. I highly recommend Koi to Uso if you are looking for a romance that deviates from the norm.\\n",

But you make see it as a bite off of the Scum's Wish anime that aired recently and they are trying to take some of its fans. made obvious as one of the characters looks like the main character from scums wish. also it has the plot of a forbidden relationship.\r\nthe plot is about a world where in order to help japans decreasing population, its government decides to pair people up with each other for marriage when they turn 16 viasome form of science called the red string of fate. this sounds ok when you first enter the show as it works but our main character falls in love before this point and the pairing up causes issues for him. he see his 16th birthday coming soon and takes the opportunity to tell her how he feels. \\n\r\nso if you havent watched this yet the plot sounds fairly good but the execution is a little bit off for me and i will go into that with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nthe art can be a little off for some people as its kinda combining the scums wish and generic anime art. (im gonna compare this to kuzo no honkai alot.) i not a fan but its tolerable compared to the yuri on ice bite this season (ballroom) that has the xxxholic art combined with a more outdated style. the art for this show is average at best for me.\\n\\n\r\nthe music in this show is amazing. i love hearing it every episode and might enjoy it on its own. the opening has great art and symbolism also. if you dont like anything about this show you have to admit its pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nwe have 3 characters this show follows with nejima being our main character. he fell in love with girl after sharing a eraser with her when they were kids which is a little creepy as he treasures that same eraser  but that girl does the same thing. her name is misaki btw. he is later assigned to ririna (his forced wife). because this show kinda falls under harem pretenses you couldve probably guessed hes a beta and its really annoying. misaki only like for his looks and you can say vice versa for him but they treat it as love thats why this show is called love and lies (lust). ririna i guess is a  normal person compared to others as she rightfully calls our beta of a main character out on his shit and test their false relationship. \\n\r\noverall i dont care for this shows characters but put it off as this show is literally a joke.\\n\\n\r\noverall the show is meh. the characters really pull it down for me. i know its a joke but it doesnt make me hate them any less. the music is a huge plus but music alone is enough to get around the writting. it has a great concept but the motivations of the characters and the fact im a freedom loving American doesnt help it. 6/10, i wonder what it would be like if it was satire.",

This story is all about Nejima Yukari and how he deals with his feelings for his 5 year long love and his new assigned future wife who everyone says he now has to love. If you are a fan of romance anddrama then you should definitely give Koi to Uso a try.\\n\\n\r\nI thought their love story was pretty different in the good way. I mean growing up in a society where loving whoever you want is forbidden and you are told to marry someone you have never even seen before? It's like arranged marriage backed by the science they use on online dating sites. The science part saying \"Don't worry you will fall in love with this person because all the data says you are perfect for each other!\" We live in a society where being able to love who you want is a big deal so this story shows you what it's like if that wasn't the case. Would you prefer to love whoever you want or fall in love with the person assigned to you? \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why so many people are disappointed in the ending. Yes, it has an open ending with nothing totally figured out but this story is coming from an on-going manga so of course the story isn't going to end there. But does that make the show bad? No. It was still interesting. And in my opinion a good anime should make you want to read the source material to know more and this ending was a good way to make that happen.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all give it a try! It's an interesting take on what love really is.\\n\\n",

From the very beginning, the show relies heavily on cliched tropes which makes everything a else feel a bit tasteless. From this unoriginal start, the series devolves into blatant wish-fulfillment surrounding a main character, Nejima, who is completely worthless. He has no traits that make him stand out, and this mediocrity is even pointed out several times by other characters. \\n\\n\r\nSadly the disaster doesn't end there. The ending is inconclusive and is doubtlessly the worst cop-out I have ever seen in anime. It absolutely tarnished anything the show might have had going for it up to that point.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the art was not bad, just pretty average; however I was put off by the design of the characters' eyes. Even for anime eyes, they were a bit too large and had a buggy feel. Also the kissing scenes were atrocious (i.e. way too much tongue).\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier Ririna, unlike our hapless protagonist, is a quality character who really grew on me. She is adorable and made everything else tolerable. And the OP (\"Kanashii Ureshii\" by Frederic) is wonderful and deserves a better show to back it up. Unfortunately, neither of these good points can save this train wreck, and you would do best to look up the song on YouTube and spend your time watching a better anime.",

Who comes up with this premise and just turns it into a generic trope-following romance? Koi to Uso could have explored the interactions with the government, and how that builds on the themes of logic vs. intuition,and obedience vs. rebellion. Yet it hardly did, opting instead to spin its wheels in typical harem nonsense with a one-dimensional protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nBut, hey, at least the music's really good.",

            "content": "Love relationships are inherent in our daily lives. Most of us have experienced and we know how difficult it can be to maintain this relationship for various reasons. Discord, differences of opinion, lack of confidence etc. Sometimes we question ourselves and we try to understand why the couple did not last. But in Koi to Uso couples are created from a database measuring the compatibility between two individuals. The logical question is: can we trust these statistics? Does not reality go beyond theories?\r\nBut... Koi to Uso doesn't seem to waste its time. And I find a melodramatic and insane triangle love (rectangle?) again.\r\n(Light spoilers fromthere because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes - the big spoilers will be specified: *big spoiler*)\\n\\n\r\nFor synopsis, read MAL summary. \\n\r\nKoi to Uso is one of those drama series where I felt uncomfortable when I watched the characters talking, interacting, because the writing was bad. At times I persuaded myself that they would act differently, more maturely and that the characters would evolve in a logical way, at least. But, they didn't. I had fun with this series, I admit. I wanted to slap Yukari many times when I saw him blushing stupidly when a girl told him she loved him. It was a little insane since I found that this character had no really significant quality. Nice? Meh, a classic character as you could see with MCs in many harems and others.\\n\\n\r\nFor the other characters, I don't really want to participate in the fighting between #teamRirina and #teamMisaki because I don't see the interest. If I have to judge their beauty, they are quite equal. As for their personality, they are nice, yeah. One is a rather \"tolerable\" tsundere and the other a gentle mysterious girl who loves Yukari since childhood. (two clich\u00e9s yeah !) There is no real rivalry between the two girls. Surprisingly none seems embarrassed to see Yukari flirting freely and indifferently. Each has accepted her position, one as a future bride (because the government says it) and the other as an \"impossible\" love. I find this aspect absolutely senseless and unrealistic. As if someone logical could accept that his boyfriend spends his time with another girl, as if nothing had happened.\\n\\n\r\nI could possibly think that Misaki is a Samaritan and is so altruistic that she is willing to sacrifice her happiness for others. But... it seems so wrong. Since later she will cry again almost regretting having let Yukari go out with Ririna. And then I just wanted to shake up and tell her: \"But why did you do this at first?\" And we have no explanation, so I'm forced to tell myself that she's a masochist: she likes to suffer unnecessarily. Concerning Ririna, she is a tsundere. She wants comprehensive although it is always a little ridiculous. For example, when she suggests to Misaki and Yukari to kiss in her room to show her. Because this idiot has never seen two people kissing apparently, but in Koi to Uso world, this type of personality exists. After all, she agrees to go out with Yukari when she knows that Yukari loves Misaki. In a way, she is as masochistic as Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yukari?\\n\r\nOh God, this character is absolutely horrible. But really! I don't know what I can say. He is nice but terribly silly, stupid, awkward and is only a mass of cliches. He has a mentality of a child and doesn't understand his responsibilities. He doesn't understand that he must choose (since his two lovers are masochists, let us not forget) but at no time does he take his courage with both hands. It is only a spectator who leaves (and kisses) one of the two girls. He is undecided and seems to have an emotional intelligence worthy of a four-year-old child. In addition, with the other two girls, there is another character named Nisaka, the other male protagonist. (I almost forgot it so transparent he's, excuse me)\\n\\n\r\nNisaka is a Yukari's classmate. He also seems to know Misaki. Hmm... he doesn't seem really interested in women and he is... hung-up? Yeah, surely and we also see that he seems to love Yukari. (But why is Yukari so beloved? It will remain a mystery.) Unfortunately or not, we don't have much information about this character. We don't know its true intentions and the anime doesn't try to make it more important. He made an impressive performance in the play, apparently, according to the audience, but that's all. It would have been interesting to know whether M-M relations were accepted in this society which married only men and women together. I'm not interested in yaoi or anything like that but mentioning homosexual relationships could have been relevant.\\n\\n\r\n*Big spoiler*\\n\r\nProbably the worst scene I've seen in this series: the one where Yukari and Ririna are on the bed so they \"train\" to kiss each other. Before that, many couples (including them) had lessons about using condoms and different ways to have sex. They also watched a porn video. And so... the couples were able to be excited enough to engage in similar acts. But... but... Yukari and Ririna don't seem to have acquired the maturity necessary to understand the notion of marriage, couple or sexual relations. They are 16 but are still ignorant. And so Yukari seems to have great difficulty in having sex. It was so ridiculous when I saw him blushing and shaking. Ririna did not want either. And guess? Because they didn't want to betray Misaki. Yeah, the same girl who told them earlier to go out together anyway. Aaaah so cringe !\\n\r\n*End big spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the general context with these laws about the birthrate, we don't have much more information except: \"Japan was a country known for low birthrates but thanks to the new directives, everything is arranged, meh. We know the people who are responsible for the changes in society but not more. Besides, when I watch Koi to Uso, I don't even feel that their society really differs from the current Japanese society. People don't really complain, everyone seems happy (eg Yukari's parents, Rrina's parents). Apparently a law (worthy of a dictatorship) doesn't seem to bother anyone (except our love triangle). And what a coincidence because there were no rebel groups or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical aspects, the opening theme is quite refreshing and melancholic ending as well. I appreciate both of them. Regarding the OST, nothing memorable but I would gladly check if some can satisfy me. Animation is enough for a school-life/romance series. I didn't like the chara design with their huge eyes but after two episodes, I was no more disturbed. I even think that Misaki and Ririna are sublime. (I have weird tastes, don't be shocked). Some scenes were relatively mesmerizing, especially when our 4 protagonists look at the fireflies while thinking about their future prospects. (in their romantic relationships)\\n\\n\r\nI'm really pleased to see this series come to an end. I don't plan to read the manga. Koi to Uso seemed to start with a more original plot with atypical arranged marriages... but nothing is explored. And add unbearable characters and you can't decently enjoy the series. Personally, their reactions were so stupid and inconsistent that I still found the show to be fun. Fun because stupid. I didn't get bored but it certainly wasn't for incredible romance or stereotyped characters.",

            "content": "Love and Lies is a 12 episode anime where love takes the form of lies and each of the characters are like walking chalkboards, constantly scratching upon each other. Japan for some reason deemed it fit to pass on the torch of its current social crisis to the biggest intellectual heavyweight of a medium out there. By presenting a theoretical scenario in which society as a whole is shaped a certain way in order to entertain the idea of Japan's birth rates not being in the gutter, we are hence introduced to another run-of-the-mill-overdramatized-romance-love-triangle-rectangle-harem-cocktease. And impressively enough, its' atrocious and unexplained setup remarkably gives somethinglike Eromanga a whole new level of credibility. While its' innovativity didn't didn't speak for much in the minds of the masses, at least it had the audacity to try and push forward a healthy agenda. \"It might be grasping at straws, but she's still fertile\". Meanwhile on the other end of the spectrum, we have an anime that is centered around this very same nuanced topic, yet fails to provide any substantial worth at all to the table in regards to social commentary, or much of anything, really. About midway through it crumbles down under the weight of its nonexistent ruleset and unexplored concept, but impale me with a cactus if these redundant melodramatic pieces need consistency within anything but MUH FEELS.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some thought that resides strictly within the compounds of the show does delve into questioning the validity of a clearly-corrupt system via the characters, I find it extremely difficult to believe the writer herself put any while actually writing this story. In anything but an ideal world, the idea of these arranged marriages would be doomed from the get-go. And in an ideal world, there'd be no need for them in the first place. So in the end, all we're left with is a hypothetical scenario that is not and can not be founded in reality by any stretch of the imagination, ever. Thus the series is forced to revolve around this lofty joke of a scenario, and revolve around it, it does. Not only would it be a shitty situation on an emotional and mental basis for most young people, but for some reason it is able to reach the back ends of society as well. If you decide against being being a mindless drone (which is somehow a rare occurance, seeing as teenagers love losing their freedom of choice, being enslaved, etc), it is for some reason able to influence your academic standing for the worse, with no apparent reason anywhere in sight. \\n\\n\r\nImagine being on the short end of an abusive relationship. The person you're paired with treats you like dirt, and you might be in love with someone else. So what happens when you try turning your life around for the obvious better? You get shunned by society, your future put at risk and ironically enough get deemed a lesser human being than your peers. How or why rejecting an arranged marriage is the end all be all of a person's highschool life is beyond me. May as well write \"SEX OFFENDER\" on the entrance exam sheet in big, bald letters just so everyone is aware what a menace to society these rebellious teens really are. Case and point - Marriages are apparently all sunhshine and rainbows where nothing bad can ever occur, and likewise all people are inherently bound to accept the iron fist of free will.\\n\\n\r\nDespite there being enough conveniences and unexplored scenarios relating to the story to where'd I'd call plotholes, the worst detractor evidently might just be how poorly the author invisioned this artifical caricurature of a modern society of hers to function. If anything, this red string of science would eventually end up bringing the country's mortality rate to new peaks entirely, as suicide is already enough of an epidemic currently as is. Therefore, not only does it serve as a weak ass plot, but it also contradicts the very nature of the idea that is combating low birth rate for which it initially set out to do. The only counter-argument ever provided against any of this is that it works cuz.. science, 'n stuff. Because we all damn well know scientists ought to seize and take notice of all of our behavoural patterns, personality traits and preferrable positions in bed. If we've come this far, Koi to Uso's neo-Japan should be an island paradise, barely short of eden. Technology, banzai.\\n\\n\r\nNeji is either the biggest excuse for a human being I've had the displeasure of setting my eyes upon or the typical Japanese beta male, I really don't know anymore. This man trembles in fear and is required to turn the other cheek as the thought of looking another person into the eyes instills such immense dread into the very fiber of his being, especially when one such person happens to be a moderately cute girl who he ends up accidentally wooing by giving a slight demonstration of his immeasurable bravery. Neji knows no fear, ladies and gentlemen, as he only takes 3 full hours to hand over a chopped up piece of his eraser to this desperate damsel in distress. Upon recieving the rougher edge of said eraser, cute girl is suddenly transformed into the love of his life the moment she thanks him for being such an indecisive, although considerate, loser. This is what the main characters' infatuation for one another stems from, sadly enough. I can only assume that it is because of this, I, in recent memory oftentimes encounter myself subconsciously wandering off into the deepest and darkest recesses of my mind, only to spend endless hours upon hours wondering if our species was doomed from the very beginning. Cue the oversatured Nietzsche quote, please.\\n\\n\r\n\"\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33. \ud835\ude08\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude27 \ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36 \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34, \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude36.\".. That's the one. Despite what the aformentioned may make you believe, make no mistake. Neji is quite the player. No, he is THE player. The aftermath of being such an immense pussy his entire life inevitably resulted in his very body transforming itself into a pussy magnet. But his savagery doesn't stop there. The pure sight of Neji's huge pussy makes him irresistable to guys as well, although that's another story entirely. I'm sure that by now most of HanaKana's characters would be able to compete in some sort of national women's marathon for constantly running away from their male counterparts in these drama series so much. What seperates her from Orange's Naho is the old saying about the shy ones being the kinkiest out the bunch, which surely ought to hold some truth this time around. Forest sex, anyone?\\n\\n\r\nWith this in mind, Erasergal is probably to be considered the story's main heroine. It's been an entire year since I rose above and beyond the wish-washy poetry of my collegues by writing an intellectual diatribe for last summer season's Orange, yet it remains as fresh as ever in my mind. As such, there are some paralells to be drawn between the two heroines from the overall feel of the shows to even matching haircuts. Evidently so, what makes Erasergal stand out as the superior/updated version of Naho is the fact that she actually gets shit done on her own accord. No Kakeru-kun is needed here, when she wants some good ol' forest sex, good ol' forest sex will be had. With every tool at her desposal and virtually very little competition, she takes Nejima by the balls and French-kisses him until they run dry. Quite commendably so, really. Apart from her subpar taste in men, HanaKana does this girl justice. She has no problem cucking her friend out of the relationship with her fiance and rocks some cute bangs while doing it. #HanaKanaPleaseGetSomeDiversityYourEntireCastingCatalogueIsBangs\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the heaps of praise I could give to her character in comparison, she is overall extremely willy-nilly in what she wants. It's like she's got severe bipolar disorder and gets caught up in the moment so heavily one episode, only for next week to flush it down the unkempt toilet like it's all bygones and make-believe, cus it'd make harem member #2 sad. Regardless of harem member #2 consciously going out of her way to get them to shag in front of her very eyes. Whatever, logic isn't this show's forte and it slowly devolves into an endurance test of how many mental flops Erasergal can do per 20 minutes, before breaking out into wishful tears full of regret and getting comforted by Nejima who is at this point having a mental breakdown over the overwhelming guilt and being an overall pansy who shouldn't be loved by anyone other than his own mother.\\n\\n\r\nRirina is the second most prominent member of the Nejima Fan Brigade. Despite of her shortcomings and lack of comprehension for her own feelings, she is cute. However, the shortcoming that serves to seperate her from the other members is the overwhelming fact that she is, in fact, a cuck. And I do not use this term lightly or as a form of internet slang in hopes of coming off as hip. Ririna is full-fledged Resident Cuckold in the flesh. The real thing. This girl literally goes out of her way to force her future husband into a make-out sesh with some girl she's known for a day's time. Her backstory is that of loneliness and sorrow, as she's never had any real friends to speak of. Yet when she does acquire the faintest signs of friendships, she successfully serves as a gap closer which would in turn make her the ultimate third wheel, essentially sending her back to square one. Because she admires their unadulterated romance. The irony is that the romance in this show is BAD. Anywhom, Nisaka does well to point this out before going on some completely idiotic tantrum about how the after-effects of cucking can harm Nejima's academic performance. But good on him for trying.  #TeamCuck\\n\\n\r\nLast and dead least in the race for Neji's heart, there is the sole male companion of the gang. Nisaka is sharp, easily embarrassed and full of angst. Why is he full of angst? Either because he's gay, or he's gay and his taste in men is subpar. While to some extent I want to applaud the writer for going this extra mile, is this really anything beyond a fan ship from a fujoshi's hidden locker? Surely, no one in their right mind thought this ship was ever setting sail. Perhaps after years of discrimination in Japan, being gay is the new blockbuster recipe after Yuri on Ice. His voice is good to the ears, but as a non-13 year old girl I sure was not hoping for any.. unforseen unpleasantries to occur between the two boys. #NejiDroppedTheSoap\\n\\n\r\nFinally; Shuu Igarashi, being the only female cast member able to contain her overarching lust over Nejima's shallow manhood personally comes as a huge disappointment. While equipped with a design that reeks of Eromanga's Sagiri that suddenly started hanging out with the wrong crowd and recently got out of rehab with a whole new jaded outlook on life, she is also appointed as being the granddaughter of Lady Democracy from whom the red string of science originated AND Misaki's bff. Due to the extreme position she holds in the story you'd think she'd be able able to grant some clearance as to either of the afromentioned, but no. It's a blank state of mind in which this moody little snowflake operates, being the single biggest cocktease in existence. She is revealed a laughable 2 episodes before the finale and in that short time nothing but her backstory is provided. Oh, and that she orchestrated the entire fall of Nejima. I honestly wouldn't have known she was anything beyond Misaki's over-obsessive stalker had her MAL profile not been indicitive of something else. Thanks, MAL Re-Write!!!\\n\\n\r\nSuMmArY\\n\\n\r\nBoring series filled with plot and character inconsistency buzzword, buzzword, buzzword - IT SUCKS. Taking place in a twisted reality in which emotion and freedom of choice are exchanged with a lofty system that doesn't even work, and the goverment's tax money is spent to gather 16 year olds to mass porn sessions where they can beat off in unison. Devoid of logic, full of corny scenes and dialogue that does get a bit experimental and even overboard for the standard \"By Fujoshi, For Fujoshi\" formula. Which will sadly be all but lost on the vivid fandom consisting of 13-year old girls and a few other unfortunate souls. I would ironically request some alluring Nisaka fanart, but this anime will be long forgotten by the time its' fanbase learns to draw art more impressive than doodles of their cute elementary-school boy crushes.\\n",

            "content": "\"This show was like a bad roller coaster. You love the first turn, the second turn isn't that amazing, and after more turns, you just want to get down and forget the experience.\"\r\nThe story was interesting at the beginning but then transformed into a mess to the point that it was unexplained and inconceivable possible that happens. The partners and couples are selected by \"Japan's officials\" at the age of 16, so you will need to marry with them because the law demands it. \r\nThe writers created a weird love square and combined with a failed character progression titled it \"Koi to Uso.\" I can'tlie that the story is average from the perspective of the characters. The main character Yuraki Nejima failed to express his feelings. He loved Misaki Takasaki since the middle school. When the government selected his partner, he couldn't fight for his hidden love even when she said to him that she loved him. Also, it is incomprehensible why Ririna tried several times to be the backer of Nejima and Takasaki's relationship under the wrong argument that she doesn't know the meaning of LOVE. Ironically, she ended loving Nejima. Well, that was expected so I am not spoiling anything. The other character Yuusuke Nisaka is Nejima's best friend and loves him in silence (love square design). In other words, you can see this as a harem where all the main characters love Nejima, and this one is just so silly that doesn't decide about his life and his feelings. One day he loves Takasaki and after some hours is worried why the other girl didn't send him a message. Maybe he just loves all them. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, they lack a creative background. The love started with an eraser, literally. A failed progression and a failed character background in progress. Characters that are a pool of mixed feelings and don't take any coherent decision. For example, I love you but will love another person in 3, 2, 1. You will say that these actions are because are young but not. It is because the script created shallow characters and not insecure ones so we could mistake insecurity sometimes with silliness. \\n\\n\r\nThe art. it is weird. From some angles it is good, but then you look another angle, and that big puppies eyes aren't that cute as we believed. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was normal, but it didn't help. Both the OP and ED weren't that bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was average, and it didn't conclude the story. The lace of the destiny is hooked to ... ALL them. We didn't get an appropriate conclusion to this story. We got an ending that will add a message like \"for more information, please buy the manga.\"\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story isn't great and needs lots of work to keep us entertained. It is unconcluded and is the reflection that this show was very average.   \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Drama series with love as a central theme tends to draw a variety of audiences. When I seek one of these shows, relationship dynamics is something I trust for the series to capitalize. Koi to Uso (Love and Lies) is one of those series that define love more than just holding hands, dating, or kissing. It\u2019s an anime that dances around the idea of love and drawing the audience into a world of drama.\r\nGetting into this show was actually quite easy. The premise is simple to understand and as a manga reader, I went into this show with tolerable expectations. The first few episodes easilyestablishes the principle character cast \u2013 Nejima, Nisaka, Ririna, and Misaki. These four characters have distinctive personalities that makes them different from one and other. The story interconnects their lives as the setting takes place in the future. Government created the Yukari Law in which young people after 16-years old would be assigned marriage partners. So you\u2019re probably asking thinking \u201chmm, a show that builds relationship through a system. Where\u2019s the love in that?\u201d On the surface, that logic would makes sense but it\u2019s obvious that certain characters have real feelings for each other. For instance, Nejima has a strong attraction towards Misaki. However, his actual marriage partner is a girl named Ririna who is also interested in the idea of love. The three art part of love triangle that explores human emotions, growth, and emotional relationships.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I can\u2019t really say this show does an adequate job at developing its story. At its core, it puts emphasis on the theme of love. The show invites questions that makes us wonder what love actually is. What is romance? How do couples build on a love relationship? Why do we feel attracted to certain people and vice versa? For starters, the first few episodes makes it clear that romantic feelings is based on attraction. However, it does get into the emotional elements soon as we learn more about the characters. Human emotions are exposed such as happiness, jealousy, fear, hate, sadness, anger, pain, and pleasure. Yet at the same time, it often feels like this series tries to do too many things at once. Every episode dedicates a variety of human emotions at once that sometimes feel too much to take in. For instance, the first two episodes explores emotions of happiness, pleasure, but also fear. Koi to Uso translates to Love and Lies and that by itself draws the attention of romance. It\u2019s a very complex subject that even to today, there\u2019s no right answer. \\n\\n\r\nBy no shadow of a doubt, relationships is a very important focus in the show. The central focus is the love triangle between Nejima, Misaki, and Ririna. If we look at these characters individually, they are rather different. Nejima is the nice guy that tries this best to appeal others but sometimes makes himself look like a fool. He is what I\u2019d label as the \u201cAverage Joe\u201d. On the other hand, Misaki is portrayed as the \u2018next door girl\u2019 type that many guys dreams to date. However, she also has her own insecurities and often shows emotional moments when she is with Nejima. Finally, Ririna has the personality of an ice queen. She rarely opens herself to others but at the same time is fascinated by the idea of love. As Nejima\u2019s marriage partner, it\u2019s obvious that she also feels an attraction towards him. Yet, Ririna seems to support Nejima and Misaki\u2019s relationship. However, I think the main problem falls onto the shoulder of main male protagonist Nejima. I\u2019ll be honest here\u2026he is a very uninteresting character. He\u2019s not just average but also lacks any dominate traits as a male. He is like a beta male that always struggles to keep up with the alpha pack. Although some people may argue that he carries a lot of responsibilities (as a guy that chosen by the Yukari system), Nejima still stands out as a weak character. The guy spends way too much thinking rather than acting on his instincts. Although he takes a more initiative in later episodes, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that his character as a whole makes him underwhelming. Misaki and Ririna stands out better as characters on their own although the lack of characterization on them holds them back. Honestly, I wish the show capitalize more on their characters individually. Surprisingly, Ririna stands out as the most interesting character in the show for me. She may be a tsundere but it\u2019s entertaining to see how she reacts to certain situations. Remember, this show explores the theme of love and Ririna is fascinated by it. That fascination leads her to get involved in many situations in this story.\\n\\n\r\nOutside these three characters, we also have Nisaka, the mysterious bishounen that other girls seems to adore. His relationship with Misaki is a big question mark and it even provokes feelings of jealousy from Nejima. While I can\u2019t really say this show has mystery, it does invite theories and questions about who he really is. Beyond that, it doesn\u2019t seem like the show capitalizes on his character much and feels like he\u2019s just there. That\u2019s actually a big problem I have with the show. Every episode seems to build a bit more and more to connect the characters together but in reality, nothing really happens. It feels like a loop and nothing really is achieved in the end. We don\u2019t really get a clear answer on who Nisaka really wants to marry in the end and to that, I can\u2019t help but hit my head on a desk.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Koi to Uso being a drama heavy show, it still finds room to add comedy. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really praise it as it\u2019s pretty dry and feels the same almost every episode. Misunderstandings, sexual fantasies, lewd jokes, and awkward character interactions are what\u2019ll often see. To be honest, I think this show can be enjoyable if you feel attached to certain characters. Luckily for me, I occasionally find Yukari and Ririna\u2019s relationship to be memorable because of their conflicting personalities and the fact that they can connect more on a personal level. Beyond that, this show feels like reading some romance novel where the author isn\u2019t even sure on who root for.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, this show\u2019s animation style is strange. It\u2019s neither good nor bad but peculiar in the sense that it doesn\u2019t look very realistic. Character eyes look abnormally big, fan service seems to happen randomly at times, and expressions seems forced. The character designs are acceptable enough with Misaki and Ririna standing out as the pretty girls at school. Nisaka also has the pretty boy look that makes him look irresistible to the ladies. Unfortunately, Nejima\u2019s character design makes him feel out of place compared to these three. As a show with drama and romance, you can also expect kissing. Tons of it actually. By the time I finished this anime, I lost the count of times Nejima has kissed the main girls. Oh and of course, the show adds saliva and fan service during make out scenes to make them more \u201crealistic\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack makes me wonder if the show knows what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s pretty light-toned and make scenes more melancholic than they should be. The OP and ED theme songs has some noticeable lyrics and symbolism, in particular the red strings of fate. However, what does really stand out is the character voice acting. From all the characters, Misaki probably stands out the most as her character displays the most emotions in her voice. At times, Ririna also stands out especially during tense moments between her and Nejima. Still, the other character voice mannerisms aren\u2019t anything to write home about. Shu sounds like an emotionless doll while Nejima\u2019s voice is just as average as his character.\\n\\n\r\nKoi to Uso is a watchable drama show at best and an trashy romance at worst. The show tries to get the audience invested into the characters but it doesn\u2019t succeed with all its goals. It exposes the weakness of the story when it puts way too much emphasis into the love triangle of the main characters. Hardly anything actually happens! Not to mention, the main male protagonist doesn\u2019t step it up to deliver a strong performance. Nejima holds the show back and is really feels disappointing after watching his role throughout every episode. Up to a certain point, I think this series\u2019 drama is really aimed at specific audience. It's still a fine anime in general but far from perfection. By the time I finished the anime, it feels like a show that couldn\u2019t connect its dots.\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review assumed that you have already watching Koi to Uso and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may be some spoilers in character analysis.  \r\nBased off the popular manga of the same name Koi to Uso which translates literally into love and lies makes use of a theme that\u2019s not often seen in animes which is marriage. The premise of this story is that in this world that the anime is set in Lies are forbidden and Love is doubly forbidden which sets the stage for the story. In this world as a result of populationdecline the government in an effort to control this crisis comes up with a complicated plan that it hopes will solve this problem. \\n\\n\r\nIn this plan when you turn sixteen you are assigned a marriage partner by the government thus eliminating all the work involved for a marriage as this will be taken care off. Thus, the premise here is that of a governmental marriage that is arranged by them that matches a boy and girl that reaches the age of 16 that is paired according to the compatibility of their genes. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot follows the life of 15-year-old Yukari Nejima as he faces this requirement of society as he comes to age and faces the choice of whether to confess his love to his childhood crush and establish a relationship with her and break the law or agree to his arranged marriage and marry a stranger that was chosen for him. \\n\\n\r\nYukari \\n\\n\r\nYukari Nejima portrayed by veteran voice actor Ryota Osaka of Tales of Zestiria the x fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A 16-year-old high school boy that is just entering the age where he knows and understands what love is this is also the age where he dreads the most due to the law. Personality wise Yukari was a calm, kind and honest person that was shown to be very loyal to his friends. In the beginning of the series Yukari was also on the bit of a quiet side and had a tendency of becoming nervous when he is talking with people. Like most teenagers of his age Yukari views love with something akin to disdain and like most people dreads the fact that he will be assigned a random partner to him that he will eventually be married too. Though Yukari understands the necessity of the law and the background behind It Yukari is someone that should have the choice of choosing the person that they will spend the rest of their lives with and as a result he doesn\u2019t hide his disdain about the law. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series Yukari was someone that got nervous and scared rather easily and did not like being put into situations where he will be forced to make a heavy decision that will have long lasting impacts. Indeed, when Yukari does get nervous in this early stage of his personality Yukari falls back into one of his hobbies which is making elaborate objects like funeral mounds that for some reason he has a deep interest in. These objects that he creates I feel were quite interesting to see as they are very detailed which from the level of a high school student is impressive. A peculiar trait of Yukari\u2019s that I find interesting is that when he\u2019s in production mode Yukari also goes into explanation mode as well and the long winded but detailed explanations that he gives on the most random of subjects was pretty interesting and funny. As the series goes on however Yukari notably gets braver as a result of not just confronting his feelings for Misaki but also develop feelings for his assigned partner Ririna as well. He also become more responsible and less of a scatterbrain and willing to shoulder the many responsibilities that he has until now been trying to escape from. This is a result of the friendships and bonds that he has been able to forge with his friends and also his assigned partner Ririna. As a character, I was impressed by Yukari\u2019s growth and development and I was quite surprised that the weak willed and indecisive Yukari that we see in the beginning would later develop into someone that was willing to confront his feelings and be much braver than he was before. I felt that his voice actor Ryota Osaka really did a great job portraying the character of Yukari.    \\n\\n\r\nMisaki \\n\\n\r\nMisaki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of the irregular at magic high school and Psycho pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and acts as one of the two heroines of the show. A high school student that is similar in age to Yukari and is also in the same class as him Misaki is considered to be the class idol as she is both pretty and kind that only serves to enhance her position within the class. A childhood friend of Yukari Misaki is a kind, honest and caring person that as a result makes it easy for her to make friends and bond with people. Apart from her base traits Misaki has also been shown to be rather perceptive and understanding of other people\u2019s feelings especially the main character of Yukari. This I feel is a result of her being a childhood friend of Yukari\u2019s. In the beginning of the series it is shown that Misaki while trying to remain distant is well aware of the fact that Yukari has feelings for her something that she too also has but is reluctant to commit due to the law that acts as the centerpiece of this anime. When it became apparent that their love for each other will not be able to work due to the law however Misaki\u2019s personality starts to gradually change. Initially Misaki opted to squash the feelings of love and desire that she had for Yukari due to the friendship that she establishes with Yukari\u2019s partner Ririna and also because she was reluctant to break the law as well content with just looking at Yukari and being with him when they are in class. However, as the series progresses however and as Yukari and Ririna\u2019s marriage plan gets ever closer Misaki\u2019s feelings and actions soon begin to change as she starts to resent Ririna and starts taking actions that run contrary to her earlier personality. \\n\\n\r\nA surprising relationship that Misaki managed to establish in the series was the friendship and bond that she managed to establish with Ririna Yukari\u2019s assigned wife. In the beginning of the series after they met each other for the first time Misaki was shown to be friendly to Ririna but not completely hating her for being Yukari\u2019s assigned wife instead of her. Indeed, the two of them were able to hit it off pretty well in their first meeting and gradually become good friends trading secrets and gossip whenever possible. As the series goes on this changes as Misaki\u2019s bottled up feelings soon turn to resentment which causes her to start to take actions that will please her but trample on the relationship that she has with Ririna. This however is conflicted with Misaki\u2019s desire to maintain the friendship between the three of them thus causing a struggle inside Misaki. The character of Misaki I felt was an interesting one mainly because Misaki herself isn\u2019t a simple one-sided character and instead has different sides to her character that depend heavily on the kinds of feelings that she is feeling. The development of her character and the emergence of the many sides to her character I felt was done pretty well as you can never tell what she will be doing next thus adding unpredictability to her character. Kana Hanazawa I felt did an excellent job portraying the many different sides of her Misaki. \\n\\n\r\nRirina\\n\\n\r\nRirina Sanada played by veteran seiyuu Yui Makino of Sakurada reset fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the series. A 15-year-old high school girl of a rather rich household Ririna is the girl that was assigned as Yukari\u2019s assigned wife as part of the selections that the red string of fate law determined. A modest, kind and intelligent young girl that as benefit of someone from a rich household also radiates a sense of elegance and nobility. Ririna is someone that can be best described as a true maiden as like Yukari she has no experience of love at all. However unlike Yukari she also doesn\u2019t even have a crush that she longed for in the past either. In the beginning of the series Ririna like Yukari didn\u2019t have a high opinion on the law that will bind her and Yukari together as husband and wife and indeed didn\u2019t actually have a high opinion of Yukari either. However, as the series progresses Ririna\u2019s impression of Yukari gradually changes as a result of seeing Yukari become braver and more willing to challenge the law that governs them and indeed by the end of the series it has become apparent that she indeed has fallen for him as well. \\n\\n\r\nThough Ririna\u2019s initial personality was quiet and composed and had the elements that you will normally see in a rich girl it\u2019s interesting to note that she has none of the usual traits of one as she is neither arrogant or haughty but is rather kind and understanding to others and always willing to listen to them. In the beginning while quiet and composed Ririna was considered by many to be hard to approach and did not really laugh much and the fact that she had a habit of speaking her mind despite the situation only served to reinforce this. As a result of meeting not just Yukari but also Misaki as well however Ririna\u2019s personality begins to change and she gradually becomes more cheerful, happy and positive which also allows her to break out of the nickname that her school friends gave her and allow her to make her first friend. The reaction that Ririna made as she made her first friend which was Misaki I felt was actually pretty funny but also heartwarming to see. Within her personality Ririna has a number of prominent traits that serve to enhance her personality and character. One of the first prominent traits that Ririna has is the fact that despite not knowing what will happen in the future Ririna is someone that when set on a path that she is determined to follow she will follow it to the very end demonstrating how brave and determined she is. Ririna has also been shown to be a very dutiful person and willing to take responsibility for actions that she has caused something that I think is admirable for someone her age. Of Ririna\u2019s character naturally the most prominent thing about her is the manner of how she sees Yukari and Misaki\u2019s relationship that stems from her interest in romance novels and media. It was actually quite funny in seeing Ririna learn about what love is by trying to cause the two of them to match up. As a character, I thought that Ririna was an interesting character whose development I thought was done pretty well. Her views on love itself while unusual I felt matched pretty well with the theme of this show. I felt that her seiyuu Yui Makino really did a great job in portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe arts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good and I especially loved the settings of the school and the various areas that the cast go to in the series. The school during the culture festival for the school I felt was done pretty well. with regards to the culture festival I felt that the costumes that Nisaka and Misaki wore during their little play was designed pretty well and were actually pretty nice. The designs for the characters I felt were pretty good though in this regard I felt that Misaki and Ririna were the only ones that were done well. Animation wise I felt that it was pretty smooth and clear with a good balance of colors for the outfits that the characters wore. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with regards to both the scene music and the opening and ending themes. The opening theme for the series which was Kanashii Ureshii by Fredrick and Can\u2019t you say I felt was especially well done and matched well with the series. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the series I felt was actually pretty strong and easily one of the series best points. Kana Hanazawa who voiced the character of Misaki and Yui Makino who voiced the character of Ririna I felt deserve particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying their characters. The character of Misaki I felt was a complex character that was easy to portray but I felt that Kana really did a great job in her portrayal of her. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Koi to Uso was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and I felt that its main strong points that made it so was its interesting premise, story, excellent voice acting and character development and its ability to provoke questions for the audience. The premise for the show naturally is the complex system that the government in the anime created and implemented. While the law itself is fictional the problem that it seeks to address with it which is population decline is not and is rather a serious problem that several countries in the real-world face including Japan. The usage of a real-world problem into an anime that was solved by a fictional law itself was an interesting premise and one that I applaud. In addition to addressing the problem of a declining population this premise also created an interesting theme of whether marriage should be happiness for only yourself or should your happiness be also to benefit the country that you live in as well. Very few animes are able to provoke such deep questions which is another thing that I like about this anime as it provokes the audience to think and look beyond the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for the series I felt was done pretty well and I felt it was anything but simple as it was full of revelations and unexpected events. Key to this is the struggles that the characters of Yukari, Misaki and Ririna experience for the love that the three have. In particular the complex character and ever-changing attitudes of Misaki only served to make the story more and more interesting as it kept the audience engaged in trying to guess what will happen next. The friendship and bonds that Yukari establishes with Misaki and Ririna I felt was also one of the strong points of the story and seeing it evolve over the series was interesting. The central concept of the series is love and lies and in this I felt that it was done rather well though in this regard the character that best displayed it was Misaki.  The ending itself I felt was interesting and served well to show the results of the culmination of the bonds that Yukari managed to establish with both Ririna and Misaki and helped highlight the fact that love itself is not as simple as people think it is. Sometimes a lie is necessary if you want to remain happy. \\n\\n\r\n However, while I really enjoyed the anime and the story for it there are some things that I felt could have been done better. The character of Nisaka who is the main characters best friend within the series though a main character in his own right wasn\u2019t given much development and indeed his relationship with Misaki and their mutual hatred for each other wasn\u2019t explained really well. But despite such blemishes Koi to Uso was one anime that I really enjoyed thanks to the excellent premise, story and top-notch voice acting from Kana Hanazawa and Yui Makino so I would say that my final score will be a 9/10. \\n\\n",

            "content": "-This review has spoilers. You have been warned.-\r\nJapan has a declining birthrate. To combat this, the Japanese Government thought it'd be a BRILLIANT idea to create a law that forcefully marries two 16 year old kids in hopes that they'd make kids. No mention of riots, arguments about the law, no characters even seem to question the law in general, they just all accept it as it is. So, we're off to a rocky start already.\r\nOur main character, who I will refer to as Paste because he's just a copy/paste character from every other anime, is your average teenager and anime protagonist. Boring as helland no redeeming qualities. Paste somehow fell in love with one of the two main love interests because he shared an eraser with her...i'm not kidding they fall in love because of an eraser. Speaking of this eraser, FOR SOME REASON, they both have treasured this eraser for their remainder of their lives. All the way from Elementary School to High School. This eraser is basically God's wingman. It just has to exist for people to love each other. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Paste liked Eraser (the girl) a lot. Before he gets his notice, he confesses his feelings. Turns out they both have the hots for each other. This is when the show reveals its true colors. Eraser MOUNTS Paste on a park bench at night and just starts tongue sucking him in public. \\n\\n\r\nUH OH, it's Paste's birthday, he gets his marriage notice via text. And would ya lookie there, it's Eraser's name! They can straddle each other all they want from now on. But wait, the text for some reason glitched, and suddenly shows another girls name, who will be referred to as Wafer because I could go for a KitKat or something right now. \\n\\n\r\nReasonably, Paste and Eraser are like \"What the heck, this can't be right, what happened to the text message!\" (which even if the data got corrupted, hacked, or displayed wrong it would be logged in the phone but the characters aren't gonna question it like everything else in this show.) Next thing you know, you have the Ministry of Hormonal Teens popping up at 12AM at night as Eraser straddles Paste and gives him an official confirmation. Not sure how they found him randomly in the middle of the night, but OKAY, we're gonna move forward and not question it.\\n\\n\r\nThus begins the \"Love and Lie\" shenanigans. From this point on it is nothing but Wafer, who is cute as heck but dumb as bricks, putting Eraser and Paste together and watching them kiss/grope each other because it's interesting or something. The show also tries to complicate it by saying Wafer actually likes Paste, and doesn't want to admit she wants to stop making them kiss. Which if you are like me, you probably think that it is stupid. \\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse they introduce a gay character, who is Paste's friend, but also like's Paste. This gay character (who will now be referred to as Bae) is unfortunately the BEST character in the ENTIRE show. He actually has a personality! And he never gets the limelight. This guy actually had to tell Wafer that she liked Paste and maybe forcing him and Eraser to kiss is the reason why she feels bad...\\n\\n\r\nReally, the show just suffers from poor writing. Despite all the characters being on screen, I don't feel like I know any of them. That's probably why i'm using nicknames because I can't remember their names. They just aren't memorable. The show is just a vanilla porn without the porn. I'm not even sure if it classifies as ecchi. I've said this before but the show is just overly hormonal kids getting overly hormonal in sexual situations. It's more awkward to watch than it is entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nFor the positives...well, there just aren't a lot. It has a unique visual style. Nothing that i'd probably remember, but something I could maybe recognize. \\n\\n\r\nI'm probably being way too harsh on the show as many other people seem to be enjoying it, but I am finding hard to suspend my disbelief and revel in the world the creators put me in. It's just bad. Go watch Clannad if you want good bug-eyed romance.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do watch. Remember, Bae is best character.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Japan establishes futuristic e-Harmony & forces 16 year olds to marry who they are assigned. 4 people find themselves entangled in a four way love rhombus. Will Arrange Marriage or Love Marriage win? Find out next time in KTU.  \r\n[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 3/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 5/10]\r\nWhat do you get when you want to deal with a serious issue like Japan's decline in child birth & marriage but still want to attract people from various age groups to explore Love? You get Love and Lies. A show where you end up lying to others telling them how much you loveit when in reality you don't. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is futuristic Japan adopts the arrange marriage policy labelling it \"The Red Thread of Science\". Where the government chooses your partner, based on \"hard-core algorithm.\" The public has no clue how the math works but at age 16, you are paired up with your \"one calculated love\" and you meet up and starting sexing it up right away. They even have sexual concentration camp to facilitate the process. If you don't follow it you are punished with unimaginable torture. However, enter MC, Nejima, an idiot infatuated with his school crush, Misaki, who gets paired of with a tsun chick, Ririna, and thus begins the game of Love and Lies. Will the boy end up with the girl he loves or the girl he got assigned? \\n\\n\r\nThe way the show started, it had an interesting premise. They want to explore what love really is and can one really calculate it. Even today, no one really knows the concrete answer to that despite all the online matchmaking websites with their take on different algorithms. With the central theme being love and relationships, people are easily hooked on to the show. So in the beginning the plot was interesting. They introduced the dilemma pretty early and each episode they explore different emotions associated with love, like Happiness, Confusion, Jealousy, Sadness and so on. However mid-way the show takes a huge nose dive. They introduced another character, Nisaka (a boy) who has a crush on the MC, Nejima. Now you had a 4 way love rhombus with a hint of Harem mixed in. It was really unnecessary. If they just kept the dilemma to the love triangle and explored the caveats of love it would've been better imo. As the show goes on, the characters try to unearth the science behind the algorithm while figuring out who to choose in the end. Each episode ends with a bit of twist so viewers still remain motivated to watch the next episode.  \\n\\n\r\nIf the story didn't have enough bumps and cracks, the characters with their lack of personality and substance definitely did. The MC, Nejima, makes you viciously angry. He is too nice and too dumb who just panics at every trivial matter that makes it hard for viewers to really connect with. Then you have Mikasa & Ririna, a sappy confused girl who just loves to tease vs a tsun confused girl who just loves to be teased. Then you have Nisaka, the token closeted homosexual, to cover the void in \"Japan's Hard-core Algorithm\" that didn't account for same gender love. Overall, the characters are just too flat and hard to sympathize, with their daily struggle in finding whatever love they desire. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the failure in story and characters, the OP and ED songs are one of the best in this season. The background score is wonderful to listen to on its own. Although the animation at first will throw you off. I mean, we all know anime characters have big eyes, but this show takes big eyes to the next level. They almost look like aliens but I think the show creator did this to emphasize how much emotion people can show through their eyes. Regardless, the show is animated well with great CGI blending and the blue filter effect is maintained throughout the anime. The show had great cinematography and intense kissing animations that almost made it borderline hentai. Altogether, It fit the anime and gave it a soul that the story and characters lacked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite its wonderful premise, the anime just didn't fully tackle what's better, arrange marriage or love marriage. It was sort of fun to watch each week and mid way through I wanted to drop it but glad I didn't because near the end it picked up once again. The characters are a bit bland and the love rhombus was sort of intriguing. However, maybe sticking to the core of the anime and exploring the emotions behind love in a more in-depth manner would've done justice to this anime. Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. Also, tell me, do you believe in love marriage or arranged marriage?  \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "** Minor Spoilers throughout** \r\nKoi to Uso is the worst show I have ever watched. It is a romance anime without the romance. It is worse than shitcom. Worse than any other 5 minute \"WTF\" show. It was physically and mentally painful to get through this show, and I continued watching only because I am a masochist. However I would urge others to watch this show so they can have a solid basis concerning what a \"Bad\" anime is- the worst of the worst- an absolutely shit show. \r\nThe first episode introduces us to the absolute worst MC of any show, let alone anime, inexistence. It is almost as if the show is self-aware because the MC openly admits how shitty he is. However instead of normal shows where the MC is being hard on himself for little to no actual reasons- he is fully deserving of the \"Worst Main Character\" award. He has no personality. He has no interests. The only times we see him on screen is when he is interacting with other characters. He has a gimmick interest to make him \"quirky\" but in reality he is 1 dimensional, boring, and totally undeserving of having very character fall in love with him. Do you want a drinking game for this show? Every time the MC makes a stupid face and gets nervous take a shot. You will die 5 minutes into any given episode (including the OP). It is the most annoying thing I have ever experienced. \"Oh no my assigned wife is in a bathing suit let me blush and make a wacky face and say *Japanese um* a lot\". \"Oh no I see my crush let me act like a little bitch and make a weird face\". \"Oh no my crush is wearing a new shirt let me make a stupid face and laugh like an idiot\". \"Oh no my crush is 50 feet away from me let me start shaking and having an internal meltdown\". UGH \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about love, you should know prior to watching this show that the main romance in this show has blossomed and was kept secret because one time the MC gave his eraser to this girl because she forgot hers at home. I shit you not. This girl tells the MC that she has loved him for the past 5 years or so because of that moment. It is not as if they really interacted prior to their feelings being known. This concept is totally ridiculous. The show (poorly) sets up a setting where people are assigned who they are supposed to marry. Instead of having some intimate romance and in-depth internal struggles related to societal pressure and consequences in this made-up world: They decide to pick some cheesy interaction to make two young teens fall in love and then create a melodramatic show out of it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is barely utilized and is used as a gimmick premise to create a generic harem love triangle/rectangle \"romance\". For instance, there is one character in the show who is either gay or bi. Instead of looking at what happens to gay people in this society or their internal struggles (since society would seemingly pair them with a member of the opposite sex to increase the birth rate)- they are just used as an addition to the harem cause ooh you weren't expecting a gay person to enter the situation did you. Another instance is in the first episode there is a message sent to a cell-phone that contradicts the married \"match\" that the MC receives. Instead of maybe using this as an opportunity to explore internal politics within this marriage assignment system they just use it to force conflict and more melodrama. Instead of exploring how society actually functions with these assigned marriages they just leave it at \"its good\" and don't  actually show how this society operates or the major issues within it (apart from the OP and his little harem). \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis only briefly highlights a major writing error in this show: Tell don't show. See usually when you write a piece like an essay or script for a show- you want to show ideas and concepts through actions rather than just telling about it. This show feels like it was written by a middle schooler while daydreaming and the result is the characters sounding like robots. They always have monologues that assume the audience is stupid. Instead of showing a character is mad at you through them avoiding you or through failed actions to get their attention they will have the MC talking to himself saying stuff like \"Girl #2 has not spoken to me in a week. This makes me very upset because I want to talk to Girl #2. I wonder if she is mad at me. I hope I can fix this\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nApart from the writing, the directing is like its from a hentai. There will be lots of kissing in this show. And it is very cringy. Apart from the massive cringe you will experience due to the MC not having a personality and not knowing how to interact with anyone (though they still fall in love with him because... well the writers wanted a romance ok), the kissing scenes are just... extra. They make it a purpose to show the tongues moving on each other, and they add these \"realistic\" sound effects, and they try and show the spit that hangs from the lips when they break away. Its like some form of weird form of softcore porn... but anime version. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI can go on and on about all the faults in the show, but to prevent myself from writing a book on this show I will outline them here: \\n\\n\\n\r\n- Generic MC to the point of being unlikable and not possessing a personality. He makes watching the show really difficult and I have never disliked a character in any book/movie/show as much as I hate him \\n\r\n- Generic side-characters used for the purpose of having cute designs so that people can \"choose\" which character they want to win\\n\r\n- Terrible Plot Development and uninspiring story given the premise \\n\r\n- Unrealistic character motivations and actions- people falling in love with each other for no reason at all, at least none that we can see on screen. If anything, the show gives us reasons to hate the MC not love him.  \\n\r\n- Overly cringe-worthy scenes, directing, writing. \\n\r\n- Boring melodrama with the plot making little progress towards the end of the show\\n\r\n- No real conclusion at the end of the final episode \\n\r\n- Setting and premise are not utilized to any form of their potential, instead being used as gimmicks. \\n\r\n- No intelligent social commentary on a show that can relate to modern Japan with their birth rate crisis \\n\r\n- Subjective opinion, but I thought the art style was... bad\\n\r\n- Concepts are brought in to produce conflict and then forgotten about\\n\r\n- Even without the cringe this show produces, it is just boring and meant to be watched in the background while doing something more meaningful with your time. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiller free section:\r\nIf you like Romance and Drama, ignore the reviews and scores for this show and watch it. It's good.\r\nSPOILLERS BELLOW\r\nI usually do not write reviews.\r\nBut what MAL community did to this show is ridiculous and a reflection of a broken system and, honestly, mediocre people.\r\nI take MAL way more serious than I should. I actually use data from this website for my Master's thesis. So when shit like this happens I get really mad.\r\nThe first thing I wanna discuss is: Is this show as bad as its score and some reviews would suggest?\r\nThe answer is no. This show is a perfectly good Drama.It's not flawless. But under any circustance ever this show should be ranked bellow Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, for example.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this was recommended to me, Alongside Aho Girl, I almost shrugged it away. Why would I watch a show with a bellow 7 score? Romance and Drama on MAL are usually naturally low scored because it's basically a teenage sausage fest here. But this was way too low, even for a Romance.\\n\r\nOne day I was bored and decided to give a few episodes a try. And boy, apart from a few gratuitious fanservice and a little bit of lazy infodump, this show was not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nI can give you several hypothesis for why this was not well received:\\n\r\nIt's a Romance and HEAVY on the Drama side;\\n\r\nIt has a gay character;\\n\r\nIt sorta has a love triangle;\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, about the show:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting. They actually have a personality.\\n\r\nThe plot moves forward in most events.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good, with a very good OP and ED.\\n\r\nHanazawa Kana and Shinnosuke did a very good job on the acting side, as one would expect from them. The other actors were also not bad.\\n\r\nThe art is good.\\n\r\nThe premise is interesting and forms a good setting.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it.\\n\\n\r\nBellow I will talk about most things I read in previous reviews:\\n\\n\r\n\"The writting (dialogue) is bad\"\\n\\n\r\nMate, I watched this in Japanese (with english subtitles and later with portuguese subtitles), and there is nothing wrong with the writing on this show. I understand quite a bit of Japanese as well btw. Nothing felt contrived or forced.\\n\\n\r\n\"The premise (matchmaking based on machine learning) is unexplored/ The premisse is dumb\"\\n\\n\r\nAgain, my topic of research is Machine Learning, and with enough data, this is not impossible. Then again, this is fiction. There are several impossible em ridiculous things in Steins Gate, for example, but no one would give that good show a low rating because of that.\\n\\n\r\nSome people brought up that \"People would kill themselves\", \"People would riot\". How many fucking times the show need to shovel into your goddamed face that the system works. We see a billion happy couples in the fucking screen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, for a ROMANCE/DRAMA this show explored too much of how things work. This is not Scifi.\\n\\n\r\n\"Neji is weak/cuck/beta  /   Neji is a copypaste from every other harem show\"\\n\\n\r\nIf you use the words \"cuck and \"beta\" inironically you can honestly go fuck yourself. But to the anyone who are tired of seeing \"weak\" protagonists that can't make a decision or get nervous/anxious: Why are you watching a fucking drama? Shouldn't you be outside being a socially successful extrovert?  Neji honestly felt very real.\\n\\n\r\n\"Characters can't make decisions/ characters are poorly written\"\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever loved someone who is in a relationship? Have you ever loved your best friend? Have you ever loved your bestfriend's spouse? Relationships are complicated. Specially when you are young. I see adults who I think are pretty smart making bad decisions or even not making decisions at all. All the fucking time. Do you wanna see some random normal weak ass dudes punching each other on your action shows? Then why do you want Romance and Drama to not use exageration? That's how the Genre works you fucking moron.\\n\\n\r\n\"This is a harem show\"\\n\\n\r\nDude, do you think harem is every show where more than one person likes the protagonist? That's a ridiculous and shallow definition. What defines a Harem is SEVERAL characters loving the protagonist FOR NO REASON and also a SHALLOW DEVELOPMENT of most of the love interests. Is Onegai Twins a harem? Vampire Knight? Yeah...\\n\\n\r\n\"The show consists almost entirely of misunderstandings and coincidences\"\\n\\n\r\nEveryone hates Gokai(misunderstanding) driven plot. It's annoying and it's why I gave up on Gamers. This show is not like that. Again, people with no/shallow experience with the genre thinking Drama = Gokai.\\n\\n\r\n\"The art is kinda weird/The eyes annoy me\"\\n\\n\r\nYet the same people rate Clannad higher than most shows. I liked it. But this is a matter of preference. When you are judging the art of an anime you are supposed to judge detail level, pallet choice, animation... stuff like that. That's why even though Clannad has aliens as characters the score is still high.\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a great show. It's a good show at best.But it really pisses me off. I really take this site seriously and I almost skipped a perfectly enjoyable show because people are mediocre.",

However, Koi to Uso is a romance show that is different from most in the best possible ways.\r\nWhat makes it exciting and enjoyable to watch is the unique plot and that it is impossible to tell what will happen next and how it will end. In addition, the show doesn\u2019t shy away from sexual matters. In fact, what tends to take a typical romance show at least an entire seasonto portray, happens between the MC and a female character in the very first episode. I knew after finishing the first episode that this show is unique.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 8 episodes, I am not disappointed with any aspects of the show. The characters are just as engaging as the storyline. They all have their personal burdens, and the show makes me feel invested in their struggles.\\n\\n\r\nOther shows this season seem to overshadow Koi to Uso because it isn\u2019t getting the attention and praise it deserves. I decided to watch it on a whim, and I am enraptured. I\u2019m so glad that I gave this hidden gem a chance. I highly recommend Koi to Uso if you are looking for a romance that deviates from the norm.\\n",

But you make see it as a bite off of the Scum's Wish anime that aired recently and they are trying to take some of its fans. made obvious as one of the characters looks like the main character from scums wish. also it has the plot of a forbidden relationship.\r\nthe plot is about a world where in order to help japans decreasing population, its government decides to pair people up with each other for marriage when they turn 16 viasome form of science called the red string of fate. this sounds ok when you first enter the show as it works but our main character falls in love before this point and the pairing up causes issues for him. he see his 16th birthday coming soon and takes the opportunity to tell her how he feels. \\n\r\nso if you havent watched this yet the plot sounds fairly good but the execution is a little bit off for me and i will go into that with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nthe art can be a little off for some people as its kinda combining the scums wish and generic anime art. (im gonna compare this to kuzo no honkai alot.) i not a fan but its tolerable compared to the yuri on ice bite this season (ballroom) that has the xxxholic art combined with a more outdated style. the art for this show is average at best for me.\\n\\n\r\nthe music in this show is amazing. i love hearing it every episode and might enjoy it on its own. the opening has great art and symbolism also. if you dont like anything about this show you have to admit its pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nwe have 3 characters this show follows with nejima being our main character. he fell in love with girl after sharing a eraser with her when they were kids which is a little creepy as he treasures that same eraser  but that girl does the same thing. her name is misaki btw. he is later assigned to ririna (his forced wife). because this show kinda falls under harem pretenses you couldve probably guessed hes a beta and its really annoying. misaki only like for his looks and you can say vice versa for him but they treat it as love thats why this show is called love and lies (lust). ririna i guess is a  normal person compared to others as she rightfully calls our beta of a main character out on his shit and test their false relationship. \\n\r\noverall i dont care for this shows characters but put it off as this show is literally a joke.\\n\\n\r\noverall the show is meh. the characters really pull it down for me. i know its a joke but it doesnt make me hate them any less. the music is a huge plus but music alone is enough to get around the writting. it has a great concept but the motivations of the characters and the fact im a freedom loving American doesnt help it. 6/10, i wonder what it would be like if it was satire.",

This story is all about Nejima Yukari and how he deals with his feelings for his 5 year long love and his new assigned future wife who everyone says he now has to love. If you are a fan of romance anddrama then you should definitely give Koi to Uso a try.\\n\\n\r\nI thought their love story was pretty different in the good way. I mean growing up in a society where loving whoever you want is forbidden and you are told to marry someone you have never even seen before? It's like arranged marriage backed by the science they use on online dating sites. The science part saying \"Don't worry you will fall in love with this person because all the data says you are perfect for each other!\" We live in a society where being able to love who you want is a big deal so this story shows you what it's like if that wasn't the case. Would you prefer to love whoever you want or fall in love with the person assigned to you? \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand why so many people are disappointed in the ending. Yes, it has an open ending with nothing totally figured out but this story is coming from an on-going manga so of course the story isn't going to end there. But does that make the show bad? No. It was still interesting. And in my opinion a good anime should make you want to read the source material to know more and this ending was a good way to make that happen.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all give it a try! It's an interesting take on what love really is.\\n\\n",

From the very beginning, the show relies heavily on cliched tropes which makes everything a else feel a bit tasteless. From this unoriginal start, the series devolves into blatant wish-fulfillment surrounding a main character, Nejima, who is completely worthless. He has no traits that make him stand out, and this mediocrity is even pointed out several times by other characters. \\n\\n\r\nSadly the disaster doesn't end there. The ending is inconclusive and is doubtlessly the worst cop-out I have ever seen in anime. It absolutely tarnished anything the show might have had going for it up to that point.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the art was not bad, just pretty average; however I was put off by the design of the characters' eyes. Even for anime eyes, they were a bit too large and had a buggy feel. Also the kissing scenes were atrocious (i.e. way too much tongue).\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier Ririna, unlike our hapless protagonist, is a quality character who really grew on me. She is adorable and made everything else tolerable. And the OP (\"Kanashii Ureshii\" by Frederic) is wonderful and deserves a better show to back it up. Unfortunately, neither of these good points can save this train wreck, and you would do best to look up the song on YouTube and spend your time watching a better anime.",

Who comes up with this premise and just turns it into a generic trope-following romance? Koi to Uso could have explored the interactions with the government, and how that builds on the themes of logic vs. intuition,and obedience vs. rebellion.

            "content": "To sum it Up This Anime is a perfect example of what happens when you make an anime adaptation of a Manga and don't even have enough source Material to begin with. Due to the Manga still being at seemingly the 1/2 way point of its production/storyline this was to be expected. The anime changes quite a few key factors that the Manga had in an effort to try to shape its own ending but unfortunately they do this terribly too late at like the last 3 episodes which leaves the entirely Made up anime conclusion feeling extremely empty and unsatisfying. The Whole premise ofthis anime/manga was him having to choose his true love and essentially go against his fate to pursue his original true love which is shown in 3/4 of the anime. However towards the end it essentially betrays that entire plot by (SPOILER BE WARNED) having the MC end the last episode by basically choosing both girls and going the Harem Route. The main problem with this isn't necessarily that he chooses both but rather that it seems so forced because they made the ending up on the spot with almost no foreshadowing of this being his end goal/choice so it comes off as unfulfilling to the viewer. In conclusion this anime had a ton of promise early on and a great synopsis but ultimately falls short due to the lack of Original source material resulting in a half-hearted ending. All in All i give this anime a 6/10 with potentially a higher score if they ever make a S2(unlikely) to flush out the actual storyline.",

            "content": "Koi To Uso is one of the most painfull to watch romance anime I've ever seen. Nothing encapsulated the horrible parts of teenage drama shows more than this one. It truly is perfection, in a perverted way. So let's talk about all the horrible things this show has to offer. (Oh, and there will also be light spoilers)\r\n-,,Just don't think about it\"\r\n\tIf you don't think about anything. You'll understand everything. But if you think about it too much, you'll realize everything is nothing and life is pointless. I mean, you'll realize just how amazing this show is. I mean, it fucking sucks. The show isfilled with so many stupid plotholes, that I genuinely could not have gotten past the first episode if I didn't write down all the dumb stuff that happened, for satisfaction. So, just 'cause, I guess I'll post what I've written along with this review. You can read it if you want, but it's not necessary to understand my other points(especially since I cut certain portions out to not repeat myself). Also, these will not make any sense if you haven't already seen the show.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1:\\n\r\n- Apparently, the children born after this new law had higher average intelligence, which doesn't make sense biologically. Did they kill off dumb people? Did everyone take an IQ test, where, if the score was too low, you wouldn't be allowed to have a partner? I guess ,,Red string of science sounds cool\" is good enough. We do get a little information related to this later, but not nearly enough to justify it.\\n\r\n- Why was Misaki 4 hours late? The show's excuse is that she didn't plan to come, which is the most retarded thing in the history of anything ever (especially once we get more info about her MAD LOVE for Yukari).\\n\r\nEpisode 2:\\n\r\n- Why didn't Yukari, Ririna and their families meet up in a weekend, instead of having to skip school?\\n\r\n- Couldn't Yukari just call Misaki?\\n\r\n- Ririna's personality is incredibly inconsistent. At the meeting, she was straightforward and friendly with Yukari (despite not knowing anything about him, not to mention the importance of that meeting) and continued to act like that through the entire episode (e.g. her interactions with Misaki), but she's apparently an outcast in her class and socially awkward? Bullshit. So far, she hasn't show any signs of being shy. Not to mention her tsundere attitude directly contradicts her ,,shyness\". This inconsistency continues in later episodes.\\n\r\n- WcDonalds.\\n\r\n- Didn't Yukari tell Ririna about all that happened between him and Misaki? There was absolutely no sign that he skipped over a part of his story to Ririna. So how didn't he mention he kissed Misaki?\\n\r\nEpisode 4:\\n\r\n- They don't take physical preference into account. Complete and utter bullshit. There will always be teenagers who only care about how their ,,love\" looks. In that case, they'll hate it if the person they're assigned with is ugly (something that apparently the government can't control), resulting in a toxic marriage. It's a pandering way of appealing to unfit or ugly people by saying ,,It doesn't matter how you look, you could still get the girl you want\" so that they can project themselves more onto the show. You could say that if their egotistical personalities match, than they will both look good, but no. The show completely rejects that idea by stating people ,,don't fall in love with outward appearances\". Some people DO fall in love because of outward appearances and it's foolish to deny that.\\n\r\n- How does a government official *forget* someone's address?\\n\r\nEpisode 5:\\n\r\n- Isn't being carried in someone's arms more embarassing/sluttier than being piggybacked, especially in a swimsuit?\\n\r\n- It was stated in episode 1 that ,,romance with anyone besides their assigned partner is forbidden\", but now, according to Yusuke's dialogue, you can change your partner. So, romance with someone besides your assigned partner isn't forbidden? Quite hypocritical.\\n\r\n- If you could just change your marriage partner, why did Misaki and Yukari act like it was the end of the world at the end of episode 1? Could it be because that wasn't the original concept? The information we get in this episode completely contradicts the show's concept.\\n\r\n- Why the fuck do you have to pay such a harsh penalty if you reject your assigned partner? Isn't it the government's fault if they don't provide you with a suitable partner? If they would've actually given you a perfect match (like the government promotes these assignments), then you wouldn't have even thought of rejecting it. This is stupid and completely illogical. A fee would indeed make sense (as in the money spent searching for a new partner), but rejection of education and employment? What the fuck? Why? How does the government benefit from this?\\n\r\nEpisode 6:\\n\r\n- Suddently Ririna started having a crush for Yukari, which feels incredibly rushed. Up until now she showed no signs of interest or love for Yukari (being embarassed in an awkward situation and doing tsundere shit doesn't count). The dream she had would not have happened if she didn't already have some affection for him. You could say it's because of what happened last episode, but, she didn't seem to abandon the idea of Yukari and Misaki becoming a couple (this is later confirmed).\\n\r\n- Why is the governement shoving sex down everyone's throats when these kids are barely 16? All of these couples are still in highschool. Wouldn't it be extremely bad for their education if they got pregnant before finishing their studies? They don't even mention anything about the dangers of unprotected sex. Not to mention this event will be really awkward for a large number of these couples(e.g. Ririna and Yukari) since they've only know each other for a couple of months (usually not nearly enough to develop a strong relationship). It would make much more sense for them to be taught this when they're 18 or 20 (the age at which you are no longer considered a minor in Japan) or at least have this special class be optional.\\n\r\nEpisode 7:\\n\r\n- Why is Yusuke forced to participate in the play? There's absolutely no way a normal school would allow such blackmailing from the teachers (,,I'll knock 30% off your attendance\"), especially since it was said in public. Yes, we know that Yusuke didn't go to school for some time, but there's been no indications that some of his absences haven't been written. In fact, the quote ,,and it's questionable as is\" implies that all of his absences have been written.\\n\r\n- Why is Yukari asking Silver_hair_guy for advice? Why not his parents or close friends? Silver_hair_guy seems like the last guy he'd want to talk to, considering all that happened. \\n\r\nEpisode 8:\\n\r\n- If Misaki had such a large crush for Yukari, why did she have no reaction to his confession in episode 1? How could neither of them have noticed the other was constantly paying so much attention to them?\\n\r\nEpisode 10:\\n\r\n- Yukari and Ririna could not give less of a shit about Misaki being Yukari's assigned wife (even though they went crazy at the beginning of the episode). First, they *forget* to ask Misaki about Shuu and then they don't even bother to call her, better not waste her precious time. Later, after Yukari finally gets Shuu's number, he writes her a message as if she forgot to give him his pen back or some shit and this is the first time he's talking to her (not to mention he's worried that he might sound SERIOUS). \\n\r\n- Everyone doesn't talk to Ririna because she's not smiling enough. Yeah that makes perfect sense.\\n\\n\r\n-The Concept\\n\\n\r\n\tI've actually seen a lot of people praise Koi To Uso for it's concept (in a positive way), which I think is undeserved. The idea of government officials controlling relationships and love, by itself, could be really interesting. However, when the show tries to delve deeper into this concept and explain how it works, everything falls apart.\\n\r\n\tFirst, they make the setting in modern day Japan, stating that all of this happened in less than 100 years, which kills any ,,because future\" excuse they might've had otherwise (and yes, the synopsis IS lying about the setting being futuristic). Then, they imply that the government completely understands your personality by analysing your genes (which gives them 50% of your personality somehow) and then discovers the rest through tests. WHAT? That's so stupid. You can't understand someone's personality through fucking tests. It's impossible for someone to be self-aware enough to the point that they can answer every question regarding themselves perfectly. They're teenagers for fuck sake. Have you ever heard of narcissism or special snowflakes? What if someone lies and writes something different on the tests intentionally in the hopes of a better partner? It's literally impossible for them to discover if they're lying or not. ,,Oh no, you see, everyone will take the tests seriously because it has such a large effect on their lives\". That's exactly why some might lie, in the hopes of having an amazing life, not to mention they're goddamn teenagers. What if someone was gay (just like in the show) or asexual or a mexican? What do you do then? How does the government even know who is compatible with who? Trial and error could never work in this situation because of the infinite amount of possibilities. There are no 2 human minds identical, similar yes, but never identical. I could go on and on about how this doesn't make any sense, but it's pointless. Oh, and they also change like half the rules by episode 5 and completely abandon it by episode 12, truly story-telling at it's best.\\n\\n\r\n-The Characters\\n\\n\r\n\tI feel like this is how naive extroverts, that never met any shy people, think of shy people. They think of them as charismatic, straightforward, but occasionally embarrassed people. Do you see where I'm getting at? Good, then let's talk about each main character respectively and why they're so horrible.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Takasaki\\n\r\n\t-I'll say it now, Misaki is not a character. She's a plot device. Or, I guess you could say, a 'pander device'. She's just there to be ,,the girl the MC loves that turns out to also love the MC\". The only reason we're given for why she loves him so much is because he seemed like a nice guy and he gave her half a razor. What the fuck? If someone gave me half a razor, I'd think ,,Oh, thanks, I'll pay you back later\" not ,,Oh my god, he's so kind, I wanna suck his dick\". Now, It makes sense that a child would act this way. Kids be kids, you know? But a fucking teenager?! She should've realized how stupid all of this is when she was 13. Here's the thing, if the show was actually smart, they could've made her into a naive or easily manipulated character. This would make sense based on how quickly she fell in love with Yukari. Or maybe have a twist where it turns out she never actually loved Yukari and this was all part of some government plan. You know? Break the mold a little. But no, because that would mean she'd no longer be a plot device and the show needs her to be one. She's there just to introduce Shuu and to be filler to complete the love triangle drama bullshit (which is quite ironic, since Ririna has the same role too). Also, the fact that she's 4 hours late to her meeting with Yukari (who she apparently had such a large crush on) is like the cherry on the top of the plot device cake.\\n\\n\r\nRirina Sanada\\n\r\n\t-This is one of the most inconsistent characters I've ever seen. One minute, she's a full on tsundere that bitches about everything. Then, she gets all shy and flustered and doesn't want to talk to anyone. This character, just like Misaki, doesn't feel like a human being. She instead feels like a template to pander to otaku. A waifu, if you will. \"the girl of your dreams that is so shy and needs someone to save her because she has no friends, even though she's so nice and blah blah blah\". Her romance with Yukari is rushed beyond belief. The fact that she's a loner and nobody talks to her makes no fucking sense. And most of all, even as a cliche tsundere, she's boring as hell. I never found myself interested in anything that had to do with her. Then again, that was kind of my permanent state the entire run time of the show, but... come on! You're a tsundere! Do something interesting!\\n\\n\r\nYusuke Nisaka\\n\r\n\t-This is the best character in the entire show, which isn't saying much. I actually found his love for Yukari intriguing, but the show doesn't do anything with it. Instead, the show puts him in the ,,popular friend of the MC, that just so happened to become friends with the MC, even though the MC has no friends\" box. Apparently, he's also shy and doesn't want to be in the center of attention, which is bullshit, if you pay any attention to what he does.\\n\\n\r\nYukari Nejima\\n\r\n\t-Finally, the elephant in the room. Well, a tiny elephant, but an elephant nonetheless. I've seen a lot of people simply describe him as a ,,generic harem protagonist\". Which is somewhat true, but because of how amazingly bad Koi To Uso is, I think there's a couple of things that make him stand out. First, he's a LOT more childish. And by childish, I mean dumb and naive. There were moments in the show were I simply thought ,,How can you be so dense?\" (I suspect the PG-13 rating to be the cause of this). His hobby for burial mounds is brought up to 11 and eventually becomes very annoying. You like burial mounds. I get it. Now can we move on and have some actual character development?. He's probably the only actually shy character in the entire show. But it's harem-shy, you know? The kind of shyness where if you walk next to him he gets a seizure.\\n\\n\r\nI could talk about the supporting cast, but I'd just be repeating myself, you can already tell how boring they are just by looking at them (except for Shuu I guess).\\n\\n\r\n-The Art and Animation\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is probably the worst thing about the show. It's not good enough to where I can admire it, but it''s not bad enough to where I can laugh at it. So it's just in a middle section of blandness.\\n\r\n\tThe art is average. The animation is average. The color pallet is average. None of the characters stand out and could easily fit in any background. The background is average (if you consider how boring the setting is).  Everything is average.\\n\r\n\tThe only good thing I can say about it, is that it fits the light-hearted romance vibe the show is going for.\\n\\n\r\n-The Romance\\n\\n\r\n\tOh boy, this is what I've been wanting to talk about this entire time. Quite ironically though, this is almost my last point and this is definitely a more sensitive topic, but I'll do my best anyway.\\n\r\n\tIn my opinion, the show doesn't understand what true love is. Think about it. The only love that actually makes any sense is Nisaki's love for Yukari, because he actually knows something about him). Misaki and Ririna don't know jack shit about Yukari, besides ,,he's nice\". Heck, not even Yukari knows jack shit about Misaki and Ririna, besides ,,I'd stick my dick in them\". True love should be caused by relating to a person and said person's problems and by wishing to help that person and to be next to that person for the rest of your life (At least that's what I think). It's kind of hard to explain true love, but this doesn't feel like true love. This feels fake love.\\n\r\n\tThe show constantly mentions ,,Do you want to kiss him?\" as a confirmation to whether you love him or not. In my opinion, this confirms what I've said above. Just because you want to kiss someone, that doesn't mean you love him. You can love someone without originally wanting to kiss them. In fact, if you love someone *just* because you want to kiss them, then you probably don't actually love that person.\\n\r\n\tI also think it's not right to love 2 people at once ( in this case, Yukari's ,,love\" for Ririna and Misaki). That's called cheating. And don't give me some bullshit like ,,Oh they don't mind that he's cheating\", it's still wrong.  A true partner should be just that. A single person that you love from the bottom of your heart. You usually try to devote all your time to being with your true love, especially if you're a teenager. You can't do that if you ,,love\" 2 people. You have to commit to a single person, not do this harem bullshit. I mean, if this was an actual stupid harem show, I wouldn't mind, but when it's taken seriously, that's where you lost me. \\n\r\n\tThen there's sex. Which they tackled horribly. Since they're PG-13, they can't actually go all out like any other show with sexual themes (i.e. Scum's Wish), so they just have the characters kiss a little and then Yukari pussies out, out of getting some pussy. They never explore any of the themes of sexuality, like intimacy or lust, so what's the point? Why introduce sexuality if you're not gonna do anything with it? I'm gonna tell you why, so that they can appear smart and mature in front off dumb teenagers. Fuck this, literally.\\n\\n\r\n-The Sound Design\\n\\n\r\n\tOk, we're wrapping this up, but I might as well talk about the sound a little. It's below average.\\n\r\n\tI think the OP and ED are fine. I can't really criticize them, since I'm not an expert in that category, but I thought they they were mediocre and usually skipped them (although that might've been caused by how much I hated the show).\\n\r\n\tI think the phrase ,,Show, don't tell\" applies to sound as well. Every single scene, even if it's not that dramatic, has this loud drama music in the background and, in my opinion, most of these scenes would've been much more powerfull if they weren't drown out with music. So, in a nutshell, fuck the OST.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion\\n\\n\r\n\tI'm finally done with this horrible show. I could've talked more about the finale and all that Friendship Is Magic bullshit, but I just want to be done with this.\\n\r\n\tSo, in conclusion, Koi To Uso is a horrible show with a dumb plot and bad characters. Unless you want to watch it intentionally to make fun of it (and there aren't a lot of things to make fun of, mostly just cringy and boring stuff), you should skip it. There are much better drama shows out there and Koi To Uso isn't one of them. You might as well look at paint dry and get a better experience than this.",

            "content": "Story - 6\r\nI'm going to be very straightforward with my opinion. The plot and story of an anime is it's very own backbone. Koi to Uso does a good job in the beginning by introducing an interesting concept with a superb amount of potential to the audience. The beginning is fairly unorthodox and really gets viewers hooked in immediately. \r\nHowever, the story starts to swing halfway and take a different curve completely which veers from the original ideal path. I can guess that the creators were way too loyal to the manga and it really ruined the story in the second half of the serieswhich really demolished the original purpose of the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite good, shading and ambient occlusion is done beautifully and the scenery is quite beautiful. The characters are also fairly well designed and overall visually Koi to Uso does a good job. Except I believe that the eyes may be slightly too big. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of this anime is probably the highlight of Koi to Uso. The background music of Koi to Uso is some of the best you'll hear in the world of media. The music truly captivates and amplifies the feels in the scenes especially in the first half of the series. The voice acting is also incredibly good and the sound effects are synced well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\\n\r\nThis is an aspect where the anime lacks tremendously. The character development in Koi to Uso is highly poor and very little backstory is given to the characters. In the end, the reason why the hero and heroine fell in love seems to be over a portion of an eraser. Sure it's sweet and cute, but it doesn't build the characters and a lot of their behavior remains a mystery and unexplained. Little change in the characters is shown as well except in Ririna who i see is the only one who actually does change to a point where it's noticeable. In the end, it feels like the characters are the same as they were in the beginning. Not something you'd want to particularly feel while watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nRest all the negative aspects of this anime, I definitely did enjoy the anime. The audio aspects of the anime really enhance the emotions and really highlight some key scenes in the anime. The directing is well done, there weren't many points in the anime where I felt a scene was too drawn out or it was too short. Overall the anime is quite enjoyable and little melodrama is used. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, the question is. \"Did I like the anime?\" My answer is it was good, not bad, nor great. That's it. Could the anime have been better? Yes definitely, it could have been so much better, there's a huge difference between an anime rated 7 and an anime rated 8 and I feel like this anime just deserved 7. In the end I would probably rate it like a 6.8. The main bummer of this anime is the disappointing second arc. If the anime had continued the first arc  of the first six episodes smoothly, I think this anime could've been one to remember for a long time. In the end nothing can be changed about this anime except hope that the anime creators dont show as much loyalty to the manga as they do and that they change the storyline. Cause honestly, following the manga was a big mistake the anime creators made with this anime.",

But you convince yourself that you're a rational and logical human that follows Descartes' doubt ideology and you shut the voice up. You start seeing signs that it really is bad, the voice screams (Stop already!) but you keep on going. When you're finished, the voice goes (Ha! I told you so). This is the experience that I had with Koi To Uso.\r\nI have seen The Signs : \r\n-an MC who has the brain and way of thinking ofa three years old child.\\n\r\n-he can't even look a person in the eye for 0,03 seconds without blushing.\\n\r\n-he is portrayed as the good, nice guy but is actually a f***boy who kissed two girls in the same day without shame.\\n\r\n-we never know why he is loved so much since he is bland in every sense of the word.\\n\r\n-the two main girls are well aware of his indecisiveness and his playing with both of them, and guess what? They're bffs! They even cheer each other on! \\n\\n\r\nThe anime started with what seemed like a very interesting concept/idea: the government decides who your future husband/wife is, but it failed miserably to explore it.\\n\r\nWe never knew how the calculations are made. How did the millions of citizens accept this new law happily like it was so natural? Why aren't there no rebel groups/organizations? \\n\r\nIn the anime, we find out there is a character (who joins the MC harem) who is gay, and if we leave bad assumptions aside (for example that he's there just to serve as a drama factor or for a certain type of audience), we can say that it roses a very important question: What happens to citizens that don't identify themselves as straight? \\n\r\nWell, the anime doesn't really take itself seriously or cares about any topic aforementioned, as it's basically just a journey of the MC running and screaming (Girl 1 or Girl 2?). \\n\\n\r\nAs Schopenhauer stated: \"The two enemies of human happiness are pain and boredom\". Boredom is what made me watch Koi to Uso, and Mr.Arthur didn't lie. This anime really took away a percentage of my happiness (as well as my brain cells). \\n\\n",

            "content": "Koi to uso, love and lies, this was one unique anime where it doesn't involve a lotta harem member, rather i was more like a \"M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\" so how do I rate this?????\r\nStory, Fair 6.\r\nThe story itself was more like pattered after Romeo and Juliet, where guy and his childhood friend love each other but they can't because of some law that was created in which the gov't get's to decide who will marry who, and somehow has made no exception about those who were already in love with someone, now, to me the plot was good but somehow it was a bit shallowfor such a scenario in which such situation, where the guy was seemly allowed to have some form of consensual cheating, on his assigned wife, the assigned wife seemly tolerates it and the childhood friend looks like she likes it. Also there were a lotta inconsistencies that were associated with the childhood friend who keeps saying that she wants to protect the guy. I mean, what and to whom is she protecting the guy from? Next there were alotta elements that shouldn't even be in the anime like the guy's guy friend who is gay and somehow wants to be part of the harem???????Now don't get me wrong, I like this anime story line but, it kinda looks like that this certain Musawo , who created this thing kinda takes a more complicated route, that one wouldn't understand as to the reasoning of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice, is only limited to Ririna where she was seen with her striped panty in the clinic and in a hot bikini , but in her school uniform?????Not Cool, Misaki on the other hand has the curve and the boobs  and is in a hot school uniform, but in a bikini?????Not good.\\n\\n\r\nSound, Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI just have nothing to say in this category.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Poor 3, \\n\\n\r\nAnd the score is for Yukari Nejima, for being this indecisive fool, who doesn't have the balls to say \"no\" to the notice, instead he played along with the notice, until he met Ririna Sanada, now Ririna, I like her strong personality, she has guts and at the same time she has consideration for both Yukari and Misaki, but she is also as indecisive as Yuakri, where she is having a hard time of weather or not to be with Yuakri who is her assigned husband whom she knows likes Misaki and her being a single for life kind of girl, since she isn't the type of being liked,,,, at first that is. Now on to Misaki Takasaki, she loves Yukari, but she keeps coming up with such reasoning that one wouldn't understand, I mean she has such complication, that can't be comprehend. Now Nisaka Yusuke...he's gay, good thing, he's limited to the sides.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly I was the hoping that Yukari would have the balls to be decisive as to whom he will choose, that kept me glued to follow up this thing up to the last episode, but..............\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nIt ended in an open ending, where it looks like the guy can have both , be with his assigned wife and have a concubine at the same time. SHIT. IMAO, this anime's title \"Koi to Uso\" is a misled, cu'z there is love, but the lie was more of a conflict that has affected that three of them.............Well, nothing more to say..............\\n\\n\\n\r\nPres. Thrump OUT!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I love the eyes and the colors looks of the characters. By the way, Ririna and Takasaki were really pretty good designed.

Are they going to makea trio or what? Okay, there are so many couples with one more person, very modern.

            "content": "There is absolutely nothing more frustrating in romance anime than an obstacle standing in the way of two people that love each other. Even worse in the case of Koi to Uso this obstacle is a nonsensical, bullshit love mandate that threatens sanctions if broken leading to characters betraying their feelings over and over again. Watching characters do that to themselves is suffering and I don't like to suffer so this anime is crap.\r\nAn annoying narrative can at times be salvaged by great characterization of which Koi to Uso has none of. MC is a beta male wimp with aspirations of not being a betamale wimp someday you can find him in literally every anime ever. His love interest is cute but she never says what she actually feels and doesn't have the resolve to fight against the system that opposes her love so who gives a damn. His fake love interest is the best character in the show bar none and she's a tsundere who, to no one's surprise, also struggles to communicate her feelings and say what she actually feels.\\n\\n\r\nLets get one thing straight: This is not Kuzu No Honkai. Not even a little bit. For it to be the #1 recommended show is insanity. That anime was a thorough analysis on the psychology of sex through the lens of naive teenagers under the delusion of equating sex with self worth. Koi to Uso has no such depth to it. It's just a generic love story with a complicated narrative due to a bullshit government mandate. Characters in Kuzu No Honkai did whatever the fuck they wanted, whoever the fuck they wanted, when the fuck they wanted. There were no restrictions to their feelings. Furthermore, the art in Kuzu No Honkai was stunning. The cinematography and character designs were some of the best I've ever seen from the genre, Koi to Uso on the other hand doesn't stand out at all. For the love of god stop comparing the two.\\n\\n\r\nMAYBE all of this could be salvaged if the narrative wrapped up in a conclusive way that settled it's conflicts and brought a resolution to character arcs but of course it doesn't! It's literally nothing more an advertisement for the manga and screams to buy the source material rather than stand on it's own as a work.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot in any good faith recommend this to anyone who wants to feel any sense of satisfaction when watching love stories. Koi to Uso doesn't give you hope or joy, nor does it speak to any broader themes in an intelligent way, it just makes you upset. Not the experience I'd want for myself and hopefully not you too.",

            "content": "You walk to your boring, mundane job with your head down thinking it's just going to be a normal workday where nothing happens.\u00a0 On your way to work, you pass by this beautiful, stunning girl that catches your eye.\u00a0 Without word or warning, you run to her, heart beating, wanting to see or know more about this strange maiden that you just happened to go by.\u00a0 That...is love.\u00a0 Or rather, that's a common, idealistic idea of 'love'.\u00a0\r\nStory: In reality, the subject of love is messy business, where commitment and relationships are tested only to end in separations and heartbreak.\u00a0 To counteract this, the Japanese governmenthas enforced a policy where everyone is assigned a marriage partner with positive statistics showing that this method ends with happy marriages and better, healthier people.\u00a0 It's here where we meet our main protagonist who, despite having an arranged partner himself, attempts to defy the system by trying to chase after the feelings he's harbored for another for several years.\\n\\n\r\nWith the interesting situation of natural love vs. artificial love when you compare the two situations against the corresponding results (aka ending poorly and ending successfully), Koi to Uso presents us with an interesting predicament that doesn't get the execution that it deserves.\u00a0 While the show does initially present the characters' problems in an interesting light and really throws the audience in for a loop with what happens, everything after the beginning two episodes ends up spiraling in a mildly interesting yet disappointing kerfuffle that every so often reminds us that the show has this really great premise only to not go into it that deep as it continues with more middling and slice-of-life routine.\\n\\n\r\nThe only really interesting parts occur when the show presents us with the mystery surrounding the hidden structure of the arranged partners, as the show's main conflict is derived from an unclear government mishap.\u00a0 But once again, the potential is wasted because nothing actually gets answered.\u00a0 Like its source material, the show ends up being more aggravating than interesting because every scene not pertaining to the main quartet having fun only adds another layer to everything without clearing out what's underneath.\u00a0 Like a really bad board of Tetris.\\n\\n\r\nTo describe this show would be in a word...unsatisfying.\u00a0 Quite honestly, Koi to Uso is a show that ultimately has no payoff for its viewers because even with the ending of our main character actually deciding what he's going to do in regards to his 'natural love vs. artificial love' conflict, the show doesn't make a convincing argument for his decision because not only does the show seem to have more than it's willing to let on (which it does.\u00a0 I will attest to that), but the protagonist himself doesn't seem that convinced of the end result because the show apparently hates being definite on its own argument.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Really interesting story idea\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Poor execution\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Unsatisfying Results\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If I may be honest, having the unsure, spineless harem protag as your main character's trope is probably the worst things to have as a main character with a story concept like this.\\n\\n\r\nAside from being obsessed with burial mounds, Nejima Yukari's only other quality is the fact that he's so unsure of himself of who he likes that it becomes the show's main hinderance.\u00a0 Indeed the trait is necessary, as the show attempts to showcase the benefits of both arguments with natural love being organic and following your heart while the arranged notices are statistically better and have happier marriages.\u00a0 As such, him being unsure with what he wants with the two options placed in front of him makes sense.\u00a0 But at the same time, it's really hard to make that argument when your protagonist is so damn passive.\u00a0 As a character, Yukari stays on the sidelines and let his fellow cast members, or anyone else for that matter, dictate the plot because he doesn't make his own decisions.\u00a0 A protagonist is meant to dictate the story, drive the plot so that there's some kind of direction that the story should be heading.\u00a0 He doesn't do anything, and because he doesn't do anything, we're left with a piddling mess of what could've been.\\n\\n\r\nFor \"natural love\", we have Takasaki Misaki.\u00a0 For \"artificial love\", we have Sanada Lilina.\\n\\n\r\nAs the target of Yukari's affection for several years, Misaki poses as one of the show's problems simply due to the fact that nothing about her is told.\u00a0 Sure we know that she loves Nejima, but that's IT.\u00a0 The show is so secretive about her past and the various actions she takes in the show that it becomes so fucking aggravating to watch.\u00a0 Imagine two of your close friends laughing at something and when you ask them what's so funny, they say 'nothing' with a smile.\u00a0 Now imagine that like...thirty times.\u00a0 That's basically Misaki's entire character arc for the entire twelve episode runtime.\u00a0 There comes a time in every story where you do have to spill the beans, damnit.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Lilina, the show paints a surprisingly better picture of her despite the show really trying to shoot for the 'natural love' agenda with her character.\u00a0 Regardless, as Nejima's assigned wife, Liliana learns of Nejima's love and wishes to learn what 'true love' is, going so far as to tell Nejima to chase after Misaki so she could learn what natural love is like.\u00a0 The show even goes to the extent of giving her a more detailed and involved backstory (comparatively) to both of her main counterparts so the viewers resonate with her, as well as basically giving her among other side characters the active role in the situation.\u00a0 She is what basically drives the plot and yes, while I do like her character, as we see her change over the course of the series (which is more than can be said for her 'hubby') the burden is too much to bear on her little shoulders.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's...Nisaka.\u00a0 Honestly, Nisaka is a side character.\u00a0 While yes he is involved with the quartet, he doesn't really do anything or have much of a presence in the series.\u00a0 There is one particular scene that does give him some kind of definition as to what his stance on everything is like, but he, like Misaki, is so wrapped in secrets that it's not even worth bothering with because you already know that you're never gonna get answers.\u00a0 Hell, there's supposedly history with him and Misaki, and it's so vaguely touched on that it might as well not have EXISTED.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters range from side cast who really don't matter in the grand scheme of things, and government workers who really would've made a better story with Koi to Uso's concept.\u00a0 There's also Shuu who again, is wrapped in mysteries that'll never be solved.\u00a0 Yes, yes, I've repeated this many times, but repetition is really about the only way for me to irritatingly drive in the point that this show has far too many unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Lilina is a decent character\\n\r\n+/- The government workers would've made a much better version of this story\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Far too many 'mystery' character traits\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Main character doesn't do anything\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Lidenfilms, Koi to Uso has a light and clear artstyle with a relatively glossy look in order to really give the show that finishing touch.\u00a0 It's a nice style that's very appealing to the eye and has few and far between faults that aren't really all that noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally the show goes on different spectrums with occasional simple artstyle moments to add comedy to a certain scene, or blacken the whole screen and fill it in with a couple pictures to drive in a metaphor to the situation.\u00a0 Quite honestly, the art is rather flexible and is one of the more positive points of the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, clean artstyle\\n\r\n+ Flexible to fit the story point's needs\\n\\n\r\nSound: Honestly, the soundtrack for Koi to Uso is...kinda weird.\u00a0 \"Kanashii Ureshii\" is a poppy rock song that while yes has an interesting beat that makes it actually quite memorable, doesn't really fit with the show.\u00a0 It's actually quite fun to listen to cause its beat is so clear that it's like a song you bop your head to.\u00a0 My question is, why is this kind of song in a romance/drama?\u00a0 It's a good song, but it doesn't really make sense for a show that's supposed to be about the trials and tribulations of falling in love.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, \"Can't you Say\" is a lighter and softer song compared to its OP counterpart, as not only is it a good song, but vaguely fits more with the supposed 'drama' theme.\u00a0 Both tracks are pretty good and are honestly worth a listen to at least once.\u00a0 They just feel like they're part of the wrong show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, somewhat memorable tracks\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Why are they in this show?\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: The original manga has like six to eleven pages a chapter.\u00a0 Literally the moment something good was gonna happen, the shit just ended.\u00a0 However even with roughly eighty normal length manga chapters put into a twelve episode anime with a majority of the fat cut out of it (trust me, they cut out A LOT), the adaptation really brings to light why I've grown so disinterested with the series.\\n\\n\r\nNothing is in a rush to get resolved, and the slow crawl is so painful that I want to cry because an idea like this is wasted on such a horrendous plot that hates resolution.\u00a0 My theory is that they just don't want either one of the waifus to lose, so they drag the story along on this seesaw of death that swings side to side on which girl will win.\u00a0 It sucks, but I've invested too much time into this, so I'm not stopping even though I should.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\r\nRather than enjoy the anime, I enjoyed more of understanding why I like Lilina as a character.\u00a0 Compared to almost everyone else, she actually does something and has more than just one or two traits that aren't held under wraps and wraps of secrets to be revealed at a later time.\u00a0 Plus she's the cuter one of the two so yeah, I like her more.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nWhile I did complain about a multitude of things, Yukari especially is such a boring and nonsensical character.\u00a0 He has almost no traits to him.\u00a0 That is worse than having an unredeeming trait.\u00a0 At least with shit asshole characters, they give you a reason to hate them.\u00a0 This guy however gives you no reason to care for him.\u00a0 And he's the main character.\u00a0 So you end up hating him because he has no reason to hate or like him.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nAside from maybe the first two episodes, Koi to Uso really isn't a show worth investing time into.\u00a0 The show is so devoid of anything useful in its presentation of its central conflict that it almost becomes insulting to the viewer because it pretends to be clever when in the grand scheme of things, NOTHING IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.\u00a0 As such my recommendation is to just...skip it.\u00a0 A good concept is one thing.\u00a0 A good execution is something entirely different.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I got cheated out of my sex scene again, so I'm still pissed about that.",

Someone had a pretty good idea for a manga but had the logic and thought processing of an elementary student. \r\nThe society has low birth rates so in order to stimulate the population the government decided to enforce a law where arranged marriage is mandatory for everyone at the age of 16. \r\nThe main character is Yukari AKA Beta Male nice guy #45608 AKA the self insert AKA the Target Audience AKA YOU. In Elementary school he was sitting next to a cute girland she needed an eraser... he had one of those big erasers that are for really big mistakes and broke it in half and give a piece to her. She said thank you to him and ever since then Yukari has been in love with this girl...\\n\\n\r\n5 YEARS LATER he is still going to the same school as the girl, but has never talked to her since. He still holds on to the eraser in this little box as if it was an engagement ring. He is a day away from turning 16 so he decides to confess to the girl. The girl's name is Misaki. He asks Misaki to meet him at a park at 6pm... He waits there until 11:30 pm and she shows up. He confesses and she confesses that she to was in love with him since the \"Eraser Incident\" (ahhh no wonder this is so popular... Otaku Wish Fullfilment... low effort romances since actual dating and relationship building is to much of a task so hopeful stalking is the only way to \"fall in love\") \\n\\n\r\nThen she suggests they kiss.\\n\r\nHoly fuck the animation literally went from pre2010 studio deen animation to borderline MAPPA level animation JUST for that kiss. I almost thought I was watching a totally different show for a sec (cough Scum's Wish cough) \\n\\n\r\nAh but it couldn't last. It is now midnight and Yukari is now 16 years old. Right on the dot two government employees show up and give Yukari his marriage arrangement person. Like im talking these employees just came out of nowhere to an abandoned park to give Yukari is notification that he was marrying someone else. \\n\\n\r\nThis first episode is the product of bad writing. \\n\r\nTheres currently 120 chapters and what seems to be no end in sight. so you anime only folks can expect an open ending.\\n\r\nIf you liked the wishy washy nature of Nisekoi then this will be right up your alley.",

It casts them in a very dark light and really does ramp up how people, like our main characters, are going to struggle against the system. This creates all sorts of fantasies and possibilities for us, the viewers, for the story and anime itself overall.\r\nThere was also a hint of diversity as tsundere best friend Yuusuke Nisaka is actually gay. Well at the very least, bisexual because he does kiss Yukari while he is sleeping and then we get a monologue about how he lies to himself atthe end of the series. It is important because there are many MOGAI individuals around the world and they don\u2019t just disappear in a situation like this. True, it would have been better if they would have explored this more in depth, but that is not this author\u2019s M.O.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for the anime was rather cute as well. It really lent to a lot of the scenes. The ending as well was very fitting for a series that dealt with a lot of drama. In fact, that was actually a very good part of this series was all of the drama. There was so much drama because everyone is slightly babbling and Yukari can never really get his mouth to say anything clearly but instead just awkwardly trounces through everything.\\n\\n\r\ntotally recommend",

            "content": "---- THE FOLLOWING REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS ----\r\nWhat is love? Albert Camus has already said: \"Not being loved is bad luck, but not loving is own unhappiness.\"\r\nIn the universe of Koi To Use at one time Japan suffered the low birth rate and to solve this was put into force a law that at the age of 16 the government chooses a partner for you based on calculations and statistics, but in fact this it works? From what is shown, but the funniest part of this is to see how people do not complain about this system, everyone seems happy and convinced that thisis right and apparently a law (worthy of a dictatorship) does not seem to bother anyone (except our love triangle).\\n\\n\r\nAnd what a coincidence because there were no rebel groups or whatever. From the very beginning nothing is actually explained, as the system really works for calculations and research, its creators or anything, it's all so superficial. The issue of relating to another person outside your chosen partner also does not have answers such as a consequence if this happens and after all it is not as if the government would know that you are doing this, or if they knew apparently they would not act (remember that one of the ministry's employees knew of Misaki's passion for the protagonist) nothing is actually explained and this is an incredible weak point of the work, you get lost in that which is one of the pillars of the main problem, it is as if the only important thing in the anime was the novel and nothing else needs to be explained as for example works homosexual relations in this system where the government chooses that you have to be straight.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we get into the main problem, we are introduced to a love triangle of young people who are unhappy with the system of their country ... Or not, the question is if they were in fact unhappy with that they would be fighting against it but what you see is a character saying how he is not the right person for the protagonist and trying to play him to the other, as if that were the right thing, being that both like him, there is no rivalry or something and it is funny because it is as if both were masochists about to shut up and give up their happiness to see their supposed love find that happiness with another person.\\n\\n\r\nAlbert Camus also said: \"Man has two faces: he can not love anyone unless he loves himself.\" What happens is so irrational coming from an anime that tries to appear rational and fails abruptly in this question, nothing is rational there, the marriage system itself is clearly corrupted and we can see an example of this when priority is given to an encounter instead of studies or when you become the rubbish of society if you refuse to marry your designated partner. It is all illusory and forced as every marriage seems to be a sea of \u200b\u200broses.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does not have a main focus or if it has it is not explicit, the most visible and logical focus within this is the protagonist trying to choose one of the girls but it is not how this was confirmed after all he does not even choose one of them, the end is totally open, dignified for an anime that can not explain anything but everything has its own, nothing that is wanted by the public is delivered other than kissing as a strategy to attract a young audience to see the anime and different scenes like that in that Yukari and Ririna decide to \"train kisses\" being that before they talked as they wanted Yukari to stay with Misaki, but it was treason, scrotum.\\n\\n\r\nThe Koi To Uso proposal is indeed very good, it really attracted me to something that at first was innovative and interesting and over time just became a waste due to its various weaknesses, I do not know if I can put guilt in its execution and direction because I have no knowledge of the manga but the incredible thing is that it seems to be faithful to its original material and well directed, being the biggest problem its history and plot.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty average overall it's just a clutter of cliches with a good but very poorly explored proposal, the plot and script are incredibly weak and wasted. Remember the episode 1 where the protagonist receives a message about his designated partner in error tone and soon after his cell phone hangs up, is not explained at any time and implies that Igarashi simply sent the message because he wanted, soon after the employees of the ministry appear at midnight to deliver the document to Yukari, where did they appear? The 22 police hours tell Yukari to go home because it was late, but where were they later when Yukaria and Misaki were at the kisses or better where were the ministry officials to see this being that relating to someone else is forbidden? They say that the system works the basis of the latest science however where do you find the related research and calculations? It is said that the system works, but science, where is it?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10 -\\n\\n\r\nI believe the worst thing in this work, are extremely weak, poorly utilized and without a decent characterization and exploration. Being stereotyped and bland, the best character is probably Nisaka, it would be interesting to develop and focus more on him as to the question of how homosexuality works within the society imposed on the work but we do not see it, the truth is that there is not much information about it .\\n\\n\r\nART: 5/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very simple, the traces of scenery and the characters are visually beautiful but nothing more, the animation is also very simple and on average but in some scenes leaves much to be desired to speak the truth I got to question if it really was the LIDENFILMS that was producing this work.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is very good, melodic and singer I really liked and to speak the truth until I sang along, the ending is also very good, my merits to both. As for the OST, nothing more, fits in the general simplicity of the work.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYAMENT: 4/10 - \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to think I did not like Koi To Use at all but that's not true, it's not totally bad to watch and if you're not expecting too much it becomes cool to pass the time.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3/10 -\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a weak and unpretentious work, do not expect too much, the story is not too much, the script is weak and has silly holes, the plot is inconsistent, the characters are crap and the technical quality is very medium. A waste, I sincerely expected more of how they could explain the system and fit a romance with a beautiful drama and ending but what is delivered is just the opposite, lack of answers and inconsistency, a silly and poorly performed novel, an incredibly dramatic force and a fully open end. Koi To Usage does not impress anymore is not even an offense, do not recommend but varies with the taste of each one. If you read this far I have to thank you until the next! o/",

            "content": "Story\r\nI was excited with the synopsis but the story itself turnout to be very disappointing. Not because of the pacing but mainly the characters choices or actions throughout the show. I was expecting something different. Less teen drama and more focused on the government actions and consequences, mainly for characters like Nisaka. \r\nThe ending was not satisfying but I kind of expected it because Nejima is a horrible character. \r\nArt\r\nThe art style fits the story, I guess. Even though, I must admit I find it so much interesting than the plot itself. The characters designs are cute and in some moments really well-made, mainly onthe emotional scenes. However, I would have preferred less fanservice regarding women\u2019s chest size (Misaki). I get it the girls are beautiful, the boobs do not need to get any bigger on each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nCharacters voice actors were, as usual, really good at conveying the mood and emotions. The soundtrack in general fitted every scene but nothing extraordinary. I did downloaded the opening because I really enjoyed the music. It\u2019s catchy and I did not know at the time, but it gives you the vibe of this show. What I mean is, I was expecting something more serious and complex but in reality I guess it was focused on lame characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOh the characters. Where should I begin? Yeah, the main one \u2013 Nejima Yukari one of those infuriating characters that are dense as f\u2026 and because of it, everyone arounds them suffers. Although, I must admit it\u2019s not entirely his fault that some things happened but who I am kidding? This is one of no good for nothing character that somehow is loved by several different characters.\\n\r\nHe is in love with Misaki Takazaki but his assigned wife decided by the government is Lilina Sanada. However, he decides with Lilina support to keep pursuing his first love. He knows there will be consequences and also is aware that he is being unfair to Lilina even if she is also messed up. Others describe Nejima as a good person but in reality I just think is being na\u00efve, unfaithful, dense beyond what can be acceptable and selfish. \\n\r\nMisaki Takazaki is not na\u00efve or dense and she should be aware how terrible person she really is. Pretending or even believing she is a good friend to Lilina and at the same time, teasing, kissing and confessing her love to Nejima. Even if Lili said it was okay and it was supporting them because of their true love, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s wrong. Even worse when she knows Nejima and Lilina might have being developing feelings for each other. She keeps that to herself.\\n\r\nTo some extent I can empathize with her. I can even feel sorry for her but I cannot accept her actions. I know being a teenager and all, we are more prone to make bad decisions but still\u2026\\n\r\nThen, there is Lilina Sanada who is completely messed up. I can\u2019t understand what is going on in her head. I know she is not comfortable with the assigned husband thing or people in general but that cannot justify everything. I want to feel sorry for her but at the same time, I hate how they built her personality.\\n\r\nMy favourite character and the one who I truly feel sorry is Nisaka Yusuke. Okay, his love interest is not fascinating at all but love is not rational. However, Nisaka is truly caring and unselfish. Nisaka knows if he followed his heart alone without thinking about the repercussions it would not only affect him but also the one he loves. Therefore, he is hiding is own feelings and also remembering other characters what will happen if they do not follow the government orders.\\n\r\nFor him is even worse because the idea of a perfect matching in order to improve a low birth rate in the country basically ignores the existence of people that might be homosexual. So, in my opinion, this perspective if more interesting than that BS that\u2019s going on between Nejima, Misaki and Lilina. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIn each episode, I would read the comments section and conclude that there were things different from the manga. Nothing new but I guess they did mess up the ending so I am thinking about reading the manga.\\n\r\nThe characters behaviours in general ruined this for me. That and the annoying fanservice, which would not be necessary if they focused for example on others characters (mainly some from the government). Maybe there will be a second season but I am not even sure if I will watch it. \\n\r\nI will definitely not re-watch this or even recommend to anyone. It\u2019s not terrible but they could have done so much better than this, which will make me forget about this pretty quickly.\\n",

            "content": "On paper, the premise of Love and Lies would seem like a unique one that could have delved into the societal issues that arose from the Yukari System, where the Japanese government mandates arranged marriages between its populace to curb its decreased population. This issue is delved into with focus on Yukari Nejima, a young man who finally works up the resolve to admit his feelings to childhood crush Misaki Takasaki until he receives notification that he has been arranged a marital partner by the Japanese government. However, Yukari's marital partner, Ririna Sanada, has no interest in Yukari as a marriage partner and tries tomend relations between him and Misaki, the latter choosing to distance herself from Yukari upon learning of his arranged marriage. At the same time, Yukari and Ririna try to publicly maintain the mandated arrangement made for them by the government, as rejecting it has serious societal consequences.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its rather unique premise though, Love and Lies mostly focuses on the love triangle between our main trio of Yukari, Misaki, and Ririna. While this typically wouldn't be so bad a case as romance anime has made some memorable lover triangles over the years, this isn't really the case for Love and Lies as the characters here are too shallow to give much of a hoot about in their romantic endeavors as Yukari's too milquetoast as out male lead and the two girls connected to him are not much better off. Worst off, the love triangle doesn't really go anywhere either as Yukari is too hesitant to make any major move, Misaki seems to be holding back on her feelings and doesn't have much to show as a character to get a read on her emotions, and Ririna is mostly focused on trying to hook up the two other characters (though her character does get some gradual development compared to Misaki and Yukari). The anime does devote some focus on the flaws of the Yukari System with the government pushing developments on the arranged couples they make, but this is largely window dressing in focus compared to the anime's focus on its shallow love triangle. These major issues are bad enough as such where the anime ends inconclusively in resolving how the three lead characters get around the Yukari System to get their ideal relationships.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the only praise I could give the series is its artwork. Scenic shots are vast and highly detailed with vivid colors and the characters are drawn with realistic body proportions in mind, though female characters are drawn with the \"big doe-eyed\" character design style traditionally depicted in many anime titles.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, Love and Lies is mostly quite messy as a romance anime. While its premise had potential to be an interesting piece of social commentary, this mostly played second fiddle to the rather pitiful love triangle that the series attempted to push as nothing went anywhere with it and the characters were mostly too shallow to care much for them. Fans of romance anime should definitely skip this one.",

            "content": "My first review is shit. Never mind that. Koi to Uso isn\u2019t that great of an anime it\u2019s not even good. The only reason I rated it the way I did is because of my personal enjoyment. The concept yes, is original but when you break it down it\u2019s nothing new. We all know arranged marriage was a common practice in Japan, rich families want their daughters married to someone of similar background or social status. Like you wouldn\u2019t marry your child to a random delinquent when your line is of nobility or to the daughter of a farmer when you are raising your sonto be a business owner. Yes, that\u2019s what it means to have your marriage arranged for you. You do NOT get to decide for yourself. All the show did was bring the idea into a different era: to the future of perhaps 2067. Now, like the tradition mentioned before. Our oh-why-so-bland main character has a wife appointed to him by the government (ikr. How great would that be?) but the problem is he already has a girl that likes him. Seriously?? How come stuff like that never happens to me? Only in Japanese anime do you get a childhood friend who has a crush on you. By Default.\\n\r\nThe story leaves you a feeling of incompletion and the ending is anime original which means FILLER. Many questions are not answered by the end of its 12 episode run. Below are my dissatisfaction with this show:\\n\r\n1.\tMisaki (one of the two main girls) and one of the casts spite each other WHY?\\n\r\n2.\tThe said character hardly gets any focus; he has a billion times more depth than mc\\n\r\n3.\tDistribution of screentime is awfully uneven between Misaki and Ririna\\n\r\n4.\tRirina can be absent and the story would be a lot more family friendly\\n\r\n5.\tRirina feels like anime add-on\\n\r\n6.\tThe society has accepted sex as everyday life: the age of harlots and horn dogs\\n\r\nNot that I hate the character Ririna in any way I actually like her a lot and she makes an elite waifu. It\u2019s just that the anime doesn\u2019t do her justice. The way this show uses her is unnecessary, like she is only there to cause tension between the love of mc and Misaki. Note that Ririna is in no way poorly written or one dimensional character. The anime is bad but I did still enjoy it.  One thing that saved it is no excessive fanservice. The mc, for once didn\u2019t \u201caccidentally\u201d run into a girl who\u2019s in the middle of changing. The characters are likable (minus MC) and the concept is somewhat new although in the end it turns out no different from your everyday love story or even harem tuned down. If anyone is to be blamed for Koi to Uso not getting a score of 8.77, it is no doubt the fault of the studio that adapted it.\\n\\n\r\nBELOW IS MY FIRST REVIEW IF YOU CARE TO READ\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nKoi to Uso is a love story about a boy and a girl\u2019s school life. High School to be exact. And they seem to have feelings for each other and\u2026(I know right? There\u2019s no way anyone can tell from the title of this anime) my review is so so sooooooooo HELPFUL!! Like I am not telling a lie, seriously.\\n\r\nSo you got yourself a male student and there\u2019s this girl who secretly likes him Yeah,\u2026and big boobs. Unnoticingly, this guy also gets the attention of another girl few episodes in and thus begans his harem life. No. Wrong review..no, wait. No it\u2019s not that simple. The premise is quite interesting. Set in the near future of Japan just because. The government now incorporates a system of arranged marriages, meaning you actually get a wife or a husband appointed to you so you don\u2019t have to worry about staying single your entire life or otaku waifu. Yes. Otaku. Although not brought up in the entirety of the plot, we can assume that\u2019s what led to the system where government decided to intervene in citizen\u2019s interpersonal relationship and affair. Takasaki Misaki, your childhood friend type of girl with big boobs and a caring personality. (no bento but still) she is the one our main protagonist likes and conveniently, she also has a secret crush on him. She is your default girlfriend, the type every Japanese romance has and has never been absent since the genre of high school. Our second candidate Sanada Ririna, is the girl government selects to pair MC with. Anti-social, twin tails, blonde, flat chest and tsundere(minus her signature line) Oh, and a bit of airhead. The anime is enjoyable with its tone set on romance and nothing else. The spice of it is mc\u2019s struggle in making a choice between the two girls. Not your typical harem and I wouldn\u2019t classify it as such but the ending does have that feeling. Twelve episodes is an easy watch but will leave you hanging and the idea of arranged marriage isn\u2019t something totally original but it is a first to use it in that way. At the end it\u2019s not much different than any other romance.\\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "~Koi To Uso (Love and Lies) Review\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story is actually one of the most original stories of this entire season, with a premise that is actually golden. The only problem is that it doesn't feel much like anime. It feels more like a drama live action show that was too expensive so they animated it. Or at all they should have probably made this a movie instead. But even still the story so far is enjoyable and is a very stable concept. One of the best of the season!\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nNow this is a nine for one reason. It's unique, most anime watches are veryused to the average anime character style. While this just brings in a new fresh idea to life, honestly I could have honestly dropped this but decided to just for the story not the art. At first I hated the art but then the differences with the art and story of the season seem to make sense and adds more emotion the character concepts. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound in the series so far is studio quality, though sometime it's a bit obvious it was recorded across the room of a studio. Even still the VA's were picked beautifully and added to the character's like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are special in a good and bad way. But comparing it to the anime series that I have seen so far make this a more or less average high school drama. Which is good but also means that the characters don't have anything special or interesting about them. Luckily the story covers this and makes it more understandable and watchable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the rare gems of the season, though it is not better than the other jems like SukaSuka (WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world) Which had this Ghibli feel to it and an Arrietty quality, this series redeems  itself and I can't wait to see what happens next!\\n\\n",

Spoilers ahead!)\r\nKoi to Uso is an anime that asks an age-old question: \u201cThis or that?\u201d\r\nSuch a question has been asked by people, of people for a millennium. Presented with two choices, someone must select either-or to proceed. It may be as simple as choosing which piece of clothing to purchase at the mall. It may cause more thinking when it involves which vacation spot to go to over the summer. And it may be completely life altering as a specific college is selected to attend.\r\nNo matter the chosen option, the outcome changes. For Koi to Uso,that question pertains not to jackets, beaches, or reputations but rather marriage. And the answer it comes to is ultimately disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to love, many people believe in the concept of \u201cthe one.\u201d A person who, by an unbelievable miracle, completes him or her like nobody else ever could. Whether such a sentiment makes sense matters not, for it isn\u2019t so much about the miracle as it is about people finally finding their better half. Within the story of Koi to Uso, such a belief is unnecessary \u2013 because it\u2019s now a reality.\\n\\n\r\nGovernment mandates, based off scientific evidence and extrapolation, discern for the masses their \u201cone\u201d to such a high degree of accuracy that compatibility is practically guaranteed. Already, and as the anime showcases, this intriguing premise gets the audience pondering about the truth behind love itself.\\n\\n\r\nBe it by notice or by nature, the events tackled within the anime prove that love isn\u2019t so simple. Circumstances, ideas, emotions, upbringings. These facets and more drive someone\u2019s feelings on both an inherent plane and a personal level. To the point that love, in Koi to Uso\u2019s eyes, must mean more than just a reactionary feeling based on a single encounter.\\n\\n\r\nAs it pits programmed fate against random destiny, the anime introduces different setups for its narrative that, while not groundbreaking, give it opportunities to further its thematic presence. For example, the Romeo and Juliet play, while perhaps an overused staple of the rom-com high-school genre, fits snuggly within the show\u2019s discussion on forced feelings given the content of that famous Shakespeare work. Likewise, the camping trip, the sex lecture, and the wedding bring into the fold interpersonal drama, heightened hormones, and vital commitments (respectively) which once again follow the show\u2019s intentions.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Koi to Uso arguably fails to explore its premise to an adequate extent, glossing over potential problems and obvious cues in favor of keeping its focus on just Neji and his singular dilemma.\\n\\n\r\nTake the \u201cpenalty\u201d for foregoing the genetic system. The anime often alludes to this threat, but it doesn\u2019t mean much when it isn\u2019t demonstrated in a real-world (their world) example. There\u2019s also Nisaka\u2019s case of homosexuality. Despite his own orientation, the show does not investigate how the government handles those who are attracted to the same sex, a trait which inherently goes against the \u201cbirth-rate boosting\u201d ideology of the system. The show rarely even takes the time to highlight other couples or the system itself in action for comparative and contrasting purposes, turning the idea into a detail that the audience must trust and accept without remorse.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying devil\u2019s advocate, the premise here exists only to get the ball rolling and not much else. After all, expanding the scope of the plot beyond Neji, Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka\u2019s bubble wouldn\u2019t necessarily serve their dramatic sequences. An acceptable defense, but this direction means that that bubble better be airtight. Unfortunately, it contains a few holes that keep it from maintaining a sound structure.\\n\\n\r\nOne of these bigger holes takes the form of characters popping in out of nowhere. Yajima, the government man overseeing Neji\u2019s situation, appears unannounced many a time, like at the school or at the cat playhouse. And Nisaka\u2019s father has one of the most glaring \u201cOkay, now where did he come from?\u201d moments the medium has ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major hole pops up as frustrating circular dialogue. Characters like Igarashi and Misaki seem as if they are talking in earnest to Neji and others \u2013 only for them to take it all back afterwards. Lines such as \u201cforget everything just said\u201d forces this problem to the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, at its core, the back and forth between Misaki and Ririna represents another hole for Koi to Uso to overcome. But this hole is both a blessing and a curse. It\u2019s a blessing because the anime demonstrates well enough why either side deserves to win in the first place based off their separate-yet-similar reasons regarding love and its necessity in their lives. Plus, it\u2019s the whole point of the show. Without this struggle, no story would exist, and it would therefore not have the chance to think about the scientific and personal implications of love.\\n\\n\r\nYet it\u2019s a curse because, by the halfway point, it becomes painfully obvious that the show will not forego the status quo. Instead, it keeps the narrative in a tug-of-war match that only induces frustration and tiredness the further it goes. This lack of progression means less insight and more of the same drama revisited in a stale fashion.\\n\\n\r\nMust one or the other be selected? Perhaps not. But when Koi to Uso tries very hard to make it seem so throughout the season, and then fails to resolve much (if anything) come the end, it somewhat defeats the purpose of having to make a choice between the two in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has interesting ideas about love and creates some nice setups for its story to talk about the concept. Sadly, it restricts the premise, it upholds too many writing problems, and it lacks a definitive answer to the question it posits. So, altogether, this narrative is by no means \u201cthe one\u201d in this context.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAmong the anime\u2019s key traits, Koi to Uso\u2019s artistry arguably ranks in the middle of the lot.\\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the designs of the characters at least stand out in some regard. Yes, Neji\u2019s short brown hair and unassuming looks unfortunately paint him as a rather bland person. But Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka do not succumb to this same problem.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, the love interests have a few details to call their own. Neji (and the audience) lose themselves in the girls\u2019 large (almost too large) eyes as they look on with affection. Flushed fingers and long lashes increase their prettiness without calling attention to themselves as well. Individually, Misaki\u2019s medium-length hair and generous proportions increase her physical attractiveness, and Ririna\u2019s refined beauty evokes for her a cute, docile aura. As for Nisaka, his purple motif gives him a cool appearance, and his thinner eyes incite his standoffish personality well enough.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the nice character designs, the lighting within the show also has a small foothold. Vibrant nighttime scenes with glowing fireflies. A sunset cascading into a classroom as a gentle breeze shifts the curtains around. Shadowing techniques as they start to get a bit frisky. While not incredible, Koi to Uso likes to play around with the lighting in its scenes when and where it can.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of \u201cfrisky,\u201d the anime also isn\u2019t afraid to showcase its distinct advances, highlighting the passions of the characters therein with kissing and caressing aplenty. Some of the slight ecchi moments perhaps do not belong in this drama, though. They could be chalked up to a meta aspect of the visuals that reflects their sexual ignorance, but that seems like a stretch. At any rate, the show includes a few comedic styles and backgrounds on occasion to change up its usually serious self.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the anime is very straightforward in its presentation. The setting and the direction do not do a whole lot to engage the audience, and the actual animation neither improves nor does anything too interesting. Worse still, artistic errors sometimes creep their way in. For instance, in episode eight, Nisaka\u2019s mouth continues moving as he walks down some steps despite not speaking anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, the designs, the various lighting techniques, and the attempts at varied styles prevent the visuals from falling out of favor. Meaning, the show delivers a passable artistic direction for this love-filled story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Koi to Uso must contend with those occasionally tumultuous, often invigorating feelings of love. Neji, Misaki, Ririna, and Nisaka go about it in their own way, but they also have clear parallels which tie them together.\\n\\n\r\nMost notably, these characters are quite na\u00efve when it comes to love in and of itself. Indeed, they often think about and ask a philosophical question: \u201cWhat is love?\u201d To them, the \u201cpowers that be\u201d have controlled their outlooks and their thoughts on the subject their entire lives. So, it makes valid sense that exchanging an eraser, listening in earnest, or sticking up for someone sparks those skip-a-beat feelings that they do not yet fully comprehend.\\n\\n\r\nTheir naivety also explains their reactionary behavior, for each of them responds to love in a similar yet distinct manner. Neji caves to the thoughts and actions which so easily influence him. Misaki runs away from and lies about her feelings. Ririna romanticizes romance with a starry-eyed expression. And Nisaka goes wholly on the defensive, remaining aloof in his mindset. Without a doubt, love plays a big part in their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s them as a grouping. On their own, these four teenagers not only have different places within Koi to Uso but also have different purposes as well. The two most interesting cast members that fit this description are the ones who get along the least: Ririna and Nisaka.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Ririna\u2019s backstory as a sickly child receives the bare minimum of attention, it accounts for much of her persona. Awkward social behavior, lack of companionship, idolization of romance. Her starting point within this series may in fact be the lowest among the cast simply because she, unlike everyone else, finds love only now and therefore understands the least about it.\\n\\n\r\nThus, her bonds with Neji and the others grant her better relationships and allow her to discover a more realistic view on love. She befriends Misaki and a fellow classmate at her school as she opens up to them, and she learns from Neji and Misaki in equal parts that her feelings equate to a tangible, meaningful existence. So, seeing her evolve from a lonely girl to a mature lady becomes a high point of this series.\\n\\n\r\nNisaka doesn\u2019t evolve as much as Ririna, but he plays an important role within Koi to Uso: maintaining a rational perspective. He often lets Neji bounce ideas off him so that he can in turn dish out his calm advice on the situation. Advice that comes directly from his heart. He can be a bit too tactless, but he has care within him, like when he is willing to put up with the school festival if it would mean making his best friend happy. Either way, when Neji caves, Misaki lies, and Ririna romanticizes, Nisaka keeps that cool of his (save for when his family rolls around), forming a nice contrast in the grounded stance he takes as compared to those three.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Koi to Uso ignores Nisaka\u2019s character to some extent. His interactions with Misaki and Ririna are few and far between despite their collective, interconnected circumstances with and towards Neji. Which is doubly odd for Misaki since his (heavily implied) feud of sorts with her doesn\u2019t mean much or go anywhere meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Misaki and Neji, they fall further behind. The entire season, Misaki lies about how she truly feels, fitting her character well enough and imposing a strangeness within the dynamics. She even goes so far as to \u201cbetray\u201d her friendship with Ririna in that she at one point secretly wishes for her to fail. As she sadly says, \u201cIt\u2019s a cruel thing\u2026loving someone.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYet the anime never reveals the true motive behind why she cannot follow her heart\u2019s desires. Some guesses can be made (e.g., she\u2019s lying about being matched with someone else already, she has a terminal illness that literally prevents a long-term relationship). However, without concrete proof, they\u2019re nothing more than guesses. Her friend Igarashi appears later in the season to deliver extra information about Misaki, but most of the audience already knew or at least could infer these repeated details. As such, she certainly remains shrouded in mystery but likewise stays in a static state with little to no progression.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, Neji is the plain, main protagonist whose main hobby includes knowledge about burial mounds. So, naturally, he\u2019s quite unintriguing, acting more as the vessel for this tale rather than a worthwhile person within it. Not to mention his simultaneous passivity and forwardness. Contradictory behavior for sure, yet it oddly works. In a writing sense, it reflects the tough decision he has before him: choosing between Misaki or Ririna as his bride-to-be.\\n\\n\r\nTo flesh out Neji\u2019s character, Koi to Uso juxtaposes him with Yajima. Surprisingly, this government dude had a personal love (implied to be his red-haired work partner) that he did not pursue, posing as a what-if for the impressionable guy. This tangent leads to a dead-end, though, because Yajima\u2019s involvement and impact feels more like an aside rather than a point of purpose.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Misaki and Neji not having the greatest substance within this story, they stay true to themselves and have their tiny moments here and there. Plus, Nisaka\u2019s role, Ririna\u2019s arc, and the parallels present demonstrate that they all contend with their feelings on love no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the music and the sound within Koi to Uso, its audio decisions reach a standstill of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nOn the helpful side, its opening track provides a neat start. The OP, aptly titled \u201cKanashii Ureshii\u201d due to its catchy lyrical content, begins each episode with a few peppy xylophone notes and a drum beat. However, the funky bass line, the harmonizing vocals, and the clapping interlude create in the song a passion and a somberness that reflects the emotions present throughout the season. Arguably, the dance-like, almost bubbly tone falls outside the scope of this dramatic tale insofar as the composition seems more aligned with a groovier structure rather than a direct appeal. Nevertheless, the OP has the musical chops to take a leading spot within the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack also helps Koi to Uso with its atmospheric approach. Grating sounds, jittery piano keys, reverberating guitar strings, grander movements. These ambient layers coat the show in unease but still maintain a sense of structure throughout. Such structured uneasiness coincides with that ever-present choice that nags at Neji\u2019s mind. Even the tracks that focus on lighter instrumentation for the not-so-serious moments involve a lot of singular, disparate notes too, keeping the anime consistent in its music while also demonstrating its range.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the OP and the OST, the music slowly skirts away from helpfulness and towards hindering. Listening to the ending track \u201cCan\u2019t You Say\u201d, it ditches the groove of the OP for that direct appeal in a hip-hop love song. The snapping, the chimes, the female singers, the melodic structure. Everything screams romantic and emotional, complementing the anime\u2019s own direction. However, despite picking up in the second half of the song and intermixing both Japanese and English lyrics for more dynamism, the ED doesn\u2019t do enough to leave a lasting impression in its beat, its vocals, or its delivery to reach a similar set of heights as its counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting likewise reaches the same conclusion. Each performance works as is but fails to capitalize on a lot of scenes with any notable moments. At the very least, Kana Hanazawa as Misaki and Yui Makino as Ririna bring along innocence, Ryota Osaka as Neji fumbles ahead with nervousness, and Shinnosuke Tachibana keeps his cool for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThese VA performances mark for an average outing, meaning they\u2019re neither too positive nor too negative in execution. In fact, the only real negative in the sound design stems from the infrequent mixing issues. For, while that OST is nice and has its uses during the season, it sometimes overbears the characters as they talk. Again, not that it always happens, but the loudness is noticeable during select scenes.\\n\\n\r\nPointing out the loud music may be overly nitpicky anyway, for the OP and the OST help Koi to Uso in a positive sense regardless. And the ED and the VA performances, while not standout in their inclusion, do not interfere with this project. In total then, and much like the art and the animation, the audio elements rank somewhere in the middle.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that I wouldn\u2019t mind if either Misaki or Ririna won must say something about me, about the anime accomplishing its goals, or both.\\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re kindhearted and sincere, each wanting a relationship with Neji while also dealing with their own situations and even looking out for the other in some fashion. Truth be told, I still like Misaki more than Ririna and believe Misaki to be the better of the two. Yes, she lies a lot, but my heart tells me that her feelings for Neji (and his for her) hold a higher value than those of Ririna\u2019s if only because they derive from a personal place all their own as opposed to a by-the-books matchup.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, I would be perfectly okay with a polygamous ending despite such an outcome defeating the purpose of the show\u2019s thematic presence. For Ririna\u2019s emotions, while a result of government meddling, still blossom from the real bond that she shares with Neji. In simpler terms, I just want those three to live happily ever after together because they deserve it. So, I\u2019m rooting for the harem.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I feel sad for Nisaka. Not that he was ever teased or belittled about his feelings or his personality (because he is known as the hottest, coolest guy in school), but the anime almost never gave him a chance to begin with. Neji clearly has no romantic interest in him, so he was doomed before the story started. Even the scene where the girls rush his changing area when nobody did the same to Misaki minutes earlier didn\u2019t sit right with me in its blatant double-standard portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the mistreatment of Nisaka, I didn\u2019t dislike the anime. I could do without Neji since he wasn\u2019t the best protagonist, but the passionate moments with Misaki and the heartfelt talks with Ririna kept me entertained. The smaller comedy sketches had me slightly chuckling, too. However, without a proper conclusion on any front, I\u2019m left unsatisfied with this incomplete tale.\\n\\n\r\nKoi to Uso leaves much to be desired. It does have several strong traits: its ideas, some of the details in the artistry, a couple of its cast members, pieces of the music. But too many others are decidedly weak: a slew of narrative problems, a boring artistic direction, lame character involvement, average audio design. Between \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthat\u201d, this project chose poorly.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, despite having themes targeting the true roots of love and using worthwhile setups for its various events, the unexplored premise, the weak narrative direction, and the inherent lack of progress prevent this tale from reaching a meaningful place\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Fine, nice character designs and appreciated lighting techniques offset the rather straightforward artistry\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, parallels between the cast strengthen their foundations, Ririna goes through a solid arc, Nisaka is an interesting player who is ignored, Misaki remains too static, and Neji needs more to him\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, a neat OP and an ambient OST help more so than the direct ED, the okay VA performances, and the infrequent loudness in the audio\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, although Misaki is better than Ririna, a polygamous outcome is highly acceptable for maximum romance, but Nisaka\u2019s mistreatment and an unfinished answer is not welcome\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "The series started strong. I'll be explaining my scores not with too much detail. I'll tell you this: I'M OBSESSED WITH THE OPENING\r\nThe story wasn't as all over the place as I thought it would be. Considering the plot is about the govt. choosing your spouse at age 16 there was so many ways it can go and sometimes anime goes in all those directions to satisfy viewers. Luckily, it came off pretty clear and of course built up hope. TBH I didn't know who to root for. I wish the ending were different. It felt like there wasn't really a solution to the storyIMO but I wasn't unsatisfied 100% so I guess that says something.\\n\\n\r\nDespite their big eyes which can be haunting the art was amazing... to me. It carried light and dark undertones based on scene rather than mood for the most part and came out clear cut with detail. If I can notice every single detail of the dress of the character than they were thinking of that much and I love that\\n\\n\r\nSound wasn't gross. The voices weren't dramatic on the Japanese and they spoke in a way that it was anime approved but not like too squeaky and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't much of any character development just about at all. Hence the ending. You ever feel like without CD the story goes no where? Like I said the ending wasn't 100% bad for me because I have gotten way worse but it was pretty bad. The end could've given so many things and we got nothing from it. The main character stayed basically the same and his friend had more character development and he's supporting. So that was heart breaking.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the characters and the end I did enjoy it. How can you not? I looked forward to the opening song every time I started a new episode. Seriously, it's flapjacking catchy. Anyway! I suggest you watch it if you are that curious but if you like an actual solution to your end and developing characters then don't bother. Just a suggestion. It's theme and art reminded me of Scum's Wish, which if you haven't seen it please do, it' why I was drawn to watch this. The summary is so enticing compared to the result. I still enjoyed it though, you might too. Watch at your own risk\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy! :3",

The concept being a regular dude who\u2019s dumb as a bag of shit gets a lot of potential lovers that want to be noticed by \u201csenpai\u201d, comedy and drama pursues and then there\u2019s a small twist. Be it monster girls, aliens, regular high school girls and the list goes on and on. However this anime has done something unique, very interesting and something never done in an anime before: it has actual character development and an interesting story to it! \r\nThe art and animation ofthe show is by studio LIDENFILMS who are responsible for anime like Yamada-kun and the 7 witches, Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor and the shitfest that is the Berserk adaptation from this year. Jesus. What were they thinking when they decided to animate that? The thing that blows my mind the most is that it got a 2nd season. How!? Anyways back to Love and Lies. The color palette used for this show is amazing. The light and bright colors in the background give the show a light-hearted feeling to it. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show overall. It had interesting characters, a unique art style (fuck you A1 pictures. Everything you make looks the same) and a plot I really enjoyed. The reason why I love this show is because it touches on a subject that anime has done before in many different ways and yet it was just really good. The romance aspect was the best part of the show. It really would bring anyone who went through the experience of love, and takes it seriously, into the show. It really gives off a dumpling show vibe. If you don\u2019t know, a dumpling show is what I myself and another anime reviewing channel called Glass Reflection call feel good and chill shows. A show you can watch with your family or a show that gives you a warm nice feeling after each episode.",

I have a lot more to say about this anime so bare with me.\r\nStory 2: The concept about arranged marriages to help alleviate the declining of the birth rate is interesting but it fails to explain it deeper as to why a certain individual ischoosen to be your partner. How are two individuals choosen to be partners guaranteed to produce an offspring in the future?

Yes, the three of them knows each other's feelings but it didn't get them anywhere at the last episode of the anime and just stagnates frome there\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: I liked the series until the yaoi part that caught me off guard. I'm no fan of yaoi nor do I have problems with it. It just felt like after that shock factor nothing else happened. Plus the anime also failed to explore what happens to this kind of situations. You can't bring an interesting concept and just leave it for shock value and do nothing with it. That's like buying your favourite food and just given to a random person without even tasting it or in this case exploring it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2: I know it's just anime but the potential was written all over the first few episodes only for it to go downhill and I couldn't help myself regret watching this anime.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nEarlier this year we got Scum's Wish, which delved into the darker side of romance, however now it seems during the summer season we got another anime that delves into a darker aspect of romance, except this time it's a little bit different.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story is set in a world where Japan assigns people together when they become 16 years old, for Yukari Nejima this is a bad thing since he loves someone else that is until he encountered his assigned wife.\r\nNow the best part about the story is how random and unexpected it is, because I was expecting another casual love triangleto happen between Nejima, Misaki and Ririna, but that wasn't the case because over the course of the show each of the characters feelings change a lot, each of the characters always question whether the feelings their experiencing is true love or just a lie and what surprises me as well is the actions the characters took, I was expecting a lot of fights and arguments to break out yet the characters actually overcame the situation quite maturely and civilised which is usually an uncommon site.\\n\r\nThere was also quite a lot of drama and emotional moments between the characters, because of this and their likeable personalities it was really difficult who Nejima should have ended up with since each of the characters gave good reasons.\\n\r\nHowever I will admit that the story did start lacking a little during the final episodes, the ending didn't help either although it's mixed for me because it was unexpected yet I feel like it was the cowardly route to have gone for, if there is a season 2 it would be interesting seeing how it would carry on this development.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of characters were for once very likeable, it was very enjoyable watching them change throughout the show as they started experiencing new and stronger emotions.\\n\r\nYukari Nejima is the male MC, he is you're usual MC being the awkward and uncomfortable guy yet he can also be very honest, straightforward and selfless which probably helped him out along the way, it was interesting seeing how his love for Misaki get stronger while he also started developing feelings for Ririna too, this led him to a dilemma on who he wants to be with and which feelings are the correct ones to go for.\\n\r\nMisaki Takasaki is the female MC who Nejima has loved for 5 years, despite being a popular and interactive girl she always has had her eyes on Nejima, however her strong feelings for Nejima have created conflict within her because she wishes that whoever is assigned to Nejima feels the way she does for him, but she creates a lie in order to protect Ririna so she doesn't get hurt, it was interesting seeing Misaki's feelings for Nejima become a battlefield inside of her on whether she should stay true to her feelings or not.\\n\r\nRirina Sanada is the female MC who is Nejima's assigned wife, even though Ririna is a Tsundere she is actually the one I would probably get along with the most, she does start of hitting Nejima a few times in her first episode (although the reasons are understandable), yet her character shifts tones a lot going from shy, awkward and a bit angry into an open, straightforward, innocent and cute person. This made her the most interesting character of the series because I thought I was going to end up hating her, but her change in feelings towards Nejima made the journey a lot more entertaining and enjoyable.\\n\r\nYuusuke Nisaka is Nejima's best friend, he also has a secret that he is also in love with Nejima, this made him another interesting piece to the story because he would be the one struggling the most, this is mainly due to the marriage system so his love for Nejima is forbidden well I think because the anime failed to explain this, hence why a season 2 should in some way concentrate on this since Nisaka had an interesting personality, he just wasn't used to his best effect.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty nice including the character designs although it was kinda distracting, mainly due to the large round eyes they had which made them stand out a lot. It did remind of Orange and Your Lie in April a little because it gave the characters more visible features like lips, they aren't usually seen in a lot of anime's instead it's usually just a line.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op and ed were alright, not as good compared to Scum's Wish which had a much better op, no what makes Koi to Uso stand out was the soundtrack which fitted a lot of the scenes very nicely, yet there were some scenes where the soundtrack had a good beat going yet didn't match the events that were going on like the scene where Nejima and Ririna were talking calmly in a park and the soundtrack got really upbeat for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance was actually done very well, the change in everyone's feelings was the main reason I kept on this because I was really interested to see who would fall for who while also wanting to see who end up being the most hurt, true the outcome was much happier than I was expecting which was a bit of a let down, but it has made it a bit more intriguing because you wonder what's going to happen next.\\n\r\nThere was also bits and pieces of fanservice too although those moments where the characters kissed for once didn't feel sexy like it's for the viewers pleasure, instead it felt like the characters were being true to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was an enjoyable Romance, I was expecting another Scum's Wish and instead I got something a little more interesting, however there were some things that weren't expanded upon which is what I hope will be explored, if there is ever a season 2.",

            "content": "Koi to Uso : my thoughts. \r\nThe start of the anime was pretty basic, nothing special except two teens that are in love who finally confess to each other, but this is when the system interferes, because in this world, this is how your future spouse is chosen. \r\nBased on this information, and on the anime description, it may seem that story is pretty good, BUT, the truth is: nope, just nope. \r\nWhy, you may ask? For the sake of explaining the whole plot shortly, I\u2019m writing this. You may or may not agree, but here are my thoughts, anyway. \r\nWith the simple informations givento us through the synopsis, we can see that the story has real potential, and it does, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be handled pretty well. At the start, there are a lot of ambiguous points that concern the characters, and as the first episodes go by, the knot seems to get tighter, and you demand more information to understand the whole thing, but many main points don\u2019t get explained later on, and basically there\u2019s no character development, it just gets messier, and you enter this maze of illogical actions (not in a good, mindful-ish way). But hey, things might get fixed in the last episode, right? I have great news for you: no. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re into psychological anime with a good plot, and story development, this might not be for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending put the anime on fire, it seems to make the situation problematic in so many ways, and the thing is that it already was since the beginning, so imagine it not getting fixed at all. \\n\\n\r\nBut are 16 years old ready for any kind of commitment? They are so unsure about so many things, how can a system be? The main character doesn\u2019t have much of a personality to oppose the system or to choose someone, which makes pretty much at this point the story meaningless. Ririna was somehow interesting, but no further informations are given about her, it seems that she\u2019s only there to ship Nejima and Misaki, and anyway she goes with the flow, no matter what situation she finds herself in. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the story = much disappointment, such wow. \\n\\n\\n",

I enjoyed this anime as it would be hard to choose between the two female characters and the ending was somewhat good.

            "content": "This show starts out with an interesting premise. The government chooses a person's partner when they reach the age of 16. \r\nIn the first two episodes, Koi to Uso does a good job of conveying the emotions that come from teenagers living in a world that is quite different from ours, at first glance. The teenagers don't like the fact that their partner will get chosen for them, so they declare that they'll never get married, which is a rather accurate representation of a teenager's feelings before they fall in love; representing their fear and denial of getting married.\r\nThe premise is very similar to amodern-day Romeo & Juliet, and like I stated, it does a good job of conveying that \"forbidden love\" in the first two episodes, but then it falls apart right after and turns into a generic romcom.\\n\\n\r\nIf a partner-choosing system like that was to be forced on people in the real world, everyone would lose their shit. It's an oppressive system that manipulates people and \"encourages\" them to have children just so the birth rate doesn't decline. \\n\\n\r\nAnd instead of showing that, the series does the complete opposite and tries to imply that this system is almost 100% accurate with its results, and most pairs are happy with their partner. It's very unbelievable as we're barely told anything about this system.\\n\\n\r\nWith this system set by the government, this series had a lot of potential in exploring how different this world is compared to ours, how people act differently, live differently, feel differently, deal with certain situations differently. Hell, this premise is even perfect to explore homosexual relationships, but the most this show does is only give implications and it never delves deeper into it, almost like it's too afraid to stray away from its generic romcom direction.\\n\\n\r\nI would go more into this, but this review is long already. Overall, this show isn't really worth watching, but if the premise interests you then try watching it and you might see something that I didn't.",

This review contains a perspective suited for both, without spoiling the story.\r\n(important note: towards the end, the series didn't stick to the original story from its source (manga). So if you're one of the people who take the accuracy of the plot based on its source meticulously, then watching this series would be a waste of time.)\r\nGood Points:\r\n- Art\r\nThe art was able to emphasize the mood for most of the scenes especially for sentimental moments that required theeffective usage of aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound \\n\r\nIt wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the OP alone made up for the shortcomings of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBad Points:\\n\\n\r\n- Weak MC\\n\r\nWeak MCs are common and is considered as a cliche, especially in a genre such as Romance. Nevertheless, there is always a limit as to how a character can get indecisive and unassertive, and these were traits that only got worse in the story as it progresses.\\n\\n\r\nHaving a weak personality gives a character the potential to improve and grow, but making it as an unchanging trait only drags the down the quality of the story.\\n\\n\r\n- Inconsistency\\n\r\nOne important aspect in every series would always be its consistency. What makes this show inconsistent is its inability to maintain a natural development between the relationships of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nProvided that the show managed to leave a good impression on me during the first half of the show, I couldn't bring myself to score lower than it is based on how the animators ended the show, knowing that they did not follow the source material.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of an anime series, it seems that the show was created for the sole purpose of promoting its manga but does a horrible attempt in doing so. It leaves the viewers either not wanting another season, or tempts them to read the manga instead in hopes of finding better plot progress.\\n\\n\r\nA show only gets disappointing if it started out good but fails to stay as is towards the end, and this series is definitely one that fits the category.",

            "content": "[WARNING: SPOILERS FOR ENTIRE ANIME] \r\nThe level of disappointment I'm feeling right now is unbelievable. But first, allow me to back up to the beginning of this anime. \r\nKoi to Uso on the surface has an interesting, compelling plot. However, by the first two episodes it seems to just be a cliche, standard romance anime. But this image is quickly swept away by episode three, where we see it's true intentions-- or so I would think. But no. Really, all this anime is is a cliche, standard romance anime with a load of melodramatic scenes and the worst possible ending. \r\nI won't delve into thestory, the art (which in contrast to the rest of this anime is very good) or anything like that. Rather I'll simply say that this anime is fucking shit. Literally every episode one of the girls is crying those good ol' crocodile tears but we're actually supposed to take them seriously. And for the first few episodes, I did-- but that changed the second I realized that they appeared in almost every single episode. Heck, they may as well have names and characterization now. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention this series is frustrating as hell, as it leaves people like me hopelessly wishing that MAYBE something actually interesting would happen such as Yukari turning out to be a psychopath, or Yukari falling in love with Nisaka but NO. Rather I have to sit through episodes that are dragged out with the same boring shit again and again, waiting and waiting for them to be over so I can actually go watch something quality. The funny part of this is that I actually really liked this series when I first started watching it-- but when every episode is filled with the same shit, I just begin skipping past them. \\n\\n\r\nActually, I learned throughout this series that the second I see Misaki or Ririna on the screen, I just skip past it. Skip past it and hope Nisaka will make an appearance, or maybe Misaki and Ririna will find solace in each other instead of fucking flip-flopper 101 Yukari. Literally, Yukari goes from one moment saying \"I've always loved Misaki\" to the next saying \"My love for Ririna...\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat the fuck. Make up your goddamn mind instead of playing around with these two girls until you finally decide... well, I don't know which one to choose... so I'll just choose them both! \\n\\n\r\n...This. This is how the anime ends. Sure. Poly relationships are fine, literally nothing wrong with them, but when the whole anime is about him trying to figure out which one to choose only to choose them both? Yeah... no. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I would just like to say that do the producers of this anime (and originally manga) expect anybody to actually be satisfied with it? Sure, a few odd people might be but seeing as this anime is probably centered towards girls, don't they know that fujoshis are very popular these days? Did they learn NOTHING at all from Yuri on Ice (which, mind you I've never seen, but I do know how popular it is)? It might seem like I'm just being bitter that I didn't get to see the ending I wanted but regardless of that, this anime is shit. \\n\\n\r\nTaking all of that off the plate, Koi to Uso is still a shit anime as the producers of it do not know how to make a proper romance anime. With a strangely fast-paced (but repetitive), cheesy as hell cliche love story, I think they'll find that the majority of viewers can't even stand to watch it (or at least I can't).\\n\\n\r\nIf you like good anime, don't watch this. Enough said.",

The story starts off good but they ruin the ending with a cliffhanger. The ending still worth your time but truth to be told, I was disappointed nonetheless.

Still, it's pretty nice even if it looks a bit weird, you'll get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNice touch but nothing too special about it. The OP is good though.

The fact that the government and not the individual chooses who marries who, is an easy way to add in drama to a love story.\r\nMy overall impression on the anime was that it was just ok. Everything from the story to the art,characters and soundtrack were average or just above average. I hope it doesn't come across that I'm trying to be to negative about the show because at the very least I thought there wasn't any boring episodes while I was watching.My main gripe with the anime is that it had an open ending. I normally don't have a problem with this but in this particular instance it was off-putting. With the way the anime was initially set up I was expecting some kind of closure and there wasn't any. Also there wasn't any kind of indication that there might be a season two with the way the final scene was executed which is a bit unfortunate.\\n\r\nIf you have run out of romance anime to watch then consider giving Koi to Uso a shot but be prepared to read the source material afterward as I worry it may not get another season.",

            "content": "Spoilers About the First Episode\r\nDo you think you could live in a world where your marriage partner is scientifically chosen for you when you turn 16? To be honest, I wouldn't mind letting an algorithm decide on my lifelong partner. Of course, I'm against real-life arranged marriages, and the Sybil System from Psycho-Pass definitely rubs me the wrong way when you look at the society it creates, but the \"The Red Threads of Science\" actually matches you up with someone that's suitable for you, and benefits society by decreasing the number of single people and increasing birth rates. How much easier would life be ifyou didn't have to worry about finding the love of your life? Also a better chance for sex at 16! What a great deal! Of course, there are many people that disagree with me, and Love and Lies focuses on one of them, Yukari Nejima. It's an interesting idea, one that could definitely be something incredibly enjoyable, but as you continue the show you start to realise it's not as good as you thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't clear, this show is a love triangle. Yukari is in love with Misaki Takasaki, but his assigned partner is Ririna Sanada. Throw in a best friend, Yuusuke Nisaka, whose feelings towards the trio are quite the mystery, and we have all our main characters. On their own, the characters are all perfectly fine. Yukari is forward enough so that he isn't a complete pussy, Misaki and Ririna are both perfectly likeable girls and don't have any annoying character quirks, and Nisaka is kind of an enigma but an enjoyable enigma. (Although the mystery is never cleared up and we're left with character with vague intentions) The other frequent characters also fit well with the show, all having some sort of purpose to the progression of the story. However, once you take in the romance and drama, problems start to arise. First of all, there is one main issue I would like to address.\\n\\n\r\nYukari is a bit of an ass...\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry, but he's just way too indecisive. Put yourself in the shoes of Ririna. You have been given a marriage partner by the government, but you find out he actually likes someone else. At first, you find this cute and decide to support him by pushing the two together, but as things progress you start to develop feelings for him as well. Your first thought would be that you want that person to choose either you or the other girl. Of course, it's gonna hurt if he rejects you, and there might be some repercussions, but it'd be better than prolonging the inevitable and causing even more emotional pain. However, your marriage partner can't fucking decide between you two. This is the problem. I know it would be terrible for the show if Yukari just chose one of them early, the story would no longer have a reason to continue its love triangle and be forced to move onto something else or just end it there, but it's just not fun knowing that either one our main girls or both of them are gonna end up getting hurt really badly when it all could have been prevented with a simple answer.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance also suffers from plot convenience and pointlessness. The reason shown in the first episode behind Yukari's and Misaki's feelings for each other is incredibly forced. They tried to set up a couple way too fast and caused it to feel stupid and unbelievable. Later on, we do get some more development that allows us to make better sense of the pairing, but we're still suffering from the recoil of that first episode that we're struggling to see the love as genuine. As the show goes on, our main's feeling is pretty one-sided, with the occasional monologue of \"Do I like Ririna?\" and \"What is love?\" (Baby don't hurt me) A lot of the progression in the relationship is between Yukari and Misaki, with Ririna in the background like a knock-off cheerleader that desperately needs some attention. It makes you wonder why exactly the love triangle was created in the first place if you were only gonna focus on one couple. Either give both girls an equal amount of romantic screen time or scrap one of them, because the way this show is doing it's love triangle is incredibly annoying. The ending only makes the whole ordeal even more frustrating, but going any further would be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is ok, but it also relies on a lot of plot convenience and plot points that don't get explored enough. An example can be seen in the first episode, as Yukari gets an email on his phone about who his assigned partner. At first, it shows Misaki Takasaki as his chosen partner, but the phone suddenly glitches and disappears. Then two government officials appear out of nowhere and hand him a notice in an envelope, stating his partner is now Ririna Sanada. Okey dokey, so first of all, what the actual fuck? That's not how an email works. What kind of next level hacker is in this anime trying to bring up the hopes of some random high school kid and send them crashing back down? This scene was only done as an incredibly weak set up for drama, relying on its audience to turn off their brains for a minute so they don't collapse from the ridiculousness of the situation. The worse thing is that it never is explained, it's just brought up a couple of times to fulfil its job as drama set up and thrown back into storage, never seen again. Also, how did the government officials know where to find Yukari? To make it clear, he is not sitting at home happily waiting for his notice, he's out at a park in the middle of the night. There is absolutely no way for anyone to know where he was unless he was tagged or being followed for the entire night, and I doubt that's what happened. There are many other scenes that use plot convenience and create plot points that are never touched back on, but listing them would be tedious and spoil the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like Love and Lies, cause the premise was something I was genuinely interested in. Sadly, too many issues popped up and I spent too much time picking apart bits and pieces to properly enjoy the show. Although, I'm sure a lot of people here can look past the issues I saw and really enjoy the anime, so go ahead. Pick the show up and see how you like it yourself. Just don't drop it after the first episode. Don't let a piece of school stationery scare you away.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading, Send Feedback if You Have Any!",

            "content": "Again this kind of romantic animes are not my speciality and just recently ended up on my watch list. \r\nI noticed some similarities with the last seasons Kuzu no honkai mainly with character designs. Of course premise and plot related stuff are different. But anyways, this started strongly with establishment of the theme, relationship of the main characters and conflict. They succeeded bringing up the emotions the characters went through and what relations they had. You really knew what they felt when conflict stroke. Until the first half everything went good but then things got way too complicated and there was this on again offagain things going. And until the end everything just wasn't what I expected. This may have to have something to do with that they left it open. \\n\\n\r\nNow the premise, so there is this government enforced marriage coupling program. I'd say it's like Minority report of marriages. Algorithms pick up from large number of data your future life partner and you are basically stuck and screwed if it messes up. It seems that this system have more than once given false matches and there is brief mentions about. Of course like in Minority report things don't go public. There is this girl whose dad? created the program and is trying to say that it made a mistake but the whole thing is swept away very shortly. An then never addressed again. What happened? This would have made nice Minority report style twist. Well it may have not suited for the style. It still kept bothering that it didn't amount to anything.\\n\\n\r\nWell as a romance anime the forbidden love and how it affected and complicated main characters  and his assigned wife's life is portrayed well. There is definitely a conflict within the main character when he is trying to be his wife but his true feelings for his GF keep coming up. This conflict is the premise and things get even more complicated when main char. and his wise actually start loving each other and his wife tries to get his husband with the GF. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end everything gets together and conflict is solved and everybody lives happily ever after. Even though I'm harem ending supporter I would have preferred a sad bitter sweet ending with him choosing one of them. The assigned wife would have been more suitable for this anime. But then again if they would have made the Minority report thing it would have made the fugitives that are trying to over throne the system and corrupt government that runs the whole sha bang... But that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nAlso you really really shouldn't think too deeply into this law, there is so many flaws and things that make it so stupid, super illegal and malfunctioning. Main point is certainly not that but the relationships.\\n\r\nSound design is good and fitting and art style is colorful and lively. \\n\r\nThis anime gets 7,6/10 rounded to 8/10.",

            "content": "I'm not going to lie, I personally didn't enjoy this anime. From the first episode I was really interested and had high expectations, but the second half, for me, was much lower quality than the first. I haven't read the manga and I do not plan to.  [Minor Spoilers]\r\nThe entire concept was flawed and looked over. I completely did not understand why refusing your assigned partner was such an issue. If the system was to combat low birth rates, why would they have an issue with a couple marrying if it wasn't the one they'd picked out if they were most likely going tohave children anyway? I could have overlooked this, but as it made the rest of the plot seem like unnecessary forced drama, it was hard to feel sympathy or relate towards the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the characters were 2-dimensional and undeveloped. There was barely any character development throughout the entire show (except perhaps Ririna) which was frustrating as I could have related to the characters more if I understood them and their feelings. Everything felt a bit forced which was annoying because it could have been a better show if the characters weren't so dull.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Koi to Uso does do well, in my opinion, is sound and art. I understand there are mixed feelings about the art but I thought it fit the show and didn't look too bad for the scenes it was in. It wasn't a reason on its own to dislike or rate down the show.\\n\r\nThe sound was good too, I loved the opening and the background music. Some of the voice acting  was pretty good and all of it was bearable. I felt like the characters weren't badly cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Koi to Uso isn't an anime I despise, but I just don't like it. Watching it isn't one of my deepest regrets, and it was, in a way, kind of entertaining. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn't judge someone if they like it or want to watch it, because they're entitled to their own opinion. However, I felt that it had more potential than what it delivered. (Note that according to the rating system on reviews, a 4 is 'decent' and not 'bad.')",

            "content": "Hi, I'm Ren and this is my 1st review so please be gentle :)\r\nStory/Plot: 8\r\n- In my opinion Koi to Uso have a very good story, using the Japan's Low-birth problems as premise and these so called Red String of Fate by Science. And what's good about it is the system actually works for the people of Japan. And as the story progress, you will feel that these hand-picked partners by the government really are best suited or really is compatible with their counterpart. My only problem on this was, I hope you can still choose whether to accept or refuse your assigned partner. :)\r\nArt:8\\n\r\n- On my limited sense of art, I think Koi to Uso have a great art except those big round eyes. I simply can't ignore how Takasaki, Misaki's eyes looks kinda creepy sometimes. Though those big round eyes matches Ririna's character perfectly.\\n\r\nI also love the color of their eyes and lights in background :)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n- The voice actors are great and I love the OP and ED. I wish they release the full song of the ED so I can add it on my phone's playlist..T_T\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\n- I think this is where the show excels, the characters. The characters feel very human to me, being selfish or someone who tend to follow their heart even if its kind of wrong. I'll try to highlight each characters :)\\n\\n\r\nNisaka, Yuusuke - I believe his the only characters who thinks rationally in the 4 main characters. His character is like a reality check to the other characters that life is not a fairy tale.\\n\\n\r\nNejima, Yukari - Well, I think Yukari is just your typical goody old shoes MC in love triangles. He kind of bland too me but he has his own shine from time to time. And he can be a relatable, which is good for Male audiences since you can put yourself in his shoes. If you can put yourself in his shoes, you'll gonna feel the struggle in choosing the best girl. Like myself, I'm struggling in choosing between Ririna and Misaki, they are both great girls for me so like Nejima, I can't choose one..HAHAHAHA\\n\\n\r\nTakasaki, Misaki - Nothing to say here except I love \"PLOT\"..HAHAHA\\n\r\nBut kidding aside, Misaki is a gorgeous character, I like her face (except the eyes sometimes), I like her body proportions (LOL) and I love also her character. She's a typical shoujo character and she's like a DERE-DERE girl (who wouldn't like a dere-dere GF? hahaha). Her character shines in her struggle choosing between her happiness and someone else. She's also the kind of character you can fall in love with. <3\\n\\n\r\nSanada, Ririna - She's kind of a surprise character for me. At first I didn't like her that much coz I'm not a lolicon and Misaki is so hot compared to her..LOL\\n\r\nThough I'm starting to fall for Ririna because of her character. She's mature (though she's younger) and she's someone who thinks of others happiness first than herself. You will definitely fall in love with her through her development as a character. And that's why I'm so torn between her and Misaki..XD\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n- What is there to not enjoy, every episode makes you fall in love and feel despair. And that is good for a romance and drama anime. From episode 1 to current, your heart will experience a roller-coaster ride of emotions and be torn between the two best girls. You can really feel the struggles the characters had to fight in search of the meaning of love. :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 (Might changed depending on the ending..hahaha)\\n\r\n- Overall, this show has its faults. Like how can you just fall in love because of one simple eraser? Even I find it unreasonable but who are we to judge? It might also be possible that their love developed through time and just started because of that simple eraser. But what is important here is that you can feel the characters emotions and love for one another.\\n\\n\r\nI want to recommend watching this anime to anyone who likes romance and drama. Really, I even recommend it to my girlfriend and I hope she won't get jealous coz I'm fanboying over Misaki and Ririna..AHAHA",

            "content": "In any case i just wanted to say that i've known about this manga for awhile and later found out that an anime adaption was going to be made of it. I choose not to read this manga, because i am usually busy with other things (i'm looking at you Persona 5). But i digress and i want to give my own personal review of the anime so far. Also i want to say majority of this review was based of the first ep. i wrote a review awhile back and it was taken down which is completely understandable. So lets just dive in.\r\nStory- Thepremise of the story seems like a pretty basic love story with the main character falling in love with someone they knew since childhood. Yes its been beaten to death, but what Koi to Uso does to set it apart from other Romance anime is that the government regulates marriages when they become of age  Also come on who hasn't helped out someone in need, especially if its your crush.  - 8\\n\\n\r\nArt- MY God is this one of the best looking anime of 2017. I literally loved the art direction and animations in Koi to Uso. I was surprised to see studio LIDENFILMS up their animations granted i only recall seeing Yamada Kun to 7 from them. Also LIDEN made those giant moe eyes in which i usually dislike actually enjoyable to llok at. (Just so you know i hated the clannad eyes) looked like they were staring into my soul with no emotion). - 9\\n\\n\r\nSound- The anime does well in its song choices granted I did not enjoy the op too much, but the ending and then adding the song just perfect. Not much other that so its good. -8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Initially the characters appeared to be taken from the (usual i love you from first sight trope) which has been like i said beaten to death. But that is until the next couple of episodes the show finally found to stand on its own two legs and add some of its own personalities to the their characters. Yeah it may not be anything new, but it definitely is smarter than the average fan service romance anime. Also there is a major curve ball in which i did not see coming in episode 2 or 3 which made the show more distinguished than other anime, but again i need to see more interaction of the characters.  -8\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I'm a simple man when i see something that resembles something close to what i have experienced i'm going to love it. Also who doesn't love seeing the two main characters actually confess their feelings and not having it become a recurring (oh i wish i confessed before all this happened sort of scenario). so - 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  So far the first couple of episodes has been an overall great experience and a much needed refresher for this long time anime watcher and i feel the first ep was a strong start to the anime, but also shows some flaws (Cough.. cough... eraser scene). If we see more character involvements and handling situations (which they are in later epidsodes) to test their actual love for each other i could see this anime become one of the best of the season, but so far the ever so perfect shounen MHA season 2 and the biggest surprise for me this season Ballroom e Youkoso are ahead. Just watch the first ep koi to uso and give it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and i would gladly welcome criticism so i can improve my writing abilities.\\n\\n\r\nP.S- Like i said majority of the review was based of the original review i wrote based on the first ep. I know more goes on so if you are little confused i am sorry. I hope to write a more in depth review when i finish, but i want to write, because i believe this anime needs more credit then it deserves, but hey everyone has their opinion. Also for the eraser scene the show did mention more, but it was not too much which i am ok with, but more would have been nice.\\n\\n\r\nAnywaaaaays......\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading",

            "content": "The story starts out with the premise that a tyrannical government is assigning children spouses, and forcing them to breed with the threat of getting blacklisted in society if they dont participate in the project of stopping the population decline. For the first couple episodes the premise felt revolting, but at the same time original and having great potential to make a sad story and focus on the psychological aspect of the premise and how it affects the children. And after the beginning the show just ignores all the rules and the premise it set up and ends up being just a love triangle withno plot, character development or conclusion. Basically mc is a weak bitch with no emotions or agency and magically every girl (and guy) around him somehow ends up in love with him, and he does nothing about it in any direction and ends up making everyones life miserable.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: No plot, no character development, youll just end up wishing mc would get hit by  a car.

            "content": "Love & Lies, whether set in a desirable utopia or restrictive dystopia, begs the question; what is love?\r\n          From the author Tsumugi Musawo, comes a story set in a world where once children turn 16 they are liable to receive a notice with the details of their future spouse enclosed. The government controls the \"red strings of science\" that bring about perfect matches which turn into perfect marriages. Love with any other is strictly forbidden. However for fifteen year old Nejima Yukari, he finds a love separate from his assigned partner. Which one is the lie?The anime keeps a nice pacing for how short it is. It doesn't tell the full story, twelve episodes rarely do, but the audience is slowly introduced to the main cast and presented two options. Should Yukari forget his long time love and trust the government to match him with the perfect partner? Or shall he go against the system, and take free love back for himself? The story is never very clear on which girl the audience should be rooting for. There's reason for both to be the one. Love & Lies takes the viewer through the day to day of a complicated romance. It mirrors real life in that way, only what could be made easy for the protagonist is not.\\n\r\n          The premise is intriguing, a factor which encouraged your humble writer to take up this show. However as the scenes carry on and it becomes increasingly more difficult to root for one girl or the other, the show starts to lose its meaning. If it was created to present a proposition, what is the point of watching if a true story cannot be extracted out of 4.8 hours spent watching?\\n\\n\r\n          The art is another one of the main forces compelling this anime enthusiast to include it on the \"To Watch\" list. Love & Lives possesses a cute and simple style. Feelings about the eyes are a mixture of love and hate. Sometimes they seem too big and a grim reminder of the dark ages of anime style, but other time they hold much expression. Each design for characters is different and unique, and it was a pleasant surprise to see each of the main cast having a family that shared common features (a design choice that is somehow missed a surprising number of times in other series). \\n\r\n          For the average viewer, the art is a plus. For the snooty and seasoned veteran, the eyes may be a little distracting during viewership. And for this one? The art is considered acceptable. The animation turned out to be lazy and suspicious in some scenes, but LIDENFILMS has a budget. All anime suffers from this at some point or another in an episode.  \\n\\n\r\n          At first listen, the opening was not much to speak of. It has a simple melody with a decent performance by Frederic. The tone is rather upbeat, but the lyrics are a bit darker in that they serve the story to a \"T\". Love is difficult indeed. The more your dedicated viewer refused to skip the opening, the more it took ahold of her sing-song heart. The opening turned catchy. Definitely one of the better ones of this season if given a chance. \\n\r\n          With help from Prime Video, the ending theme was never really given much of a chance before the next episode started playing, but it screams standard J-pop. Roys has a beautiful voice and sings more about how Takasaki Misaki is feeling. It matches the show's aesthetic, and provides a nice wind down from the events of the episode prior. Unfortunately, it is also completely skippable. Nothing in the song really grips attention, pretty as it is. \\n\r\n          As for the original soundtrack, your humble writer suggests opening YouTube and surrendering an hour, thirteen minutes, and forty-one seconds to music that has personality. Each piece really belongs to Love & Lies, and each piece can bring about a memory of a scene. It is a soundtrack truly applaud worthy, as it gives the show depth; hat second layer of feeling. \\n\\n\r\n          An average boy, a conflicted girl with a mask, a disagreeable loli, and a handsome loner are what this show has to work with. It is almost impossible to form a favorite character from any of the cast. Either all the characters are amazing, or abysmal. Regrettably Love & Lies's main cast falls into that second category. \\n\r\n          Nejima Yukari is an average boy who falls in love with someone who isn't his arranged marriage partner. He doesn't have confidence, much drive, and the audience is forced to accept his love for burial mounds without much reasoning. He is fickle, and indecisive, and positively the worst character in the series' main cast.\\n\r\n          Takasaki Misaki is a beautiful and smart girl who happens to be the subject of Yukari's affections. Her main personality is that of a person who puts on a brave face and hides her feelings, stuffs them under a mask and pretends everything is alright. She's presented as the damsel in distress for most of the series, and it tends to become quite . . . distressing.\\n\r\n          Sanada Ririna is the loli of the snow. She is blunt, says what she wants, but also cannot seems to really figure out what it is that she truly desires. Her whole character is a tad bit confusing, as she is used as the person that just makes everything \"work\" in the story. Her role is simply to further or complicate the plot as seen fit. \\n\r\n          Nisaka Yuusuke, friend of the protagonist, and brooding loner has a lot of potential. It is hinted at that he has much more backstory than the show covers. A fact which becomes highly aggravating as he could be the series' most interesting character, but ends up as a backdrop that keeps getting pulled into the spotlight. Not much is done with him, even though he has the most than could be tinkered with.\\n\\n\r\n          When all is said and done, this show is a good watch -- if you're trying to take a break from watching something else, which this critic indeed happened to be doing. The beginning, when all characters were being introduced and the story was starting to take off was a time when the series could be considered an eight. But as scenes continued on, and plot started moving and characters began developing, the end result was so minuscule that everything the story could have built up to became a major disappointment. Does the viewer ever get the answer to the question it presents? The answer would be the same as this one saying \"Why don't you find that out for yourself?\" \\n\\n\r\n          Overall, the series had a great start with it's premise and pretty art, but as it tried to get more series and philosophical with it's ideas, it shot itself in the foot, never really committing to a certain flow. Any questions it asks requires the reader to find the answers within themselves. It's hard to root for any one of the characters, as none of them are exactly root-worthy. Should this show be watched? Yes, if the genres are what floats your boat. No, if you're hesitant at all about netorare (there are abstract elements of this) or want an actual satisfying love story. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nStory ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 6\\n\r\nWhile having a good premise, the actual show -- even though it displayed quite a bit of development -- ended up going almost nowhere. \\n\r\nArt ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 8\\n\r\nEnrapturing! Be wary of the eyes, but character designs were all lovely and unique. Sometimes heads were drawn in a way that I would draw them (which is no credit in the slightest), though that is easily overlooked when it's only some frames!\\n\r\nSound ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 7\\n\r\nNice opening, okay ending, and a beautiful soundtrack!\\n\r\nCharacter ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 5\\n\r\nDepressing personalities. Almost one dimensional if not for the confusing philosophical aspects forced upon each one of them. \\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 6\\n\r\nGood watch as a distraction from your main source of entertainment. Beginning starts out great, but the ending turns out dissatisfying. \\n\r\nOverall ~ \u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f\u272f ~ 6.4\\n\r\nGood premise. Good art. Poor characters. Pretty music. Confusing philosophies. Did this show mean to answer any of the questions it asked? Unresolved ending. Abstract NTR elements. So so unfortunate.",

            "content": "I enjoyed watching it, but wasn't satisfied at all with the ending. (can hardly call that an ending)\r\nIn the world of Koi to Uso, the government determines who your marriage partner will be, at the age of 16, taking many factors up to that point into account. Let's just take it as is and ignore that in a realistic approach, this would cause so many problems (revolts, love affairs, suicides, ...) that it would never work out as nicely as depicted in this show. So, if you are critical about the general setting a story plays in, that will most likely bother you a lot,as they make it seem like nearly everybody is fine with this concept.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing the setting this story plays in, it's already pretty obvious what happens. Yukari loves Misaki, Misaki loves Yukari, but Yukari gets assigned to Ririna as marriage partner. As there are many possibilities how this could play out, depending on what type of person Ririna is, they went for the scenario where Ririna falls for Yukari too, and even befriending Misaki. This turns this whole story into an emotional dilemma, rather than a \"fight against the system\" kind of thing. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, I was very disappointed with the ending. The dilemma built up throughout the show makes it obvious that no way how Yukari chooses, a person important to him (and himself too) will get hurt, so I was looking forward to see how they make it play out... just to see that they don't conclude anything in the end. It's absolutely unclear whether or not he will obey the system, fight against it, or whatever.",

Right off the bat the premise is kind of unique and brings up an interesting question of whether predetermined love or self-discovered love is better. However, the story drags on and for much of it, and the pacing is pretty far off. The main character is a total pushover with no spine or commitment or ability to make decisions for himself, and constantly flip flops on what he wants. Worst of all, the anime is completely unsatisfyingwhich infuriated me to the extent that I made an account and wrote this review. Skip it.",

I will try my best to keep this review spoiler free. \r\nWhile the show wasn't horrible, the only things that kept me watching was the art and the hope that there would be better characters and a good ending. That is not what I got. The ending was a cop out that i normally see in bad harem anime's. The characters were stale all except for the pretty boy who, I think, should have had more screen time because he was the most realistic character in the show. The OP and ED were very enjoyable and I willlisten to them in my off time. The OST was nothing special but wasn't noticeably bad. The premise for the show was actually very interesting and I thought it was a realistic setting for Japan. However, the event that takes place are very shallow and cliche in content. As I was watching I kept coming up with better scenarios than what the show had in store. There were some conflicts that I thought would make this show go from a overall 5 to a 7. Sadly that is not what I got and I personally feel robbed of my time.",

Even though the story was dramatic and over-the-top it was an interesting concept and I enjoyed viewing a story exploring the line between passion and practicality in love and relationships. At the very end though, the story betrayed everything the show stood for about following your heart. If it wasn't for the last episode, the story would have an 8 and characters would have a 7. I didn't enjoy how flimsy the male protagonist was and how okay each girl wasabout how indecisive he was. I truly enjoyed the story and the opening hooked me into the show. Some of the romance felt forced *cough cough* Nisaka *chokes*. Nisaka's story felt shoe-horned in, even though he was the most dynamic characters in the show. His story would've brought up an interesting issue of homosexuality in a world where the main goal is to put you with someone of the opposite sex to help repopulate the declining population in Japan. Anyways I enjoyed it and I recommend this anime, just pretend the last episode didn't happen.",

The first episode I thought was personally the best episode and pulled all the right stops and had all the cool twists. After that everything seemed bland. It seemed like all the plot twists were there and with good timings, but just fell really short - as well as the story and how it progressed and the route it took. For being an incredibly emotionally themed show I was left feeling... unemotional. Character wise it was alright. 5/10. The only notablecharacter to me was Sanada. The main male character Nejima was unlikable and quite the t o o l . Art and sound were also alright. Another 5/10. Cute Girls, handsome boys, ooo, ahhh. (Except Nejima I don't know what happened to his design.) Overall did I feel any enjoyment watching this? Here and there. Was it memorable? Not really. Would I recommend this to my friends? No.\\n\r\nBUT, it's worth a watch if you're curious.\\n",

Gundam IBO, Saekano etc. Those kind of anime that engage with audience, Please don't watch with the attitude \"nah i just want to have fun\", or \"i expect the show going to bringfeeling to me\", \"lets just have some peaceful life watching some lovey dovey romance\" Seriously... we need more serious watcher in anime like it used to be! \\n\r\nEvery girl has its own good and bad and i don't think we should compare one another. And this is the problem... what happen when the so called government help you decide. The government acts like some god who decide your destiny now. For me is bullshit. But because of the so called \"calculation\" it still work. and now you fall in love with someone and that particular someone is not some kind of evil at all and is really someone you can get along with! Diss her? Or dump another girl? Seriously when this time came out... Polygamy is like the best solution. (Btw i also don't hate the idea of polyandry but of course, to a certain extent, this anime made me search about discussion of polygamy and polyandry) And some more we still have gay element that we talk about... Is still kind of unpopular culture in Asia, and even before... we think gay is weird or gay is wrong... and i believe this kind of psychological effect apply to everyone else.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDownside\\n\r\nWorst possible art style... although i don't really care about art style but when i compare to Kuzu no Honkai... is totally different...

The setup is that the futuristic Japanese government can now arrange perfect marriages, and when you turn 16, you are givena \u201cnotice\u201d of who your partner will be. The main character, Nejima, is a teen boy that falls in love with someone other than his destined future wife. Shocker, right?\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing Koi to Uso does well, it\u2019s utilizing dramatic irony. The viewer sees the story unfold from an omniscient perspective, and we get to track all the characters\u2019 feelings that the main character does not see. This creates a very interesting tension between all the characters. It hints at the romantic feelings of the two female characters, Misaki and Ririna, and that of the main characters\u2019 friend Nisaka. Many times, there\u2019s this palpable tension between Nejima and his interactions with the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some fanservice thrown in too. It fits in nicely with the tension.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, though, the rest is mediocre \\n\\n\r\nSetting - While the show plays off the whole idea that the main character has been mismatched, there is no apparent danger in calling the engagement off, and the only thing stopping this main character from breaking off his engagement with his government-assigned wife is the lack of his own courage. Not only does this create a very weak-willed main character that is incredibly frustrating to swallow, this begs the viewers to ask, \u201cWhy even bother?\u201d. For a show based off the premise of prearranged marriages, this show seems to really de-emphasize that aspect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 The anime suffers from very bland characters. Nejima plays as your stereotypical clueless schoolboy in love, and Ririna and Misaki might as well be the same person with how they act all the time. We don\u2019t get to know anything about Nisaka\u2019s personality either. The cast is overall quite forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEnding \u2013 *mild spoiler alert* Oh my goodness the ending. This show suffers from an extreme case of \u201cNisekoi Syndrome\u201d, a.k.a. I\u2019m-going-to-make-a-season-two-so-screw-you-viewers. Honestly, I feel very cheated. The whole show puts you in a constant guessing game of \u201cWho is Nejima going to choose\u201d, so you\u2019d expect for him to perhaps just maybe actually choose someone?\\n\\n\r\nWhile there isn\u2019t anything wrong with an open-ended ending per say, this just felt as if the author decided to rip the last 50 pages out of a novella and dumped it just so he could sell more copies of his sequel book.  \\n\\n\r\n*Soundtrack and Art*\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the voice acting. The overall atmosphere was captured well by the voice actors, and while it wasn\u2019t something extremely memorable, the voice acting did not get in the way of the story. If there\u2019s one bone I had to pick, it\u2019s that the characters sound the same from scene to scene, but that\u2019s a matter of personal preference, so take my opinion as a grain of salt. The ending song is somewhat impactful, and I think that\u2019s the one song I\u2019ll take away from this series. Other than that, nothing too distasteful or too good either. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is the most interesting part of this, and the one aspect of this anime that made me watch this series. It\u2019s distinct and a bit strange, and sometimes the characters look a bit deformed, but it was eye-catching and memorable. It\u2019s a refreshing style of art, a nice change of pace from the usual anime that we\u2019re used to watching. If anything, the art was the best part of this anime. \\n\\n\r\n*Verdict*\\n\\n\r\nComing from a person who really enjoys Nakige-style tearjerkers, I personally enjoyed Koi to Uso for what it was worth. Some of the scenes were very intense, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit of sympathy for the main character. The soundtrack and the voice acting were not distracting either. I just wish the story played more on the importance of these pre-arranged marriages and had more interesting characters. \\n\\n",

Nope all i felt was defeat like why the hell did i watch that? Give me back my wasted time. What was the whole point of that anime? To show that true love is real and you should follow your guts? then why did the main character have such hard time choosing and wasdoubting his choice.Or was it to show that the government selections were right all along? Is thats how it is why make the anime i the first place? So disappointed i myself that i actually watched this at least you could have put some decent fanservice i you weren't gonna provide me with a story worth watching",

            "content": "I had to write this review because I felt like others have reviewed this series far too poorly.\r\nLet me go over just some of the reasons I rated this Anime as high as  I have.\r\nArt and Sound:\r\n Initially and throughout the story I struggled with the shoujo big eye artstyle. That's just personal choice. interestingly, I really like the big eyes art style of Basilisk. Why score 8 then, you may ask. Throughout the series the art team as well as the voice actors worked incredibly well to add detail to the scenes. Go back and watch the climactic moments in this anime andyou'll notice incredible body language which adds so much values to those scenes. The tension and power both sound and art add to this anime is astounding.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development:\\n\r\nFor me what shines about this anime is actually the characters. By the end of episode one I already cared deeply for the two main characters. The scene in the playground at the end of ep. 1 was incredible. I have never felt so many feels in only one episode before. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked that character of Ririna. She wasn't tsundere and she never made sexy jokes or acted over the top. It's actually really hard to make two female characters that aren't polar opposites of each other. I respect how they made both female leads actually very similar. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Misaki, of course mainly because I love Hanazawa Kana-san as a voice actress. I always fall for her characters (Kuroneko I'm looking at you!!) But I also liked this character. She was well balanced and I didn't feel like there were too many \"fake anime moments\" with her, you see, I like realistic things to happen in the story and I appreciate it when dialogue and scripting reflects what a person might really do in that situation. \\n\\n\r\nI hated Yukari for nearly the entire time. It was only at the very last episode when he spoke about himself to Nisaka that I realised that although I might dislike him, it was their intention to make him that way- his character was just one I detest. Then again, had I have been in his situation.... I hated how apologetic and stammering he always was. I hated his stupid shocked face EVERY time one of the girls said something. GOD it was ANNOYING. \\n\\n\r\nNisaka... well I can't say too much without spoiling the story. I( loved how the story developed his character, quite subtly. I did feel his character was ever so slightly generic, but every now and then there was a sparkle of nice narrative.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOverall, interestingly, I ended up rooting for Ririna over Misaki, in spite of my bias. For me this just goes to show you how well designed Ririna's character was. I really enjoyed this and I will be looking for more like it. The ending was................................\\n\\n\r\n......\\n\\n\\n\r\n.....\\n\\n\\n\r\n......\\n\\n\r\nWell, how do you end a story like this anyway? \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, please enjoy the show!\\n\\n\r\nLuthien\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I really thought there was more to the secrets. Maybe there is... in the manga.\r\nWarning - spoilers ahead.\r\nCharacters:\r\nPoorly developed. We don't actually get a sense of direction with any of them. Characters are not developed enough to actually makes us feel anything towards them. I didn't feel sorry for Nisaka, I didn't root for any of the girls and I didn't even get mad at the main character's indecisions.\r\nStory:\r\nGreat premise. Great premise not developed at all and thus, lacking apoint in the end. A society where the government chooses who you marry - this could raise many interesting debates on whether love is a social construct or a biological reaction. Can we love someone chosen for us? It even raises the interesting subject of arranged marriages in many cultures. What makes a relationship good or stable or even... real?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, none of this matters because the inquisitive dialogues and monologues are not developed, the relationships barely change and Nisaka (who raises even a more interesting subject which is homosexuality in this kind of society) doesn't get enough screen time with his love interest.\\n\\n\r\n*sigh* I was disappointed because I was looking for more metaphorical matters to be approached. If you're just looking for a romance/drama then the anime is fine and has a couple of sexy scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it all boils down to what your expectations are.\\n",

For example, the storyline take you in of how the story will end up, and if the love can really be found scientifically since many couples (insignificant people in anime) end up as a couple. So then this anime always asks, \"What is love.\" Really, everyone wonders about that and love is a mysterious thing. Anywayyyy, the story line was very interesting.\r\nThe problem for me was the romance. There were moments that I thought it was sweet, and the first episode will totally blow up your mind ifyou are into slow romance. I do not want to spoil it, but if you do not enjoy seeing French kisses, and the saliva from the mouth falling out, I recommend to just be sure to keep in mind this\ud83d\ude05 Since as for me, French kisses are a bit extreme, especially in action.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem was the main character, I would honestly want Nisaka or Misaki to be the mc. Why you ask? The mc seems to not try to change or keep in mind that he may be hurting others since he is so thick headed to not see some people's love for him. Well, him being pushed to move on is normal since there needs to be some support at times, but I really would like for the mc to stick to one person he loves.  \\n\\n\r\nIt makes sense to not want to hurt others you care about or if you have sincere feelings more than one person, but the mc just seems to lure people to fall in love with him more (unintentionally of course, and that's why it's stupid, sorry to say).\\n\\n\r\nAny, I recommend this anime if you are looking for something interesting, but be sure to keep in mind that there are French kisses\ud83d\ude05",

I cannot express the level of disappointment after witnessing it, honestly.\r\nThe premise is actually pretty solid and original, the setting is realistic and had potential, and you even get characters with honest motivations (get to stay with the person they love) and that would do anything to accomplish that... except they didn't, or even managed to AT LEAST set acourse of action to accomplish that. The childhood love interest kind of doesn't want to let go the MC, but she kinda wants to; the assigned wife, suddenly loves the MC but decides not to in the end because she became very good friends with the former one BUT STILL kind of wants to be with him; the surprise and unsuspected third person in this love square appears but says \"screw this\" and just gives up in the end; and the bland, generic main character decides to make the LAZIEST and CHEAPEST choice for a romance series I've seen in an ending. I actually realized I wasted 12 weeks of my life waiting eagerly for a closure (or at least an open ending for future seasons) and got nothing. You just don't do that. Not even if an anime is trying to advertise a manga or a light novel. You'll hurt the source material BADLY.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but at some point some plot elements I even gave the benefit of the doubt turned out to be absolutely unrealistic. Yes, I'm talking about the goddamn eraser (not spoiling it, but if you ever watch this you'll see). Some characters just appear for the sake of the plot and we never get to see or hear about them again. But what infuriates me the most is the fact that the premise is absolutely WASTED into teenage insecurity and angst. Yes, the main cast somewhat manages to be better people after meeting each other, but even so it feels like all of that meant nothing in the end. They could have fought for a change, they could have gone against the system and shown that even with adversity they'd fight for their ideals, they could have even faced the worst of the worst and been disowned by their families just to be true to their feelings but... but no. They sort of just go with it and never question the system. I honestly don't know how the manga managed to keep it up after where the anime left the story (which was an original ending for the series, and because of that, it made things worse), but if making such a bad writing decision for the ending so people could check out the manga instead was their plan from the beginning, they succeeded then.\\n\\n\r\nI insist, if we even got an open ending for a season 2 or an actual, plausible choice for the love interest in the ending, even if it went against the source material, that'd have been THOUSANDS of times better than the garbage we got in the end.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend either reading the manga or not checking the anime at all. The only saving point of this series is the OP by Frederick which is really great.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: Garbage out of 10.",

More or less:\r\nThe animation/art has flaws, but it's more about the plot than anything else. A couple years ago, books about dystopian societies were in, and as an avid YA books reader I have read a fair share of them. This AU is not that different from these (see Delirium, Matched, etc). My point is that if you liked those you will for sure like this one. It is not as \"hey let's fix this unfair situation, down with the bad guys \"as The Hunger Games or Delirium, but it's still good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not that original, they reminded me a bit of Scum's Wish characters, maybe not /that/ screwed up tho. Still likeable, at least Ririna found a way to my heart with her bluntness and kind heart, I found myself waiting for her scenes with the main character tbqh. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways [s/p/o/i/l/erinos] ahead. \\n\r\nI hate the end, and I hate that I had to read the manga to find the \"\"true ending\"\", and I hate that they are going to make a movie with the actual end so until someone kind translates it I won't be able to know the end!!! So if you dont like open endings dont watch, but STILL it was so enjoyable Id watch it again tbh???",

            "content": "\"What does it mean to love someone?\"...\r\nKoi to Uso, calm down on your symbolism.\r\nKoi to Uso comes with an interesting premise of the system of \"The Red Threads of Science\" where people are assigned partners for the rest of their life to stop the decline of birth rates. Yukari Nejima voiced by Ryota Osaka is such an interesting case where he had a crush on Misaki Takasaki voiced by Kana Hanazawa since he was kid but when the notice for Yukari's partner was abruptly changed from Misaki to Ririna, things changes for Yukari.\r\nThis premise is quite interesting for the fact of showing us whether governmentlaw can produce results in a healthy relationship or whether true love can conquer this. However in the case of Koi to Uso, it kinda broke it's own rules and ruined it in the process.\\n\\n\r\nBefore LA talks about that.....characters.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a rather character-relationship driven narrative, LA will look at each of the major characters one at a time.\\n\\n\r\nFirst is Yukari Nejima, our main narrative focused protagonist.......he's just your ordinary high school boy with a crush with no really redeeming features about him (besides he's a nice guy and likes burial mounds), he's actually the most uninteresting character in this series to be quite honest, he's essentially an audience proxy as to how the system of \"The Red Threads of Science\" works.\\n\\n\r\nNext is LA's favourite character Ririna Sanada voiced by Yui Makino, Yukari's assigned partner. LA really just liked her naive tsundereness (leaning more to dere) and just how she shook the entire situation of Yukari and Misaki. However her naivete is also her downfall, being from a rich family and being awkward in school, she kinda misses the point sometimes and gets into misunderstandings alot with Yukari. But later on she does develop feelings for Yukari and her life changes as she gets used to school life, have friends from her school as well as Misaki. Nonetheless LA was rooting for her and it's not just because she was LA's favourite character.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Misaki Takasaki, Yukari's childhood crush, really the only thing going for her is that she's a childhood friend and seeing the childhood friend win would have been a refreshing sight in anime and again going aback to the entire \"true love conquers\" works into her quite well. As much as LA likes Ririna, having Misaki \"win\" would hold true for the anime at hand and hell to that because of this, Misaki becomes an interesting character, not LA's favourite but more interesting to see this outcome. The only problem with Misaki is that although she's interesting nothing much about her is interesting such as the case of Yukari as well. It's Yukari and Misaki's relationship that makes them interesting not individual themselves.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we have Yuusuke Nisaka voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana, best friend of Yukari and he's kinda got a secret of his own and LA is totally fine with it. Overall he's the guy that gets the less flack within this entire ordeal.\\n\\n\r\nSo about the rules breaking for \"The Red Threads of Science\" system, well for one if the arranged partner skips out on the system, they get a stigma towards society which also affects their futures as well......but then later on it tells us there's a loophole that bypass all this...then what's the point of the system?, also the anime is persistent in telling us all these rules are absolute and the majority of testing says it proves it works, not to mention Yukari's sudden change of notices from Misaki to Ririna also breaks the system. LA might get why some of these are put in place, saying that the government isn't all knowing and isn't 100% correct in it's own system and again true love conquers all, but yeah if the rule about the arranged partner skipping out along with it's loophole is anything to go by, Yukari could have just as easily be with Misaki with no resistance by the end of it because the SYSTEM screwed up not Yukari.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime goes through some typical stuff in a melodramatic love triangle romance anime as well, from a crossdressing Romeo and Juliet play to ughhh sex lectures, going to a marriage and even a bridal model shoot. All typical and all, but these events only prolong Yukari's decision on who he's gonna pick and Jesus do they prolong it. So LA talked briefly about the obnoxious symbolism in Koi to Uso and it's everywhere especially the concept of Love and Lies. Mainly it's symbolism is Yukari seeing Misaki and Ririna as Love and Lies (sometimes vice versa) but the thing is it goes back to the question of \"What does it mean to love someone?\"...but the thing is they spout this phrase as well as the same words of Love and Lies CONSTANTLY, like LA knows it's from the title and the symbolism is there, but if we have a indecisive main protagonist it gets old pretty quickly as we want him to choose. To be honest LA wouldn't mind going the yuri route for Misaki and Ririna due to how bland Yukari is...but that's LA's wildcard.\\n\\n\r\nSo in speaking of routes, who does Yukari choose by the end?...well yes Yukari does tell us through a conversation with Ririna, however the final scenes are left ambiguous as to who he's gonna choose if not BOTH. Two questions, if he picks both, won't the government get on Yukari's case about this and leaving an ending this vaguely ambiguous is gonna piss some people off...some of them being LA as LA was pleading the finale for Yukari to pick someone (as for LA, both sides would have won, choose Ririna, LA would have liked it because favourite character, choose Misaki, seeing the childhood friend win would be refreshing) instead it's left rather ambiguous if Yukari would go through with their plan...if anything LA was rather pissed and at the same time mixed with this kind of ending.\\n\\n\r\nKoi to Uso from it's interesting premise that ruins itself falls under the typical love triangle spiel we have seen time and again and it prolongs the decision until the finale where it's left ambiguous...-sigh-. Well Koi to Uso, you showed love in MANY different ways but you definitely lied your way through the finale and not helping matters is the typical highschool romance settings bashing us in the face it's symbolism. This isn't the worst romance anime LA has seen but falls under the typical trappings of anime romance cliches and of not taking risks with it's romance and even ruining it's interesting premise in the process, it's a mess of indecisiveness and hormonal teenagers under a broken system not knowing what they are doing or what they truly want.",

            "content": "Well, before I start writing the review, I want to say that I had high hopes for this anime but it dissapointed me in a way. As I matured and watched a lot of different series (anime and tv shows) I began watching things differently, I wanted to watch more actual good material. If the series you're looking for has to be actually good, I recommend skipping this one.\r\n[Story: 3 - Poor]\r\nAt first the synopsis seems appealing, it made me curious about how the story would evolve. Sadly, the story developed very badly. The real 'plot' behind the series is set in motion by acertain someone (not a main character) who does not have a clear motive of why she did it, and even if she had, it would not have been good enough, the series isn't thought that well through.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 8 - Very Good]\\n\r\nNot much to say about it, except that I found the art very pretty. The eyes stood out especially, eventhough they looked misplaced sometimes. Another perhaps fun thing to mention, is that I noticed that one of the female main characters looks like she has pudding for hair.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7 - Good]\\n\r\nThe music was not that amazing and outstanding, yet it supported the visuals heavily. It only felt like such a waste that the same music was played over and over, which made me get a little annoyed sometimes.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 3 - Poor]\\n\r\nI really dislike to give this grade to this category, but in my honest opinion, it's not worth higher. The characters barely develop, aside from some obvious growing feelings toward others. Another big miss in the characters is background, there is just so much lacking that it couldn't make me feel empathy for any of the characters. Like one character does not want something (sorry for being vague, I cannot give further details due to spoilers) but no reason for this at all is revealed, which was pretty important.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 6 - Fair]\\n\r\nDespite the, in my opinion, bad plot and characters, I give this series an overall 6. This is solely because I happened to enjoy the first couple episodes and perphaps the nice looking visuals.",

            "content": "This series was are fairly omnipresent during the Summer 2017 season as the notable romance anime of that season. In that, I would also find it very dividing, depending on what you expect out of a romance anime. I'll get more into that as I talk.\r\nPlot: 5/10\r\nThe story is fairly generic at best. The plot focuses primarily as Yukari as tries to figure out where his affections truly lie (pun intended), either with his long time crush or his newly assigned wife. The show is heavily character driven, and flops a lot before of that, but more on that later. Pacing is slow, and somescenes are just agonizing to watch. Several of the subplots have weak conclusions or flat out lack a conclusion overall. The overall conclusion flies in the face of how a romance story should be told, with the implications and hints built through the story being tossed out in favor of a very predictable ending (for those familiar with harem romantic trends) that ultimately does not satisfy. Finally, in my opinion, much of the backstory to explain the love triangle is really awkward, and unbelievable. \\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is being a bit generous giving it a 5 out of 10. The  main character, Yukari, is general laughable and boring, the kind of \"every man\" that we are suppose to project ourselves on, save for a weird obsession with burial mounds (which admittedly are interesting, but do nothing to redeem his character). The two heroines are actually rather distinct from one another, which is good. Only one of the heroines, the assigned wife Ririna shows any character growth beyond her initial introduction. The other significant character is Nisaka, who is often forgotten about anyways. The character interactions are weak and often unbelievable, which doesn't help the character driven plot. Most characters have some kind of subplot which are hinted at but never properly explored. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile stylistically this anime stands out since it employs a less standard style of depiction, the character designs are ugly and/or awkward to look at. Personally, the eyes seem too big for me and result in some awkward camera angles. \\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10\\n\r\nNothing particularly standout about it. The openning is pretty catchy though.\\n\r\nThemes: 5/10\\n\r\nThe anime actually had some interesting themes in contrasting love verses lust. Tied into this was the idea of asking what love is. Unfortunately, the exploration of the themes was basically undone with the final conclusions and leaves the viewer ultimately confused. I honestly really like the themes, and the plot did a good job in building the themes up until the last few episodes. \\n\r\nOverall, the anime had plenty of potential but flops on all levels to make it a mediocre watch for future anime fans. This anime will likely fade into obscurity fast. Hope this review helped!",

            "content": "I remember being very bored at one point surfing the internet for anything that might pick my interest. I thought to myself I could use some sparkle in my life so I browsed through the romance genre of manga. Koi to Uso immediately stuck out to me with it's very distinguishable art style. And that's where we will start with what I believe is Koi to Uso's strongest element, Art. \r\nThe Manga of Koi to Uso had a visual flair very appropriate for romance. The character designs were very grounded as well as defining the characters archetype at a glance. And while some might havean issue with the design of the eyes, I welcome it whole heartedly. In anime, movement and strength of the eyes can express the characters feelings that they would be unable to say themselves. And to that I would love to say that Koi to Uso's visual language is graciously sympatheic. It has a variety of extreme close up shots on lips or hand movement accentuating the nervousness. High angle shots on a slouching character in a time of weakness or distress. It is also very rare for a scene to skip a close up of the characters eyes, further emphasizing the importance of the eye. \\n\\n\r\nMoving away from the face, the body language is just as important. While we still get the common shots where it includes multiple characters standing there with little much to do while a few characters talk, I welcome them. Because not much is meant to happen. However, when the story is meant to be really personal we see shots of different angles often showing us the position most expressive of their feelings. I also feel that the cuts in this anime are almost of a perfect length. And length of the scenes are well paced, feeling neither rushed or too long to fit the episode. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the character design, my favorite aspect of animation in the anime is the lighting. Whether if it's broad daylight, a red dusk or in the middle of the night, the gradient layer of white at the corner of the shot accentuates the moment. The bright color palette is very nice but I feel Koi to Uso is at it's strongest at night. Dark colors conquer most of the screen, however, the few lightning we have on the characters express a sensual relationship with the uncertainty. \\n\\n\r\nIronically, uncertainty is what I feel for the sound department in Koi to Uso. Unlike with the animation, the music does not know when to cut away. The music is mostly drawn out and tries it's best to express the mood of the scene. Contrary to it's purpose, it actually breaks the mood. As there were both verbal and visual dialogue and requires time to translate between the characters. The best thing to do would have had complete silence and when the characters are finally able to draw a conclusion through the dialogue is when the music should be executed. In addition, the soundtrack seems to be just a cut above average. The soundtrack seems to be very small. Although, the ending theme is very nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nI've always been a fan of Hanazawa Kana as her voice is really easy to listen to. Kana plays her archetype fine. Makino Yui on the other hand took me some time to relate her voice to Ririna. At times the visual language and verbal language didn't seem to match but I like her voice nonetheless. Ohsaka Ryouta voice I find to be very troll at times, and I mean that in a good way. His voice fits Yukari almost perfectly barring the times he speaks with Nisaka. When Yukari speaks with Nisaka, the pitch of his voice seems to shoot up a level emphasizing his ridiculous levels of sensuousness to Nisaka. All to incite Nisaka's inner tsundere towards Yukari. And while the VA are doing what they are supposed to be doing, it still bothers me. Selection of the VA's to the characters was pretty spot on, though.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, it's very difficult to separate a story from characters. This is especially true in the slice of life genre where the story is heavily influenced by the characters interests and goals. However, the only thing on our main casts mind seem to be love. Besides Yukari's interest in Burial Mounds, Koi to Uso has very little material to build on. Resulting in simple plot development and a spiral of melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is very simple, it's not necessarily a bad thing. It allows the story to focus on our cast. The existence of the Marriage Plan is pretty ridiculous and is probably the only offender of ridiculous reasons to bring characters together and cause melodrama. It is also our source of fun, our reason for watching this series. The special events that forces the characters to bond do not feel random. Instead of having Yukari randomly meet Ririna out in the wild, they take the initiative to invite each other. Or their parents act as an intermediary. At least in the world of Koi to Uso, it all feels very plausible. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe about the cast is really Yukari. He's mostly just a nice guy and lacks initiative or the strength to make his plans come to fruition. Regardless, I cheer for him to express his feelings. Ririna sits in the middle ground for me. At first, her actions are very questionable as we all know it's going to cause issues later. I empathize with her naivety, because she is forced to live with the consequences. Misaki is perhaps my favorite character from Koi to Uso. Being reluctant with her love for Yukari at first but choosing to let her feelings out when she can is all understandable. \\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoy that I can empathize with the characters of Koi to Uso. The dialogue always reminds of what the characters are feeling. The animation has a firm grasp of their feelings and well placed cuts keep the scene active although not much is happening. Although, less music would help with the atmosphere. And at times the volume of the sounds can be an issue. Koi to Uso was a good show.",

But I didn't only because I wanted to finish it because I am not gonna lie there were moments where I was hopeful that it will  at-least end decently. But I was highly disappointed.\r\nCharacters were very bland. My least favorite male protagonist- right out of a harem show. Wimpy, undecided, no courage, little high school boy. Then, there is the \"beautiful cool mysterious black hair girl\" and the beautiful tsunderepink haired girl. Hated all of the characters. Not one of them had any redeeming qualities. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story have hints that one of the characters was \"hiding something\" honestly I thought the end will shed some light on it but it didn't. Nor did it show anything about the 2 sub plots the whole series was hinting at. And the end was the worst one I have seen in anime by far. I am a big disliker for harem shows but I think this show even beats those harems. Overall, in my experience this is the worst I have seen",

            "content": "When I saw the first episode, I really thought that it was going really different way. So I promised myself that I will stick 'till the end. And I was disappointed. It may contain some spoilers but in my opinion, it wasn't a big secret anyway.\r\nLet's start with the story. The story is really basic. When you are 16 years old, the Japanese government assign you a partner. And we really don't see a development in the story. It was just two people loved each other but they didn't assign to each other. But, of course, it had love square. The assigned partners started todeveloped some feelings for each other (of course, it had to be) and there is a guy which was only there to make fujoshis happy. And, yeah. That was basically it. Well, at first I was guessing that they will go against the government or destroy the system. But well... And the ending was ridiculous. I understand the effort to make everybody happy in the end but I thought it ended uncompleted and rushed.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the characters. I didn't like the characters. Nisaka was my favorite in the series but he was actually extra. We didn't learn why he likes Nisaka, what has happened to him etc. He was just there to be there. We have almost no information about him. Misaka and Ririna... Oh, boy. Where should I start? So, I really didn't like the fact that both of them willing to the everything to make the other person happy. Even it costs their happiness. Which was unrealistic. The whole series was \"No, you should be with Nejima.\" \"No, YOU should be with Nejima.\" Which was weird. It was hard to watch. Because you expect to see some fight in order to get the one you love so much. But they were willing to give the other person happiness even though they really don't know each other really well. And then Nejima. He is awful. He was so average that even an average person wouldn't be like him. Actually, I really didn't understand why they love him. Yeah, he is nice but he has nothing interesting besides that. Now, I don't mean that in order to a person be interesting, the person has to have some cool talents or some cool personality. But he talks boring, he acts boring. He is just plain boring. He is really average. Which makes the situation worse because you started to think that he cast a spell or something. And at the end, he the \"choice\" that he made was ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a cliche love-story. I don't really recommend this anime because it really didn't add something. The characters and the story were superficial and unoriginal. It was not particularly boring but it didn't give me some feelings. I watched it, I slightly regret it but it wasn't so awful. But it wasn't good.",

            "content": "I'M REVIEWING JUST THE ANIME!! It has a manga and it's possible that it is better.\r\nStory (5): The story actually had an interesting set up. However, call me pragmatic all you'd like; I did not sympathize with the plot. One of the main reasons I feel this way is because of the age and situation. So 2 VERY young teenagers are supposedly madly in love with one another even though they haven't talked since elementary school. One teen gets their assigned partner notice and is willing to give up a whole future with a good candidate for someone he doesn't truly know. Tbh, looking atit, no matter which partner he picked, our protagonist, Yukari, would 've still ended up with a hot acquaintance and would have an equal chance of regretting the decision. The only difference is that one decision comes with major cons, which kinda makes the right decision stand out when you use logic. Thus; I didn't really care which girl he picked. The only reason I stuck with the show was because I prefer to finish my anime and there was a subplot that caught my attention. It was utterly disappointing when the ending was indecisive and the only interesting story was tossed away. It might have been a more interesting situation if the partners weren't assigned during the pinnacle of puberty and the first 2 lovers actually dated rather than expressing their \"love\" the night before a notice.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4): Although a lot of the scenes and settings were drawn beautifully, I could NOT get over the exaggerated character drawings. Although the art pretty much matches that of its source, it was really hard to overlook the un-proportional eyes and lips the size of a grape. That is the design for a majority of anime, but this one took it to a level it did not need to be on and certain scenes, like intense make out scenes were hard to watch. Not to mention it gave all the male characters feminine features.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7): The opening was average and the ending song wasn't too bad and catchy, but not something I'd care to remember. For the most part, the soundtrack wasn't distracting yet didn't necessarily stand out so I'd say that's good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6): I feel like besides one, all the other major characters were rather unrealistic. Yes, there is NO real assigned partner system in Japan, but besides that, the anime seemed to want to capture a realistic idea for Japanese teens. Therefore, it was hard for me to believe a beautiful, and tiny girl at the top of her class was truly friendless for so long (and the reason they gave wasn't adequate enough). A lot of the decisions the characters made were rather stupid, illogical, and detrimental to the other parties involved, and they decided to cover these dumb choices up with a \"just cuz\" or \"love can do crazy things\" reason which got old. And finally, back to what I said earlier, there was only one character who actually sounded/acted like a normal person AND had a character plot that stunned almost all the viewers (and kept me tuning in) and it was disappointing when this person was tossed to the side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): Although it may seem rather hypocritical I had a decent time watching the show. Although I disliked the 3 main characters, I was rather interested in all the stories going on around the main plot. And I favored a certain character who made certain situations rather hysterical.",
