            "content": "When you look at the cover Oda Nobuna no Yabou, you would immediately think \"oh, its just another cliche harem series\", I wouldn't blame you if you did as it does look like one and I myself thought of it as one, but when you actually watch it you realize that there is simply more to it than that, its definitely not a tasteless cliche and although it has many female characters, it doesn't present itself as a stereotypical harem where they are all attracted to the male lead.\r\nI won't bother with the introductions because I know you are smart enough to have read thesynopsis first, so I won't repeat anything you already know. Instead I will get straight onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that most other cliche harem/romance animes out there fail at is the story, they continuously throw in unneeded fanservice and ecchi scenes to please the viewers instead of telling the story. However, unlike them ONnY cuts the ecchi short and focuses more on giving the viewers a good story and plot, which is commendable. However although i say this, they put in all the fanservice in the ending credits lolz XD but its much better than putting it in the episode itself where it will ruin the storytelling and the serious aspect of the anime\\n\\n\r\nSo far the storytelling has been superb and the plot has been interesting, its based on real historical events that happen in the Sengoku Era where Oda Nobuna (female version), the leader of the Oda Clan has an ambition of conquering the whole of Japan, but in order to do so she must take on rival clans and handle internal affairs, the one who helps her on her conquest is Sagara Yoshiharu who is a huge fan of the original Nobunaga Oda, he uses his knowledge from the game he played \"Nobunaga's Ambition\" to assist her by telling her what she needs to do and how she must do it. It gets more interesting as the story goes on where you learn more about Nobuna, alliances are made and as other characters are introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe only plot hole that I've encountered so far is how Sagara was able to time travel back in time and how all the major samarai's turned into girls. However its an anime, so there's no point nitpicking on these small points when its purely fiction and doesn't really need to be explained.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about this, the characters are nicely drawn  and the vibrant colours and costumes suit the characters really well, its based on clothes of the Sengoku period but its been altered and changed slightly to suit the characters wearing them, which is a good point about this anime because it gives off a unique feeling to them. The action scenes and fighting aren't too shabby either and are nicely animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is fine and suits the anime, the voice acting is also done pretty well, the characters that have a mature voice aren't too husky and the characters that have a sweet and childish voice aren't too high pitched and loli-like. The voice acting in serious situations are done well and doesn't feel forced and the same can be said for the comical situations where there is a bit of comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nYes the characters are a bit clich\u00e9d but they don't act as if they are in a clich\u00e9 harem anime, instead of the girls falling for the male lead like they should, they have no respect for him and call him a monkey (\"saru\") which is taken from his name *S*agara Yoshih*aru*.\\n\\n\r\nThe main Heroine Nobuna is a tsundere character but isn't an annoying kind of tsundere, more of a cute and pleasant tsundere unlike all the usual clich\u00e9d bitchy tsunderes. She can also handle herself just fine, she isn't a weak character who relies heavily on the male lead, although Yoshiharu is from the future and knows exactly what Nobuna should do, she makes it pretty clear to him that she doesn't want to be told what to do and can make her own decisions. As time goes by you also start to learn more about her character and more about her ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what surprised me the most was the main male lead Sagara Yoshiharu, his character is pretty unique, he is a weakling but he isn't weak-willed, even though he acts like a bit of an idiot he helps out using his knowledge and takes command in battle. Although he is a pervert, he isn't overly horny that it ruins his character. He is a sort of pleasant and funny male lead that you can't help but like. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a harem aspect in the anime where the female characters fall for Yoshiharu one by one, the only romance that is hinted is between him and Nobuna, unlike the usual overly tsundere female and normal male relationship that occurs frequently in anime, this is one of those rare cases where they are both tsunderes, the best example that i could give you that is similar to this is okabe's and kurisu's (steins gate) love-hate relationship. They both ridicule each other and argue but they actually care for one another but they refuse to admit it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIts very entertaining to watch, the story isn't boring and actually teaches you about Japanese history, Yoshiharu is hilarious and its interesting to see him in action, its also quite funny when he and Nobuna argue, the comedy doesn't ruin the seriousness of the anime and it does well in changing between the comical moments and serious moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't finished the anime but the episodes I have watched have been great and its been getting better and better as the episodes go on. So don't be discouraged to watch this anime just because it looks like another stereotypical anime because this is a good example of how \"you shouldn't judge a book by its cover\".",

            "content": "As many have already said, at first glance this show appears to be just mostly your standard harem rom-com, however I was quite surprised when it turned out to be more of a reverse-harem, especially since most of the cast consist of females.\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\r\nWhile the story itself isn\u2019t really anything amazing, it well managed to keep me interested enough to finish watching the series. Throughout the show we basically deal with the different tasks Oda Nobuna has to do, or rather what tasks she has for the main character, Yoshiharu. It is an \u201chistorical\u201d anime, but since I don\u2019t know much at allabout Japanese history, it\u2019s hard for me to judge how accurate this is, really. However, the fact that Yoshiharu needs to take care not to change too much (as he\u2019s from the future and knows what\u2019s \u201cgoing to happen\u201d) is quite an interesting element to the show, and adds that little extra as he tries to not reveal important bits of information to certain people, or how he takes from his historical knowledge to get out of situations.\\n\r\nThere are however a few major plot holes around, like how Yoshiharu traveled back in time in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it won\u2019t leave you breathtaken, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be bored out of your mind by the story, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything that really makes the story stand out. \\n\r\nAnother major problem is also the fact that there\u2019s never really any real conclusion or anything, and thus this series is in dire need of a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nThe art is overall pretty good, to be honest. It has nice visuals, pretty fluid animations throughout most of the series, and nice-looking backgrounds. While I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a \u201cunique\u201d sort of style to it (thinking something like KyoAni) I also quite liked the character designs. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this brings us to the next point; Fanservice. Now, being a show where a majority of the characters are female, all surrounding this teenage boy then there\u2019s obviously bound to be fanservice. Whether it be Oda\u2019s regular outfit, the occasional fantasy or just overall moe loli characters, fanservice is certainly present throughout the series, however it never really felt like it was overdone or anything (the majority of the fanservice probably appear in the ED, actually). Most of the time they managed to make it somewhat funny, actually, and who doesn\u2019t love the occasional loli? (amirite?)\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nI quite liked the music in this show. The OP, \u201cLink\u201d by Aimi, is a bit more fast-paced or upbeat, which fits rather well with the series overall. It\u2019s not really a slow show in any aspect, and all of it is certainly not lollygagging, so this song with a more \u201caction-y\u201d feel to it is rather appropriate, in my opinion.  The ED, \u201cHikari\u201d by Makino Mizuta, is somewhat slower, and feels like it better captures the \u201cinnocent\u201d (or rom-com, if you\u2019d like) side of the series. \\n\r\nThe background music was good, but again, nothing amazingly outstanding (then again, I\u2019m not one to really pay too much attention to the BGM).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was rather well done, and further added upon the characters, well, characteristics. The voices are fitting for the characters, and some did a pretty great job at bringing out that little extra in their character (the stuttering of the ninja girl, for example).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7 / 10)\\n\r\nBeing the \u201cromantic\u201d (there\u2019s not that much romance, to be honest) comedy, and harem (or well, reverse-harem, rather) that it is, there are some things you won\u2019t really get away from in terms of characters. While the characters are well done, they\u2019re never really fleshed out or developed in any way. There are also quite a few \u201ctypical\u201d characters present, such as the Tsundere, the cute loli, the badass mysterious dude, etc. Thankfully, as I wouldn\u2019t say this is really a story-driven series, it\u2019s not really hurt by the lack of character development either. However, it is still important to note that this is a thing in the series, and since once again a lot of the characters are female you might see a bit too many \u201cstereotypical\u201d characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nI quite liked the show. The story is decent, it was pretty funny, and most of the characters are rather likeable, but it wasn\u2019t really anything more than that. A big problem is ofcourse also the fact that there\u2019s no conclusion at all to the story, and we\u2019ve yet to hear anything about a second season.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of harems (or reverse-harems in this case) or just want a rom-com with a slightly less \u201ctypical\u201d story, then this might be for you, however I\u2019d avoid it if you\u2019re in dire need of having closure.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Decent, interesting story.\\n\r\n+ Pretty funny overall.\\n\r\n+ Music was good.\\n\r\n+ Great visuals.\\n\r\n+ Likeable characters.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- \u201cStereotypical\u201d characters.\\n\r\n- No closure to story (needs a second season)\\n\r\n- Plot holes\\n\r\n- Doesn\u2019t really excel in any category (in my opinion)",

            "content": "This anime was a big surprise for me, first because i saw this was a harem and i don't mind harem but i have seen a lot of them and i thought this was going to be like the other ones and i was really wrong in a way, second was because i didn't thought they were going to focus on the story and just in the girls but they made a great job focusing on both.\r\nStory\r\nWell, the story was very good, it follows a 17-year-old high schooler Sagara Yoshiharu who one day time-travels to the Sengoku period and that is the why i didn'tgave this a better score because you don't really get to know how he time-traveled to the Sengoku period not even through any episode, the reason was unknown but other than that it was great, the fact that he knew how to change the history and helped Nobuna to achieved a way to make her follow the good way and changing what he knew to an unknown result in the future was entertaining and you didn't know what was coming if everything changed and the fact that she wasn't corrupted (like the real Nobunaga was) was because she found someone that she loved and that one was Yoshiharu, the other thing i didn't like was that there wasn't enough romance, i was like ''kiss her'' or ''kiss him already'' don't expect deep romance but overall was very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation was great even in the battles they look really well done and the art of the landscape and the cities were just great, and the character design was really good, overall great.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound was great with the voice acting, i can't picture them with other voices that could fit them that great, the music background was very good and the OP was really enjoyable i never skipped it, overall was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThis was outstanding, i just loved every single character and not to mention Saru was really amazing, he is a real MC, he is not a wuss even tho he doesn't fight but he was really good in sports so he can avoid things and he was smart too and was never afraid of anything just to make Nobuna happy and the greatest part is that he has a Harem of lolis lol, that was hilarious when every episode a new loli was added to his harem when in reality he wanted girls of his same age was funny but they're really adorable specially Hanbee with that sweet voice, he has like five lolis and two of his age being Nobuna and other one that i won't spoil you, Sagara became one of my favorite characters, and the other ones are outstanding, they were really well developed, there're a lot of characters that were really great in this anime, so this was the outstanding part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nYou won't regret watching this anime, this has almost everything, good humor, amazing characters, great art and sound, very good story, adorable and funny lolis, historical events, this needed more romance or a kiss to be even better but you will like a lot Oda Nobuna no Yabou.",

            "content": "Unlike the other review, I'm just going to start off with why I graded them ( ).\r\nStory 9/10\r\nMain Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobunaga ' Monkey ' or  ' Saru '. No, I'm sorry. Main Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobuna ' Monkey ' or  ' Saru '. This anime is a historical, romantic and comedy with a large change of physical looks from the normal history (Gender swap). Plot twists are quite unpredictable. Main Female Lead, Oda Nobuna, is a blonde. I repeat. A blonde. I was quite surprised considering Oda Nobunaga had blackhair. The story follows the history that we know with slight changes which was made when Monkey (Sagara Yoshiharu) time-traveled there. The story's pacing was good. Nothing was rushed. Ending was okay. Although the romance tag was unanswered that much and the girl in the end, it was fine. At least they finished the main part, the Historical tag. Comedy in this anime was as fine as any other anime. Although it didn't make me roll on the floor, it was fine. The story was appealing and drew me in. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen Sagara Yoshiharu was named ' Monkey ', it was no joke. The illustrators made him look exactly like a Monkey when it was needed. His hair style kind of looked like a Monkey's. Emotions drawn by the illustrators were conveyed well to us viewers. You could clearly see what the characters were feeling. The personalities were matched the best for Monkey. The rest of the characters I would say that it was great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's voice was matched to the character until the point that you could say that the voice itself belonged to the character itself. Sound effects of the action scenes, the monkey's monkey voice, everything suited it. The opening of the anime was relatively catchy which makes you want to hear it over and over again. Once you get a hold of it, that is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters were great! I loved it. The characters were all well developed. They made an emotional attachment between the viewer and them. The physical looks of the new Oda Nobunaga were great. A few characters lost their show time at the next part of the anime. The number of supporting characters? A variety. Not too flat, the number was perfect. The villain's background was not clearly shown. Although it was clear that he had an ulterior motive. I loved all of the characters equally. Except for the villain since I was quite stupid and could not exactly comprehend what he was thinking and can barely remember what he said in the last episode. Look on the bright side, no spoilers! Overall, the characters appealed much to me, the viewer. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, come on. There is nothing to doubt about this. I enjoyed it so much I was standing on my toes. The romance, what would happen next? When I thought that something bad was going to happen, it just decided to change for the viewer. Great, awesome anime. Definitely one which can make you hit that button which leads  you to the next episode. I could barely pause watching it. \\n\r\nIt was more like -\\n\\n\r\n\"Kiss  already. Quickly, kiss. Faster plox.\"  or just talking to the person in the screen. Obviously I know that I would never get a reply. -cries-\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was one that could be remembered by its viewers as one of the best types of anime which included the Historical tag.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the other sections, amazing. The anime just sucked you in like a whirlpool.",

            "content": "Just  a little note before I start, this is my first review and I was compelled to write this because I truly enjoyed this anime.\r\nSo, Oda Nobuna no Yabou, first glance, you'd think \"Oh usual guy meets girl after girl until a harem is made\", well sorry to burst your bubble, but there's more to this anime than it looks.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n Okay, so maybe some people don't enjoy this, but personally I like the concept. Time travelling guys arrives at an alternate past where all the \"Leaders\" are girls, could have been better, but it's not overused. Usual progression for the story, girl meetsguy, they fall in \"love\" and it builds up from there, and I mean both their feelings and his harem.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: Not going to win any massive awards for the story, but definitely deserves an 8 for it's creativity.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n Compared to other animes, I'd say the artwork in Oda Nobuna is pretty GOOD, not as good as something like Hagure Yuusha no Estetica (Personal Preference, replace with some other title) but it's definitely nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: Not the best, but still amazing\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n The opening of Oda Nobuna is worth listening to, and that's coming from a person who skips most intros after hearing it once, it really fits the anime. Now, the sound effects etc. as you'd expect from an anime with sword fighting and the like is pretty good. I think you'd be able to immerse yourself in the sounds of the ongoing battle while listening to a few mc's chatting pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: Amazing sound effects, great voice actors and a good intro, deserving of a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n Some of you may argue, but I felt that the way the characters acted and are portrayed fits the time line of the show. They're proper \"ladies\", they get embarrassed when they're supposed to, trust each other more after some experience, and doubt each other when it's proper to do so. I'd rather not go into detail of the characters themselves, so I'll say this: The wide array of characters provides various choices favor. (Personal favorite is Goemon)\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: The characters act correctly according to the happenings, there are no weird attitude changes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n Okay so, it may not average to a 10, but I enjoyed it so what the hell, give it a 10. I loved the concept, the characters and the harem development (compared to other harems), I enjoyed watching the battles and how each character played an integral part in their victory.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: WATCH THE SHOW DAMMIT\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n Worth the watch, worth the time, I won't ignore the fact that some people might not like this anime, but if you're fine with a few not-so-funny jokes, or getting angry at how disgusting a person looks (it was obviously on purpose) then get your ass off that chair and give Oda Nobuna no Yabou a try!",

Their notable products such as Death Note, One Punch Man, and Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (to name a few) are psychologically intense. While, on the other side, less intense shows such as Ore Monogatari!!, Nana and Chobits give a different sense of ambient. Oda Nobuna no Yabou belongs to the latter.\r\nYou might be surprised how this simple show's capability of enticing you - wishing for more. The edge of the show is on its historical stories that compel the content onto the audience whilst paired with Madhouse absorptive capacity to transfer their heritage knowledgeof past works into the making of this anime. With their past experiences and capable technologies, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is produced. While it's debatable, any supposedly decent work with a stamp from Madhouse studio will be escalated into above average. Whether it may or not be for this case, it's up to how the individual interprets it.",

Let me just get one thing out of the way:  This is NOT one of them (at least imo.)The historical setting does little to mask the flaws of this anime.\r\nSTORY 6/10\r\n-This isn't a strong point of the series, as many would claim.\r\n- Linear and boring plot \r\n- Uninteresting developments. Battles are vague and don't make sense. How on Earth is Nobuna a Samurai Lord?!\r\nART 8/10\r\n- Character designs are very good.\r\n- Scenery and backgrounds are nice to look at.\r\nSOUND 7/10\r\n- Fairly niceOP and ED that set the tone well for the series.\\n\r\n- Voice acting is very good and suits the characters very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 6/10\\n\r\n-I suppose that this series gets praise because all the girls don't lust after the male lead as one might expect looking at this title. Nor is he some generic, pervy loser.\\n\r\n-The main female lead is a tsundere, but surprisingly this doesn't result in her being a generic one dimensional character. She is portrayed as (for the most part) a strong female character, much like the other girls in the series.\\n\r\n-The development of the characters was lacking and once a couple of episodes go by, they quickly became uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter development and plot was unsatisfactory. \\n\r\nThe humor which is one of the primary reasons people may watch this is this is also boring. Despite what I said earlier, I think it would have been better if Yoshiharu (the male lead) was a complete perv\\n\r\nbecause there really was no other source of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nFans of the harem genre will enjoy this. Those of you who don't usually watch this genre of anime and come into this expecting a good series will probably be left disappointed past the first few episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oda Nobuna No Yabou is a rather exciting new anime for me. \r\nWhat i like about it so far is they took a old idea and gave it a fresh twist. Standard time shift backwards but the twist is when you meet all the greatest male figures in Japanese history, they are girls. The whole concept seems somewhat cheesy but they actually do this well.\r\nThey keep the strong character types while somehow making them a little cute. Character designs a i found interesting, when i look at Nobunas standard clothing it just seems so unique for anime. The colors of Gold/Black as always compliment eachother but they gave her such a unique clothing choice that i think was just very imaginative.It may be based off of a standard historical style but it looks unique how they have altered it just a bit.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the art and sound i give a solid 7, art is fairly standard but the sound effects and voice acting is tops. I think they did a fairly great job casting voice actors for this show. Some stronger than others while others being slightly more sweet and childish giving the show a nice balance.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing i loved most about this show is that they actually use the fact the main character knows whats going to happen in history effectively. I mean they don't leave that big open plot hole in this show. A lot of similar story lines complete neglect facts like they should know or even could know. This show really embraces the whole reality of the situation and uses it effectively as a story mechanic.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching this show, its exciting and it actually teaches you a bit about Japanese historical moments and people. I also like how the beginning they skip the cliched 2 part introduction to the gimmick. They just drop you right into the middle of the action without really feeding you 10 minutes of pre time travel setting/dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nI think anyone who gives this a good 2 episode watch is gonna watch more, its funny and the plot is solid. The characters are very likable and the show is just well done all around. Solid 9, this is a Great anime.",

Of course the main character would need a lead to be able to be the chosen one and the helpful monkey which is from the future helps nobuna conquer japan.\r\nStory-9/10\r\nNot exactly original. You gain allies and keep on conquering and make mistakes. The only twists are the fact that there is a \"monkey\" trying to win women ( his harem of friends haha), the fact that all the key historic figures and cute little girls andthe fact that Sagara, our monkey, knows the future and the past but not with all the new twists.\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nIt's absolutely stellar. Except for the people who are meant to be disgusting but other than them I love nearly every character design and the surroundings. It is what 2012 art should be like.\\n\r\nSound-9/10\\n\r\nThe opening song really fits with the type of genre this is ( conquer japan) and I love the ending song.\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\nThere are not many \"steriotypical\" characters. Everyone is quite fun and a bit different and all have their own reasons for fighting. the characters with notable personalities would be Sagara (monkey) who is fun and trying to get the most beautiful women in Japan and help Oda Nobuna conquer Japan. There is also Nobuna who has to prevent herself from being overcome by crazyness, anger or greed like many other rulers.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI loved every single episode. It was full of fun and did not have a single dull moment. I wouldn't exactly say this is great for rewatchability but its a fun filled ride as long as you don't know the rythm.\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nA great story. Fun, exciting and a great story. It's basically a codegeass but without a badass main and the make you think aspect. You should watch it or at least give it a try. Some reasons I've heard that made the story awful would be \"it's a harem\" or \"it looks like it has no plot\". Yes, it is a harem. However there is one girl that stands out and the rest are basically just friends so there is progress. And I assure you, the plot is quite nice for it's genre. It would be a 10/10 if only it were a bit longer but the 12 episodes I watched were spectacular.",

            "content": "There is something that needs to be said about this show before this review proceeds. This is that this show can be a beautiful and interesting/different presentation with exciting fan service (No, not just tits and panty shots) of the Sengoku world to another typical harem/hijinks show. The first will probably be the opinion of people who have studied the Warring States period of Japan, played related video games of them such as Nobunaga's Ambition and Samurai Warriors, and is generally a fan of the numerous Sengoku shows out there. The latter will of course be someone who has no knowledge in this area. WhileI try to be objective in a sense, I can't help but come reviewing this show as the former simply because it was created for these type of people and does it extremely well. I am of course in no way putting myself as superior to anyone; I simply want people to understand the show may one viewer squeal in delight while another passes up any enjoyment because of circumstances. It's a show like Carnival Phantasm and Type-Moon in this way.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the show presents a number of fan service that can only be appreciated by the Sengoku, Three Kingdom fans. From the events of Nobunaga's meeting with Saito Dousan and rifle lighting, to the glorious Okehazama, and to the Zhuge Liang reference of Hanbei, the show throws a number of fan service and interesting references that may go unappreciated by a viewer that has no knowledge of these events and history. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot progresses from the beginning of Nobuna (Nobunaga) as the fool of Owari and her gradual rise to power with the help of someone from the future who has distinct knowledge of the era. Because it mainly goes through her campaigns, it should be noted once again that enjoyment and interest stems from knowledge of some of these campaigns and to see how they will turn out. Yes, while the story tries to stay true to the main events of history, there are enough little events and subversions that allow the viewer feel anxious on what will happen next. An obvious flaw is the blatant ignoring of how the main character ended up in the Sengoku era. This however helps to alleviate the usually sidetracking of the main story in typical time travel/other dimension travel stories where excess time is spent on trying to get back home. It is somewhat refreshing to see this ignored for a change and see the focus on what is at hand.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, people who watched Highschool DxD may recognize Miyama-Zero and his distinct drawing style. It probably goes without saying that the art is wonderfully done if you take a few minutes to watch the show or see Zero's artwork. The production values are high up there, not ufotable status of course but you can definitely see the effort the animators have put in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs an Aimi (Ben-to OP) fan, I instantly fell in love with the opening song to the show. She is one of the more underrated stars out there and I definitely urge people to try and check some of her songs out. But to not digress, the soundtrack of Oda Nobuna is superb as well. It does a fine job of setting the mood and evoking the feelings from the situation at hand. From the wacky song that plays throughout the comedy scenes, to the touching melodies during the drama, and to the war-like drum fashion when the troops are preparing to go to war, each song plays a suitable role.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the greatest compliment I have to give to Oda Nobuna no Yabou is it's characters. The typical thought of someone who first sees this show is the thought that the main character is your generic harem man and the characters are but breasts to fill on TV for the ogling otaku. This is not so.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Sagara Yoshiharu is a refreshing character. He is someone that actually uses his knowledge of the era to the benefit, actively participates in every episode instead of sitting around behind his harem of women, even to the point that he is the reason for Nobuna's success, and is overall competent except for a few comedic moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is mature and you can see the many qualities they have underneath their exterior. Nobuna herself goes through a series of touching and good character development. She, like many of the characters of this show, are subverted in such creative and unique ways that I must bow in respect to the author. It really really helps if you know the typical media representation of these historical figures and want to see something different and twisted in many different ways. They are not just your typical gender-bent shameless body flaunting character, though there is quite a number of skin-ship. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a Sengoku fan, have played KOEI games, and love history in general, then I 100% recommend this show. If otherwise, I still ask for someone to try it out; if not to start learning about the Sengoku period, then for some delicious females, the hilarity, and romance.",

            "content": "Basically, this story is about our main character going back in time to feudal japan. Immediately he gets caught in the middle of a battle. From what I've concluded after watching the first episode, him being there causes the death of a key person of in japanese history, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a key retainer of Oda Nobunaga. \r\nIt's up to Sagara (main character) to take his place and assist Nobunaga or rather Nobuna and take Hideyoshi's place. \r\nI love history and this show seems like a good way to learn about the unification of Japan. It gives off sort of a Axis Powers Hetalia feel toit where the show teaches a bit of history to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nI find it amusing how the producers turn famous deadly warriors into girls. When i saw Goemon's character in this show, i couldn't take this show seriously anymore. Then again i can't say that i don't like the idea of them turning them all into girls. I mean seriously? Who doesn't like watching anime girls with swords and spears, etc beating the crap out of faceless unimportant characters. \\n\\n\r\nI laughed a couple of times during this show. For instance, the girls don't even address him by his name. Instead, they call him Saru (Monkey). For the oddest of reasons i felt that this show had the same sort of comedy feel as Highschool Dxd for all of you who have seen it. Not the ecchi comedy part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for it being a harem show, its not one of those dirty ecchi shows. i'd have to say it's probably a 2 or 3 on a scale of 10 on ecchiness. There are a lot of loli's though...i already counted like 4. The main character's a typical harem character. He's sort of a loser but in his own strange way he's very powerful. Like in almost any anime, you will find anime stereotypes in this show. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally i hope this show goes where i think it's going. All the girls in the show seem to disrespect him and think he's disgusting but i can see him turning that all around. Sort of like in Love Hina. Last, hopefully this show becomes like one of those shonen mangas and takes the main character and turns him into a really cool, bad ass character. Until then, i will be following this show until the end.",

            "content": "When I read the synopsis without thinking much, the first thing that came to my mind was that all the characters in the anime, except for the protagonist, were females. I was wrong.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nA story based on Japanese History, which actually entertained me and educated me a bit, mainly because I have Japanese classes. It wasn't boring, it didn't drag out that much and if it did, it would be fan-service/some comedy skit added into that. If I were to give a score on originality about the type of story being used in the anime, I'd give it a 9 but if I based iton how much it entertained me, I'd give it a solid 4 but the only thing that saved it was they made it different by putting the protagonist to be someone from the future, having the 'ability' (not sure if I could call it an ability) to see the future. The type of male protagonist that come from the future/different worlds and want to save the current world always make the anime better, personally. It had a lot of action, mainly sword fighting and a little bit of magic I suppose. There's harem and romance, but the harem slowly develops throughout the anime, which doesn't bother me but as a guy who has watched a lot of harem/romance anime, it was very predictable on who's going to fall in love with the protagonist. It was somewhat funny, mainly using perverted jokes which are alright, but if overused and repetitive, can get really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if it's just me, but the art style gave a history-ish vibe. Other than that, the colors and nice and bright, animations are smooth and is very easy to catch the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST fit scenes nicely and used necessary, not overused and isn't too loud. The OP fit the theme of the anime, giving that 'army' vibe (I'm probably stoned) and the ED fits the romance side of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSagara Yoshiharu, the protagonist who comes from the future (circa 400 years). He's very obsessed with history games, mainly with the Shogunate eras and all those. He's very talented, in his own ways because he remembers a whole period of time from the past and uses it to his knowledge to try to save characters from dying. A very kind but perverted person.\\n\\n\r\nOda Nobuna, a very cheerful girl who dresses very minimal. She's a tsundere (not a flat one!!) and cares a lot for the people she loves. She's not that smart, mainly because she is easy to trap. Without Sagara her nation would've died. Kind-hearted and caring (mostly to Sagara ;))\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a new experience for me, as not only did it entertain me, but it actually educated me. Yes there's fan-service and a lot of 'loli' characters, but hey the action was quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a second season out there, I'd watch it. I really liked the idea of this anime. If you like protagonist who comes from a different world/future and wants to save the current world he is in, then Zero no Tsukaima is for you. If you like history but not very educational, then Hyakka Ryouran might suit you. Would I re-watch this? Definitely.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oda Nobuna no Yabou appears like a fairly simplistic reverse gender harem/romance and comedy set in the Sengoku Era  at first glance, but there's actually more to the plot than meets the eye... \r\nThe story revolves around a 17 years old young man named Sagara Yoshiharu, who is sent to an alternate version of the Sengoku Era without currently providing any explanation of how he achieved such a feat.\r\nHowever, not is all as it seems...\r\nSagara quickly realizes that the fearsome Oda Nobunaga has been replaced by a girl named Oda Nobuna in this continuity and that other historical figures such as Shibata Katsuie andNiwa Nagahide have also undergone an inexplicable shift in gender.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of these historical inconsistencies, he is mistreated and/or not taken seriously within the Oda clan and has to earn the trust and respect of his own companions and the fiery Nobuna and maybe find love...\\n\\n\r\nNote: All following statements explaining my scores are but mere opinion. Also, I have only watched two episodes as of now so my opinion on the series may change along the way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI think the main appeal of the story is the potential it holds when it comes to changing historical facts as current episodes show Sagara actively trying to alter the course of history as he knows it so that Nobuna doesn't become like Nobunaga and leaves one to wonder what will happen to the roles of Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Tokugawa Iyeasu if she remains alive unlike her historical counterpart or just how far will Sagara's knowledge of the future will get him before he gets a prediction wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good aspect of the story is how the comedy aspect of the show does not overlap on the serious aspect of the story like say...Nyarko-san where there was virtually no boundary between the two.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from Madhouse Studios, the art is just fine, the ecchiness is mild and not too overbearing. There isn't anything wrong with the animation in general at first glance though I did not make a thorough investigation (as in frame by frame) like I usually do.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I would have is against the ending sequence, did they really have to put so much ecchi shots cause it's literally made of them! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and voices are fine as well, the background music and sound effects reflects the mood of the scenes and aren't squeaky or unbearable and the voices are pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is well fleshed out and don't feel like you're talking to a random background character. Here's a short list:\\n\\n\r\nSagara: A harem hero who has 'balls', that's all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nNobuna: The Tsundere who is quite reckless and her inability to say what she wants honestly is a flaw can make her as dangerous as Nobunaga himself if no one is there to voice their opposition. \\n\\n\r\nKatsuie: The big chested girl who is serious most of the time and gets embarrassed quite easily, follows the 'knight' archetype.\\n\\n\r\nNiwa: The 'ojou' type-2 (TvTropes) girl who acts cool and mature and likes to rate people and their actions.\\n\\n\r\nGoemon: The loli girl who has difficulty speaking coherently as her speech drags on and is actually pretty skilled as a ninja, which may hint to having been trained so hard she didn't get a proper education.\\n\\n\r\n(There are obviously more, I'm just naming the 'main' ones)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOver all, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is a really unique 'harem'/comedy anime that has a hidden flavor for any Japanese history maniacs if on is willing to look past all the 'anime' aspect of the show and can be very enjoyable.",

            "content": "The anime is about Sagara Yoshiharu, who travels back into the Sengoku era where feudal lords fight among each other to expand their territory and to inch their way into conquering Japan. The anime opens with our main, Sagara, trapped in a battle field. He meets the leader of the Oda clan, Oda Nobunaga. No, wait. He is shocked to discover that the man who unified Japan is actually a young tsundere blonde. She\u2019s not Oda Nobunaga; she is Oda Nobuna. Sagara then decides to serve under Oda Nobuna and using his knowledge of playing video games about his conquest, he has proved to bea valuable weapon for Oda. He helps her correct wrongs that happened in history and to predict the events to give Oda the advantage. He also vowed to make sure she\u2019s alive after she conquered Japan. It\u2019s not an easy task when the rest of the feudal lords are out to make sure she doesn\u2019t succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been the biggest surprise of the season so far because I didn\u2019t even knew this anime existed until a couple of days ago. I certainly didn\u2019t expect it to be so damn good. I saw the title and I sighed a bit because I expect another anime like Brave Ten that uses the feudal era as a setting and basically doing something subpar with it. The anime has all the elements to fail miserably yet it turns out to be very amazing. I always believe that clich\u00e9 isn\u2019t a bad thing and it all depends on how you use it. This anime has a harem with all the generic fixings but it was able to properly use the elements to make one remarkable story. Also, it\u2019s a light novel anime. I love anime adapted from light novels because they have more emphasis on story than any other medium. Oda Nobuna no Yabou is one of the best anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime proves to be a bit ridiculous when you see the first episode. I actually find it hard to believe that they made a show where Oda Nobunaga is a tsundere. It boggles the mind and I was sure this premise wouldn\u2019t last. They might replace it with pointless fan service or build a harem or something. All the elements are there for the anime to drop the premise. We have a bunch of girls and one guy, the generic casts of a harem is here: the tsundere, the big breasted one, the silent one and the loud one. They just needed to align themselves and I was preparing for the worst. It didn\u2019t happen though. The anime didn\u2019t disintegrate into a senseless Ecchi or Harem anime. I was relieved to know that. It couldn\u2019t become a pointless Ecchi show mainly because the anime has a pretty impressive story to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle in this anime is accepting the fact that the heroes of Japan are replaced with girls. Oda Nobuna is a freakin tsundere. If you can follow that fact then you can enjoy the anime. It started pretty interesting actually. The first episode started with a battle and the plot was laid out pretty nicely afterwards. The idea of having a guy from the future telling Oda of all the things she did wrong is pretty sweet. It\u2019s like going to the movies with a guy who already seen it. He spoils the story and Oda is able to capitalize from it. The rewriting of history and the characters turning into cute girls is among the charm of the anime. The plot of the anime is very serious despite the ridiculous elements of the anime and it\u2019s the reason why the anime was able to straighten out right away. The first half has some very powerful episodes that will easily grab you.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about a part of history of Japan though but it never got in the way. I recognize most of the characters because I played a lot of Orochi games on the PS2 and that\u2019s as far as I know regarding the Sengoku era. The anime often has time to have a narrator introduce the characters so they can easily slide themselves into the story. After the introduction, the anime proceeds in building the story. There are a lot of dialogues in the anime but it was used to establish certain situations in the anime. The anime is like watching a game of chess and you eagerly wait for the moment where a player shows the trick up his sleeve. There are a lot of moments in the anime that is really impressive. One example is declaring that building a fort in the field would prove impossible because it\u2019s near a feudal lord\u2019s territory and he will do his best to make sure the fort won\u2019t be built. The anime uses certain situations like this and have Sagara or Oda have their moment of brilliance and attempt the impossible. Once you get used to the pattern, it\u2019s not long before you wait for the next big hurdle to come and the moment of brilliance the characters will do to overcome the problem.\\n\r\nThe characters are certainly the strongest point of the anime. They are a bit generic but they have the perfect personality to make the story interesting. The cute little girls being involved in feudal wars are really interesting because the anime did a great job presenting it. Of course, the idea of a stuttering ninja who looks about 9 years old is a bit of hard pill to swallow but when the story moves along its climactic moment, all the characters  was able to bring their own charm to the scene. There are a lot of characters and none of them look alike. They all have a certain role to the story with their unique personality. There is no shortage of interesting characters here from both the good guys and the bad guys. They certainly make the story a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOda Nobuna is pretty rounded herself. She is considered as a military genius capable of doing the impossible but most of the time she is just a little brat. I really love how most of the times, she is the problem and her weak hearted nature adds some needed tension in the anime. It does wear off pretty quickly because the anime relies far too much on her weak personality but it deepens the story and makes it more exciting. One moment she is this girl with a nasty personality trying to rule the country then the next moment she is a docile little kitten that needs the other characters to comfort her out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sagara, well, he\u2019s a pretty normal guy. He is the generic type of main character that just flows along with the story. If the scene calls for him to be an idiot then he becomes an idiot. If the scene needs him to be hero then he\u2019ll rise to the occasion. If the story needs him to be \u201ccool guy\u201d the girls will fall in love with then he becomes that guy. I guess it\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s a flexible main character but he doesn\u2019t have enough personality to stand on his own. It\u2019s not a bad thing though because other supporting characters get some screen time thanks to his lack of a decent personality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some hints of fan service in the anime but it was never a main focus. The story did point out that Sagara is a pervert but there aren\u2019t any panty shots and there was only one moment of boob grabbing. It\u2019s pretty alright because some of the characters are a bit under aged and it\u2019d be pretty awful to sit through another Ro Kyu Bu type of anime (which gets another season and some more pedo fan service). There is also a slight hint of romance to tie the entire anime together. Sagara and Oda\u2019s relationship is one of driving plot points of the anime and it\u2019s often of the elements that cause a lot of tension in the anime. One moment they\u2019re buddy buddy then when push comes to shove, they\u2019re fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does have some downsides to it. The biggest hurdle is accepting the cute characters as competent warriors battling adult sized soldiers and what not. The story easily covers that up. The anime never explained Sagara going back to the past though and it does bug me at first. He just suddenly showed up and no mention of black holes or time machines to explain his time travel. The anime obviously didn\u2019t want you to question it because the plot was pretty good that it didn\u2019t matter how he got there. The one complaint I have about the anime though is that the anime slowly pushed Sagara into the background. In the first half, he was very pivotal in the fights because of his knowledge about playing video games. As the anime progresses, this knowledge was no longer used and some of the moments of the second half would\u2019ve been more awesome if the anime had Sagara spoil the fights. It\u2019s a minor complain though and the anime didn\u2019t crumble from the lack of Sagara\u2019s knowledge.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in the second half did become a bit fast and certain events had little effect to me because the anime rushed in getting there. There was no climactic build up in the second half and it was a shame that they couldn\u2019t make the final moments of the anime more awesome. It ended pretty anticlimactically and it\u2019s a shame. It did tease a second season and I seriously want another run at this awesome anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character, the anime did a heck of a good job at it. There is a huge range of character design here from the cute kin of character up to the grown up old type adult character. One thing I love about this anime is that no character looks alike. They are all extremely detailed using the attire of the era to their advantage and putting a spin on it. There is a stuttering ninja with a pink skull hairclip, a little girl with a spear and a tiger hood and even a girl with a cute dragon emblem on her head. The characters are the best part of the anime and it\u2019s their diverse look that makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also one of the anime\u2019s best parts. The fight scenes are a bit too short but they still have an air of awesomeness to them that makes them fun to watch. The use of CG in some scenes is nicely done because it doesn\u2019t look stiff. The way the camera changes angles is also one of the reasons why the fight scenes are some awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are pretty straight forward and there isn\u2019t a lot of technicality in them. The anime uses it as a way to move the story along and it\u2019s often not the climax of the anime. It often leads to the climax but the battles where never once the main attention of the anime. The moment of brilliance among the characters is like building a fort overnight. That being said though, the fight scenes are still pretty nice. The capture the feel of a real war and there are enough effects to give us the impression of a massive battle. There is no blood though. I would\u2019ve preferred at least some blood out of slashed necks but the anime often cut away before any blood would gush out or they would be off screen. Let\u2019s focus on the moe characters instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s OP is \u201cLink\u201d by Aimi. This really captures the anime\u2019s theme and it nicely reflects the relationship of the two main characters. The anime\u2019s opening sequence is pretty awesome as well. It introduced all the characters without spoiling the story and overwhelming the viewers. I also love the scene of the horses meeting each other for a battle. You can clearly see the awesomeness of the anime and the high production value of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED song is \u201cHikari\u201d by Makino Mizuta. It\u2019s a slow song with a romantic theme to it. It has a meloow vibe to it compared to the rough nature of the anime. The ED sequence is has a bigger fan service than the overall series with all the girls naked and draped with a sheet. It\u2019s pretty nice, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a really good anime and it\u2019s too good to miss. The plot, the characters and the action all makes for one awesome anime experience. Try to enjoy the moe girls fighting in the Sengoku era because the anime is really great. I highly recommend it.",

What happens if?\r\nThe anime has done great about Artwork, characters are drawn very well, unlike some other drawings that make you go sick.\r\nAlso the OST are very well made fromthe opening song all the way through the episodes until the end with some minor letdowns.\\n\r\nYou should watch Oda Nobuna no yabou if you enjoy a good soap opera",

            "content": "When I saw Oda Nobuna no Yabou I really wasn't expecting much. It looked like a typical harem anime set in a historical  time frame. Which it is. Most of the characters are typical harem type characters and the anime is laced with comedy and romance.\r\nSo there you have it.\r\nNot quite. Its the historical time frame that separates it from your usual harem comedy. The story is very loosely based on the life of Oda Nobunga, the hero of Japan's Sengoku period, through the eyes of Sagara Yoshiharu a 17 year old boy from the future who replaces Toyatomi Hideyoshi, and includes most ofthe key characters of the period except in this version Oda Nobunga is actually called Oda Nobuna who is a teenage girl as are the rest of the main characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result we have an anime which is a lot of fun likable characters and lots battle and action scenes which are based on real events in Oda Nobunga's life with some very good artwork.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend swatting up on Japan's Sengoku period and Oda Nobunga's life a little to get the most out the anime as it will help to understand the plot.",

You will enjoy the anime and studying about japanese history,interesting isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\nThe story involves about Sagaru,  a highschool guy which is unknownly stranded into the era of Oda Nobunaga where ALL the major samurai was a cute girls. and he promises to Oda Nobuna (Not Nobunaga) that he will helps her to achieve her dream to unite japan. as far as go, the story really interest me, since its rare to see some harem anime (well, i always thought this anime is a harem), which have a strong plot and nice development between the two main lead. and love that happen (harem typical) wasn't exaggerating , they (the girls) didnt express their feelings in any weird way, and later, the twist in nearly the end of the series was really suprising me. \"i never really thought that\" thats what i said.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nI cant said too much on this section, for me as the story was good, i dont really mind about the art. well, for this anime , i thought the art was really nice, especially when the battle and war scenes, it looks realistic.  i really enjoyed it. and for the character, i think they are really well-made, and again not exaggrating in \"Boobs\" section like any other harem anime. thats a good point!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nAgain, i cant said too much on this, but surely the opening song was nice (really nice, even i searching for this song) and really fits with the story and the anime itself, it represent on what will hapen. and the voice actor really did a good job, especially loli girls voice. the voice was so childish and it really fits with the loli character. Not just the loli voice, but the other character voice wasn't really bad too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 7/10\\n\r\ni think this was the weakness for this anime, so many questions in my head about this, like how can that highschool boy can do time travels? is he a john titor? and since the story was focussing on the conquest of Oda Nobuna, i think thats acceptable if the each character didnt get any own story. and more, its just 12 episode. its too hard to expand and explaining for each character. and i think there will be a season 2 for this, and hope they will fill \"the holes\" in the season 1.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nI am really glad i found this anime, i am not just enjoying this anime but in the same time, its feeling like studying japanese history. i am not japanese, but with this anime, i think i am interest in Oda Nobunaga era like i interest in three kingdoms. A totally great anime to watch! \\n",

Oda Nobuna no Yabou would fall into the latter category, but actually not as far into it as first impressions might lead you to believe.\r\nThe premise of having a high-school kid *somehow* travel back in time to the Sengoku era as a replacement for Toyotomi Hideyoshi (a.k.a. Kinoshita T\u014dkichir\u014d) and then having all the famous Samurai lords be cute girls instead makes it seem like nothingmore than yet another silly romantic comedy in an original setting. However, if you\u2019re looking for some sort of stereotypical funny ecchi harem you\u2019re not going to find it here, rather this anime sincerely surprised me with how little fan service it had, and bar the initial premise it turned out to be an extremely good series, even from a purely objective standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nNow obviously there is a fair amount of comedy and non-serious elements in it as well, but that is essentially only due to the twist made with the main characters identities; other than that it follows the actual story of Oda Nobunaga (in this case Nobuna as it\u2019s a pretty blonde girl instead) and his\u2026 uhh her* dream of unifying Japan into a peaceful country, which of course is not something that can be done without military conquest.\\n\\n\r\nI should probably also mention that while it is by no means completely necessary, I would highly recommend that you know at least a little bit about the story of the actual historical events of the Sengoku period if you are going to watch this series, as that is in the end what the entire anime is based on, and all the characters, clans, famous battles and events are essentially all ones that existed/happened in reality. You will be able to relate to the characters especially a lot more if you\u2019re at least somewhat familiar with their actual historical counterparts, and there are a LOT of names to keep track of if you\u2019re completely in the dark heading into this. Also even though there are a few short seconds every once in a while showing a map of who and what is where, it would still be very helpful to be familiar with at least the locations of the various major houses, as well as the names of their respective countries and lords.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said though, that doesn\u2019t mean you will literally know everything that\u2019s going to happen in the anime in case you are very familiar with the actual story, because our resident protagonist and time traveler also happens to be an expert on the Sengoku era, and due to being able to foresee almost every event since he already knows what is going to happen (because of coming from the future from the others\u2019 perspective), not everything goes exactly as history would tell it since his words and knowledge slowly change events compared to the \u2018past\u2019 he knew from his own time. Thus, despite being based on a real story (albeit with some obvious twists in the premise itself), it still manages to be quite unpredictable every so often.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I happened to marathon this series literally the same day that I had earlier finished reading Sengoku Rance which probably increased the enjoyment value quite a lot as well, but that is definitely not a stunt I think anyone is obliged to replicate (although if you feel like it and have the time, be my guest).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this isn\u2019t an anime you should watch if you want a heavily action-filled samurai story, nor should you watch it if you\u2019re looking solely for laughs and fuzzy feelings, but still to a certain extent, Oda Nobuna no Yabou manages to do both those things at once, which I found kind of impressive given the premise and the fact that it\u2019s only a 1-cour series. Speaking of which though, that is probably the only real complaint I have about the anime as a whole, namely: \\n\\n\r\nWhere the hell is season 2??",

            "content": "When you look at the cover Oda Nobuna no Yabou, you would immediately think \"oh, its just another cliche harem series\", I wouldn't blame you if you did as it does look like one and I myself thought of it as one, but when you actually watch it you realize that there is simply more to it than that, its definitely not a tasteless cliche and although it has many female characters, it doesn't present itself as a stereotypical harem where they are all attracted to the male lead.\r\nI won't bother with the introductions because I know you are smart enough to have read thesynopsis first, so I won't repeat anything you already know. Instead I will get straight onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that most other cliche harem/romance animes out there fail at is the story, they continuously throw in unneeded fanservice and ecchi scenes to please the viewers instead of telling the story. However, unlike them ONnY cuts the ecchi short and focuses more on giving the viewers a good story and plot, which is commendable. However although i say this, they put in all the fanservice in the ending credits lolz XD but its much better than putting it in the episode itself where it will ruin the storytelling and the serious aspect of the anime\\n\\n\r\nSo far the storytelling has been superb and the plot has been interesting, its based on real historical events that happen in the Sengoku Era where Oda Nobuna (female version), the leader of the Oda Clan has an ambition of conquering the whole of Japan, but in order to do so she must take on rival clans and handle internal affairs, the one who helps her on her conquest is Sagara Yoshiharu who is a huge fan of the original Nobunaga Oda, he uses his knowledge from the game he played \"Nobunaga's Ambition\" to assist her by telling her what she needs to do and how she must do it. It gets more interesting as the story goes on where you learn more about Nobuna, alliances are made and as other characters are introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe only plot hole that I've encountered so far is how Sagara was able to time travel back in time and how all the major samarai's turned into girls. However its an anime, so there's no point nitpicking on these small points when its purely fiction and doesn't really need to be explained.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about this, the characters are nicely drawn  and the vibrant colours and costumes suit the characters really well, its based on clothes of the Sengoku period but its been altered and changed slightly to suit the characters wearing them, which is a good point about this anime because it gives off a unique feeling to them. The action scenes and fighting aren't too shabby either and are nicely animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is fine and suits the anime, the voice acting is also done pretty well, the characters that have a mature voice aren't too husky and the characters that have a sweet and childish voice aren't too high pitched and loli-like. The voice acting in serious situations are done well and doesn't feel forced and the same can be said for the comical situations where there is a bit of comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nYes the characters are a bit clich\u00e9d but they don't act as if they are in a clich\u00e9 harem anime, instead of the girls falling for the male lead like they should, they have no respect for him and call him a monkey (\"saru\") which is taken from his name *S*agara Yoshih*aru*.\\n\\n\r\nThe main Heroine Nobuna is a tsundere character but isn't an annoying kind of tsundere, more of a cute and pleasant tsundere unlike all the usual clich\u00e9d bitchy tsunderes. She can also handle herself just fine, she isn't a weak character who relies heavily on the male lead, although Yoshiharu is from the future and knows exactly what Nobuna should do, she makes it pretty clear to him that she doesn't want to be told what to do and can make her own decisions. As time goes by you also start to learn more about her character and more about her ambitions.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what surprised me the most was the main male lead Sagara Yoshiharu, his character is pretty unique, he is a weakling but he isn't weak-willed, even though he acts like a bit of an idiot he helps out using his knowledge and takes command in battle. Although he is a pervert, he isn't overly horny that it ruins his character. He is a sort of pleasant and funny male lead that you can't help but like. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much of a harem aspect in the anime where the female characters fall for Yoshiharu one by one, the only romance that is hinted is between him and Nobuna, unlike the usual overly tsundere female and normal male relationship that occurs frequently in anime, this is one of those rare cases where they are both tsunderes, the best example that i could give you that is similar to this is okabe's and kurisu's (steins gate) love-hate relationship. They both ridicule each other and argue but they actually care for one another but they refuse to admit it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIts very entertaining to watch, the story isn't boring and actually teaches you about Japanese history, Yoshiharu is hilarious and its interesting to see him in action, its also quite funny when he and Nobuna argue, the comedy doesn't ruin the seriousness of the anime and it does well in changing between the comical moments and serious moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't finished the anime but the episodes I have watched have been great and its been getting better and better as the episodes go on. So don't be discouraged to watch this anime just because it looks like another stereotypical anime because this is a good example of how \"you shouldn't judge a book by its cover\".",

            "content": "As many have already said, at first glance this show appears to be just mostly your standard harem rom-com, however I was quite surprised when it turned out to be more of a reverse-harem, especially since most of the cast consist of females.\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\r\nWhile the story itself isn\u2019t really anything amazing, it well managed to keep me interested enough to finish watching the series. Throughout the show we basically deal with the different tasks Oda Nobuna has to do, or rather what tasks she has for the main character, Yoshiharu. It is an \u201chistorical\u201d anime, but since I don\u2019t know much at allabout Japanese history, it\u2019s hard for me to judge how accurate this is, really. However, the fact that Yoshiharu needs to take care not to change too much (as he\u2019s from the future and knows what\u2019s \u201cgoing to happen\u201d) is quite an interesting element to the show, and adds that little extra as he tries to not reveal important bits of information to certain people, or how he takes from his historical knowledge to get out of situations.\\n\r\nThere are however a few major plot holes around, like how Yoshiharu traveled back in time in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it won\u2019t leave you breathtaken, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be bored out of your mind by the story, it\u2019s just that I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything that really makes the story stand out. \\n\r\nAnother major problem is also the fact that there\u2019s never really any real conclusion or anything, and thus this series is in dire need of a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nThe art is overall pretty good, to be honest. It has nice visuals, pretty fluid animations throughout most of the series, and nice-looking backgrounds. While I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a \u201cunique\u201d sort of style to it (thinking something like KyoAni) I also quite liked the character designs. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this brings us to the next point; Fanservice. Now, being a show where a majority of the characters are female, all surrounding this teenage boy then there\u2019s obviously bound to be fanservice. Whether it be Oda\u2019s regular outfit, the occasional fantasy or just overall moe loli characters, fanservice is certainly present throughout the series, however it never really felt like it was overdone or anything (the majority of the fanservice probably appear in the ED, actually). Most of the time they managed to make it somewhat funny, actually, and who doesn\u2019t love the occasional loli? (amirite?)\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nI quite liked the music in this show. The OP, \u201cLink\u201d by Aimi, is a bit more fast-paced or upbeat, which fits rather well with the series overall. It\u2019s not really a slow show in any aspect, and all of it is certainly not lollygagging, so this song with a more \u201caction-y\u201d feel to it is rather appropriate, in my opinion.  The ED, \u201cHikari\u201d by Makino Mizuta, is somewhat slower, and feels like it better captures the \u201cinnocent\u201d (or rom-com, if you\u2019d like) side of the series. \\n\r\nThe background music was good, but again, nothing amazingly outstanding (then again, I\u2019m not one to really pay too much attention to the BGM).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was rather well done, and further added upon the characters, well, characteristics. The voices are fitting for the characters, and some did a pretty great job at bringing out that little extra in their character (the stuttering of the ninja girl, for example).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7 / 10)\\n\r\nBeing the \u201cromantic\u201d (there\u2019s not that much romance, to be honest) comedy, and harem (or well, reverse-harem, rather) that it is, there are some things you won\u2019t really get away from in terms of characters. While the characters are well done, they\u2019re never really fleshed out or developed in any way. There are also quite a few \u201ctypical\u201d characters present, such as the Tsundere, the cute loli, the badass mysterious dude, etc. Thankfully, as I wouldn\u2019t say this is really a story-driven series, it\u2019s not really hurt by the lack of character development either. However, it is still important to note that this is a thing in the series, and since once again a lot of the characters are female you might see a bit too many \u201cstereotypical\u201d characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nI quite liked the show. The story is decent, it was pretty funny, and most of the characters are rather likeable, but it wasn\u2019t really anything more than that. A big problem is ofcourse also the fact that there\u2019s no conclusion at all to the story, and we\u2019ve yet to hear anything about a second season.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of harems (or reverse-harems in this case) or just want a rom-com with a slightly less \u201ctypical\u201d story, then this might be for you, however I\u2019d avoid it if you\u2019re in dire need of having closure.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Decent, interesting story.\\n\r\n+ Pretty funny overall.\\n\r\n+ Music was good.\\n\r\n+ Great visuals.\\n\r\n+ Likeable characters.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- \u201cStereotypical\u201d characters.\\n\r\n- No closure to story (needs a second season)\\n\r\n- Plot holes\\n\r\n- Doesn\u2019t really excel in any category (in my opinion)",

            "content": "Unlike the other review, I'm just going to start off with why I graded them ( ).\r\nStory 9/10\r\nMain Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobunaga ' Monkey ' or  ' Saru '. No, I'm sorry. Main Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobuna ' Monkey ' or  ' Saru '. This anime is a historical, romantic and comedy with a large change of physical looks from the normal history (Gender swap). Plot twists are quite unpredictable. Main Female Lead, Oda Nobuna, is a blonde. I repeat. A blonde. I was quite surprised considering Oda Nobunaga had blackhair. The story follows the history that we know with slight changes which was made when Monkey (Sagara Yoshiharu) time-traveled there. The story's pacing was good. Nothing was rushed. Ending was okay. Although the romance tag was unanswered that much and the girl in the end, it was fine. At least they finished the main part, the Historical tag. Comedy in this anime was as fine as any other anime. Although it didn't make me roll on the floor, it was fine. The story was appealing and drew me in. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen Sagara Yoshiharu was named ' Monkey ', it was no joke. The illustrators made him look exactly like a Monkey when it was needed. His hair style kind of looked like a Monkey's. Emotions drawn by the illustrators were conveyed well to us viewers. You could clearly see what the characters were feeling. The personalities were matched the best for Monkey. The rest of the characters I would say that it was great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's voice was matched to the character until the point that you could say that the voice itself belonged to the character itself. Sound effects of the action scenes, the monkey's monkey voice, everything suited it. The opening of the anime was relatively catchy which makes you want to hear it over and over again. Once you get a hold of it, that is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the characters were great! I loved it. The characters were all well developed. They made an emotional attachment between the viewer and them. The physical looks of the new Oda Nobunaga were great. A few characters lost their show time at the next part of the anime. The number of supporting characters? A variety. Not too flat, the number was perfect. The villain's background was not clearly shown. Although it was clear that he had an ulterior motive. I loved all of the characters equally. Except for the villain since I was quite stupid and could not exactly comprehend what he was thinking and can barely remember what he said in the last episode. Look on the bright side, no spoilers! Overall, the characters appealed much to me, the viewer. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOh, come on. There is nothing to doubt about this. I enjoyed it so much I was standing on my toes. The romance, what would happen next? When I thought that something bad was going to happen, it just decided to change for the viewer. Great, awesome anime. Definitely one which can make you hit that button which leads  you to the next episode. I could barely pause watching it. \\n\r\nIt was more like -\\n\\n\r\n\"Kiss  already. Quickly, kiss. Faster plox.\"  or just talking to the person in the screen. Obviously I know that I would never get a reply. -cries-\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was one that could be remembered by its viewers as one of the best types of anime which included the Historical tag.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the other sections, amazing. The anime just sucked you in like a whirlpool.",

            "content": "Just  a little note before I start, this is my first review and I was compelled to write this because I truly enjoyed this anime.\r\nSo, Oda Nobuna no Yabou, first glance, you'd think \"Oh usual guy meets girl after girl until a harem is made\", well sorry to burst your bubble, but there's more to this anime than it looks.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n Okay, so maybe some people don't enjoy this, but personally I like the concept. Time travelling guys arrives at an alternate past where all the \"Leaders\" are girls, could have been better, but it's not overused. Usual progression for the story, girl meetsguy, they fall in \"love\" and it builds up from there, and I mean both their feelings and his harem.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: Not going to win any massive awards for the story, but definitely deserves an 8 for it's creativity.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n Compared to other animes, I'd say the artwork in Oda Nobuna is pretty GOOD, not as good as something like Hagure Yuusha no Estetica (Personal Preference, replace with some other title) but it's definitely nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: Not the best, but still amazing\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n The opening of Oda Nobuna is worth listening to, and that's coming from a person who skips most intros after hearing it once, it really fits the anime. Now, the sound effects etc. as you'd expect from an anime with sword fighting and the like is pretty good. I think you'd be able to immerse yourself in the sounds of the ongoing battle while listening to a few mc's chatting pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: Amazing sound effects, great voice actors and a good intro, deserving of a 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n Some of you may argue, but I felt that the way the characters acted and are portrayed fits the time line of the show. They're proper \"ladies\", they get embarrassed when they're supposed to, trust each other more after some experience, and doubt each other when it's proper to do so. I'd rather not go into detail of the characters themselves, so I'll say this: The wide array of characters provides various choices favor. (Personal favorite is Goemon)\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: The characters act correctly according to the happenings, there are no weird attitude changes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n Okay so, it may not average to a 10, but I enjoyed it so what the hell, give it a 10. I loved the concept, the characters and the harem development (compared to other harems), I enjoyed watching the battles and how each character played an integral part in their victory.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short: WATCH THE SHOW DAMMIT\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n Worth the watch, worth the time, I won't ignore the fact that some people might not like this anime, but if you're fine with a few not-so-funny jokes, or getting angry at how disgusting a person looks (it was obviously on purpose) then get your ass off that chair and give Oda Nobuna no Yabou a try!",

Their notable products such as Death Note, One Punch Man, and Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (to name a few) are psychologically intense. While, on the other side, less intense shows such as Ore Monogatari!!, Nana and Chobits give a different sense of ambient. Oda Nobuna no Yabou belongs to the latter.\r\nYou might be surprised how this simple show's capability of enticing you - wishing for more. The edge of the show is on its historical stories that compel the content onto the audience whilst paired with Madhouse absorptive capacity to transfer their heritage knowledgeof past works into the making of this anime. With their past experiences and capable technologies, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is produced. While it's debatable, any supposedly decent work with a stamp from Madhouse studio will be escalated into above average. Whether it may or not be for this case, it's up to how the individual interprets it.",

Let me just get one thing out of the way:  This is NOT one of them (at least imo.)The historical setting does little to mask the flaws of this anime.\r\nSTORY 6/10\r\n-This isn't a strong point of the series, as many would claim.\r\n- Linear and boring plot \r\n- Uninteresting developments. Battles are vague and don't make sense. How on Earth is Nobuna a Samurai Lord?!\r\nART 8/10\r\n- Character designs are very good.\r\n- Scenery and backgrounds are nice to look at.\r\nSOUND 7/10\r\n- Fairly niceOP and ED that set the tone well for the series.\\n\r\n- Voice acting is very good and suits the characters very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 6/10\\n\r\n-I suppose that this series gets praise because all the girls don't lust after the male lead as one might expect looking at this title. Nor is he some generic, pervy loser.\\n\r\n-The main female lead is a tsundere, but surprisingly this doesn't result in her being a generic one dimensional character. She is portrayed as (for the most part) a strong female character, much like the other girls in the series.\\n\r\n-The development of the characters was lacking and once a couple of episodes go by, they quickly became uninteresting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter development and plot was unsatisfactory. \\n\r\nThe humor which is one of the primary reasons people may watch this is this is also boring. Despite what I said earlier, I think it would have been better if Yoshiharu (the male lead) was a complete perv\\n\r\nbecause there really was no other source of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nFans of the harem genre will enjoy this. Those of you who don't usually watch this genre of anime and come into this expecting a good series will probably be left disappointed past the first few episodes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oda Nobuna No Yabou is a rather exciting new anime for me. \r\nWhat i like about it so far is they took a old idea and gave it a fresh twist. Standard time shift backwards but the twist is when you meet all the greatest male figures in Japanese history, they are girls. The whole concept seems somewhat cheesy but they actually do this well.\r\nThey keep the strong character types while somehow making them a little cute. Character designs a i found interesting, when i look at Nobunas standard clothing it just seems so unique for anime. The colors of Gold/Black as always compliment eachother but they gave her such a unique clothing choice that i think was just very imaginative.It may be based off of a standard historical style but it looks unique how they have altered it just a bit.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the art and sound i give a solid 7, art is fairly standard but the sound effects and voice acting is tops. I think they did a fairly great job casting voice actors for this show. Some stronger than others while others being slightly more sweet and childish giving the show a nice balance.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing i loved most about this show is that they actually use the fact the main character knows whats going to happen in history effectively. I mean they don't leave that big open plot hole in this show. A lot of similar story lines complete neglect facts like they should know or even could know. This show really embraces the whole reality of the situation and uses it effectively as a story mechanic.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching this show, its exciting and it actually teaches you a bit about Japanese historical moments and people. I also like how the beginning they skip the cliched 2 part introduction to the gimmick. They just drop you right into the middle of the action without really feeding you 10 minutes of pre time travel setting/dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nI think anyone who gives this a good 2 episode watch is gonna watch more, its funny and the plot is solid. The characters are very likable and the show is just well done all around. Solid 9, this is a Great anime.",

Of course the main character would need a lead to be able to be the chosen one and the helpful monkey which is from the future helps nobuna conquer japan.\r\nStory-9/10\r\nNot exactly original. You gain allies and keep on conquering and make mistakes. The only twists are the fact that there is a \"monkey\" trying to win women ( his harem of friends haha), the fact that all the key historic figures and cute little girls andthe fact that Sagara, our monkey, knows the future and the past but not with all the new twists.\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nIt's absolutely stellar. Except for the people who are meant to be disgusting but other than them I love nearly every character design and the surroundings. It is what 2012 art should be like.\\n\r\nSound-9/10\\n\r\nThe opening song really fits with the type of genre this is ( conquer japan) and I love the ending song.\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\nThere are not many \"steriotypical\" characters. Everyone is quite fun and a bit different and all have their own reasons for fighting. the characters with notable personalities would be Sagara (monkey) who is fun and trying to get the most beautiful women in Japan and help Oda Nobuna conquer Japan. There is also Nobuna who has to prevent herself from being overcome by crazyness, anger or greed like many other rulers.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI loved every single episode. It was full of fun and did not have a single dull moment. I wouldn't exactly say this is great for rewatchability but its a fun filled ride as long as you don't know the rythm.\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nA great story. Fun, exciting and a great story. It's basically a codegeass but without a badass main and the make you think aspect. You should watch it or at least give it a try. Some reasons I've heard that made the story awful would be \"it's a harem\" or \"it looks like it has no plot\". Yes, it is a harem. However there is one girl that stands out and the rest are basically just friends so there is progress. And I assure you, the plot is quite nice for it's genre. It would be a 10/10 if only it were a bit longer but the 12 episodes I watched were spectacular.",

            "content": "There is something that needs to be said about this show before this review proceeds. This is that this show can be a beautiful and interesting/different presentation with exciting fan service (No, not just tits and panty shots) of the Sengoku world to another typical harem/hijinks show. The first will probably be the opinion of people who have studied the Warring States period of Japan, played related video games of them such as Nobunaga's Ambition and Samurai Warriors, and is generally a fan of the numerous Sengoku shows out there. The latter will of course be someone who has no knowledge in this area. WhileI try to be objective in a sense, I can't help but come reviewing this show as the former simply because it was created for these type of people and does it extremely well. I am of course in no way putting myself as superior to anyone; I simply want people to understand the show may one viewer squeal in delight while another passes up any enjoyment because of circumstances. It's a show like Carnival Phantasm and Type-Moon in this way.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, the show presents a number of fan service that can only be appreciated by the Sengoku, Three Kingdom fans. From the events of Nobunaga's meeting with Saito Dousan and rifle lighting, to the glorious Okehazama, and to the Zhuge Liang reference of Hanbei, the show throws a number of fan service and interesting references that may go unappreciated by a viewer that has no knowledge of these events and history. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot progresses from the beginning of Nobuna (Nobunaga) as the fool of Owari and her gradual rise to power with the help of someone from the future who has distinct knowledge of the era. Because it mainly goes through her campaigns, it should be noted once again that enjoyment and interest stems from knowledge of some of these campaigns and to see how they will turn out. Yes, while the story tries to stay true to the main events of history, there are enough little events and subversions that allow the viewer feel anxious on what will happen next. An obvious flaw is the blatant ignoring of how the main character ended up in the Sengoku era. This however helps to alleviate the usually sidetracking of the main story in typical time travel/other dimension travel stories where excess time is spent on trying to get back home. It is somewhat refreshing to see this ignored for a change and see the focus on what is at hand.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, people who watched Highschool DxD may recognize Miyama-Zero and his distinct drawing style. It probably goes without saying that the art is wonderfully done if you take a few minutes to watch the show or see Zero's artwork. The production values are high up there, not ufotable status of course but you can definitely see the effort the animators have put in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs an Aimi (Ben-to OP) fan, I instantly fell in love with the opening song to the show. She is one of the more underrated stars out there and I definitely urge people to try and check some of her songs out. But to not digress, the soundtrack of Oda Nobuna is superb as well. It does a fine job of setting the mood and evoking the feelings from the situation at hand. From the wacky song that plays throughout the comedy scenes, to the touching melodies during the drama, and to the war-like drum fashion when the troops are preparing to go to war, each song plays a suitable role.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the greatest compliment I have to give to Oda Nobuna no Yabou is it's characters. The typical thought of someone who first sees this show is the thought that the main character is your generic harem man and the characters are but breasts to fill on TV for the ogling otaku. This is not so.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Sagara Yoshiharu is a refreshing character. He is someone that actually uses his knowledge of the era to the benefit, actively participates in every episode instead of sitting around behind his harem of women, even to the point that he is the reason for Nobuna's success, and is overall competent except for a few comedic moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is mature and you can see the many qualities they have underneath their exterior. Nobuna herself goes through a series of touching and good character development. She, like many of the characters of this show, are subverted in such creative and unique ways that I must bow in respect to the author. It really really helps if you know the typical media representation of these historical figures and want to see something different and twisted in many different ways. They are not just your typical gender-bent shameless body flaunting character, though there is quite a number of skin-ship. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a Sengoku fan, have played KOEI games, and love history in general, then I 100% recommend this show. If otherwise, I still ask for someone to try it out; if not to start learning about the Sengoku period, then for some delicious females, the hilarity, and romance.",

            "content": "Basically, this story is about our main character going back in time to feudal japan. Immediately he gets caught in the middle of a battle. From what I've concluded after watching the first episode, him being there causes the death of a key person of in japanese history, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a key retainer of Oda Nobunaga. \r\nIt's up to Sagara (main character) to take his place and assist Nobunaga or rather Nobuna and take Hideyoshi's place. \r\nI love history and this show seems like a good way to learn about the unification of Japan. It gives off sort of a Axis Powers Hetalia feel toit where the show teaches a bit of history to the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nI find it amusing how the producers turn famous deadly warriors into girls. When i saw Goemon's character in this show, i couldn't take this show seriously anymore. Then again i can't say that i don't like the idea of them turning them all into girls. I mean seriously? Who doesn't like watching anime girls with swords and spears, etc beating the crap out of faceless unimportant characters. \\n\\n\r\nI laughed a couple of times during this show. For instance, the girls don't even address him by his name. Instead, they call him Saru (Monkey). For the oddest of reasons i felt that this show had the same sort of comedy feel as Highschool Dxd for all of you who have seen it. Not the ecchi comedy part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for it being a harem show, its not one of those dirty ecchi shows. i'd have to say it's probably a 2 or 3 on a scale of 10 on ecchiness. There are a lot of loli's though...i already counted like 4. The main character's a typical harem character. He's sort of a loser but in his own strange way he's very powerful. Like in almost any anime, you will find anime stereotypes in this show. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally i hope this show goes where i think it's going. All the girls in the show seem to disrespect him and think he's disgusting but i can see him turning that all around. Sort of like in Love Hina. Last, hopefully this show becomes like one of those shonen mangas and takes the main character and turns him into a really cool, bad ass character. Until then, i will be following this show until the end.",

            "content": "When I read the synopsis without thinking much, the first thing that came to my mind was that all the characters in the anime, except for the protagonist, were females. I was wrong.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nA story based on Japanese History, which actually entertained me and educated me a bit, mainly because I have Japanese classes. It wasn't boring, it didn't drag out that much and if it did, it would be fan-service/some comedy skit added into that. If I were to give a score on originality about the type of story being used in the anime, I'd give it a 9 but if I based iton how much it entertained me, I'd give it a solid 4 but the only thing that saved it was they made it different by putting the protagonist to be someone from the future, having the 'ability' (not sure if I could call it an ability) to see the future. The type of male protagonist that come from the future/different worlds and want to save the current world always make the anime better, personally. It had a lot of action, mainly sword fighting and a little bit of magic I suppose. There's harem and romance, but the harem slowly develops throughout the anime, which doesn't bother me but as a guy who has watched a lot of harem/romance anime, it was very predictable on who's going to fall in love with the protagonist. It was somewhat funny, mainly using perverted jokes which are alright, but if overused and repetitive, can get really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if it's just me, but the art style gave a history-ish vibe. Other than that, the colors and nice and bright, animations are smooth and is very easy to catch the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST fit scenes nicely and used necessary, not overused and isn't too loud. The OP fit the theme of the anime, giving that 'army' vibe (I'm probably stoned) and the ED fits the romance side of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSagara Yoshiharu, the protagonist who comes from the future (circa 400 years). He's very obsessed with history games, mainly with the Shogunate eras and all those. He's very talented, in his own ways because he remembers a whole period of time from the past and uses it to his knowledge to try to save characters from dying. A very kind but perverted person.\\n\\n\r\nOda Nobuna, a very cheerful girl who dresses very minimal. She's a tsundere (not a flat one!!) and cares a lot for the people she loves. She's not that smart, mainly because she is easy to trap. Without Sagara her nation would've died. Kind-hearted and caring (mostly to Sagara ;))\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was a new experience for me, as not only did it entertain me, but it actually educated me. Yes there's fan-service and a lot of 'loli' characters, but hey the action was quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a second season out there, I'd watch it. I really liked the idea of this anime. If you like protagonist who comes from a different world/future and wants to save the current world he is in, then Zero no Tsukaima is for you. If you like history but not very educational, then Hyakka Ryouran might suit you. Would I re-watch this? Definitely.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oda Nobuna no Yabou appears like a fairly simplistic reverse gender harem/romance and comedy set in the Sengoku Era  at first glance, but there's actually more to the plot than meets the eye... \r\nThe story revolves around a 17 years old young man named Sagara Yoshiharu, who is sent to an alternate version of the Sengoku Era without currently providing any explanation of how he achieved such a feat.\r\nHowever, not is all as it seems...\r\nSagara quickly realizes that the fearsome Oda Nobunaga has been replaced by a girl named Oda Nobuna in this continuity and that other historical figures such as Shibata Katsuie andNiwa Nagahide have also undergone an inexplicable shift in gender.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of these historical inconsistencies, he is mistreated and/or not taken seriously within the Oda clan and has to earn the trust and respect of his own companions and the fiery Nobuna and maybe find love...\\n\\n\r\nNote: All following statements explaining my scores are but mere opinion. Also, I have only watched two episodes as of now so my opinion on the series may change along the way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI think the main appeal of the story is the potential it holds when it comes to changing historical facts as current episodes show Sagara actively trying to alter the course of history as he knows it so that Nobuna doesn't become like Nobunaga and leaves one to wonder what will happen to the roles of Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Tokugawa Iyeasu if she remains alive unlike her historical counterpart or just how far will Sagara's knowledge of the future will get him before he gets a prediction wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good aspect of the story is how the comedy aspect of the show does not overlap on the serious aspect of the story like say...Nyarko-san where there was virtually no boundary between the two.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from Madhouse Studios, the art is just fine, the ecchiness is mild and not too overbearing. There isn't anything wrong with the animation in general at first glance though I did not make a thorough investigation (as in frame by frame) like I usually do.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I would have is against the ending sequence, did they really have to put so much ecchi shots cause it's literally made of them! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and voices are fine as well, the background music and sound effects reflects the mood of the scenes and aren't squeaky or unbearable and the voices are pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is well fleshed out and don't feel like you're talking to a random background character. Here's a short list:\\n\\n\r\nSagara: A harem hero who has 'balls', that's all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nNobuna: The Tsundere who is quite reckless and her inability to say what she wants honestly is a flaw can make her as dangerous as Nobunaga himself if no one is there to voice their opposition. \\n\\n\r\nKatsuie: The big chested girl who is serious most of the time and gets embarrassed quite easily, follows the 'knight' archetype.\\n\\n\r\nNiwa: The 'ojou' type-2 (TvTropes) girl who acts cool and mature and likes to rate people and their actions.\\n\\n\r\nGoemon: The loli girl who has difficulty speaking coherently as her speech drags on and is actually pretty skilled as a ninja, which may hint to having been trained so hard she didn't get a proper education.\\n\\n\r\n(There are obviously more, I'm just naming the 'main' ones)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOver all, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is a really unique 'harem'/comedy anime that has a hidden flavor for any Japanese history maniacs if on is willing to look past all the 'anime' aspect of the show and can be very enjoyable.",

            "content": "The anime is about Sagara Yoshiharu, who travels back into the Sengoku era where feudal lords fight among each other to expand their territory and to inch their way into conquering Japan. The anime opens with our main, Sagara, trapped in a battle field. He meets the leader of the Oda clan, Oda Nobunaga. No, wait. He is shocked to discover that the man who unified Japan is actually a young tsundere blonde. She\u2019s not Oda Nobunaga; she is Oda Nobuna. Sagara then decides to serve under Oda Nobuna and using his knowledge of playing video games about his conquest, he has proved to bea valuable weapon for Oda. He helps her correct wrongs that happened in history and to predict the events to give Oda the advantage. He also vowed to make sure she\u2019s alive after she conquered Japan. It\u2019s not an easy task when the rest of the feudal lords are out to make sure she doesn\u2019t succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has been the biggest surprise of the season so far because I didn\u2019t even knew this anime existed until a couple of days ago. I certainly didn\u2019t expect it to be so damn good. I saw the title and I sighed a bit because I expect another anime like Brave Ten that uses the feudal era as a setting and basically doing something subpar with it. The anime has all the elements to fail miserably yet it turns out to be very amazing. I always believe that clich\u00e9 isn\u2019t a bad thing and it all depends on how you use it. This anime has a harem with all the generic fixings but it was able to properly use the elements to make one remarkable story. Also, it\u2019s a light novel anime. I love anime adapted from light novels because they have more emphasis on story than any other medium. Oda Nobuna no Yabou is one of the best anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime proves to be a bit ridiculous when you see the first episode. I actually find it hard to believe that they made a show where Oda Nobunaga is a tsundere. It boggles the mind and I was sure this premise wouldn\u2019t last. They might replace it with pointless fan service or build a harem or something. All the elements are there for the anime to drop the premise. We have a bunch of girls and one guy, the generic casts of a harem is here: the tsundere, the big breasted one, the silent one and the loud one. They just needed to align themselves and I was preparing for the worst. It didn\u2019t happen though. The anime didn\u2019t disintegrate into a senseless Ecchi or Harem anime. I was relieved to know that. It couldn\u2019t become a pointless Ecchi show mainly because the anime has a pretty impressive story to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle in this anime is accepting the fact that the heroes of Japan are replaced with girls. Oda Nobuna is a freakin tsundere. If you can follow that fact then you can enjoy the anime. It started pretty interesting actually. The first episode started with a battle and the plot was laid out pretty nicely afterwards. The idea of having a guy from the future telling Oda of all the things she did wrong is pretty sweet. It\u2019s like going to the movies with a guy who already seen it. He spoils the story and Oda is able to capitalize from it. The rewriting of history and the characters turning into cute girls is among the charm of the anime. The plot of the anime is very serious despite the ridiculous elements of the anime and it\u2019s the reason why the anime was able to straighten out right away. The first half has some very powerful episodes that will easily grab you.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about a part of history of Japan though but it never got in the way. I recognize most of the characters because I played a lot of Orochi games on the PS2 and that\u2019s as far as I know regarding the Sengoku era. The anime often has time to have a narrator introduce the characters so they can easily slide themselves into the story. After the introduction, the anime proceeds in building the story. There are a lot of dialogues in the anime but it was used to establish certain situations in the anime. The anime is like watching a game of chess and you eagerly wait for the moment where a player shows the trick up his sleeve. There are a lot of moments in the anime that is really impressive. One example is declaring that building a fort in the field would prove impossible because it\u2019s near a feudal lord\u2019s territory and he will do his best to make sure the fort won\u2019t be built. The anime uses certain situations like this and have Sagara or Oda have their moment of brilliance and attempt the impossible. Once you get used to the pattern, it\u2019s not long before you wait for the next big hurdle to come and the moment of brilliance the characters will do to overcome the problem.\\n\r\nThe characters are certainly the strongest point of the anime. They are a bit generic but they have the perfect personality to make the story interesting. The cute little girls being involved in feudal wars are really interesting because the anime did a great job presenting it. Of course, the idea of a stuttering ninja who looks about 9 years old is a bit of hard pill to swallow but when the story moves along its climactic moment, all the characters  was able to bring their own charm to the scene. There are a lot of characters and none of them look alike. They all have a certain role to the story with their unique personality. There is no shortage of interesting characters here from both the good guys and the bad guys. They certainly make the story a lot more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOda Nobuna is pretty rounded herself. She is considered as a military genius capable of doing the impossible but most of the time she is just a little brat. I really love how most of the times, she is the problem and her weak hearted nature adds some needed tension in the anime. It does wear off pretty quickly because the anime relies far too much on her weak personality but it deepens the story and makes it more exciting. One moment she is this girl with a nasty personality trying to rule the country then the next moment she is a docile little kitten that needs the other characters to comfort her out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sagara, well, he\u2019s a pretty normal guy. He is the generic type of main character that just flows along with the story. If the scene calls for him to be an idiot then he becomes an idiot. If the scene needs him to be hero then he\u2019ll rise to the occasion. If the story needs him to be \u201ccool guy\u201d the girls will fall in love with then he becomes that guy. I guess it\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s a flexible main character but he doesn\u2019t have enough personality to stand on his own. It\u2019s not a bad thing though because other supporting characters get some screen time thanks to his lack of a decent personality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some hints of fan service in the anime but it was never a main focus. The story did point out that Sagara is a pervert but there aren\u2019t any panty shots and there was only one moment of boob grabbing. It\u2019s pretty alright because some of the characters are a bit under aged and it\u2019d be pretty awful to sit through another Ro Kyu Bu type of anime (which gets another season and some more pedo fan service). There is also a slight hint of romance to tie the entire anime together. Sagara and Oda\u2019s relationship is one of driving plot points of the anime and it\u2019s often of the elements that cause a lot of tension in the anime. One moment they\u2019re buddy buddy then when push comes to shove, they\u2019re fighting.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does have some downsides to it. The biggest hurdle is accepting the cute characters as competent warriors battling adult sized soldiers and what not. The story easily covers that up. The anime never explained Sagara going back to the past though and it does bug me at first. He just suddenly showed up and no mention of black holes or time machines to explain his time travel. The anime obviously didn\u2019t want you to question it because the plot was pretty good that it didn\u2019t matter how he got there. The one complaint I have about the anime though is that the anime slowly pushed Sagara into the background. In the first half, he was very pivotal in the fights because of his knowledge about playing video games. As the anime progresses, this knowledge was no longer used and some of the moments of the second half would\u2019ve been more awesome if the anime had Sagara spoil the fights. It\u2019s a minor complain though and the anime didn\u2019t crumble from the lack of Sagara\u2019s knowledge.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing in the second half did become a bit fast and certain events had little effect to me because the anime rushed in getting there. There was no climactic build up in the second half and it was a shame that they couldn\u2019t make the final moments of the anime more awesome. It ended pretty anticlimactically and it\u2019s a shame. It did tease a second season and I seriously want another run at this awesome anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character, the anime did a heck of a good job at it. There is a huge range of character design here from the cute kin of character up to the grown up old type adult character. One thing I love about this anime is that no character looks alike. They are all extremely detailed using the attire of the era to their advantage and putting a spin on it. There is a stuttering ninja with a pink skull hairclip, a little girl with a spear and a tiger hood and even a girl with a cute dragon emblem on her head. The characters are the best part of the anime and it\u2019s their diverse look that makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also one of the anime\u2019s best parts. The fight scenes are a bit too short but they still have an air of awesomeness to them that makes them fun to watch. The use of CG in some scenes is nicely done because it doesn\u2019t look stiff. The way the camera changes angles is also one of the reasons why the fight scenes are some awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are pretty straight forward and there isn\u2019t a lot of technicality in them. The anime uses it as a way to move the story along and it\u2019s often not the climax of the anime. It often leads to the climax but the battles where never once the main attention of the anime. The moment of brilliance among the characters is like building a fort overnight. That being said though, the fight scenes are still pretty nice. The capture the feel of a real war and there are enough effects to give us the impression of a massive battle. There is no blood though. I would\u2019ve preferred at least some blood out of slashed necks but the anime often cut away before any blood would gush out or they would be off screen. Let\u2019s focus on the moe characters instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s OP is \u201cLink\u201d by Aimi. This really captures the anime\u2019s theme and it nicely reflects the relationship of the two main characters. The anime\u2019s opening sequence is pretty awesome as well. It introduced all the characters without spoiling the story and overwhelming the viewers. I also love the scene of the horses meeting each other for a battle. You can clearly see the awesomeness of the anime and the high production value of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED song is \u201cHikari\u201d by Makino Mizuta. It\u2019s a slow song with a romantic theme to it. It has a meloow vibe to it compared to the rough nature of the anime. The ED sequence is has a bigger fan service than the overall series with all the girls naked and draped with a sheet. It\u2019s pretty nice, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a really good anime and it\u2019s too good to miss. The plot, the characters and the action all makes for one awesome anime experience. Try to enjoy the moe girls fighting in the Sengoku era because the anime is really great. I highly recommend it.",

Also you cannot help but acknowledge the way the oda military makes every battle as strategic as possible. It is a typical history set series that is changed completely by one element: a time traveler. All this makes you ask yourself... What happens if?\r\nThe anime has done great about Artwork, characters are drawn very well, unlike some other drawings that make you go sick.\r\nAlso the OST are very well made fromthe opening song all the way through the episodes until the end with some minor letdowns.\\n\r\nYou should watch Oda Nobuna no yabou if you enjoy a good soap opera",

Most of the characters are typical harem type characters and the anime is laced with comedy and romance.\r\nSo there you have it.\r\nNot quite. Its the historical time frame that separates it from your usual harem comedy. The story is very loosely based on the life of Oda Nobunga, the hero of Japan's Sengoku period, through the eyes of Sagara Yoshiharu a 17 year old boy from the future who replaces Toyatomi Hideyoshi, and includes most ofthe key characters of the period except in this version Oda Nobunga is actually called Oda Nobuna who is a teenage girl as are the rest of the main characters in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result we have an anime which is a lot of fun likable characters and lots battle and action scenes which are based on real events in Oda Nobunga's life with some very good artwork.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend swatting up on Japan's Sengoku period and Oda Nobunga's life a little to get the most out the anime as it will help to understand the plot.",

You will enjoy the anime and studying about japanese history,interesting isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\nThe story involves about Sagaru,  a highschool guy which is unknownly stranded into the era of Oda Nobunaga where ALL the major samurai was a cute girls. and he promises to Oda Nobuna (Not Nobunaga) that he will helps her to achieve her dream to unite japan. as far as go, the story really interest me, since its rare to see some harem anime (well, i always thought this anime is a harem), which have a strong plot and nice development between the two main lead. and love that happen (harem typical) wasn't exaggerating , they (the girls) didnt express their feelings in any weird way, and later, the twist in nearly the end of the series was really suprising me. \"i never really thought that\" thats what i said.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nI cant said too much on this section, for me as the story was good, i dont really mind about the art. well, for this anime , i thought the art was really nice, especially when the battle and war scenes, it looks realistic.  i really enjoyed it. and for the character, i think they are really well-made, and again not exaggrating in \"Boobs\" section like any other harem anime. thats a good point!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\r\nAgain, i cant said too much on this, but surely the opening song was nice (really nice, even i searching for this song) and really fits with the story and the anime itself, it represent on what will hapen. and the voice actor really did a good job, especially loli girls voice. the voice was so childish and it really fits with the loli character. Not just the loli voice, but the other character voice wasn't really bad too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 7/10\\n\r\ni think this was the weakness for this anime, so many questions in my head about this, like how can that highschool boy can do time travels? is he a john titor? and since the story was focussing on the conquest of Oda Nobuna, i think thats acceptable if the each character didnt get any own story. and more, its just 12 episode. its too hard to expand and explaining for each character. and i think there will be a season 2 for this, and hope they will fill \"the holes\" in the season 1.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nI am really glad i found this anime, i am not just enjoying this anime but in the same time, its feeling like studying japanese history. i am not japanese, but with this anime, i think i am interest in Oda Nobunaga era like i interest in three kingdoms. A totally great anime to watch! \\n",

            "content": "The life story of Oda Nobunaga is definitely one for the history books, and has been used as source material for countless works of literature for centuries, some of which are historically accurate and some of which are not. Oda Nobuna no Yabou would fall into the latter category, but actually not as far into it as first impressions might lead you to believe.\r\nThe premise of having a high-school kid *somehow* travel back in time to the Sengoku era as a replacement for Toyotomi Hideyoshi (a.k.a. Kinoshita T\u014dkichir\u014d) and then having all the famous Samurai lords be cute girls instead makes it seem like nothingmore than yet another silly romantic comedy in an original setting. However, if you\u2019re looking for some sort of stereotypical funny ecchi harem you\u2019re not going to find it here, rather this anime sincerely surprised me with how little fan service it had, and bar the initial premise it turned out to be an extremely good series, even from a purely objective standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nNow obviously there is a fair amount of comedy and non-serious elements in it as well, but that is essentially only due to the twist made with the main characters identities; other than that it follows the actual story of Oda Nobunaga (in this case Nobuna as it\u2019s a pretty blonde girl instead) and his\u2026 uhh her* dream of unifying Japan into a peaceful country, which of course is not something that can be done without military conquest.\\n\\n\r\nI should probably also mention that while it is by no means completely necessary, I would highly recommend that you know at least a little bit about the story of the actual historical events of the Sengoku period if you are going to watch this series, as that is in the end what the entire anime is based on, and all the characters, clans, famous battles and events are essentially all ones that existed/happened in reality. You will be able to relate to the characters especially a lot more if you\u2019re at least somewhat familiar with their actual historical counterparts, and there are a LOT of names to keep track of if you\u2019re completely in the dark heading into this. Also even though there are a few short seconds every once in a while showing a map of who and what is where, it would still be very helpful to be familiar with at least the locations of the various major houses, as well as the names of their respective countries and lords.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said though, that doesn\u2019t mean you will literally know everything that\u2019s going to happen in the anime in case you are very familiar with the actual story, because our resident protagonist and time traveler also happens to be an expert on the Sengoku era, and due to being able to foresee almost every event since he already knows what is going to happen (because of coming from the future from the others\u2019 perspective), not everything goes exactly as history would tell it since his words and knowledge slowly change events compared to the \u2018past\u2019 he knew from his own time. Thus, despite being based on a real story (albeit with some obvious twists in the premise itself), it still manages to be quite unpredictable every so often.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I happened to marathon this series literally the same day that I had earlier finished reading Sengoku Rance which probably increased the enjoyment value quite a lot as well, but that is definitely not a stunt I think anyone is obliged to replicate (although if you feel like it and have the time, be my guest).\\n\\n\r\nOverall this isn\u2019t an anime you should watch if you want a heavily action-filled samurai story, nor should you watch it if you\u2019re looking solely for laughs and fuzzy feelings, but still to a certain extent, Oda Nobuna no Yabou manages to do both those things at once, which I found kind of impressive given the premise and the fact that it\u2019s only a 1-cour series. Speaking of which though, that is probably the only real complaint I have about the anime as a whole, namely: \\n\\n\r\nWhere the hell is season 2??",

All the feels and everything just arrrgh.\r\nThis started kinda meh imo, it was immediately gripping for me at least, always a fan of instant immersion (thrown into action straight away), but the characters seemed shallow and unrelatable. Oh boi oh boi oh boi! That does not stay that way at all. This has some of the best characters from anything ever, almost everyone changes themselves on a fundamental level, becoming better, learning to trust in one another. Allthe character and relationship arcs are so impressively executed!\\n\\n\r\nWhy's the art a 9 instead of a 10? B/c I couldn't get over how stupid the MC's haircut looked, not a fan of that character design. Looked too pathetic. I wonder if it would have been more effective to one-punch-man-style it and give him a palette of faces, some rugged, some round, etc. so that when he means business HE MEANS BUSINESS.\\n\\n\r\nBut art is of minimal importance to me, what matters most is story and how that affects the characters involved. And they nailed that part. The story is gripping and, especially towards the end as they expertly construct this alright climax, edge-of-seat tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in here is also perfect for me, it felt very natural, developing over time, and it's also an expression of freedom in a restrictive historical world. Just works for me dude, but I expect it's something everyone will love.\\n\\n\r\nEverything's an upside, everything is flawless apart from: some asides aren't explored fully/enough (e.g. a couple of the key characters have been influenced by parental figures in their childhood but I don't think it's explored enough how much that really affected them), Sagara isn't given some opportunities to be a badass, which is a bit detrimental to the audience's image of him near the start, but I feel he's redeemed himself near the end, there's not enough foreshadowing/hinting at some \"twists\" that happen. When they do happen, it feels kind of like the writers got to that point and thought \"why not?\"\\n\\n\r\nBut my \"disadvantages\" are really really weak, this honestly was amazing and I feel is very underrated.",

Now, when I first started this show, I was a bit reluctant. There are two ways to go about making a historical anime, let alone one that has romance in there as well. The first is to make it as historically accurate as possible. The result of this of course is potentially boring your viewers to death. The second way is to make a parody of history, in which case you risk offending your viewers. TheAmbition of Oda Nobuna (Oda Nobuna no Yabou) does neither of this. Oda Nobuna is historical romcom that shows what a matriarchal society would have looked like during the Sengoku or Warring period of Japan. Talking from a historical viewpoint, this period is filled with endless killing, long before Japan was unified and the city of Tokyo was named. Oda Nobuna is a a show that neatly incorporates the genres of romance, comedy, and history without boring the watcher to death with its superfluous amount of historical background/content. It tells a story of a world filled with war, and a hero who aspires to bring an end to the bloodshed.

            "content": "Ever heard of the Japanese champion Oda Nobunaga, who united Japan during a time of civil war long before the United States was even a country? No, I\u2019m not referring to him, and neither is this TV series.\r\nThe Ambition of Oda Nobuna (Oda Nobuna no Yabou) is an anime inspired by the manga of the same title by Mikage Kasuga. Dare I say, it\u2019s listed in the historical genre, but truly nothing is historical about it other than all the namesakes of the characters involved are real men who fought in the civil war. Did I say \u201cmen?\u201d I\u2019m sorry. I totally forgot this isOda Nobuna we\u2019re talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place when a teenage boy from the present day gets stuck in an alternate (and past) universe when Japan was in a civil war during what we know of as the 16th century; only this time, both men AND women were allowed to rule as feudal lords and military personnel. In this mess of literally gender-bending history, the boy known only to his fellow comrades as Saru (literally \u201cmonkey\u201d) meets a rather promiscuous Oda Nobuna(ga?), a lower Japanese noble who desires to unite Japan and extend its diplomacy to the coming European nations. Together with her clansmen and retainers, Oda Nobuna and Saru plan to conquer Japan with the least amount of bloodshed while having a typical anime romance sequence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, nothing is terribly wrong with the series, considering it obviously plays to an audience of the typical male otaku who enjoy seeing women playing sexual warrior roles. However, I can\u2019t help but wonder why anyone would decide to write about a gender-bending of a truly historical figure like Oda Nobunaga. That has the same effect as if an American novelist decided to say Abraham Lincoln doubled as a vampire hunter as well as President of the United States (oh wait, that\u2019s already been done). I just hope that fans of this show appreciate that this is totally FICTION and not actually real; and therefore has nothing to do with historical fact.",

I thought it was just another ecchi-harem anime with lots of girls while it wasn't.\r\nWell it actually is one of the most exciting history lesson i've ever taken in my life. I always love history and very interested in Japan history. While you may say it's not very accurate because every characters are girls for some reasons (moe?), it makes this show much easier to watch and we can learn exact what happened in history through the progress of theshow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is creative, the artstyle is amazing. However, the characters of this show are very emotional, and that's the main problem i had, i didnt think this fits the war affair. Beside that, i think this anime is worth your time and it sure help you to kill off the boredom.",

The beginning doesn't really explain how he ended up there in the first place. I assume they were looking to fill people in with later seasons. The other is that he did not get his reward from Nobuna at the end of this season. Everything he went through and she couldn't even give him something so simple. Other than those two issues I found the anime to be fantastic and I really want a second season.But as this anime is from 2012, I doubt it will happen.",

I think the MC was spot on: not too much of a pervert, not too overconfident or doubtfull, and not a simple plot device that spoiled the whole warthing telling the end all the time. Nobuna was a good heroine too, and the tsun traits makes her even better. All the generals, the other female leads or important characters where good too, but at some point there where too many lolis for me. \\n\r\n2) The plot. Even if this was a historical anime, kind of telling real facts and some people might find it boring I found it appealing, I\u00b4m interested on the actual history of that era right now. It had a lot of names, but the anime allowed me to remember all the important ones when I needed them. \\n\r\n3) It\u00b4s not finished. At the end they basically give a glipse at the next \"boss\" and thell you *I wish* \"we\u00b4re making a second season, probably\". I know many animes end up like this, with the posibility of a second season open just in case it turn out to be viable, but I really want this one to get a S2, just like 6-7 other animes out there that really deserve one.\\n\\n\r\nNow some of the flaws/things that I would have liked but where not there. *A little spoiler tag because I\u00b4m going to say some specific stuff* The girl that gave points to every desition. At first I thouhgt that she had something to do with the fact that the MC is basically playing a game, but at the end of S1 nothing changed, and I got used to it, so I\u00b4m not intrigued.\\n\r\nTwo things I want to point out is that, even though all the historical characters are sex inverted might be kinda offensive for some people, I found it entretaining, imagining how\u00b4s the real story with the right sexes was kinda fun. I found this part greatly executed, because the characters still had their strong will, most of it at least. \\n\r\nI was rather unaffected by the continous exposure to Nobuna\u00b4s bra, mainly because many ecchi animes made me invulnerable and because it felt in-character, the free spirit and carelessness of having the robe undone when people of her trust where there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an enjoyable anime, not the best but better that many of them.",

Is he immersed in a Video Game, Or is this something more, I know its a \"Comedy\" and maybe this wasn't something to take too serious, which i respect. Just wonder with that teaser at the end, will their be another series to show this?",

The main characters are generals, leaders, people of importance. They are not citizens who kneel down to a figurehead that is never shown, nor do they need to obey any rules set by another man. The viewers follow the main characters' attempt to conquer and unite Japan. A huge dream shared by many. There are those who want to achieve it together, and those who want to achieve it alone. There are hindrances, eureka moments, betrayals, doubts, trickery and surprises, interestingallies and enemies. Heroes are born and villains arise. The goal is a grand one but the scheme is a simple one. To conquer quickly and coercively through ruthless decisions, or conquer by sharing, love and unite the people; driven by vengeance or friendship?\\n\\n\r\nWe see the generals lead the armies in both bird-eye and close-up views. The viewers are given seats in strategy meetings. We see the map, the route armies take and the obstacles they might face. We also see individual deaths and small victories here and there in front row seats.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the generals are invincible. They fall into traps, they make wrong tactical advances and they let their men die. They regret, they fear for the worst and they sometimes think negatively.\\n\\n\r\nThis time period wasn't chosen randomly out of a hat. The age sits between old Japan and the beginning of Westernisation. Should Japan learn about the rest of the world? Should Japan shield themselves from the West? Or should the generals set out to sea with a pirate flag and conquer shinsekai?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise alone sounds plenty interesting. What makes this series more different is majority of these generals are women and lolis. There are good fanservice but few excessive ones. The women fight like men. They lay their honour on the battlefield and they aren't afraid of death. The action is solid. Supernatural elements and magic, check, but they don't overpower the good old fashioned cavalry with swords, bow men or rifle men.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is from the future. He doesn't bring the internet with him nor anything fancy that would faze every other character in the show. No one is particularly impressed by his arrival and none feel threatened. He didn't make his impact through technology or his pair of trainers. He made his impact through people management and making good use of history lessons. He doesn't follow what was already written in the history books from his time, he allows discretion and take into consideration of people's feelings, what's the right thing to do at the right time. He doesn't dictate, nor throw solutions around in strategy meetings, and his predictions sometimes go wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of personality, he is a determined lad. He is also a pervert. This is a harem show, and this guy gets boners. He has fantasies of his colleagues he works with and he falls in love, unlike school based series where the protagonist has no clue what's going on or doesn't have a penis. Our MC has desires and attempts to fulfil them.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is nothing short of entertaining. The animation quality is Madhouse stunning. The women are sexual and the seiyuu super. It's one of the rare few anime that makes me guilty for awarding a low score. So guilty that I later changed it. Although, the setting and animation is fantastic, there are lots of typical moments in this series. Any said I would personally consider as spoilers. In addition, there are plot holes. First episode is confusing, one of the worst start to any series. But ignore it. To enjoy Oda Nobuna, you must not try to tick boxes or review it episode by episode. Do not emphasise on this time travelling, world transferring protagonist to overshadow the other characters and what the series is truly good at. The fact he is from a different time isn't the highlight of the series at all and the director made sure he isn't overpowered. It is sometimes best to forget he's from the future altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOda Nobuna isn't a mindless, shut down your brain and watch series. It has emotions and you can get lost in the many names of people, castles, territories that do not come with much references. Although most characters have appeared in many other anime personality-wise, to have them in this age period and not act like scared little brats needing samurai to protect them 24/7 is a breath of fresh air. To really enjoy this series, you should aim to marathon it in 2 days. Any slower with underscore its plot holes. Don't watch it to punish the director or yourself, watch it in a forgiving attitude and you'll have a whale of a time!\\n",

However i was definitely wrong , not only does anime have a good story ,it makes you want for more . Those who want learn little more about  Sengoku period are in for a treat . Though music and art are pretty average . The story and characters  make up for it . Especially for those who live outside japan , you can learn something from watching this . On top that the dub of this animeis not bad either .  Although this anime may not be for all.  Those that do like historical periods  will get enjoyment out of it . Over all this was pretty entertaining  anime . And I pray that there a season 2 .",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nHave you ever started watching something with the intent for it to fail? This might sound strange but after having this show recommended to me by so many people I wanted to come here today and just rant on how horrible it was just so I could stick it in their faces and state they were wrong. Unfortunately I ended up liking Oda Nobuna no Yabou a lot more than I wanted even with its various faults.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nUnderstand this if you are interested in watching this anime; this is not a serious action/adventure show. I was lead to believe afterthe first couple minutes that this was going to be a storytelling of how our average Joe was going to help lead Japan to peace. While that is the underlying focal point of the show, this show tries to do exactly what Campione! and High School DxD tried to get away with; being a smart harem. This show is a harem first, historical action drama second. The show feeds off of those awkward fanservice scenes that have been recycled throughout anime\u2019s recent history of garbage. Just to note however that this show does not go as far as either Campione! or High School DxD in terms of its fanservice level; I\u2019m just pissed that this aspect really ruined what could have been a great story. The story starts out with our main protagonist Yoshiharu somehow being sent into the past during one of Japan\u2019s civil war struggles. It just so happens that our \u201chero\u201d is a historical game nut that knows this time period very well. He then uses his knowledge to take Hideyoshi Toyotomi\u2019s (apparently someone really important that ends up dying in the first minutes) place in history to help Nobuna Oda (the head of a noble family and ruler of a part of Japan) unify Japan and end the civil war. The events that take place in the anime are actually pretty interesting to watch unfold because the more Yoshiharu helps Nobuna the more the past begins to change.  He must then learn what has really happed compared to what he remembers from his games. There is also some slapstick comedy thrown in here and there making it pretty funny in some cases. Overall the anime is quite interesting to watch it\u2019s just unfortunate that the fanservice scenes really ruined the overall mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\nI was able to watch a blu ray copy of this show (I promise I\u2019ll buy it\u2026eventually) and I have to say that even though it looks great I feel as if Studio Gokumi and MADHOUSE could have done a better job. Compared to other 2012 anime (K, Fate/Zero 2, Nisemonogatari, ext) it falls a little short of what I have come to expect especially from MADHOUSE (not sure how involved they were in making this anime). All the characters, backgrounds, and textures are well defined and have great lighting but there just isn\u2019t anything that makes this show stand out of the crowd. The anime did however do a fantastic job with keeping the heavy action scenes free from any artifacting or loss of quality. Overall a great looking anime but expected more from these two studios.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of K, this past year of anime has really not progressed very far in terms of using sound as a way of enhancing the overall experience. Some people do not realize how much a perfect score/soundtrack can make even the worst show redeemable. This show does exactly what every other harem anime has done before it; just throw some generic sounding music in with the dialogue and action scenes and as long as the anime looks good it will work. Well it doesn\u2019t. In fact some of the music really distracted me from enjoying the show. It sounded like accurate music for the time period of the show but overall it wasn\u2019t done very well. The only reason I am giving the sound category anything above a 4 is because the voice actors did do a pretty good job. Each character\u2019s emotions are amplified by their respective voice actor\u2019s performance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Oda Nobuna no Yabou actually do a pretty good job of providing some interesting moments throughout the entire anime. The relationship between Nobuna and Yoshiharu seems to escalate a little too quickly but this in the end helps provide some funny scenes with all the misunderstandings Yoshiharu gets into. The other main characters of the anime are pretty interesting and help make this war drama work even if every serious moment it ruined by Yoshiharu quest to have the most beautiful women in Japan. Now that I think about it even though Yoshiharu is a perv in most cases, he is actually a breath of fresh air compared to other harem leads. He is somewhat intelligent, caring, and bold. The fact that he is a more dominant male lead is a welcome compared to the generic no balls male lead we usually get in harems. Overall the characters help make the show more interesting but like I said earlier on I really think this show could have been one hundred times better if they just took the fanservice out and kept it an action/adventure with some comedy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.6/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though I ended up ranting on about the fanservice ruining the overall experience of the show, I did end up enjoying it. Heck I even rated it 4/5 stars on my profile because although the unnecessary stuff does hinder the series, the characters and plot helped make it an enjoyable experience. I do not hate fanservice if it is in say a romantic comedy placed in the present and maybe in a high school setting but when you try to mix it with a war drama it doesn\u2019t always work out the same way. I wanted to hate this show just so I could say \u201cHey guess what, it sucks!\u201d but I cannot tell a lie; this is an enjoyable show. Far from perfect but by no means unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "I loved the extremely fast pacing of the story. It's easy to just fly through the episodes forgetting about how much time passed. That in itself makes this excellent. What's fun about it is that it's all made according to actual historical events, so you also learn history while watching it... that is, if you don't care about genders of people or any inconsistencies with the actual history, introduced here by our protagonist from the future. It's interesting how protagonist's original life or the way he came to the past is never addressed, because it's not point of the story. This kind of fast pacingand moving the story forward doesn't allow for it, and it totally works. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't think that alternate harem-ish history in which most famous people are gender swapped into anime girls, would actually be good. Only thing I knew going into this was that it was historical romance. And it really delivers in both of those areas. It's not overly-haremish, but few complaints can be made in the area of fanservice. Often it crosses into the area of what I like to call blunt fanservice. Luckily, fast pacing doesn't allow it to eat up too much time. Other than that, sometimes the fast pacing results in introduction of so many characters that it's nearly impossible to keep track of their names. Same applies to the story, though it's mostly clear enough, sometimes I'd get a bit lost in what's going on. It's fun though to wiki a bit after an episode, to see what the differences are between anime and real history. Oh yeah, introduction of magic into an actual history is something you'll just have to accept I guess. But it does make the story more interesting so it's kinda justified. I'd usually be against the idea but again, it works here.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting how much Nobuna resembles Sena from Haganai. They even have the same voice actress, and it's like she's trying to sounds the same. Well I definitely don't mind considering I love Sena. But there are a couple of things about Sena I'd prefer changed (breasts reduction for one), and funnily enough, doing that would result in Nobuna. Well,... hell yeah! What's even better, protagonist is totally cool. So even though setting seems harem-ish with all those girls around, it's plays out nothing like a regular harem anime. So it doesn't really resemble one. Oh, and make sure you're okay with litle girls being ninjas and generals and such... yeah it sounds weird in context of near-actual history, but the anime stylisation of history really ends up making it more fun. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design, animation and production quality are spectacular and make this worth watching for the action sequences alone. Just look at OP and you'll know what I mean. Speaking of OP, it's really awesome, along with ED, and music is awesome as well. Oh, and don't expect too much closure, as anime only covers the first four volumes out of 10, but the good news is that volumes 5,6, and 7 are already translated by baka-tsuki.",

To be honest,  Oda Nobuna no Yabou is really nothing that special in most parts. \r\nThe story follows the \"romantic comedy\" formula and is extremely easy to follow. Add a few character development elements and you get  Oda Nobuna no Yabou. It's OKAY, the characters are well done and the story fits well with the show. But like I said before it'sreally \"by the letter\" romantic comedy with action.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also typical in some aspects. And what I mean by that is that there's not much innovation, which is due to the setting of the story (they kinda had a guideline no time for free roaming). To it's credit they did a great job in showing off the time period since it's loosely based on historical events. Despite it being typical, the use of some vibrant colors was executed perfectly and character design was not only true to it's time but showed originality as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this show has to be the animation, it's top notch. One of the better animations i have seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is alright, to be honest I don't care about it much. As for the sound it's great well done!\\n\\n\r\nIn the end  Oda Nobuna no Yabou is a fun watch. But in the end it's a typical romantic comedy with action and realistic (not clinging to the protagonist) characters.  In other words slightly above average.",

The story was introduced well, and I found it to be interesting, with the history added with the fact that every general/soldier was girl. However, the story as a whole, pretty much is like every other harem \"plot\" just that it is in  a different setting with different characters.\r\nArt (8/10): Splendid very good, not many flaws I can think of at all. Just spectacular :D!\r\nSound (6/10): Soundtrack was amazing,OP/EDs were okay. Balances the rating :D!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): Okay here is where we get down to business. The characters were what made this anime unique and fantastic. The supplied every single type of character, loli, busty, you name it. Also, the characters progressed very well throughout the story, good job!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): I really liked this anime a lot! It had a solid plot, great characters, great sound, worth watching!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Included pretty much every type of character\\n\r\n+Sound was great\\n\r\n+Art was amazing\\n\r\n+Characters are likable \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Left you hanging, needs a second season\\n\r\n-Story was bland, solid, but it was just like every other harem (boy meets girls, all girls like him, boy pretty much a pervert, tsundere, etc) but just with a different setting and characters\\n\r\n-Some plot holes",

I think actually the story in this anime is good, although historical story but added other story impression to be more interesting.\r\nfor my own is actually less interesting, not on the story but indeed since childhood I have almost understood the story of japanese history.\r\nit's because I'm a game lovers of Japanese history, Samurai warriors, Samurai warriors 2, Kessen, and others.\r\nthis makes me look like again and again because indeed I myself have very often played this story.\r\nfor Yoshiaru-san's own character is still unclear background, suddenly into the story problem. then because he already understands the future and makesthe story less interesting, because the problem is easily solved.\\n\r\nfor the character Oda Nobuna I think too feminine, maybe less cruel like Oda Nobunaga the Demon King.\\n\r\nfor the completeness of the weapon is also none that stands out, and the fighting action is also less stressful. Honnoji incident did not happen. whereas Mitsuhide and Oda fight in the game is very exciting and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nfrom my experience there are still many characters that have not been out, maybe there will be a second season,\\n\r\nYukimura Sanada, Tadakatsu Honda, Mitsunari Ishida, Kanetsugu Naoe, Musashi Miyamoto, Orochi * lol (just kidding).",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I'm no Japanese History Major, nor do I claim to be, but this anime, while most likely taking liberties often does a great job making you feel like you are in feudal Japan. Our main hero who is some how sent back in time (or rather into another dimension) finds himself in a world much like our own feudal Japan with one exception, all the great historical figures are girls. \r\nNow I'm not positive about this but I think this anime is still considered Harem. The reason I say that is because while he is surrounded by a widevariety of girls who may or may not fawn over him, its not like other over the top Harem anime where there's nothing really going on other than fan service, all the girls don't just fall in love with the main character for no reason, and then there is no pointless Harem scenes. The story is extremely engaging taking famous historical events and battles from the time and putting a spin on them with the main character who, being from the future, knows how they turn out. \\n\r\nOne of the things I love about this anime is the large army battles, which this anime has plenty of, and you really get a feel for what Oda Nobunaga, or Oda Nobuna as she is called in this version, must have felt during his time in history. \\n\r\nAll the characters are cool and well developed and unlike our main character can actually fight. The main character is unable to just blow through armies like they were made of wax paper, he is instead forced to rely on his wits and the knowledge he has of the future to help him on his adventure. \\n\r\nIf you're a fan of large army battles, empire building, or feudal Japan, then check this anime out. I could watch this anime any day.",

It must be joking right? its Awesome, plot, story, and art very good. when it in WAR MODE the animation just like in movie but actually its in TV-SeriesRight? yes very tempting and fill with romance, maybe it will end with harem but i dont know the ending since nobuna ( the Main Heroine ) very tsundere - type and actually She is KAWAI~. and i think the story like in sengoku era and it focus on Oda Clan. the plot interesting and the story has comedy too so you will not boring to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the bad point i think because its too many Lolicon!

The Story is all about the Onin War (A civil war in Japan and it's uniting (and it is a true war), the story of the Oda Clan! This anime takes place in a very important historical event known as the Onin war with the uniting of all the clans of Japan. The art is wonderful! Each character has a unique art, literally, they each have a different art style to them, so the variety will never end. The character'sare great, given that (SPOILER): a boy from the future has ended in the past. I was truly that the author of this anime didn't make it where he doesn't even talk about the past! I was surprised this anime didn't continue, but don't worry my anime friends, there is a Season 2! In the end it was a cliff hanger (but lets wait until you see it) Overall, I wouldn't want to give this a 10, but a 15!

Oh ho, was I wrong seeing that this anime brought out the most famous generals of Japan's feudal era to be all sexy ladies.  \r\nYou would think skepticism is what would come in mind because Oda Nobuna is completely off in a history perspective. But not entirely as it still kept some key feature left in it. Actually, enough to keep Oda Nobuna a sensible anime. \r\nCharacter development was something major in this anime. Tosummarize it, good guys vs bad guy is what technicality happen thought out the story. \\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, good delivery of some mild fan service with some comical scenes here and there. Oda Nobuna No Yabou did a real good job as a historical anime (one of the best in a while). A potential season 2 is detected :3. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating\\n\r\n8.4/10",

This is the tale of nobunaga the fool as retold if a boy came from the future to the past and all of the generals were kawaii girls. Said boy is an expert on history and uses this expertise to help nobuna (his love interest) to conquer Japan while changing key events so everyone can live happily ever after and no one needs to die (minus countless soldiers who no one cares about). Basically... this is the VN/Anime Kohime Musou without the nudity. \r\nDon't get me wrong,this is done well and the characters are appealing and interesting. You get a retelling of history with some notable changes but with the guise of being a romance plot with cute girls so it appeals to all the weebs of the world. It is done well, the pacing is good and the story is good. There are a few characters that aren't done so well and a few things work out BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP but that doesn't really ruin the story. The ending was complete and I could live with only a single season (though there was setup of another female general who clearly was meant for season 2 which never happened). The source material might be worth alook, at a minimum this will gvie you a history lesson and pass the time in a fairly enjoyable way.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8 / Art 8 / Sound 6 / Character 7 / Enjoyment 7 / Overall 7",

Settin any anime during the Sengoku era is an A in my book, cause you dont see many Animes set during the Sengoku era anymore, everything is futuristic, its nice to come back to the classic era. Plusit reverses the roles, The Oda clan is actually ruled by a girl named Oda Nobuna and a funny hopeless guy from the future is thrown into the chaos of all the fighting during the Sengoku Era, but somehow manages to help Oda Nobuna throughout the time period. And along the way there a whole bunch of humor, but also some parts that have some sense of being serious. All in all i definately think Oda Nobuna No Yabou is a good anime. Dont really want to go on either that ill reveal past the first Episode, Watch it XP",
