            "content": "Bakuman 3 picks up at where the previous season ended. The quality didn't drop at all, it's as awesome as the 2nd Season and better than the 3rd. I've watched 5 episodes and given the circumstances of this anime (3rd Season) I'm sure that I can give it a worthy review.\r\nStory (10)\r\nThe story is still great with the usual pacing style of the previous seasons. There's just something very addicting in the pacing of the story, it feels like no second is wasted at every episode. Each one brings something new to the story, good news and more hurdles at the end of the episode.The cliffhangers really get you excited to watch the next episode too. The plot twists are still the same as ever, they seem pretty petty and weak for an anime but they're realistic and you can really relate to them because they fit the slice-of-life genre very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nArt is still the same, it's different but it's neither bad nor good. It doesn't stand out and that's actually what makes it fit for it's genre. Bakuman isn't about flashy art, dramatic music and all that glitter. It's good as it is. Though the quality drops at times, it doesn't really affect the viewing enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nThe sound is like the art, it's the same.. not bad and not good. The OP is decent and the singer's voice is kinda weird but it doesn't really bother me. The EP is good, nothing to say about that. No objections about the sound really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10)\\n\r\nCharacterization is the same and still good. Same goes for character development, in fac there's actually a little bit of character development as soon as the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nBakuman is still addicting as ever, that's all I need to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10)\\n\r\nOverall, the quality didn't drop one bit. It's basically an extended Season 2, which was already perfect in my point of view. It's as interesting as ever and I don't think it needs any improvements at all. Any plans to change some things up 'for the better' would've backfired on them.  Bakuman 2 and 3 is one of the best Animes I've seen.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dreams are hard to follow and even harder to make them come true. Whether it's getting securing your ideal job, marrying someone you always admired, or becoming a superstar, dreams require many ingredients to make it come true. It requires hard work, determination, motivation, creativity, and even a little luck. Yet, when people follows these dreams, it can be surprising on how much they realize about their goal and about themselves. In Bakuman 3, the series follows two best friends who hopes to achieve their dreams and become professional manga artists.\r\nAhh, Bakuman once again returns as the third installation of this trilogy, known as Bakuman3. It's amazing how this show can still keep it together after several years. The series is written and illustrated by Tsugami Ohba, who is known for his famous work Death Note. In contrast though, the series does not give off psychological impressions but rather follows a slice-of-life style of presenting its story. The series has achieved universal success with its manga predecessor and likewise, I find that the third and final installation manage to keep it together once again.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows two best friends, Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi. Collectively known by their pen name, Muto Ashirogi, the duo hopes to make a name for themselves by getting serialized in the Weekly Shonen Jump. With a little hard work, motivation, determination, and luck, they might just be able to do just that.\\n\\n\r\nLike its previous predecessors, Bakuman 3 presents itself as a slice-of-life style series. Dreams are hard to make into a reality but we can clearly see that Muto Ashirogi hopes to do so. It follows their youth lives in a natural way as opposed to normal teens. Most teens often think about their future and dream jobs later on in life but at only 9th grade, the duo Muto Ashirogi has already began to climb that ladder to success. It's not easy though as becoming a manga artist is a very stressful way of life. In fact, Moritaka already knows this with the unfortunate circumstances of one of his family relatives. It even strived him away from thinking about the dream in the beginning. Furthermore, there is competition. Becoming a manga artist is a lot harder said than done. In fact, it can be compared to climbing the world's tallest mountain, winning an Olympics gold medal, or achieving a world record in the Guiness Book. Okay, I'm probably exaggerating a bit here but you get the idea. It is not easy.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, Bakuman 3 incorporates many ideas from the art of manga creation itself. It presents to viewers how manga is made with the ideas, how to get the material published, and how the industry works directly with many of its episodes. It looks hard and definitely requires a lot of effort. Yet at the same time, watching this series makes the career seem fun and exciting. In fact, it's that much exciting when Muto Ashirogi gets recognized for their work at various circumstances. In a way, Bakuman adapts its series of manga-in-manga but in a way that makes it look like a lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice-of-life continues to exist just like its previous predecessors. It follows the duo in their every day live mixed in with comedy, drama, and romance. The drama part comes from Nakai who continues to linger his ways of going after Aoki despite their previous encounters. It doesn't stop there though as a love triangle ensures between him, Aoki, and Hiramaru. It's two guys and one girl in a triple threat. As silly as it sounds, the love triangle plays more of a progressing role for Aoki as she makes her stand and point known.\\n\\n\r\nWith the dramatic romance part aside, the technical part of Bakuman 3 also comes into play with some controversial events. In fact, Ashirogi Muto gets some unprecedented media attention after some unfortunate events. The duo wanted to make a name for themselves but not in the way that they see it this time. It gets a bit complex and even causes stress to the duo for their dreams. Forget dreams, it's more like a nightmare now after such an event. It should be no surprising though as the author of the series wants to visualize what manga artists needs to deal with in the real life. It's realistic in many senses from this case as becoming a manga artist is never easy. There are challenges every day whether it's competition, scandals, overworking to meet due times, and bringing out ideas to audiences in its finest form. The imaginations that manga artists comes often requires extensive thoughts and planning as well. I personally found that the ideas used by Ashirogi Muto is a bit repetitive and even borrowed from themes used by the real artist/illustrator of Bakuman. In other words, although the series' manga ideas are fun to read, they often lack a bit of uniqueness or set themselves differently from others. It's often hard to present ideas when so many others exists beforehand but overall, I only considered the ideas that Ashirogi Muto came up to be....average.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, I find Ashirogi Muto and their way of working to be quite interactive and fun. Often when working together, the duo seems to have more fun than expected with their ideas. It's not in a workaholic way in which the duo tries to be the very best or earn cash but rather to do what they enjoy in while hoping to achieve success. Even when the duo are arguing, the dialogue is presented in an entertaining way. The words spoken by the characters are colorful and often or not, becomes an inspriation for their ideas. These ideas are transformed into their product for the world to see. Of course, success isn't easy to come by especially with competition. Major supporting characters as Eiji are obstacles for Ashirogi Muto and they must overcome him to achieve that success.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more dramatic side, Bakuman 3 also introduces what some fans may see as a real antagonist in the form of Toru Nanamine. He represents the antithesis of Ashirogi Muto. On the surface, he looks like a fun and outgoing guy with a chill personality. However, deep down he is seen as a hot-tempered, manipulative, and an individual who is willing to do absolutely anything to achieve success. The construction of his character makes him an antagonist by the way he compete against Ashirogi Muto because he even relies on underhanded tactics to ensure his assumed victories. To him, making manga is about winning and being the best in contrast of Ashirogi Muto who wishes to achieve their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman 3 does seem to continuously adapt a slow pace. Furthermore, the many dialogues used between the characters often gets dull, lacks flavor, and dragged. The seemingly antagonist Nanamine is also easy to predict by viewers as the villain by the way of his actions. It's not hard to see him as a two-faced individual who wishes to become the best even relying on iniquitous tactics. These tactics of course doesn't always go the way he wants to.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series remains intact compared to its previous seasons. J.C. Staff adapts the anime based off of the manga and does a fit job in making its artwork intact. And of course, because this is an anime series based on making manga, the artwork created by the various artists themselves also are presented artistically well. The artwork in fact is edgy but gives off that realistic look at the series from the outside. In the inside, the manga and characters' designs gives off a natural sort of look. It looks realistic and doesn't look too flashy, not that it needs to be anyways. There is no fan service and fans shouldn't be surprised at this considering it's NHK network known for airing lighthearted series.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack department, everything seems to remain the same. Both the OP/ED song for the first and second half depicts on a montage of the main characters. Some of the soundtrack does to be repetitive but still retains its natural vibrations. It balances it out with the general lighthearted outlook of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bakuman 3 is a pleasant series for me and I think for fans, especially those who've watched the previous predecessors. Even if you don't like the idea of making manga, the series makes it interactive with its extensive dialogues, competitions, and characters' interactions. And of course, some of the manga ideas themselves can be entertaining. It's not easy making dreams come true but Ashirogi Muto sure has great hopes. They're climbing that ladder of success and opening doors to imaginations.",

            "content": "Bakuman is, undoubtly, one of my favourite mangas ever. Saying that, why do I rate it so low? Because this season was such a rushed and low quality adaptation that cannot stand a chance against the original version or even against the previous seasons. While the first and second animes adapt an average of 2.5 chapters of the manga with great detail, this one even gets rid of characters, important situations and even a whole arc. Let's not be naive: animated language is different from that of written or drawn media, so one can understand that adjustments are always needed. Maybe some brilliant moments inmanga can't simply shine in an anime. That's a given and it should always be comprehensible. My complaint isn't about a panel or two that weren't copy-pasted to the animation. If you haven\u2019t read the manga, I can\u2019t blame you if you think that this is a quite good anime, but after watching seasons 1 and 2, it's clear that the pace and development are quite different.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's give some clear examples. Nakai is meant to be a tragic and despicable character, which is great because it makes his realistic in this shounen world full of generic and plain characters: he gives his dream up just because he wasn't loved by Aoki. A frustrated man, Nakai reappears until Nanamine's arc, now as an obese and gross person, always harassing women. After Nanamine's utter defeat, Nakai finds himself lost once again, so his only option is to sell portraits in the streets of Tokio. He then is mocked  and humiliated by a group of shallow and bitchy girls, becomes violent against hostess in a club and then, drunk and devastated, runs to Aoki's house just to beat her. In this anime, however, half of Nakai's personal drama was just cut off. He was turned just into a ridiculous character without depth. The same can be said about Shiratori Shun and its forgettable and brief appearance, or Shizuka, the non existent hikikomori addicted to hostess club mangaka.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the greatest moments in the manga is Azuki's arc because it's a great critic of the idols market. Those girls are they are bound to be incarnation of young men's fantasies, pure, untouched, flawless and unreal women. As soon as one of them shows a bit of humanity (that includes, of course, having feelings for a man), she is condemned and bashed. Shortly after otakus find out that Azuki has a boyfriend she becomes target of criticism and hate. While talking with her fans, someone asks her if she's still virgin (which, in the anime, was censored) and they call her a slut. While many people have criticized Ohba's female characters, he turns Azuki into the one who has to fulfill Ashirogi's dream, the one who has to overcome the last challenge by showing that idols are human, that they doesn't have to ask permission to love or to express what they really are as women. But this anime just turned all this into two or three mutilated episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course we have a last and necessary lecture: even if this anime was so mutilated it\u2019s still over the average, which says a lot about how great Bakuman is.",

Here's the review.\r\nStory is a 9.\r\nAs with the previous season, it hasn't lost it's edge on story telling and pacing. It's easy to follow and easy to understand. My only issues are some arcs are a bit uninteresting and unfulfilling, like the Nanamine arc.\r\nArt is 10. \r\nGreat art as always. Proper visual effects, no awkward animations or anything etc. Pleasing to watch, I should say.\r\nSound is 9.\r\nGood soundtrack and proper voice acting. OP/ED were not really anything specialthough, \\n\r\nwould prefer Bakuman. 2's OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was great and I really like how they interact witth each other. Eiji is definitely the standout as I appreciate how his eccentric behavior hasn't changed at all. Kazuya Hiramaru also improved also, not only in the comedic sense.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 10.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode makes me either laugh or feel emotional. The scenes will always put a smile in your face because they are just so great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall is 10.\\n\\n\r\nIt deserves the title of masterpiece because it isn't just enjoyable but also it has been considered a piece of art. This is an anime you can watch over and over and still end up not being bored.\\n\\n",

Now, you might not think Bakuman, a story that resolves around 2 kids who wan't to make it big in the manga world is exciting, but, the Author of this series adds so many cool characters, twist, and special events that it's not hard to fall in love with the series. \r\nNow on to the anime adaption, I loved the first 2 adaptions of this series. They did it very well, with out cutting stuff out to helpthere show. Now, when Bakuman season 3 came out, I was excited to see the stuff that's been going on in the Manga (I pick them up monthly with the speed up Viz is doing). So far the show is doing good, but out of nowhere there starting to cut out ALLLLLLOOOOT of crap from the manga. Now I know some of the stuff isn't useful but to go from the START of Bakuman Volume 13 to almost the END of Volume 13 in just one episode? No, that was not cool at all. \\n\\n\r\nBesides that the anime adaption is doing good with the music just hope they start slowing down the pacing when it comes to volume 14-16",

            "content": "Let's get things straight - this series is amazingly good. I want you to have that in mind as you read on since I would like to write about all 3 seasons and not just this one - I would like to sum up my experiences with the entire package. \r\nThis whole adventure started when two men decided to share their dream (albeit for a different reason) and follow it through no matter what obstacles they face with their unwavering resolve. What followed was one of the best plot-driven stories I had the pleasure of enjoying.\r\nStory\r\nI should start by pointing out that for me thereare two things about the story that must succeed in order for the plot to be interesting. Number one - the story itself has to be interesting. Number two - the way it's presented must be interesting - this includes pacing.\\n\r\nAnd Bakuman does both in a superb manner. We have two men trying to create the best manga that ever existed - personally I was allways kind of interested in the process of manga creation and I admit even though I don't know how the market really works - the way it was presented here made me want to try and make a story myself (that is despite the fact that my drawings would horrify people...) - it's not easy and your goal isn't just laid in front of you - but it pays of if you mange to actually do it.\\n\r\nNow I believe the reason why pacing is so great is because it's so uneven. At times we will spend and entire episode with our characters thinking over one issue but then there are also episodes with 3 timeskips a few weeks each. This helps us focus on what's important at the moment.\\n\r\nSometimes the focus is on micro - when they discuss what to change in a chapter of their work. Sometimes the focus is on macro - when we have multiple timeskips that show how their changes influence the popularity over a larger span of time. With this we can look at the story from two different perspectives and it's not boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI don't think many people would argue but the art was really really good. Maybe not Makoto Shinkai good but still - right below that. Also please note that if it was made in a Makoto-like style I would probably rate it lower since the art is very fitting for the characters (I had a slight problem with the gag/parody animation but only a minor one) and it trully is a pleasure to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt rarely happens but I actually enjoyed every single one of the openings and endings and the music in the series itself was were it was supposed to be. It wasn't something that would grip my heart but then again - this isn't a story about musicians. For the most part I'd say it did the job it was supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOh yes - this is the main reason I loved it so much. Characters for me are absolutely the best part of the series - it doesn't mean it's perfect of course.\\n\\n\r\nSo let us begin with our double protagonists - Takagi and Mashiro.\\n\r\nThey are the driving point of the entire story obviously but for me what steals the show is the chemistry between them. You can really see how they try their best and how they support each other over the span of all three seasons.\\n\r\nThere were moments where I thought \"what he's doing is stupid\" but then I reflected - maybe I wouldn't do it but Mashiro would - it's very fitting for his character.\\n\r\nIf I were to choose my favourite however I'd pick Takagi - I loved his resolve. In every single season he did things that made me think \"he's awesome\". The only problem I had with him is I believe he should really pay more attention to his wife.\\n\\n\r\nAs for female protagonists - Kaya and Miho.\\n\r\nMiho was the weakest of all the characters in my opinion - I found the concept she thought of \"not seeing each other\" as being silly but I must admit it really was a sweet thing. Not to mention I can't even imagine how I would feel if I was working for something so hard for so many years - I believe that feeling would probably be worth all that wait. Probably. Yeah... probably. She had a weird feeling for me nonetheless but she grew on me and while I had a problem with her in the first and second season - I was totally fine with her in the third.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kaya - I think she's my favourite character here. Partly because she's so invisible in the third season. It's allmost like the story wouldn't even change at all if you take her out of it. But it only makes her greater in my eyes since I couldn't wait when she shows up. Her emotions towards our male protagonists, her cheerful cheering (pardon me for that) and the dedication she puts into helping them makes every scene with her in it a real feast. I think the real strength of her character is also what we don't see - as her support for our mangaga duo is only seen on the surface as it would seem.\\n\\n\r\nI won't write about every single character since it would take too long so I'll just try to summarize it real quick. \\n\r\nMost of the characters introduced were very enjoyable to watch and they all had their unique... \"quirks\". Nizuma seemed completely insane, Aoi and Fukuda focuse on her work, Hiramaru is incredibly lazy - and it goes on. What we get is a pretty wild mix of characters with different views on obtaining the same goal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that I enjoyed this series tremendously but I can't convey all of that in just a few simple words. Even though there were moments I found less interesting - I still couldn't stop watching and I launched one episode after another. This is the pinacle example of the syndrom I call \"I just started an episode and it's already end credits\" where you get so completely absorbed by the story that you lose the sense of time. \\n\r\nI would like to trully recomment the entire series for everyone - you shall not be dissapointed!",

I think  it was the best season of all 3 , the quality of the art was a little better , the drama and the romance was more intense than the other 2 seasons , but what I really enjoyed in this one was the work of \" Ashirogi Moto \" and the great challenges between theme and Niizuma , it was both exciting and enjoyable to watch . I definitely think the serie of bakuman was one of best series I've watched so far , simply because of the unique story and the nice touch of comedy thatwas well inserted , and that supported the charm of this anime .",

            "content": "*If you havent watched the first and second season, please, watch it first.*\r\n*contains minor spoiler*\r\n\"Once upon a time there was an anime called Bakuman, At that time, many anime that doesnt give any positive values or any good things. and thats when Bakuman rises and give a hope about how anime must giving encouragement to our generation for working hard and achieve our dreams\"\r\nBakuman 3, is the third season of Bakuman or the last season of Bakuman. Bakuman as we know is some of catch-your-dream anime that have inspiring many people, including myself on how we must to pursue our dream. As we know, inthis year there was two catch-your-dream anime that have been released, beside Bakuman there was Space Brother. The two high quailty anime that have so many positive values that we can get from both anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (10/10)\\n\r\nAnyway Bakuman 3, continue the story from when PCP got a first place in the first chapter. Like the previous season, Bakuman still interesting to watch, but in this season, Bakuman is more less problem. We can call this season is the time for Ashirogi Mutou for \"picking the fruit\" that they have made . If we have saw the struggle in the previous season then in this time they're focussing on how to get anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThere isnt any much different with the pacing style in this season, Bakuman 3 still keep the slow paced, with this pace they make every episode is totally worth it, there isnt any episode that wasted or not important. Importantly, they have a good management on how to attract the viewers, there is, make the CLIFFHANGER ending in every episodes. Well played bakuman, well played.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (6/10)\\n\r\nIf we comparing this season with the previous season in art section, you will find nothing. from 2010 until 2013, there isn't any improvement or any much difference with the art quality. J.C Staff still keep with some poor drawn. But of course art is not their prominent section that makes bakuman is interesting. Yes, the art is dull and looks old. But now i am sure, anime without a good graphic still can be amazing especially when the story is amazing, they cover the shortfall of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10)\\n\r\nAgain, there isn't any much different with the sound section if we're comparing from season 1 or season 2. But not like from the art, the sound section is still awesome, from the seiyuu itself or from the OP or the ED. In the OP we have two opening until now (episode 22), its Nano.ripe with \"Moshimo no Hanashi\" song and Hyadain with \"23:40\". Both song was really awesome, since i am a fan of Nano.ripe i love the first opening, its sweet and really raise the mood. and for the second OP, it was decent. \\n\\n\r\nFor seiyuu's voice i dont have any problem with this, since the seiyuu for the main lead (Mashiro and Takagi) was really an expert, they both (Abe Atshuhi and Hino Satoshi) have many experience as the main lead in another anime. and more the sound quality isn't drop. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10/10)\\n\r\nWhat makes bakuman is interesting beside the story? the CHARACTER of course!. In this season, you will see a LOT of development between each character even the LOVE development for some characters. Furthermore, the characterization was still the same from the previous season. So, not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL and ENJOYMENTS (9/10)\\n\r\nBakuman is one of few anime that can make me sit quietly and enjoy the series for the whole days. I am not exaggerate, it was true. I have recommend this anime on several people (who isnt really addicted to anime) on my college and they said they were really enjoy this series and they said they can watch this anime for a whole days. and its same for me too, this anime was amazing and i would recommend this series to anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Okkyblight-\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Bakuman has been one hell of a ride.\r\nThe first season starts off with the introduction of the characters, the dream that they have, their struggle to chase it by spending their youth on it and the formation of pen name Ashirogi Mutou, Ashirogi which is made up of Azuki, Mashiro and Takagiwhere Mutou means to grant dream. The first season has one of the best OST among the rest, 'Blue Birds' and it's just irresistible not to relate it instantly to their unusual love promises. Season two introduces more characters as rivals and involved more drama and is more focused on the characters development especially on Tagaki and Miyoshi. It shows the struggle Ashirogi Mutou have to face where they get closer to their dream, step by step, manga by manga.\\n\\n\r\nSeason three of Bakuman, the perfect ending season with the most impactful last episode, it leaves an eternal impression along with the memory of each of the characters. To celebrate and cheer for them, to be worried when it reaches suspense scenes, to cry over touching moments to laugh to their quirks and to watch closely when the story unfolds, enjoying every seconds of it. This season has done all that, making their dream a reality and their long lasting hardwork paid off in the very end along with the emotional OST ' 23:40 ' to get you hyped up for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you've reached here, then do finish the series as it's not only packed with emotions, but entertainment and inspiration at its finest. Watching Bakuman has been a roller coaster of emotions, look closely and you'll find that dreams do come true, and along the journey, you'll definitely meet some rivals, challenges, friends and maybe even true, pure love that will always stay beside you. At the end, it's gonna be a memory to be remembered and you'll never regret it. After all, the decision's yours.\\n\\n",

The story it self is a masterpiece ,IMPACT,PASSION,DEVOTION,TEARS . A truly story of Life ! \r\nThe story itself is original and fresh,a story about how 2 protagonist make their way to archived their dream to become popular cartoonist(Mangaka) the concept was so simple yet the story telling was good.This story only the one who in touch deeply with manga  can write out not by other! \r\nIn addition ,this anime not  centered only to manga but the life of teenage also included such as relationship ,study and obstacle in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was cool , you will notice the line art of the character was so detail , how they present the story is unable to describe through writing . See it your self and compare to other work you will see the art is top notch in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend you to read the manga after you finish the anime because the anime skip a lot of story if you really love this show . Somehow i got a feeling that this anime indirectly told the life of the creator .\\n\\n\r\nIn a nut shell this anime was not simply for everyone,but anyone whose NEVER watch or have a negative review  for this show i think you did not DESERVE  to call your self an anime or manga lover!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Bakuman was originally a manga which got turned into an anime which is about the main characters trying to get it big in the manga industry in order to get an anime to fulfill their dreams.\r\nIf you were to read what I just stated above, You wouldn't really feel any interest in wanting to watch it. I mean how can an anime with a combined episode count of over 70 be able to be that good? Well you're wrong. This anime manages to turn such a corny plot into something beautiful.\r\nI write this review with the assumption that the reader has gone through the wholeseries, meaning all 3 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I was quite skeptical to start watching it because it really seemed like it wouldn't really go far with what it seemed like it had to offer. But I'm glad I was proven wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is a bit unorthodox when compared to the majority of the entertainment that manga and anime have to offer. What I liked about the story is that even though it felt like it was revolving around the protagonists,  they didn't give them all the glory that most protagonist get. the series comes with not just ups but also a lot of downs for the main characters. They really depict how the industry works and how hard it is to climb your way up it. For someone who has read a lot of manga and watched a lot of anime this story will really get to you. It allows you to appreciate anime and manga even more.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story was obviously predictable(Like of course they will make it big, of course he'll get the girl, of course they'll be number 1) it was really more of \" It's about the journey not the destination \". And it really does have a really good lesson at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it to an audience that has a bit more experience watching various anime and manga before watching it, because you'll really be able to feel the appreciation this anime will give you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\" A Dream isn't something that someone tells you to go for. It's something you fulfill of your own will. \" -Moritaka Mashiro",

The thing is from the first episode you know how the anime is going to end(ish). I'm not saying that this is a bad thing but this anime is slow paced, repetitive and even boring at some points so this plus having 90% of certainty of how things are going to end must cause most people to lose interest.\r\nThe art and how things are shown bring a very strongsense of reality to the anime also related to that it is awesome to see manga volumes that i have inside an anime. And the way they talk about real life animes with no censorship.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very good explored in the way they think; you can know even what the most irrelevant character thinks about the situations presented. There's a bunch of characters which means many of them have a chance to be forgotten as the plot goes, but i think it's really wierd how Asuki just vanish for good long time. I understand there's script limitations but she IS a main character i'd say.\\n\\n\r\nThe message the anime gives us is beautiful and there's more then one. \\n\r\nBut so does most animes. I guess the slow paced way of showing this is part of what they want us to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't great and sometimes the \"sad music\" or the \"winning music\" enter too early and you can tell just what will happen next, if you haven't figured out on your own before (which isn't that hard). Even though i must say the music of the \"Super Hero Legends\" opening is still in my head.\\n\\n\r\nAlso great that they worked on showing in a nice way the animes of the mangas created by those characters. \\n\\n\r\nA Good anime with deep characters and some serious feeling of reality.\\n\\n\r\n(First review ever i might have missed something. English is not my native language so sorry about some eventual mistake on the matter.)",

The opening and endings fit the anime perfectly with its calm and soothing tunes.One of the ending themes for this season had snapshots of the past seasons in the theme and it reflected back on all the things that happened.That was enjoyable.\r\nCharacter-\r\nThe rivalry between the main characters grew even moreespecially between Mashiro and Niizuma.And finally the love build up had been established between Azuki and Mashiro. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nThe Bakuman series is really entertaining and i would definitely re-watch the show.\\n\r\n *SMALL CONCERN*\\n\r\nThere is only one thing i am concerned about. From the start of the series when they were in middle school all the way to when they are 24 years old their appearance don't change at all. Another example is Azukis mother.It's been ten years and she looks exactly the same.The only person who actually changed were Iwase,Nakai and Azukis little sister.It doesn't really affect the story but it was something that i noticed. The main characters don't need to be changed because they are the main characters but not even one wrinkle on the mother.The power of makeup.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nLove it. Making a manga into an anime in an anime. Yes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The third season of 'Bakuman.' is somehow different from the previous ones. The art, the sound or the characters haven't changed anyhow. The main difference is in the story.\r\nWhat I liked the most about this anime was that it depicted the business of drawing manga from within. I mean there were many nuances like telling the wievers how the editoring deparment of Shounen Jump works. The process of working on new manga series, the work of the authors, their assistants, their editors, etc.\r\nThat's what was the main theme of this series for me. I'm sure that everybody who has ever read Weekly Shounen Jump mangawondered: \"How do they actually do that? How much are the artist paid? How do you become a manga magazine associate?\"\\n\r\nThat's the point: All of that questions have already been answered in the two previous series. Now the author has just to put the plot to an end. And he does that with using mainly the theme of rivalry. Rivalry between manga artists has become a main subject of the anime.\\n\r\nYou may like it or not. I have to admit that hearing Mashiro and Takagi shouting \"We can do it! Let's work hard on it and beat everone!\" ten times per episode makes me tired of it. I wish they showed more of romantic themes and Ashirogi Mutou's mangas (they still show some scenes from their mangas, but it's too little).\\n\r\nAnyway, if you watched the previous seasons then you have to watch the third season anyway. Just to see where the story eventually goes and if Mashiro will finally got married.\\n\r\nAnd if you didn't - you should!",

Then he's oust the series with an explanation that does'nt suit his character.\r\nBut in this third season the authors actually succeed in making his eviction a plausible character development.\r\nSo just for this onefact, hooray for Bakuman season 3. :)",

I am self proclaimed Idiot and I am going to give another review form an idiot's point of view. This time it Bakuman  the whole season, because I can't remember where Season 1 and 2 ended. Hahahahahaha!!!!! I watched all 75 episode back-to-back, but I went to sleep at night and probably missed class for 2 days. I probably got alot to make work, huh? Okay on to the review.\r\nStory (10): At first when I saw Bakuman, I thought, \"It romance and about being an mangaka, I'mgoing to give a try because it's a romance.\" I am glad I decided to watch this anime. I like how when they would show the manga to their editor, they would give a voice and show it. I really want to watched all the mangas they made except \"Money and Intelligence\" it's seem to complicated for me to understand it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): I loved the animation, but not only that but the manga art they showed was to cool. I don't read mangas, because I hate reading but I like look at pictures of the mangas. I'm an Idiot it goes without saying, right?\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): I love the opening soundtracks in each season, especially Season 2. I don't really watch the ending because I was to pumped to watch the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): I don't like really like animes with to many characters because it always get to complicated for me, for example, Baccano!. They might didn't give the characters backstorys but I appreciate that in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): it's goes without saying. After every episode I want to watch the next one right away. I mostly enjoyed how Yoshida lied to and abused Hiramaru. I laughed so hard and started crying when Yoshida......  I almost spoiled my favorites parts. This is a spoiler free review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): So what did we learn today kids. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. All you learned was my preferences. And reason you would want to know them is because you want to date me. Who wants to date The Self Proclaimed Idiot. I leave that to your I\u2026ma\u2026gin\u2026ation. \\n\\n\r\nNext I will be watching Death Note. So be on the lookout for The Self Proclaimed Idiot...",

I kind of feel like the previous two seasons had set the stage for this final season.\r\nStory:\r\nI liked the fact that this season, we were introduced with tough rivals an situations that seemed to be very formidable. I was just amazed on how the duo managed to deal with those. The duo sure did mature and they were more capable of handling situations compared to their middle school selves.\r\nArt:\r\nWhen watching an anime, actually, art is really not an importantaspect for me, at least not the most important. Bakuman. always had a good art in my opinion. But then again, I'm not that particular when it comes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development was superb and in my opinion, well thought of.

            "content": "Bakuman 3 picks up at where the previous season ended. The quality didn't drop at all, it's as awesome as the 2nd Season and better than the 3rd. I've watched 5 episodes and given the circumstances of this anime (3rd Season) I'm sure that I can give it a worthy review.\r\nStory (10)\r\nThe story is still great with the usual pacing style of the previous seasons. There's just something very addicting in the pacing of the story, it feels like no second is wasted at every episode. Each one brings something new to the story, good news and more hurdles at the end of the episode.The cliffhangers really get you excited to watch the next episode too. The plot twists are still the same as ever, they seem pretty petty and weak for an anime but they're realistic and you can really relate to them because they fit the slice-of-life genre very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nArt is still the same, it's different but it's neither bad nor good. It doesn't stand out and that's actually what makes it fit for it's genre. Bakuman isn't about flashy art, dramatic music and all that glitter. It's good as it is. Though the quality drops at times, it doesn't really affect the viewing enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nThe sound is like the art, it's the same.. not bad and not good. The OP is decent and the singer's voice is kinda weird but it doesn't really bother me. The EP is good, nothing to say about that. No objections about the sound really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10)\\n\r\nCharacterization is the same and still good. Same goes for character development, in fac there's actually a little bit of character development as soon as the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nBakuman is still addicting as ever, that's all I need to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10)\\n\r\nOverall, the quality didn't drop one bit. It's basically an extended Season 2, which was already perfect in my point of view. It's as interesting as ever and I don't think it needs any improvements at all. Any plans to change some things up 'for the better' would've backfired on them.  Bakuman 2 and 3 is one of the best Animes I've seen.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dreams are hard to follow and even harder to make them come true. Whether it's getting securing your ideal job, marrying someone you always admired, or becoming a superstar, dreams require many ingredients to make it come true. It requires hard work, determination, motivation, creativity, and even a little luck. Yet, when people follows these dreams, it can be surprising on how much they realize about their goal and about themselves. In Bakuman 3, the series follows two best friends who hopes to achieve their dreams and become professional manga artists.\r\nAhh, Bakuman once again returns as the third installation of this trilogy, known as Bakuman3. It's amazing how this show can still keep it together after several years. The series is written and illustrated by Tsugami Ohba, who is known for his famous work Death Note. In contrast though, the series does not give off psychological impressions but rather follows a slice-of-life style of presenting its story. The series has achieved universal success with its manga predecessor and likewise, I find that the third and final installation manage to keep it together once again.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows two best friends, Moritaka Mashiro and Akito Takagi. Collectively known by their pen name, Muto Ashirogi, the duo hopes to make a name for themselves by getting serialized in the Weekly Shonen Jump. With a little hard work, motivation, determination, and luck, they might just be able to do just that.\\n\\n\r\nLike its previous predecessors, Bakuman 3 presents itself as a slice-of-life style series. Dreams are hard to make into a reality but we can clearly see that Muto Ashirogi hopes to do so. It follows their youth lives in a natural way as opposed to normal teens. Most teens often think about their future and dream jobs later on in life but at only 9th grade, the duo Muto Ashirogi has already began to climb that ladder to success. It's not easy though as becoming a manga artist is a very stressful way of life. In fact, Moritaka already knows this with the unfortunate circumstances of one of his family relatives. It even strived him away from thinking about the dream in the beginning. Furthermore, there is competition. Becoming a manga artist is a lot harder said than done. In fact, it can be compared to climbing the world's tallest mountain, winning an Olympics gold medal, or achieving a world record in the Guiness Book. Okay, I'm probably exaggerating a bit here but you get the idea. It is not easy.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, Bakuman 3 incorporates many ideas from the art of manga creation itself. It presents to viewers how manga is made with the ideas, how to get the material published, and how the industry works directly with many of its episodes. It looks hard and definitely requires a lot of effort. Yet at the same time, watching this series makes the career seem fun and exciting. In fact, it's that much exciting when Muto Ashirogi gets recognized for their work at various circumstances. In a way, Bakuman adapts its series of manga-in-manga but in a way that makes it look like a lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nThe slice-of-life continues to exist just like its previous predecessors. It follows the duo in their every day live mixed in with comedy, drama, and romance. The drama part comes from Nakai who continues to linger his ways of going after Aoki despite their previous encounters. It doesn't stop there though as a love triangle ensures between him, Aoki, and Hiramaru. It's two guys and one girl in a triple threat. As silly as it sounds, the love triangle plays more of a progressing role for Aoki as she makes her stand and point known.\\n\\n\r\nWith the dramatic romance part aside, the technical part of Bakuman 3 also comes into play with some controversial events. In fact, Ashirogi Muto gets some unprecedented media attention after some unfortunate events. The duo wanted to make a name for themselves but not in the way that they see it this time. It gets a bit complex and even causes stress to the duo for their dreams. Forget dreams, it's more like a nightmare now after such an event. It should be no surprising though as the author of the series wants to visualize what manga artists needs to deal with in the real life. It's realistic in many senses from this case as becoming a manga artist is never easy. There are challenges every day whether it's competition, scandals, overworking to meet due times, and bringing out ideas to audiences in its finest form. The imaginations that manga artists comes often requires extensive thoughts and planning as well. I personally found that the ideas used by Ashirogi Muto is a bit repetitive and even borrowed from themes used by the real artist/illustrator of Bakuman. In other words, although the series' manga ideas are fun to read, they often lack a bit of uniqueness or set themselves differently from others. It's often hard to present ideas when so many others exists beforehand but overall, I only considered the ideas that Ashirogi Muto came up to be....average.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, I find Ashirogi Muto and their way of working to be quite interactive and fun. Often when working together, the duo seems to have more fun than expected with their ideas. It's not in a workaholic way in which the duo tries to be the very best or earn cash but rather to do what they enjoy in while hoping to achieve success. Even when the duo are arguing, the dialogue is presented in an entertaining way. The words spoken by the characters are colorful and often or not, becomes an inspriation for their ideas. These ideas are transformed into their product for the world to see. Of course, success isn't easy to come by especially with competition. Major supporting characters as Eiji are obstacles for Ashirogi Muto and they must overcome him to achieve that success.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more dramatic side, Bakuman 3 also introduces what some fans may see as a real antagonist in the form of Toru Nanamine. He represents the antithesis of Ashirogi Muto. On the surface, he looks like a fun and outgoing guy with a chill personality. However, deep down he is seen as a hot-tempered, manipulative, and an individual who is willing to do absolutely anything to achieve success. The construction of his character makes him an antagonist by the way he compete against Ashirogi Muto because he even relies on underhanded tactics to ensure his assumed victories. To him, making manga is about winning and being the best in contrast of Ashirogi Muto who wishes to achieve their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman 3 does seem to continuously adapt a slow pace. Furthermore, the many dialogues used between the characters often gets dull, lacks flavor, and dragged. The seemingly antagonist Nanamine is also easy to predict by viewers as the villain by the way of his actions. It's not hard to see him as a two-faced individual who wishes to become the best even relying on iniquitous tactics. These tactics of course doesn't always go the way he wants to.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series remains intact compared to its previous seasons. J.C. Staff adapts the anime based off of the manga and does a fit job in making its artwork intact. And of course, because this is an anime series based on making manga, the artwork created by the various artists themselves also are presented artistically well. The artwork in fact is edgy but gives off that realistic look at the series from the outside. In the inside, the manga and characters' designs gives off a natural sort of look. It looks realistic and doesn't look too flashy, not that it needs to be anyways. There is no fan service and fans shouldn't be surprised at this considering it's NHK network known for airing lighthearted series.\\n\\n\r\nFor the soundtrack department, everything seems to remain the same. Both the OP/ED song for the first and second half depicts on a montage of the main characters. Some of the soundtrack does to be repetitive but still retains its natural vibrations. It balances it out with the general lighthearted outlook of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Bakuman 3 is a pleasant series for me and I think for fans, especially those who've watched the previous predecessors. Even if you don't like the idea of making manga, the series makes it interactive with its extensive dialogues, competitions, and characters' interactions. And of course, some of the manga ideas themselves can be entertaining. It's not easy making dreams come true but Ashirogi Muto sure has great hopes. They're climbing that ladder of success and opening doors to imaginations.",

            "content": "Bakuman is, undoubtly, one of my favourite mangas ever. Saying that, why do I rate it so low? Because this season was such a rushed and low quality adaptation that cannot stand a chance against the original version or even against the previous seasons. While the first and second animes adapt an average of 2.5 chapters of the manga with great detail, this one even gets rid of characters, important situations and even a whole arc. Let's not be naive: animated language is different from that of written or drawn media, so one can understand that adjustments are always needed. Maybe some brilliant moments inmanga can't simply shine in an anime. That's a given and it should always be comprehensible. My complaint isn't about a panel or two that weren't copy-pasted to the animation. If you haven\u2019t read the manga, I can\u2019t blame you if you think that this is a quite good anime, but after watching seasons 1 and 2, it's clear that the pace and development are quite different.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's give some clear examples. Nakai is meant to be a tragic and despicable character, which is great because it makes his realistic in this shounen world full of generic and plain characters: he gives his dream up just because he wasn't loved by Aoki. A frustrated man, Nakai reappears until Nanamine's arc, now as an obese and gross person, always harassing women. After Nanamine's utter defeat, Nakai finds himself lost once again, so his only option is to sell portraits in the streets of Tokio. He then is mocked  and humiliated by a group of shallow and bitchy girls, becomes violent against hostess in a club and then, drunk and devastated, runs to Aoki's house just to beat her. In this anime, however, half of Nakai's personal drama was just cut off. He was turned just into a ridiculous character without depth. The same can be said about Shiratori Shun and its forgettable and brief appearance, or Shizuka, the non existent hikikomori addicted to hostess club mangaka.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the greatest moments in the manga is Azuki's arc because it's a great critic of the idols market. Those girls are they are bound to be incarnation of young men's fantasies, pure, untouched, flawless and unreal women. As soon as one of them shows a bit of humanity (that includes, of course, having feelings for a man), she is condemned and bashed. Shortly after otakus find out that Azuki has a boyfriend she becomes target of criticism and hate. While talking with her fans, someone asks her if she's still virgin (which, in the anime, was censored) and they call her a slut. While many people have criticized Ohba's female characters, he turns Azuki into the one who has to fulfill Ashirogi's dream, the one who has to overcome the last challenge by showing that idols are human, that they doesn't have to ask permission to love or to express what they really are as women. But this anime just turned all this into two or three mutilated episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course we have a last and necessary lecture: even if this anime was so mutilated it\u2019s still over the average, which says a lot about how great Bakuman is.",

Here's the review.\r\nStory is a 9.\r\nAs with the previous season, it hasn't lost it's edge on story telling and pacing. It's easy to follow and easy to understand. My only issues are some arcs are a bit uninteresting and unfulfilling, like the Nanamine arc.\r\nArt is 10. \r\nGreat art as always. Proper visual effects, no awkward animations or anything etc. Pleasing to watch, I should say.\r\nSound is 9.\r\nGood soundtrack and proper voice acting. OP/ED were not really anything specialthough, \\n\r\nwould prefer Bakuman. 2's OP.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was great and I really like how they interact witth each other. Eiji is definitely the standout as I appreciate how his eccentric behavior hasn't changed at all. Kazuya Hiramaru also improved also, not only in the comedic sense.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 10.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode makes me either laugh or feel emotional. The scenes will always put a smile in your face because they are just so great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall is 10.\\n\\n\r\nIt deserves the title of masterpiece because it isn't just enjoyable but also it has been considered a piece of art. This is an anime you can watch over and over and still end up not being bored.\\n\\n",

Now, you might not think Bakuman, a story that resolves around 2 kids who wan't to make it big in the manga world is exciting, but, the Author of this series adds so many cool characters, twist, and special events that it's not hard to fall in love with the series. \r\nNow on to the anime adaption, I loved the first 2 adaptions of this series. They did it very well, with out cutting stuff out to helpthere show. Now, when Bakuman season 3 came out, I was excited to see the stuff that's been going on in the Manga (I pick them up monthly with the speed up Viz is doing). So far the show is doing good, but out of nowhere there starting to cut out ALLLLLLOOOOT of crap from the manga. Now I know some of the stuff isn't useful but to go from the START of Bakuman Volume 13 to almost the END of Volume 13 in just one episode? No, that was not cool at all. \\n\\n\r\nBesides that the anime adaption is doing good with the music just hope they start slowing down the pacing when it comes to volume 14-16",

            "content": "Let's get things straight - this series is amazingly good. I want you to have that in mind as you read on since I would like to write about all 3 seasons and not just this one - I would like to sum up my experiences with the entire package. \r\nThis whole adventure started when two men decided to share their dream (albeit for a different reason) and follow it through no matter what obstacles they face with their unwavering resolve. What followed was one of the best plot-driven stories I had the pleasure of enjoying.\r\nStory\r\nI should start by pointing out that for me thereare two things about the story that must succeed in order for the plot to be interesting. Number one - the story itself has to be interesting. Number two - the way it's presented must be interesting - this includes pacing.\\n\r\nAnd Bakuman does both in a superb manner. We have two men trying to create the best manga that ever existed - personally I was allways kind of interested in the process of manga creation and I admit even though I don't know how the market really works - the way it was presented here made me want to try and make a story myself (that is despite the fact that my drawings would horrify people...) - it's not easy and your goal isn't just laid in front of you - but it pays of if you mange to actually do it.\\n\r\nNow I believe the reason why pacing is so great is because it's so uneven. At times we will spend and entire episode with our characters thinking over one issue but then there are also episodes with 3 timeskips a few weeks each. This helps us focus on what's important at the moment.\\n\r\nSometimes the focus is on micro - when they discuss what to change in a chapter of their work. Sometimes the focus is on macro - when we have multiple timeskips that show how their changes influence the popularity over a larger span of time. With this we can look at the story from two different perspectives and it's not boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI don't think many people would argue but the art was really really good. Maybe not Makoto Shinkai good but still - right below that. Also please note that if it was made in a Makoto-like style I would probably rate it lower since the art is very fitting for the characters (I had a slight problem with the gag/parody animation but only a minor one) and it trully is a pleasure to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt rarely happens but I actually enjoyed every single one of the openings and endings and the music in the series itself was were it was supposed to be. It wasn't something that would grip my heart but then again - this isn't a story about musicians. For the most part I'd say it did the job it was supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOh yes - this is the main reason I loved it so much. Characters for me are absolutely the best part of the series - it doesn't mean it's perfect of course.\\n\\n\r\nSo let us begin with our double protagonists - Takagi and Mashiro.\\n\r\nThey are the driving point of the entire story obviously but for me what steals the show is the chemistry between them. You can really see how they try their best and how they support each other over the span of all three seasons.\\n\r\nThere were moments where I thought \"what he's doing is stupid\" but then I reflected - maybe I wouldn't do it but Mashiro would - it's very fitting for his character.\\n\r\nIf I were to choose my favourite however I'd pick Takagi - I loved his resolve. In every single season he did things that made me think \"he's awesome\". The only problem I had with him is I believe he should really pay more attention to his wife.\\n\\n\r\nAs for female protagonists - Kaya and Miho.\\n\r\nMiho was the weakest of all the characters in my opinion - I found the concept she thought of \"not seeing each other\" as being silly but I must admit it really was a sweet thing. Not to mention I can't even imagine how I would feel if I was working for something so hard for so many years - I believe that feeling would probably be worth all that wait. Probably. Yeah... probably. She had a weird feeling for me nonetheless but she grew on me and while I had a problem with her in the first and second season - I was totally fine with her in the third.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kaya - I think she's my favourite character here. Partly because she's so invisible in the third season. It's allmost like the story wouldn't even change at all if you take her out of it. But it only makes her greater in my eyes since I couldn't wait when she shows up. Her emotions towards our male protagonists, her cheerful cheering (pardon me for that) and the dedication she puts into helping them makes every scene with her in it a real feast. I think the real strength of her character is also what we don't see - as her support for our mangaga duo is only seen on the surface as it would seem.\\n\\n\r\nI won't write about every single character since it would take too long so I'll just try to summarize it real quick. \\n\r\nMost of the characters introduced were very enjoyable to watch and they all had their unique... \"quirks\". Nizuma seemed completely insane, Aoi and Fukuda focuse on her work, Hiramaru is incredibly lazy - and it goes on. What we get is a pretty wild mix of characters with different views on obtaining the same goal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt goes without saying that I enjoyed this series tremendously but I can't convey all of that in just a few simple words. Even though there were moments I found less interesting - I still couldn't stop watching and I launched one episode after another. This is the pinacle example of the syndrom I call \"I just started an episode and it's already end credits\" where you get so completely absorbed by the story that you lose the sense of time. \\n\r\nI would like to trully recomment the entire series for everyone - you shall not be dissapointed!",

            "content": "*If you havent watched the first and second season, please, watch it first.*\r\n*contains minor spoiler*\r\n\"Once upon a time there was an anime called Bakuman, At that time, many anime that doesnt give any positive values or any good things. and thats when Bakuman rises and give a hope about how anime must giving encouragement to our generation for working hard and achieve our dreams\"\r\nBakuman 3, is the third season of Bakuman or the last season of Bakuman. Bakuman as we know is some of catch-your-dream anime that have inspiring many people, including myself on how we must to pursue our dream. As we know, inthis year there was two catch-your-dream anime that have been released, beside Bakuman there was Space Brother. The two high quailty anime that have so many positive values that we can get from both anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (10/10)\\n\r\nAnyway Bakuman 3, continue the story from when PCP got a first place in the first chapter. Like the previous season, Bakuman still interesting to watch, but in this season, Bakuman is more less problem. We can call this season is the time for Ashirogi Mutou for \"picking the fruit\" that they have made . If we have saw the struggle in the previous season then in this time they're focussing on how to get anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThere isnt any much different with the pacing style in this season, Bakuman 3 still keep the slow paced, with this pace they make every episode is totally worth it, there isnt any episode that wasted or not important. Importantly, they have a good management on how to attract the viewers, there is, make the CLIFFHANGER ending in every episodes. Well played bakuman, well played.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (6/10)\\n\r\nIf we comparing this season with the previous season in art section, you will find nothing. from 2010 until 2013, there isn't any improvement or any much difference with the art quality. J.C Staff still keep with some poor drawn. But of course art is not their prominent section that makes bakuman is interesting. Yes, the art is dull and looks old. But now i am sure, anime without a good graphic still can be amazing especially when the story is amazing, they cover the shortfall of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10)\\n\r\nAgain, there isn't any much different with the sound section if we're comparing from season 1 or season 2. But not like from the art, the sound section is still awesome, from the seiyuu itself or from the OP or the ED. In the OP we have two opening until now (episode 22), its Nano.ripe with \"Moshimo no Hanashi\" song and Hyadain with \"23:40\". Both song was really awesome, since i am a fan of Nano.ripe i love the first opening, its sweet and really raise the mood. and for the second OP, it was decent. \\n\\n\r\nFor seiyuu's voice i dont have any problem with this, since the seiyuu for the main lead (Mashiro and Takagi) was really an expert, they both (Abe Atshuhi and Hino Satoshi) have many experience as the main lead in another anime. and more the sound quality isn't drop. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10/10)\\n\r\nWhat makes bakuman is interesting beside the story? the CHARACTER of course!. In this season, you will see a LOT of development between each character even the LOVE development for some characters. Furthermore, the characterization was still the same from the previous season. So, not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL and ENJOYMENTS (9/10)\\n\r\nBakuman is one of few anime that can make me sit quietly and enjoy the series for the whole days. I am not exaggerate, it was true. I have recommend this anime on several people (who isnt really addicted to anime) on my college and they said they were really enjoy this series and they said they can watch this anime for a whole days. and its same for me too, this anime was amazing and i would recommend this series to anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Okkyblight-\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Bakuman has been one hell of a ride.\r\nThe first season starts off with the introduction of the characters, the dream that they have, their struggle to chase it by spending their youth on it and the formation of pen name Ashirogi Mutou, Ashirogi which is made up of Azuki, Mashiro and Takagiwhere Mutou means to grant dream. The first season has one of the best OST among the rest, 'Blue Birds' and it's just irresistible not to relate it instantly to their unusual love promises. Season two introduces more characters as rivals and involved more drama and is more focused on the characters development especially on Tagaki and Miyoshi. It shows the struggle Ashirogi Mutou have to face where they get closer to their dream, step by step, manga by manga.\\n\\n\r\nSeason three of Bakuman, the perfect ending season with the most impactful last episode, it leaves an eternal impression along with the memory of each of the characters. To celebrate and cheer for them, to be worried when it reaches suspense scenes, to cry over touching moments to laugh to their quirks and to watch closely when the story unfolds, enjoying every seconds of it. This season has done all that, making their dream a reality and their long lasting hardwork paid off in the very end along with the emotional OST ' 23:40 ' to get you hyped up for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you've reached here, then do finish the series as it's not only packed with emotions, but entertainment and inspiration at its finest. Watching Bakuman has been a roller coaster of emotions, look closely and you'll find that dreams do come true, and along the journey, you'll definitely meet some rivals, challenges, friends and maybe even true, pure love that will always stay beside you. At the end, it's gonna be a memory to be remembered and you'll never regret it. After all, the decision's yours.\\n\\n",

A truly story of Life ! \r\nThe story itself is original and fresh,a story about how 2 protagonist make their way to archived their dream to become popular cartoonist(Mangaka) the concept was so simple yet the story telling was good.This story only the one who in touch deeply with manga  can write out not by other! \r\nIn addition ,this anime not  centered only to manga but the life of teenage also included such as relationship ,study and obstacle in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was cool , you will notice the line art of the character was so detail , how they present the story is unable to describe through writing . See it your self and compare to other work you will see the art is top notch in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend you to read the manga after you finish the anime because the anime skip a lot of story if you really love this show . Somehow i got a feeling that this anime indirectly told the life of the creator .\\n\\n\r\nIn a nut shell this anime was not simply for everyone,but anyone whose NEVER watch or have a negative review  for this show i think you did not DESERVE  to call your self an anime or manga lover!\\n\\n\\n",

I mean how can an anime with a combined episode count of over 70 be able to be that good? Well you're wrong. This anime manages to turn such a corny plot into something beautiful.\r\nI write this review with the assumption that the reader has gone through the wholeseries, meaning all 3 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I was quite skeptical to start watching it because it really seemed like it wouldn't really go far with what it seemed like it had to offer. But I'm glad I was proven wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is a bit unorthodox when compared to the majority of the entertainment that manga and anime have to offer. What I liked about the story is that even though it felt like it was revolving around the protagonists,  they didn't give them all the glory that most protagonist get. the series comes with not just ups but also a lot of downs for the main characters. They really depict how the industry works and how hard it is to climb your way up it. For someone who has read a lot of manga and watched a lot of anime this story will really get to you. It allows you to appreciate anime and manga even more.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the story was obviously predictable(Like of course they will make it big, of course he'll get the girl, of course they'll be number 1) it was really more of \" It's about the journey not the destination \". And it really does have a really good lesson at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it to an audience that has a bit more experience watching various anime and manga before watching it, because you'll really be able to feel the appreciation this anime will give you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\" A Dream isn't something that someone tells you to go for. It's something you fulfill of your own will. \" -Moritaka Mashiro",

The thing is from the first episode you know how the anime is going to end(ish). I'm not saying that this is a bad thing but this anime is slow paced, repetitive and even boring at some points so this plus having 90% of certainty of how things are going to end must cause most people to lose interest.\r\nThe art and how things are shown bring a very strongsense of reality to the anime also related to that it is awesome to see manga volumes that i have inside an anime. And the way they talk about real life animes with no censorship.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very good explored in the way they think; you can know even what the most irrelevant character thinks about the situations presented. There's a bunch of characters which means many of them have a chance to be forgotten as the plot goes, but i think it's really wierd how Asuki just vanish for good long time. I understand there's script limitations but she IS a main character i'd say.\\n\\n\r\nThe message the anime gives us is beautiful and there's more then one. \\n\r\nBut so does most animes. I guess the slow paced way of showing this is part of what they want us to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't great and sometimes the \"sad music\" or the \"winning music\" enter too early and you can tell just what will happen next, if you haven't figured out on your own before (which isn't that hard). Even though i must say the music of the \"Super Hero Legends\" opening is still in my head.\\n\\n\r\nAlso great that they worked on showing in a nice way the animes of the mangas created by those characters. \\n\\n\r\nA Good anime with deep characters and some serious feeling of reality.\\n\\n\r\n(First review ever i might have missed something. English is not my native language so sorry about some eventual mistake on the matter.)",

The opening and endings fit the anime perfectly with its calm and soothing tunes.One of the ending themes for this season had snapshots of the past seasons in the theme and it reflected back on all the things that happened.That was enjoyable.\r\nCharacter-\r\nThe rivalry between the main characters grew even moreespecially between Mashiro and Niizuma.And finally the love build up had been established between Azuki and Mashiro. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nThe Bakuman series is really entertaining and i would definitely re-watch the show.\\n\r\n *SMALL CONCERN*\\n\r\nThere is only one thing i am concerned about. From the start of the series when they were in middle school all the way to when they are 24 years old their appearance don't change at all. Another example is Azukis mother.It's been ten years and she looks exactly the same.The only person who actually changed were Iwase,Nakai and Azukis little sister.It doesn't really affect the story but it was something that i noticed. The main characters don't need to be changed because they are the main characters but not even one wrinkle on the mother.The power of makeup.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nLove it.

            "content": "The third season of 'Bakuman.' is somehow different from the previous ones. The art, the sound or the characters haven't changed anyhow. The main difference is in the story.\r\nWhat I liked the most about this anime was that it depicted the business of drawing manga from within. I mean there were many nuances like telling the wievers how the editoring deparment of Shounen Jump works. The process of working on new manga series, the work of the authors, their assistants, their editors, etc.\r\nThat's what was the main theme of this series for me. I'm sure that everybody who has ever read Weekly Shounen Jump mangawondered: \"How do they actually do that? How much are the artist paid? How do you become a manga magazine associate?\"\\n\r\nThat's the point: All of that questions have already been answered in the two previous series. Now the author has just to put the plot to an end. And he does that with using mainly the theme of rivalry. Rivalry between manga artists has become a main subject of the anime.\\n\r\nYou may like it or not. I have to admit that hearing Mashiro and Takagi shouting \"We can do it! Let's work hard on it and beat everone!\" ten times per episode makes me tired of it. I wish they showed more of romantic themes and Ashirogi Mutou's mangas (they still show some scenes from their mangas, but it's too little).\\n\r\nAnyway, if you watched the previous seasons then you have to watch the third season anyway. Just to see where the story eventually goes and if Mashiro will finally got married.\\n\r\nAnd if you didn't - you should!",

Then he's oust the series with an explanation that does'nt suit his character.\r\nBut in this third season the authors actually succeed in making his eviction a plausible character development.\r\nSo just for this onefact, hooray for Bakuman season 3. :)",

I am self proclaimed Idiot and I am going to give another review form an idiot's point of view. This time it Bakuman  the whole season, because I can't remember where Season 1 and 2 ended. Hahahahahaha!!!!! I watched all 75 episode back-to-back, but I went to sleep at night and probably missed class for 2 days. I probably got alot to make work, huh? Okay on to the review.\r\nStory (10): At first when I saw Bakuman, I thought, \"It romance and about being an mangaka, I'mgoing to give a try because it's a romance.\" I am glad I decided to watch this anime. I like how when they would show the manga to their editor, they would give a voice and show it. I really want to watched all the mangas they made except \"Money and Intelligence\" it's seem to complicated for me to understand it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): I loved the animation, but not only that but the manga art they showed was to cool. I don't read mangas, because I hate reading but I like look at pictures of the mangas. I'm an Idiot it goes without saying, right?\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): I love the opening soundtracks in each season, especially Season 2. I don't really watch the ending because I was to pumped to watch the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10): I don't like really like animes with to many characters because it always get to complicated for me, for example, Baccano!. They might didn't give the characters backstorys but I appreciate that in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): it's goes without saying. After every episode I want to watch the next one right away. I mostly enjoyed how Yoshida lied to and abused Hiramaru. I laughed so hard and started crying when Yoshida......  I almost spoiled my favorites parts. This is a spoiler free review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): So what did we learn today kids. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. All you learned was my preferences. And reason you would want to know them is because you want to date me. Who wants to date The Self Proclaimed Idiot. I leave that to your I\u2026ma\u2026gin\u2026ation. \\n\\n\r\nNext I will be watching Death Note. So be on the lookout for The Self Proclaimed Idiot...",

I kind of feel like the previous two seasons had set the stage for this final season.\r\nStory:\r\nI liked the fact that this season, we were introduced with tough rivals an situations that seemed to be very formidable. I was just amazed on how the duo managed to deal with those. The duo sure did mature and they were more capable of handling situations compared to their middle school selves.\r\nArt:\r\nWhen watching an anime, actually, art is really not an importantaspect for me, at least not the most important. Bakuman. always had a good art in my opinion. But then again, I'm not that particular when it comes to the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development was superb and in my opinion, well thought of. For someone who have watched the previous seasons, it was nice seeing the characters grow and on how they establish their relationships with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThere were times that I couldn't stop laughing. There were times that I felt the intense situations. There were times that I was just genuinely happy because of the romance. This is something that you wouldn't encounter frequently. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA VERY GREAT ANIME EXPERIENCE.",

It is such an amazing story, everyone has to watch it! \r\n I am very sad that there are no more episodes to it, but everything ended perfectly, so I am happy with that!\r\n There were so many plot twists,unexpected situations and gripping moments throughout all seasons. This anime definitely took a spot in my heart and I will always go back to it.\r\n I am so grateful that I watched it.\r\n  Story- final season of this outstanding anime was amazing! It was so interesting and catchy, just like two other seasons. Iliked how the story ended and I think that it couldn't be any better. \\n\\n\r\n   Art- Just like before,everything is brilliant. All of the characters and other stuff was depicted very well. The only thing I still wonder about is why none of the characters grow up. I mean it!s been like 10 years since what happened in the first season, but they all look exactly the same. But that doesn't bother me too much.\\n\\n\r\n  Characters- We got to see even more of the characters development. I got attached to them from the first season, but now I am even more attached. I still can't believe that it' s all over now. \\n\\n\r\n  Sound- I was not a fan of openings or endings since the first season and this time it's all the same. But what I think is a lot more important is how voice actors did their job. And they did it perfectly!\\n\\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment-   I truely enjoyed Bakuman! It is definitely one of my top favorite animes now. It was so good that I want to rewatch this mkre and more, but I need to wait a bit to forget the story so that I can rewatch it with a fresh mind. However, I don't think it's going to be that easy to forget this awesome anime.\\n\\n\r\n I highly highly recommend it!\\n",

            "content": "The 2nd season is way better than the 1st, and the 3rd season matches up pretty well. All in all, the connectivity of the seasons improve my opinion of the first season. The story overall, with its relevance to the life of several well known mangakas, is excellent. Also, it's worth noting that the main characters are analogous to the authors of Bakuman, who also happen to be the authors of Death Note. So that's another great thing about the story, how the specialty of the main characters is in creating dark cult like stories not necessarily always in line with the flashy battle storiesby shonen jump. I loved the story from start to finish, and the relationship between the two main characters has been orchestrated with perfection, perhaps because Obata and Ohba share a similar relationship. My only criticism, the only reason I took away a few points from character development and story, is the dynamic between the main character and his love interest. It's a little too corny, and mostly in the first season. In the 2nd and 3rd season, it's definitely more mature. This review is probably too specific to be helpful to anyone, I'm writing it mostly cause I loved it. And if there's anything you ought to take from this review, it's that you should watch it. It's very exciting, and it's great to watch what the stories and hardships of the authors whose work we enjoy so much.",

Well, I was wrong.\r\nThe journey to be mangaka, Ashirogi Muto, is finally end. With the coolest and happy ending. The ending can be predicted from the beginning but oh well, without knowing their journey, it's not interesting, you know.\r\nMashiro,as usually, with his dere dere towards Azuki, while Azuki becomes bolder, which I think it's good for this pair as at first, they have almost the same personality (from my POV). \r\nShuujin/Akito, ashe's finally becoming the husband of Kaya-chan, I really hope that the final chapter shows us about he, being a father. (sorry, I don't read this manga, and I'll after this) A little bit disappointing but oh well, Shuujin is saikou!\\n\\n\r\nThe most cutest character ever, Niizuma Eiji-chan! I really love when until the end, he treats Ashirogi Muto as his rival, even though he always surpass them. I love his eccentric behavior, his words and oh, everything! 10/10 for him!\\n\\n\r\nKnowing that the most beautiful mangaka marries with the less expected person makes me feel, 'ah~ i have a chance to marry a handsome guy too in the future'. Lol, but I'm so happy for them!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, unfortunately I dislike it as for me, the anime like this should have an opening song sings by a guy, but fortunately they used different song in the middle of the series. But, the opening song of the first series is my most favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really love this series. And yes, I feel lost at first after finishing this, and I hope they make maybe specials (after Mashiro and Azuki's married life). More Eiji, please!\\n\\n\r\nDid I give some spoiler? I'm sorry, but I think it doesn't make you lost interest with this series, right? \\n\r\nYOU SHOULD BE WATCHING!\\n",

            "content": "As a longtime fan of this series, I do not take any pleasure in giving a poor review of this season of the show.  The series up to this point, although it hasn't broken any traditions and was not necessarily original, it had a lot of heart and told a fantastic tale of friendship and creativity.  Unfortunately,  the third season does not, in my opinion live up to the standards of the original 2 seasons, and seeing as it has received nothing but rave reviews so far, I see it as my responsibility to clarify a few points.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story continuesimmediately from the previous season.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to go anywhere with it.  It holds to the same themes of enduring friendship, perseverance (which is a fantastic thing in moderation), and love that lasts forever.  Thee only thing that really changes is the adulthood factor the takes place in this season, which shows their maturity as adults and in relationships and in viewing younger people or noobies to their field of work.  Unfortunately, this does not play well with this series as it effectively takes away a lot of the emotional connectivity with the audience and the youthful spirit of thee show.  Even the idea of their manga creation gets played down and is less creative which is a significant part of the show, simply to make more room for unnecessary plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nI may be being a bit harsh with giving this section only a 6, but it was one of my biggest qualms with this season of the series.  Effectively, they have changed the quality of their art and humor by try to convey it completely through the facial expressions of the characters even going so far as to change the person's personality in the show completely in order to fit the \"comical\" value they are trying to get across.  This has always been one of my least favorite things about anime.  I know there are some people who love this facet of anime, and I appreciate that, but in my personal opinion it does not support the facets of this show.  They also don't go anywhere at all with the art and are not creative in an way. about what they could do with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nThe music and sound in this series is amazing and although the music never changes really, they do well with fitting the music and sound effects to the situation the characters are in.  The only thing that has gone downhill and this is simply my personal opinion is the opening and closing music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\r\nThe characters really make this show, and they still have the same basic tendencies that we all love and know.  Development, although skewed at times has changed them in ways that are enjoyable or understandable and the introduction of new characters that are fantastic gains to the series have really supported this show in a great way.  The only qualms I have are with previous stated facts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nI find this season so far to be bland and quite cliche.  Not much more I can say, although i can appreciate the growing up factor it is definitely not a bad thing but it just doesn't do anything.  The art changes have really thrown me off and reduced my enjoyment from a 9 to a 6 which is a lot when it comes to me.  (6's according to me are watchable time passers)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7",

            "content": "This anime/manga is all about fulfilling dreams. If you're a dreamer, if you're an anime/manga enthusiast, if you are a writer, then this one is for you.\r\nI'm speaking as a general watcher--yes, not because I'm a writer myself. I have watched Death Note, stupendous I can say because it truly is an unorthodox anime. Knowing the same creative duo brought this 'Bakuman' (means something about 'Gamble' manga), who doesn't want to watch it?\r\nI'll want to write a review on Bakuman itself, not just season 3. And let me tell you, it has got to be one of the greatest anime ever lived. Not just because,we are biased to the authors, but because it has contributed to the anime industry openly and lovingly--to the fans and the makers. Anime and manga are art. This anime will pretty much burst out of its endless passion for it, and, how, living the dream as a Manga artist isn't impossible. But, it takes courage, determination, and eternal hard work. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime will also go on teaching you the very process of it. It's true that the authors (Ohba & Obata) have sort of given this as a gift. They have strayed away from their usual dark manga, but decided to go light! With a slice-of-life, though the enjoyment is real because the dark touch is actually the author, Takagi Akito has as a talent. Ironically, people will say this is different from Death Note but looking from the inside the authors might as well are playing by experimenting real passion with help from the outside (real) world. \\n\\n\r\n'The Verdict'\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very engaging. It is also fast-paced, I've noticed, that the authors are precise on what they want to accomplish in an episode. The themes are very beautiful, it will really get onto anyone's hearts. Friendship, dreams, love--it's a repetitious melody. Beautiful to the extreme level. \\n\\n\r\nThough I was quite disappointed with the art. There is a big gap between Death Note and Bakuman, such as the anatomy of the bodies (Takagi's chin????), and the 'heroine''s look Miho which other female characters have stood out more (i. e Nanami, the voice actress). They are not really compelling as Death Note, who had Misa-Misa's gothic fashion and L's outlandish (but striking) appearance. But I appreciate how Takagi looked like Death Note's protagonist, Yagami Light, lol. But anyway, the facial expressions on the characters are neatly drawn. \\n\\n\r\nMay I just say that the OST is beautiful? The song is titled 'Key and Hurdle'. There is a saying that music compliments the scenes' emotions and this one really spoke out and lived up to it. It was one of the reasons I couldn't stop watching, or, I couldn't stop thinking of Bakuman. The memory is already instilled to me, I needed to get back to it. And not to mention the comedic OST are suited perfectly. If you're not laughing, are you human? (Kudos)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are enormously benevolent in their own way. I believe that the only antagonist (forgive the term) or the one that was a struggle to the authors was the Chief Editor, Sasaki, lol. But it was good. It was best pressuring them. Without that pressure, they wouldn't have shone like diamonds and made it to their goal. Hattori-senpai is truly an artist. What I admire about the anime is how, based on my research, a few or most characters are based off on real life. Think what would they say if they saw the anime, which was filled with adventures brought by heart-warming relationships of the people who have worked their lives for manga, how they have developed from the inside and come into important realizations and life-learnings, such as the; value of friends; the accomplishment of a dream; you'll always learn something from the people around you and that's a fact. What only aggravated me the most was that the first two seasons were extremely sexist. The third season made an improvement by giving Miho the successful career of a voice actress. Other than that, women here seemed to be portrayed as scorching bitter women, dumb, useless. I am sad that this is how they view women in Japanese culture. Very disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThe sense of rivalry here is wondrously portrayed. Rivals and friends like Fuukuda, Hakumi, Aoki, and of course Niijima Eiji--such beautiful souls they are. Always working, always doing their best. Always catching up to one another but not taking it personally. Immortal opponents, but friends at heart. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character has got to be Eiji! Eiji, Eiji! He's so sweet. Because Eiji is an image of a very passionate person, to the point of becoming an extremist, sometimes eccentric person. But that's his life, that's how he got there, and it's one of the most exemplifying traits of Ohba: to make uniqueness unforgettable. (PLEASE: it made me embrace my anime-lover side)\\n\\n\r\nFuukuda's voice actor voiced Akatsuki from Vampire Knight, and I could say that he's my 2nd favorite because of his badass character. I love him! \\n\\n\r\nBakuman is the most worthy anime. Watch it not just only for the sake of learning the writer pro's. Watch it not only because its authors are surely experienced. Watch it not just because it's about two middle-schoolers dreaming to become successful manga authors one day (a dream that is most unlikely to ANYONE today, assuming there is absolutely no guarantee and that success depends solely upon the individual)--but because such dream is possible. And watch it right in front of your eyes. \\n\\n\r\nThe stars are just upon your reach :)\\n\\n",

You have 75 episodes of buildup and when all is said and done, it doesn't do the plot of the entire series justice. Mashiro takes forever to propose and when he does, the show's practically over. They made a joke at the end about not showing the ceremony. What a waste. They should have cut some of the pointless filler about Mashiro's crazy fan and his little ordeal by an episode or two instead and elaborated more at the ending.",

            "content": "It's one of my firm beliefs that something can only be truly judged, when placed in the context of things that came before or after it. So after rating all 3 seasons of bakuman 10, I can only say that whilst each individual series may not be a 10, when placed in the context of the series as a whole each series plays its part spectacularly. That said, my only real gripe about the show is that because it's listed under 3 separate entries on MAL it'll skew my average rankings. \r\n    What's so great about this show is that it setsup a clear premise nice and early, then due to how the material is approached that rather simple premise is enough to carry the viewer through the show. This in turn allows them to pace themselves with the narrative, take their time and flesh out some of the key themes and characters. Whilst watching i was worried that the setup between Miho and Mashiro ran the risk of taking too much of a back-seat and feeling unconvincing in the conclusion, but it's worked into the plot enough that you never forget why Mashiro is doing Manga. Even though the plot is extremely focused on the Manga side of things it never really stops being a romance. \\n\r\n     In truth there's almost nothing i didn't enjoy about this anime and to a person like me i would recommend without a moments hesitation. Having said that i think that part of why i enjoy this show so much is that i'm someone who is quite interested in anime and manga(albeit to a much smaller degree) so someone who wasn't as much might not enjoy it in turn. It's certainly not a show you could introduce someone to anime with (unlike FMAB, another of my 10's) but purely objectively this is practically perfect.",

After 75 ep with I think most of the audience want a really unforgottable and happy ending.(spoiler attention)\r\nStory(10/10)\r\n  Ashirogi Mutou finally create a manga which can beat Eiji. Reversi is a well written story and as much similar as Death Note. Azuki is hard-working so that she finally gets the herione. The whole story of Baukman teach us 'A dream is not something that someone tells you to go for,it is something you fulfill of your own will'. The story is really heartshaking and told us Baukman would be an anime to be remember forever\r\nArt(9/10)\r\n  The arttell us simple is good, no any bloody scence, just a few fighting scene, the art is perfect match with an anime that is slice of life, not very colourful but tell us Dream is colourful. The kissing scene between Saikou and Miho is also wonderful,  the animation of the openings are also marvelous. Nothing can be challenge in Bakuman art and animation.\\n\r\nSound(8/10)\\n\r\nAfter I listen to the first opening of Baukman 3 , I fell a bit frustrated, the voice is rally strange and nothing matching with Bakuman . Moreover, even the scenod openig, it is not as good as Bukuman's and Bakuman 2 's. The ost and ending in Bakuman 3 is also not outstanding, it is propably quite good only.\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10)\\n\r\n Beacuse of the disadvantage that Bakuman and Bakuman 2. Therefore the character characteristic has alrady been fixed. However, Bakuman 3 let the character further developed, Saikou with a characteristic that never give up, Shujin with a characteristc that is a bit negative, Miho's staunch although no one can hug her when she was down. Kaya crys when their dream come successfully. Hattori believe in Ashirogi Mutou. Eiji waiting for an strong enemy,etc. Bakuman 3 tell us more and more about what they are hoping for, what they are doing for, let the characters went on to a more higher level.\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10)\\n\r\n I can't think any reason that I won't enjoy Bakuman 3. Having a long series for 75 ep, but I never felt boring, PCP, The truth classroom, Zombie Gun, Crow, Reversi. Every manga in the story has a uniqe idea. Crow wih an epic ending and with 19 pages which has no any lines. The truth classroom with an wonderful idea that you can't tell lie or you will dead. PCP wih and diffent style that only use brain for crating perfect crime. Last but not least. Reversi as similar as Death Note but which only has 49 chapters, I think the mangaka of Bakuman( and also Death Note) want to have a story that without any other useless materials like Reversi and the first half part of Death Note. I think many of you guys are also moved after Miho get the herione and they finally kiss and fulill their dream together. If You want to try an anime  that is about manga and anime, you must try Bakuman, If you are an anime fans which are looking forward to have something different, You should check out Bakuman.\\n\r\nOverall(10/10) Baukman*v*",

            "content": "Here is my review of all three seasons of Bakuman. I left out any main spoilers that it why I don't put in too much detail. (This is my first review)\r\nStory - 9 -  Bakuman has a great story about two boys who decide to start writing manga together in middle school and their attempt to fulfill their dreams by becoming the most popular manga author(s) in Jack. This story takes place over the span of 10 years which is what I think makes it so good. It's not just a story about some boys who want to become manga artists and they areso good that they just rise strait to the top in a year. No, this romantic story follows them though their high and low points in their journey to become the best so that in the end they can fulfill the dreams and promises that they made to friends and family. \\n\\n\r\nArt/animation - 8 - The art and animation in Bakuman is very nice and suits the story very well. The reason I am giving it a 8 and not a 9 is that there are some points in the show which turned me off. These being the crude art during the faces that the main characters make now and then. Now, I'm not saying it was totally bad but it turned me off a little. But that being said it was easy to move past it and enjoy the rest of the art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 -The OP and ED of Bakuman were very well done and they really made me want to listen/watch them all the was though.  The music in the rest of Bakuman was also suited it very well and I have nothing bad to say about it. It was more than enough to make the show enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9 - Now I think the characters is where Bakuman really shines. The main characters Mashiro and Takagi are both relatable and likable which makes you get attached to them and root for them to fulfill their dreams.  While the main characters are great, they also have a very interesting and enjoyable supporting cast. These are mainly other manga artists which all have quite different personalities to each other which brings a nice variety to the show and keeps the audience from getting bored from too much repetition from the main characters.\\n\r\n  Favourite male characters - Takagi, Niizuma and Hiramaru\\n\r\n  Favourite male characters - Miho, Yuriko and Miyoshi\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 - My enjoyment of Bakuman slowly but steadily increased during the 3 seasons of the show ( If I had to rate each season it would be 8.1, 8.5, 9) . I would recommend this show to anyone who reads manga or even only has an interest in it.\\n\\n\r\n Before watching this anime I mainly watched anime and only read a few manga. But I can say that while this show is very enjoyable and I think it should at least be on everyone's 'Plan to watch' list, I think the true value of this show is making people understand just how much time and effort goes into making the manga that eventually turns  into the anime that we enjoy so much. Might go and read some manga now... bye....\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful in some way. Feedback is appreciated.",

            "content": "So what do we have here? My, it's the 3rd season of Bakuman and if by any chance you follow my reviews and you wonder where is my review for the 2nd one... I was bored out of my mind and my vodka supplies were running low so i couldn't bother to write one. But here i am bothering with the last and maybe i'll throw some things from 2nd season as well to keep you happy.\r\nAnd let's start with the story, which is a very easy task to pull through since i suppose you have gone through 2 seasons of Bakuman so...It's more orless the same but instead of having the disasterous adventures of a failure of an editor aka Miura, we get the un-marvelous small journey of a dickhead mangaka going by the name of... Erm... Nanamune, Nanaminer... Something like that who gives a fuck anyways?\\n\\n\r\nI think that the plotline could be a lot better if they done without the Nanafucker thingy which in my mind was a waste of time. Sure i guess you could say that there are cocks like him in the industry and they needed to point that out but i think it would be better still if they could take some more time to flesh out the relationships that were forming in this season. But i guess Bakuman after 3 seasons couldn't get the damn romance thing right which is like watching a 70 yr old virgin man putting the moves on an 18 yr old hottie.\\n\\n\r\nThink about Azuki's and Mashiro's relationshit.. FOR 10 YEARS THEY'VE ONLY BEEN TEXTING AND TALKED OVER THE PHONE 10 TIMES.. What the freakin' hell is that? Are you about to tell me that in the age of 17 and above where teen's hormones are going through the roof and into the dark deep space and into galaxies where we can't reach with rockets they did without... Well, sex of any kind? Not even a little masturbation on the side just for kicks? And they got married without even her checking his plumbing?\\n\\n\r\nAnd sadly it's not just their romance that suffers from the obvious unrealism it's every single relationship in the series and i do mean each and every one. And it's not just that they are unrealistic it's also the fact that that they are way too rushed. If i put it in terms of car acceleration, the romance starts from 0 now and after 2 secs it's reached 120 mls/hour and it's running out of runway. And if that was car that would be ok although all your organs would be thin dust after the fact but we're talking human relationships and 0-60 times are quite irrelevant, don't ya think?\\n\\n\r\nOther than the useless attempt at romancing everything else is as good as ever and the main duo is like a Trojan tank that destroys everything in its' way. And like i said in my 1st season review that's where Bakuman's strenth lies, in the way it delivers the manga making process and the duo's emotions shine through the animation, be it for good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves we got 2 \"main\" new additions which just passed me by to be honest. 1 was Nanamine and the other was his editor whose name i can't be bother to remember and looks like Mashiro would look like with a bit longer hair and glasses so to hell with them.. As for the rest? Most of them were the assistants of each mangaka who surprisingly had more screen time than characters like Miyoshi and Azuki...Azuki still is more of a plot point rather than a character although they gave her some screen time towards the very end of the series and Miyoshi is still the unsung hero of the series and one i would love to see more but life's a bitch. In fact the main duo takes almost a massive 80% or so of the show,but that was to be expected to be honest since the writers are fundamentally men and can't do more than one thing at the same time. Oh yeah they brought back Fat McFlabby aka Nakai who is the same shameless waste of blood and organs..Maybe there are more but i can't be bothered so watch for yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the music and VA's which were...More of the same old same old kind of deal, not good nor bad. VA's were very good indeed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd onto the animation part which for me was again the same kinda deal we got in the past seasons,nothing changed at all.. And one would think that they would at least bother to change the characters a tad since it's 10 years since the start of the anime but they still look the same. Other than that minor detail i would personally like to see, total mediocrity and the same character designs taken from all eras of anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow i may have worded my review to seem like it's a pointless waste of time but in all truth, the damn thing had me glued to the screen like no other. Despite the glaring issues the writers had with making relationships work like relationships, despite it's neither here or there animation and not using most of the characters as well as they should... It's still a very nice slice of life anime. It's still not the best out there by any means,nor the most realistic one you'll find in terms of basic human interactions but it's fun and such a joy to watch that in the end those faults didn't matter. On that front Bakuman does what most anime won't achieve in a lifetime.",

I absolutely love it. \r\nThere is one thing that must be noted (although you should already be aware of this). This anime is NOT for new anime-lovers. This anime is about a 'mangaka' and the entertainment (manga and anime) industry in Japan. Some newcomers will be confused right from Season 1 Episode 1. They will probably be switched off and discard it. That's just an FYI.\r\nOther than that, this anime gets a '9' for me. The characters are relatable and their developments is amazing. \r\nBe prepared tocry a few times though since there are moments when you just can' t take it. Maybe it's just me? I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a really good anime. This is my first review on this website so I hope I was at least a little bit helpful. I'm sure you will enjoy it!\\n\\n\r\n-Joggerx35-\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10",

            "content": "There are so few anime which can entertain, move and at the same time teach. Bakuman is a very special anime because it takes the viewer across 75 episodes and shows an actual journey worth travelling with a terrific emotional power packed ending. As the manga depicted in the anime shows, too many popular anime are dragged on unnecessarily simply for business, while neglecting the power of a story which actually chooses to end itself. Therefore, if you are tired of watching anime which have horrible or inconclusive endings - I present to you Bakuman seasons 1, 2 and 3.\r\nWhat makes the whole story special?\r\n1.Characters - at the heart of the story the relationship between the mains, their love interests and the brilliantly realised ensemble support cast - carries the show. In general their trials and challenges show what a tough industry manga is and in some ways is an indictment on the problem of overwork in Japan - hence the uncle dying from overwork. In fact it was a common theme for the main characters to go without sleep for days to finish a manga.\\n\\n\r\nIt is in their journey and growth that you come to know and love those characters - you feel for their dreams and hope they can succeed. When Ashirogi Muto gets a serialization you can feel the happiness with them. If you love a story with great characters - this is a shining example.\\n\\n\r\n2. Pacing - overall - it's a series where the pacing is done really well. Although some episodes may feel like filler, in the overall scheme, I suspect the closeness you feel with the characters rely on watching their ups and downs. Each episode is interesting and draws you in.\\n\\n\r\n3. Focused story - although there are side arcs, the overall theme and focus is clear and it basically comes back to it time and again. This theme is the willingness to work and keep trying for your dream. It's so refreshing to see them grow from middle schoolers, to high school to working young adults. Although there is marriage in the series, the story does not get distracted too much by other issues, e.g. children or married life.\\n\\n\r\nWeaknesses:\\n\r\n1. Plot loopholes and inconsistencies - it is the right of the author to allow coincidence to solve all your problems - but perhaps this device is used a bit too often at times, e.g. all the occasions that the 2 mains have conflict are often resolved by coincidental same thinking. \\n\\n\r\n2. Music and soundtrack - not really memorable but certainly functional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses and I have to say that watching this series has been a true pleasure. One of the best series - I'd say in it's genre of slice of life and shounen it is easily in the top 3 of all time.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nGeneral whole franchise \"review\"\r\n(...)\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nSuperb first-love story. Anime whole focus is about life of mangaka, their efforts and progress towards making great manga and fulfilling their dream. Oddly enough sub-plot of this Anime that main guy wish is to marry a girl. And a dream/promise between main guy and the girl. Their first love story with a dream getting married when MC becomes successful mangaka, until then they must not see each other. A beautiful vanilla love story, their awkward, embarrassing & cute encounters. This subplot had morevalue than the actual mangaka part of the story for me.\\n\\n\r\nMangaka part of the story was fun generally, just topic wasn't as fun here. Did like the characters reactions & progression. Very shounen'esque \"sweaty\" element of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, very cute love story and adventure/excitement packed mangaka side of the story. Did have satisfying finale alongside of side-characters \"finale\".\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nOdd character design with great art. Very oval facial designs, but was appealing enough. Old-school odd characters (odd facial expressions, some characters), but solid and clean art & animation overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music & OST, honestly, I cannot remember most of them. There were few goods OST but can't remember any worthwhile song. Some OST were, great but overall rating is good enough.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Characters\\n\r\nI'm going to only characters in a very general way.\\n\r\nWe have 2 main characters and 1 love interest with more focus.  MC 1 is thick-headed dreamy yet serious type. Very awkward with the girl he loves (easily embarrassed, dreamy). The love interest who is really mysterious, kind, shy and mostly quiet, yet strong and assertive at times. Really love her, she managed to reach my \"waifu blog entry\". As well very awkward with love interest. Rest won't comment, as rest is within the progression & Would be a spoiler.\\n\\n\r\n2nd main guy is a more \"flamboyant\" type, serious & smart. But has oddly soft & weaker side. Here I wan't to mention love interest. His love interest is also more assertive, energetic type. She feels quite a loose and non-serious type. But about her In my entry comment tab.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for rest of the cast, I'm not sure if to comment anymore. Lot of characters with lot of unique personalities. Some are quite unlikable while some are likable. Lot of standard and non-standard stereotypes. Anyhow, very fun character cast.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nIt was superb vanilla love story, got me emotional and grin from cuteness. Also the manga shounen'esque aspect was exciting and as well got from drama emotional fair amount of times.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, almost a masterpiece, the topic and the focus of the topic made me lose interest at times. And a bit of a weak music/ost was another sure point down.",

            "content": "3 Seasons Combined Review\r\nAt first i thought that i should watch all seasons and then write a combined review but after it was all done it was too much to write so instead i will do a (Pro/Con) list for the main elements of the show\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nPros:\r\n- A good take on the Manga industry although i am sure that the real thing is more complicated than this it was good to have some sort of insight (Simplified as it was)\r\n- A good amount of Drama. The whole thing moved to high gear halfway through the second season and it was going up after that. TheRomance idea was extremely far fetched but was still great to watch as the lack of day to day interaction actually made it better and less clich\u00e9 imo\\n\r\n- Good comedy\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Some stuff get a little repetitive\\n\r\n- It was kind of predictable, so there was no suspense factor for me.\\n\r\n- Although the show was trying to show how \"cutthroat\" the manga industry is. It was extremely lenient with the MC at some points which took away from the realism enjoyment and added to it's predictability I mentioned\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- A huge cast with many great characters that ranged from completely nuts to simple and lovable\\n\r\n- Kaya Miyoshi (Best Girl) :D\\n\r\n- Kouji Yoshida (Simply loved his scenes) :D\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Barely noticeable character main characters growth. The anime (in it's 3 seasons) supposedly spanned 10 years but even to it's last episodes i still felt like i was watching a high school drama\\n\r\n- Everyone is so fuckin understanding o_O I mean what thae actual fuck. I realize that this a Shounen anime but things need to have a limit\\n\r\n- Related to the point above, the show also lacked real assholes. one can have too much \"Friendly rivalry\" to last a lifetime in this show\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- For an anime about Manga it offer some really great and different types of art\\n\r\n- Environments and character design was good\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- It had some issues with size a depth perception\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Catchy and upbeat OPs and EDs\\n\r\n- Good voice acting\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- The soundtrack (during the actual anime) was repetitive. I believe it was the same during all three seasons\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (7/10):\\n\r\nIt was a good and entertaining show with a good amount of drama and comedy and sweet (Although super imaginary) romance but it was \"Too Shounen\" if this was an actual term\\n\r\nif that aspect was toned down a bit i would have enjoyed a lot more\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.4/10)",

            "content": "And so begins the final chapters of Ashirogi Muto...\r\nBakuman's Final Season shows us the culmination and the finale of the duo Ashirogi Muto and them trying to achieve their dreams with all the trials and tribulations to go with it.\r\nFirst thing is first would just to get the faults of this third season out of the way. LA's first gripe with this third season would be the new rival in the form of Tooru Nanamine voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana who appears quite early in the anime, he is essentially what would have happened if Ashirogi Muto and Miura's author-editor relationship worsened and Nanamine is straightup a villain in this anime, NOT rival. His schemes and tactics to undermine Ashirogi Muto and thinking his way of doing things are superior is annoyingly blatantly evil, for comparison Eijii Niizuma's rivalry towards Ashirogi Muto is friendly rivalry to better each other and encourage one another to do their best, Nanamine's involvement with Ashirogi Muto just felt out of left field and yes although LA could see the benefits of Nanamine in the anime in the ways of showing what happens when an author use underhanded and *ahem* focus group testing to be published and showing what happens when you NEVER listen your editor will bring you, but as soon as he came in, he utterly disappears from the anime making his presences all the more baffling why he was in the anime. The second fault and this is pretty minor but it's the animation done by JC Staff, while for the most part, the animation was up to it's typical standard, LA found some rare derpy faces here and there. LA isn't angry at this but just wanted to bring it up. Well aside from that...let's move on to what this third and final season did right.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman's Final Season gave Ashirogi Muto more risks and to what LA could see from this season was a much sharper focus to Ashirogi Muto evolving and bettering themselves to achieve their dream. From Mashiro overloaded with how much work he needs to get through even with 4 assistants and him needing a hand and calling out for that help as stubborn as he is, Mashiro bettering himself by even attempting multiple serializations at once. Takagi got some of this through the media that affected his writing in a major way and this went onto to affect one of their serializations and the risk of that serialization blowing up in front of them, Takagi got through some emotional factors from him always wanting to help Mashiro's dream through improving his own and even when backed into a corner, Ashirogi Muto found a way out of it. Together as Ashirogi Muto, they faced risks from their serializations from executive meddling to aforementioned media drama and even Azuki gets in this through a huge media \"scandal\". This also brings up a VERY good point in the form of Azuki, from the few times we saw her in both seasons, the final season finally gave Azuki focus in trying to go through her own trial for their dream. If anything it just emphasized even more from the second season that even though Mashiro and Azuki only went through a long distance relationship and rarely met that Mashiro and Azuki were meant to be together through thick and thin and this development was amazing for LA all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nNow secondary characters also get their time in the limelight, the most surprising for LA being Hiramaru and Aoki of all people, LA just didn't expect it, LA can't spoil but seriously...it's just dumbfounding how the gag character like Hiramaru got into the situation he got himself onto the lovable idiot. Nakai also comes back this season and he kinda sunk himself lower by affiliating himself with Nanamine though he didn't know at the time but got better when he's paired with Hiramaru and ummm yeah hijinks ensues as per usual. Eijii Niizuma got a strong focus this season by being the most serious he had been in Bakuman's screentime by not playing the nice guy and going all out to be the best adversary to Ashirogi Muto and really giving the rivalry some of the most intense moments of this season, add that to Ashirogi Muto's mutual rivalry to outdo Eijii Niizuma and we have pretty much one of the best rivalries in Bakuman going all full force. Shun Shiratori voiced by Yuuichi Iguchi a new assistant to Ashirogi Muto also gets a mini arc involving him and his family disparity with manga and although this is something you've seen time and again...LA was indifferent to it and felt like a much more melodramatic version of what happened with Takahama but still at least Shun better than and involved more than Nanamine was. \\n\\n\r\nDue to this being the \"final\" season, it's also expected that we get to see many of the characters and how they are doing by the epilogue of this season and by all means they do what they do best, though the focus of this final season had much more of focus on Ashirogi Muto and them achieving their dreams it's to be expected that something like this was gonna happen to finish off the anime, so LA didn't mind the secondary character taking a backseat heck they really didn't as LA said before, they are still going about their lives in the mangaka industry doing their own thing and bettering themselves to outbeat Ashirogi Muto and Eijii Niiizuma.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of \"finishing off\", the final season DID finish it's story of Ashirogi Muto, from achieving their dreams of having a manga getting an anime serialization (which might as well be a prototype Death Note, no seriously) and getting Azuki to voice the main female lead. Romance wise, this gave Mashiro the final push in making Bakuman have a fulfilling romance rarely seen in anime and mind you at the first season LA was REALLY skeptical about Mashiro and Azuki's relationship but by the final season LA had been converted and just pushing for this romance to work and have their happy ending and this only helped with the more intense dramatic moments of this season. Add in the secondary characters \"where are they now\" and we have one damn good finale all things considered and LA was rooting for Ashirogi Muto to succeed even by the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBakuman's final season is a masterpiece in it's own right, right next to it's second season, though with some faults LA found from Nanamine, rare derpy faces and the narrow focus to Ashirogi Muto's dreams and all but LA just found that the second season was better even if the final season gave off a FINISHED anime with an amazing and fulfilling ending, there was just something missing for LA when watching the third season that the second season had and done much better. \\n\\n\r\nSo although the final season wasn't the \"perfect masterpiece\" LA was wanting it to be (and even at that LA wasn't truly disappointed) in LA's Bakuman second season review but as a whole, Bakuman as a series itself is still a masterpiece of anime in it's own right, faults and all and that is completely ok, even masterpieces takes faults and flaws head on before chipping itself away to be the diamond in the ruff.",

            "content": "Bakuman is one of the anime/manga series which describe the manga itself, about the rating,the hardship, etc. It was a great show to watch, it gave us knowledge and also the 2 main character have great teamwork which is refreshing unlike every other cliche animes where MC best friend is for comedic purpose only. \r\nBefore i start this review please take a few note:\r\n1.This review is for ALL bakuman series\r\n2.This review might contain spoiler for 1st& 2nd season\r\nBakuman, one of my most favourite anime and is great to watch. Its story is about a young man named Mashiro and Takagi who want to reach theirdream and want to be a mangaka. \\n\r\nThe 1st season is about one of the manga they made got into serialization. The 2nd introduce us some funny character and how they make another manga that could surpass his work before and get anime adaptation to marry the girl he love. The 3rd season cover the story completely with a great character development betweeen the MC and the main heroines.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the greatest strength of this anime is not the story, it is the uniqueness and the knowledge. Its so goddamn unique that ppl will not forget about it. Rather than reading wiki and google nowaday, there's an anime that resolve around the production of the manga, staff etc it become an anime that even if we didnt like a single bit of it story, gave us sufficient knowledge and entertaiment. Along with funny side character, the story become fun and not boring. They tolerate the repetitive plot in this story, that make me feel that each one of them is important (except that one motherfucker i'll explain later). So to summarize, the story is unique, pretty much filler free, and one that can make you laugh your ass off. (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing unique, nothing new but not bad either. Well its pretty bad if you compare to nowadays animation like ufotable one, oh wait...  \\n\r\nI'd like to give the art (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound.... 1st opening is boring 2nd one is decent, others are pretty much average for me. Someone might get angry for this but the OP and ED didnt really work for this. The OST, i didnt remember any except when mashiro hold azuki hand... (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the part i hate the most. Character.\\n\r\nThe main character(2 main protagonist) is doing great at the 1st season but at the 2nd they pretty much controlled by a shit editor, i mean shit. That kind of person that didnt know anything but take everything as an \"OK this will work for sure\". But honestly at the 2nd season the worst character is not him, it is the main characters itself. Why did they agree on everything he told. Once Takagi rebel him but the next time, they agreed to him and make everything worse. Their rival which is a fan didnt even read them. And with 12th ranking in weekly spot why the fuck this 2 MCs still continue to believe what the editor said. If they really are aiming for anime and also smart enough to stand with a genious in manga, why cant they think about it, about who is right and who is wrong. The 3rd season is fine because finally our Hattori is back\\n\\n\r\nPut that shithead aside, lets get to the side characters. The are not really any antagonist in this series. Niizuma eiji is a protagonist too,and also hope that Ashirogi Mutou to succes. So with no main antagonist (there is 1 but got wiped so quickly)this series is doing really fine, i mean GREAT. Every side character is fun to watch. Fukuda is unique of its style.Eiji is genius. Hiramaru is... everyone favourite i guess. Others too , even nakai become likeable character at the end. 3rd season also introduced to some char, and they all cool and unique too\\n\\n\r\nBUT, The side char overpower main char in either comedy, romance and actions. Comedy? take a look at Hiramaru. Romance? Take a look at Hiramaru. Action? Take a look at Fukuda team when blockade TRAP. They are seriously great in every single section. Each side character take one main role, either is for comedy,or rival, or leadership. Then what is the main character really stand out for? The answer is dedication and seriousness also strategy. But some side own this as well thats why i think the MCs in this show arent strong enough\\n\\n\r\nOh and Azuki is a plot device i mean smiling device at 1st season, she just need to check  email and smile at 1st season, 2nd she finally get stronger and 3rd season she become a star on its own. Sadly the star isnt strong enough to make this anime become a great romance anime as well\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 aside from char and repetitive story this series succeed in entertaining me so Overall ill still give it a 9/10, a near perfect anime\\n\r\nThx for reading",

            "content": "This is one of the best anime, I have watched other than Tokyo Godfathers and GTO. It had an amazing plot and it gives us a deeper understanding of the 'mangaka' world. The art was also well done and the character development was great. This kept me on the edge of the seat every time. I recommend this show to those who like shows like Barakamon or people who like manga more than anime! The show would have been even more amazing if they had included the the plot of 'Reversi' in the anime and if they showed Mashiro and Azuki getting married.\r\nNoice.\r\nEnjoy!",
