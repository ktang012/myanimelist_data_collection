The plot can be fully expressed by the following 4 lines of text:\\n\\n\r\n1. Someone has a problem which nobody can solve - IF ONLY somebody could use THAT ONE specific spell that would immediately solve the problem!\\n\r\n2. Gary Stu comes along by coincidence and uses THAT ONE spell.\\n\r\n3. The problem is solved, Someone falls for Gary Stu.\\n\r\n4. Back to 1\\n\\n\r\nThe only measure of plot progress in this series is the number of girls that are in love with the main character. At any point in the series, if you can think of multiple variations of how the plot might play out, you can almost be certain that the show will choose the blandest of them. Every character in the show can be fully expressed in less than 10 words, a fact that won't change no matter how many episodes of screentime they get.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the technical part:\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are painfully mediocre, nothing stands out except for some really terrible lip synching.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack's only purpose is to tell you how you should feel at any given moment. Sadly, it doesn't do a good job, for it only leaves you with feelings of disgust and shame as you ponder what went wrong in your life for you to end up watching another episode of this atrocity.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you are really bored and still want to watch this show, all of the following leisure time activities will probably leave you more satisfied:\\n\\n\r\n       + Watching a good series instead\\n\r\n       + Reading a book\\n\r\n       + Laying in bed\\n\r\n       + Staring at a brick wall\\n\r\n       + Watching paint dry\\n\r\n       + Repeatedly slamming your fingers with a door\\n\r\n       + Doing literally anything else\\n\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\nIf you want a comprehensive guide on how NOT to do writing, this has got you covered.\\n",

            "content": "You know, when the main Japanese demographic your anime markets towards ends up hating your anime, then you know it blows chunks. Not even pretty girls can remedy that fact. I should\u2019ve listened to OtaKing. Well, rationality is incomprehensible to anyone involved with this show's existence. If you don't want to see a rant on this crappy piece of work that is the cheap bootleg equivalent to Konosuba and an insult to harems, isekai, and entertainment, leave immediately. The gloves come off and the spell of death is cast.\r\nCreative bankruptcy. It's something that any artist of any medium worth his or her salt should dreadwhen creating a work. It's when the art has no soul of any kind, no artistic purpose behind it, meant only for the money. That brings us to our target: Isekai wa Smartphone. This pile of insufferable, bland, incompetent dreck can fuck off for giving harem and isekai shows a bad name (more so than they already have), and for not caring about being a show for people to watch. It has no soul, no drive, and is just an example of corporate greed and a lack of care by literally everyone involved in every aspect of production, outside of the voice actors. It is the antithesis of spellbinding, as it half-heartedly casts the spell of boredom and hatred.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime can't establish anything properly. It can't establish magic until way after it was used and even then the system, especially concerning null, is stupid. It doesn't establish the idea of guilds properly at all. The gauntlets, the currency, none of it! Part of it is because its worldbuilding is beyond atrocious, and there are gigantic leaps and lies, so yeah. Oh, here\u2019s an example! When a butler got hit with an arrow offscreen, how? Apparently he and the guys he was with were surrounded by lizards with swords and shields, so that can't work, and apparently part of it broke off and... yeah. Also, inconsistent magic since they say the only way to use magic (except maybe null) was with special designated crystals yet they violate that multiple times. Oh, and the protagonist knows literally every magic ever, including the personal null ones, which are already a bad system due to being contradictory (since they're supposed to be unique but they're recorded in ways that imply more people can use these null spells, but they're each limited to a few people at a time), and heck, the magic system as a while had its own tuned violated constantly with people constantly using elemental magic without a magical fragment catalyst, so fuck this anime\u2019s own rules, amirite?! Oh, and they just randomly and haphazardly insert us into a bunch of scenarios for the characters to quickly solve and have no remote emotional effect on the audience or even have any meaningful things for the characters aside from them interacting and constantly blushing. God, this piece.\\n\\n\r\nDo I even need to mention that this is a generic piece of work with so many of the worst clich\u00e9s of a typical LN and that it has some of the worst variations on them I have ever seen? Do I need to mention that this is basically an off-brand of Konosuba that actually went beyond an expiration date before airing? No? Well, too bad! What about the setting and story beats? Well, here\u2019s something interesting: we don't know how MC-kun died! Think back to any Isekai you've seen. Re:Zero? Subaru blinked and somehow fake into a fantasy world, unsure how it happened but he was summoned by Satela. Knight's & Magic? Kurata (who we know as Ernesti in the fantasy world) got ran over, though we don't know how he got to his fantasy world. Konosuba? Kazuma died of shock and tricked a stupid cunt \u201cgoddess\u201d into coming with him into a fantasy world. Here, well, God tells him that he was stuck by a bolt and then is willing to send him somewhere, we don't actually see what happened to him. It wouldn't have taken long to do something so basic, but look at what I'm reviewing. It can't have a good sweet moment either since it ruins those, even though they don't even work in the first place, but way to ruin your theoretical chance, anime! Oh, and pacing is fucked with this one, especially in the first half. I know I'm just sort of ranting and raving but damn, my brain is trying to scrape this show off of it and none of my friends want to kill this anime, so I have to now. This show has no effort put into anything at all; why should I bother? I would say because I care and because I try to put effort by honestly, my brain is committing genocide against any specifics I can bring up about this nightmare of a show.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this anime had heard of this term I'm about to say: it's called \u201ccharacterization\u201d! No character has a real defined personality, especially not the main character, who at best can be defined as the stereotypical boring and weak yet OP AF protagonist, like Ayato from The Asterisk War. By far this show's most disturbing and avant-garde offense is that I actually believe that all of the main women in the show are largely the exact same character with the most minor of different traits. No show to my knowledge has ever done that before. Obviously, these bitches are all trash, especially the tsundere one for being a typical tsundere. I can't remember any real traits from anyone else for this show has staged a coup on my brain!\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are bland and without personality and do stuff you expect, so that leaves us with MC-kun. Oh wait, I said everything about him other than the fact they he gets so OP without any actual progression that it constantly feels like he\u2019s pulling powers out of his ass, and yes, he does get a harem, to the point where all of the members can even travel with him, it's their crowded a harem, and for next to no reason beyond \u201cDude is nice enough to help and can do crazy things\u201d and not due to anything about his personality or even looks... ugh. His name is Touya, and I learned that over time but it's obviously not worth remembering. Actually, why should you remember a single character's name? Aside from weakling OP MC-kun, I certainly don't! There is nothing standout or remotely interesting about any of them. They also constantly blush and get embarrassed for no adequate reason. They're also all idiots as displayed by the crime-solving scene in episode 4. I only remember something about the blonde 12 year old princess and it's that she acts like a 6 year old half the time. Just...wow. I could go on and on about the character and especially the narrative problems, but honestly, this anime tries so little in any department that it's honestly not worth it.\\n\\n\r\nVeteran studio, Production Reed took the reigns for this and boy did they not do a good job, to put it lightly. The character art and overall animation are both so unbelievably flat, and so is the magic. It's not a pleasant view at any point, it all looks insanely plain, life-draining in fact! The character designs are pretty terrible overall, to add insult to injury. They can even get walking right as it looks like they're often moving both forward and backward in some walking scenes, like the beginning of episode 3. In fact, they always mess it up somehow, and it's just walking! How?! Why?! Oh, and when you see debris in a fight scene, it looks so poorly drawn and it doesn't fit well with any of the rest of the art at all. \\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much animation in the fight scenes either, especially in the episode 7 duel with the awful looking wooden swords; and I thought Akashic Records was bad in that department. You can also see some rather noticeable errors here, like faces being off, the fact that one of the characters who has a sword suddenly had two swords with hilts on her sleeve and not her waist, and yeah, it\u2019s pretty bad and lazy. They also use a lot of visual gag shortcuts that I thought only long-running shounens were allowed to get away with (since no other kind of show uses them and those shows have an insane amount of episodes to have to spread their budget and staff and time etc. on). It's a visual bore with blunders, though thankfully there really isn't any CGI to speak of, since I'm sure that probably would've been handled poorly, just like every there aspect of this show. You know, except it contains some atrocious CGI stairs that have a gigantic frame rate drop and get repeated verbatim later on with a different color and some abysmal fire effects that last for a while in episode 5! You know, because this anime also has to compete for the worst visuals of 2017 too!\\n\\n\r\nThe main uniform the girls wear looks awful, especially with those lines in the white part. One of the character designs is blatantly ripped from the princess from Knight's & Magic, whose anime adaptation just so happens to be airing at the same time as this, only she has been aged down by comparison to a 12-year-old. Why are we sexualizing 12-year-olds again? Also, expect some shitty digital close-ups. Lastly, for God knows what reason, they have it so that the eyebrows and eyelashes always overlap with the hair rather than being obstructed by it. This is basic anime shit and they constantly mess that up. Then again, they didn't really try here either, did they? Oh, and there\u2019s a fair amount of reused animation, so that's a sin, especially since unlike Knight's & Magic, this isn't a mecha show (not that I really excuse that show for it either). C\u2019mon, it's 2017! This shit shouldn't be happening anymore! And.. .that's everything for this one. Sadly, this is somehow the show\u2019s best, or rather, its least worst aspect, it only barely.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the OST on its own isn't actually that abysmal, though some tracks are especially bad and wrong. Sure, none of it works or can even be considered memorable, but what's worse is the fact that almost none of it ever fits with the scenes at all. Oh, and while I'll talk about those cancerous scene transitions a bit later and how pointless and aggravating they are in every way possible, let\u2019s just say that the music makes matters worse in those moments. The OP is the most obnoxious and generic JPop song I have ever heard in my life, especially the techno aspects. Fuck this song, it's not worth naming since it's one of the worst OP songs I have ever heard. Same applies to the ED to a slightly lesser extent; it's also awful and I don't care which of the characters sings it. There is nothing of merit to the music in this show whatsoever, and that almost never happens. If that isn't sad, I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I have to ask: for those out there who actually enjoyed this anime, how? What is the appeal of this? Is it the fact that the main character is OP? Is it the fact that this is a world with magic? Is it the admittedly out there premise? Because... I don't see this as a show that really wants to entertain, like at all. I see no semblance of soul from this anime, no spirit or any enthusiasm from it or anything. It's not even just super bland to the point of feeling like it was meant for passive entertainment like some other perfunctory works out there. It's not like it even really attempts to have interesting, consistent, or involved fight scenes either. At best, it tries to pander with the whole slime nonsense, in ways that should probably be seen as an insult to the intelligence, or at the very least, ways that should be met with shrugs and groans. And as for the OP MC part, why? Isn't it boring to see some guy plow through anything, especially if he doesn't really do anything fancy or especially crazy and flashy, or have any personality to latch into while doing it? Wouldn't you want that kind of MC to have some actual personality or actually show off some crazy epic shit to cheese fights instead of cheering fights without any effort? Wouldn't you want someone like Izayoi from Problem Children over this main character? \\n\\n\r\nSo it has come to this: the transitions! Fuck these things! They are nothing but obnoxious time-wasters with blaring and equally obnoxious music, either showing the results of a scene for 5 seconds or what happened already, with these stupid and obnoxious characters and voices doing stupid and aggravating things! You see anywhere from 6-8 of these an episode too! You can no doubt tell this got irritating fast! Why was this included? Why?! For comedy? I doubt it succeeded with many viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, this show was boring and vexing as all hell. Not a single moment to enjoy. It doesn't even try so of course I feel unamused to the nth degree. Not to mention that there were a few specific moments (boob grab scene in episode 9 being chief among them) that were especially maddening, so that didn\u2019t help one bit. Some of you might say \u201cWhy not just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride?\u201d Because it's so fucking boring and stupid, that's why! If I didn't keep my brain permanently on thinking mode when watching anime, I\u2019d have dropped so many more by now since I would've quit the moment I got really angry bored from watching, hence more of my time would've been wasted! I actually heard people say this was a parody of these kinds of shows: it is not. It image then completely straight and pretends to be mildly self-aware, so that blows. So yeah, this show fails on both levels! Fuck this show, I hate it! I hate it so much!\\n\\n\r\nThis might prime some of you to ask: \u201cWhy did you watch this obviously bad show in the first place?\u201d Well, some people probably watched it out of interest of the admittedly out there premise. Maybe some wanted a trashy anime to chill to (and likely found themselves still disappointed). And of course, some of us came here just to join hands with a chunk of the community always ready to see a truly and obviously terrible burn and revel in the flames together (I mean, usually the anime suffering that fate deserves it), often coming one by one to see if it is as bad as the reputation hypes it up to be. Not gonna lie, that was part of it for me. The other part was that for all intents and purposes, this did catch my eye as something I thought would just be a below-average at best isekai title for me to watch and feel little towards, at least after I was initially put off by the cover picture. However, I can definitely say that it did deserve the fate I mentioned in the third reason because as I have been saying over and over again, this anime is the very definition of laziness when it comes to this medium.\\n\\n\r\nAnime is a very intensive and passion-filled medium. There are so many titles out there, good and bad, that obviously show a ton of passion and effort in at least some regard. So, when I see an anime as lazy as this get a sizeable viewership while better and more passionate (if not always good) shows like Knight\u2019s & Magic, ACCA 13, and so on and so forth get at best a much lower viewership and at worst the absolute shaft, I get royally angry. People had to slave over this, and no passion feels like it\u2019s coming out, no care put into anything regarding this show. I am so thankful that this show is getting quite a thrashing, and honestly, it needs all the hate it can get. Honestly, unless you really want to watch something without a soul, you should avoid this anime entirely, as this anime is an affront to the medium as a whole. Is it the absolute worst anime out there? No, there are some worse ones out there for their own reasons, but this anime really has no right to exist, and honestly, it is still very, very high up there, both in an all-time perspective and in the perspective of this season alone. It manages to be an affront to the concept of entertainment, and even the concept of a harem and isekai show. Sadly, this season isn\u2019t over yet and there are a few real duds left to cover at the time of writing, so until then, I bid you adieu.",

Take that genre, and think of every stereotype and trope imaginable. Throw them all together, and you get this show. \r\nDude dies, God feels bad, sends him to another world, he gets a better life than before, he gets a harem, he's op as hell, everythingis as convenient as can be, the list goes on...\\n\r\nSeems like pure garbage.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is not where the value of this anime lies. The reason I'm giving it a 7 overall is because it's refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nNow hear me out: it's not revolutionary, it's not beautiful, it's not emotional- in fact, it feels very clunky, has odd pacing every now and then, and doesn't offer much.\\n\r\nBut I'll be damned, this show has me smiling way more often than some of your other run-of-the-mill shows in it's genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because it's so bad it's good.\\n\r\nThis show is like eye bleach to me.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching tons and tons of the same stories/genres spun different ways, you can get tired out. This show is one where I can just sit back and relax. I already know everything that's going to happen, and I laugh and smile because it's exactly what I expect it to be, and because it's so dumb.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm just going crazy from all the time I spend watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime helps me appreciate the other stuff I watch, because it almost in a sense helps me reset, seeing as I'm so desensitized to all the uniqueness out there nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, this anime is no life-changer, and it is most definitely not for everyone.\\n\r\nBut if you're like me, and just need a little break from the anime-watching grind, and need something \"other-worldly\" (sorry, I had to) to have a good laugh... then watch Konosuba, because it's actually good.\\n\r\nBut again, if you're like me, and you've already seen it all, then yes, you can watch this, and appreciate it just like I do, appreciate it in all it's trope-y glory.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt seriously is an anime I shouldn't like, but something in my brain and all the anime I've watched makes me enjoy it. I'm sure there's a few of you out there who will agree... emphasis on \"few\".\\n",

I've seen some negative reviews where people are saying it's completely shit, so here's howI'd statistic it:\\n\r\nStory - 4 (It's pretty basic so far).\\n\r\nArt - 8 (The art style is nice and definitely supports the type of show)\\n\r\nSound - 7 (There's nothing really special, but your basic shiz, still nice though)\\n\r\nCharacter - 4 (Although they're likeable, there's not really much development)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 (Personal preference, I love any OP char)\\n\r\nOverall - 7 (I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see some OP main char use magic basically).\\n\\n\r\nHope the review was helpful guys, if you want to see a overpowered character use all the magics in the world, go check it out ;)",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n(The Very Definition of a Generic \u2018Isekai\u2019 Show)\r\nNoticing the word \u2018isekai\u2019 in the title, reminds me of the many related series and mangas that I\u2019ve seen and read.  Most, if I recalled, were pretty enjoyable and entertaining.  I guess, you could say I enjoy the \u2018Isekai\u2019 genre to a certain extent.  However, this series just yells with genericness from its lame title and boring synopsis to its dumb-looking thumbnail to its list of genres (i.e. adventure, Harem, Comedy, Magic, Romance, Fantasy) that are commonly found in fantasy romance-comedies.  With all this information in mind, I immediately knew thatthis show would be absolute shit.  Still, I watched it because I wanted to know how generic it was.  So, I took some notes and noticed some common \u2018isekai\u2019 tropes: \\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist is killed (in this case, God kills him with lightning) and is, then, transported to another world.\\n\r\n\u2013 Overpowered, dense Protagonist with no redeeming features, beyond being nice and kind to everyone.\\n\r\n\u2013 Typical medieval setting.\\n\r\n\u2013 Standard magical spells and elements (e.g. earth, wind, fire, etc).\\n\r\n\u2013 Various races and creatures with different languages (e.g. lizard men, fox girls, slimes, etc).\\n\r\n\u2013 Twin female adventurers in love with Protagonist (obviously they have purple hair).\\n\r\n\u2013 Samurai girl in love with Protagonist.\\n\r\n\u2013 Rich Princess falls in love with Protagonist at first sight, declares marriage, and the parents approve it.\\n\r\n\u2013 Exploring ruins (e.g. underwater ruins and underground ruins)\\n\r\n\u2013 Fanservice (e.g. clothes dissolving, clothing changing, boob grabbing, swimsuits).\\n\r\n\u2013 Typical quests (e.g. collect X amount, kill this monster, explore this area, etc)\\n\r\n\u2013 Typical \u201cboss\u201d monster fights (e.g. dragon, \u201cunknown\u201d creature, etc )\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist gains a \u2018free mansion\u2019 and every female lead lives with him.\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist continuously reusing overpowered skill (i.e. slip)\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist creates a \u2018gun\u2019 in a fantasy world.\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist forms a pact with the strongest spirit animal (i.e. tiger).\\n\r\n\u2013 'Resisting the Urge to Look at Naked Girl\u2019 Event.\\n\r\n\u2013 Slime Event.\\n\r\n\u2013 Beach Event.\\n\r\n\u2013 Harem Ending.\\n\\n\r\nYep, we have it all, folks.  Some of the most common \u2018isekai\u2019 tropes are in this anime.  Now, whether that\u2019s good or bad is up to you.  For me, it usually doesn\u2019t bother me, but, in this show, it was was more annoying than outright fun.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and predictable, especially towards the end.  Nothing too complex or \u201cdeep\u201d, or nothing that will confuse the viewers.  In fact, if I had to summarize this series, it would be this: OP main character is trapped in a new world, OP main character encounters many people with many problems, OP character solves the problem with his OP skills and spells, rinse and repeat.  Some examples:\\n\\n\r\nExamples #1: the butler is shot with an arrow, but wait Touya can just remove the arrow and heal him back to normal.  He doesn\u2019t die and everyone is happy.\\n\\n\r\nExample #2: The Duke\u2019s wife is blind.  If only someone had a spell that could heal her and make her see again.  Enter Touya, he uses heal.  The Duke\u2019s wife can see again, everyone is happy.\\n\\n\r\nExample #3: Evil guy is controlled by evil red orb thingy in his eye.  How do we get it?  Enter Touya, he uses some retrieve magic and destroys it.  Evil guy is defeated and everyone is happy. \\n\\n\r\nFor everything else: Touya uses the spell \u2019slip\u2019 on enemy.  Enemy slips like an idiot.  It\u2019s Super Effective!\\n\\n\r\nWe can keep on going, but basically there is no tension, conflict, or buildup to these events.  And even if there was some tension, conflict, or buildup, they will be conveniently and immediately resolved within a matter of seconds because of Touya\u2019s OP spells and powers.  In addition, there too many slice of life moments (e.g. Touya making ice cream, making a board-game, making a bicycle, going out shopping, etc) that don\u2019t add anything to the story or plot, they are just there to remind the viewers that Touya is a nice and kind person.  Additional problem with this anime include: simple and bland conversations and dialogue, unnecessary fanservice, the inclusion of too many chibi scenes/transitions, and lack of world-building.  The lack of world-building is pretty frustrating; our characters never question about the various races and languages, religions, regions of the world, governments, etc.  And even when our characters venture to a new land (i.e. Eashen), they never took the time to fully explore or learns about it.  And finally, Touya fails to fully use his smartphone for other purposes, besides using it as a map, checking mail/texts, and looking up information, until around episode 5 or 6.  And even then, the smartphone is nothing special, it\u2019s just there to enhance his already overpowered skills.  But, the most disappointing thing was the fact the anime doesn\u2019t show our main character getting killed by lightning.  Would have been more entertaining had they animate it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe background designs, such as buildings, interior designs, forests, etc, are lacking in detail and are just there to show where the our characters are.  The character themselves aren\u2019t very detailed either, in fact, one could say that all the main characters have pretty similar looking facial designs, in that everyone has a pointy chin and a rectangle face.  They only differ in eye color, hair color and design, and what clothes they are wearing, but that\u2019s pretty obvious.  Most crowd scenes just feature static characters, and if there are multiple characters moving it\u2019s usually a fight scene.  Now, speaking of fight scenes, the animations for these scenes are a mixture of still and dynamic shots of the characters punching, kicking, or slashing something.  And finally there are many chibi scenes, which are cute, but, at the same time, are annoying and interrupt the flow of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and its sequel, then you\u2019ll be glad to know that several voice actresses have a major/minor role in this series.  Specifically, Maaya Uchida voices Elze Silhoueska (elder twin), Chinatsu Akasaki voices Yae Kokonoe, Sumire Uesaka voices Leen, and Kikuko Inoue voices Origa.  The remaining cast is voiced either by professionals or novices, especially our main character, Touya Mochizuki, who is voiced by Katsumi Fukuhara, a complete newbie starring in his first major voicing acting role.  Now, having said all this, the voice acting is okay, not the best, but decent.  Moving on, the background songs are just there to convey the characters\u2019 emotion at that given moment; the sounds of swords clashing, magic effects, and many other action sound effects are standard for its genre.  Though, I\u2019ll admit hearing the \u2019boing\u2019 sound effect whenever boobs swayed or jiggled around was stupid and hilarious.  And finally, the opening song and intro is your typical J-Pop that introduces all the girls that love our protagonist, and the ending song, also your typical J-Pop, features only one female character at a time.  By the way, it's kind of stupid to include two characters (i.e. professor and silver-haired dude) that only made a brief, and by brief less than a minute, appearance on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has a readily established character trait and personality that will remain with them until the end of the show.  In other words, characters introduced in the beginning will not change throughout the show; they will not have any growth or development and no change in personality.  And, for some reason, we aren\u2019t given a proper background story to most of our main characters.  For example, our main character, Touya Mochizuki, is nice and kind, is dense and completely oblivious to the girls\u2019 feelings for him, and is overpowered because of God.  That\u2019s it.  He doesn\u2019t tell us about his former life, nor does he have any desire to do so.  Furthermore, he lacks any specific goals or ambitions when he enters the new world, and barely reacts to any situation or event.  A very boring and generic character, indeed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe female characters, despite looking and acting cute sometimes, are no better than our male lead.  In fact, most are common character tropes, such as the tsundere, the shy younger sister, the rich princess, the girl that-appears-young-but-is-actually-hundreds-of-years-old, the traditional girl, etc.  Moreover, they don\u2019t have any background story (except for samurai girl, Yae Kokonoe), and lack any goals and ambitions, besides wanting to get married to Touya.  Everyone else is a secondary character, so don\u2019t expect any backstories or any character development; they are just there to make certain events happen to our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, this show is boring, predictable, and lacking the humor, thrills, and intensity compared to similar shows.  The story is painfully generic and lacks tension and conflict, the animation and art is just there for show, and the characters are stale and unchanging.  The only entertainment I got from this series was anticipating when Touya would pull the \u2018Slip\u2019 card and defeat his \u201cenemies\u201d.  Overall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this show, unless you like the original source material and wanted to see the anime adaptation of it, or you are a huge fan of \u2018isekai\u2019 tropes.",

            "content": "A first impression. We get it from anime's synopsis, source material and sometimes even from the \"thumbnail\" and title alone. Something that can start a huge buzz around a particular work and can literally make it the most famous and the hottest show of the season, huh, sometimes even a show of the year, be it 2016's Erased and Re: Zero, or it can doom an anime from the very beginning, which the most recent Hajimete no Gal is a great example of. And in case of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, it's certainly the latter. Many people have been drawn back because ofhow it presents itself. At first, it looks like your generic tasteless and meaningless show in an overused isekai setting, that has become something like a subgenre on its own, due to a massive amount of anime with said framework, we see every year. And even though, judging a book by its cover is very superficial, I will try my hardest to truly show you, that in this instance that saying is enormously right and also why this anime deserves nothing more than hate and contempt.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the least odious aspect, the production value. While it's not as bad as characters and plot, that I will discuss later on, animation and sound are what I would consider being the embodiment of the word passionless. It's relatively easy to spot that there's no love and effort put into neither the animation nor the sound.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like the studio behind this show, Production Reed if there were a website with animation techniques, would go in there, choose a \"cute mediocre animation\" template, imply it into their little project, and be happy with the results they've got. I think that I've seen these type of plain backgrounds, bright colour palette, cute character designs in quite literally every single an \"another world\" show that doesn't have any unique qualities nor any interesting quirks in its animation. A perfect example of that \"uniqueness\" is No Game No Life's animation, which bombards us with the brightest and the most blinding colours in the universe. I tried to overlook that, and for a decent amount of time, I've thought that the animation used here is not bad. I thought of it as the only thing in this show that hasn't sunk below the level of being so-so. Surprisingly enough as the series progressed, for some weird reason, which I am assuming is the lack of funds, the condition of it, has gone downhill drastically. From being mediocre, then by having junky and choppy frames in some scenes, to in the end become less of an animation and more of a drawing made by an eight years old kid in Paint, with sketchy character outlines, their expressions and actions.\\n\\n\r\nWe can say the same about the sound. And while the animation is bearable and eventually becomes abysmal, the sound has to take the cake for being the part that sank this ship called production value, below the level of being middling from the very beginning. An opening, which while I do not dislike J-pop, has nothing more to offer than being your typical and generic anime opening #2321. The ending, which has somewhat grasped my interest with its interesting enough concept of having the main female characters sing the same annoying song in different episodes. And finishing on an imperceptible soundtrack, that I don't know if even exists. These songs are not even in the slightest degree euphonious or worth remembering, and it feels like they have been thrown in randomly. There's also one thing that has bugged me and made me question my ability to hear correctly, and that element is the sound objects make when they have some interaction with a character or the environment. We can hear it very commonly in later-ish episodes, where for instance an ordinary (walking) teddybear while shaking his head, would make a beeping sound and boobs would make a sound of a trampoline.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's go into more important parts.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the premise, the very first and easily noticeable handicap. The premise is what will draw potential viewers in and will make them watch the first episode. It's the igniter of every single anime, movie or any other type of medium. Without at least semi-interesting setting, it'll be impossible to make an enjoyable piece of entertainment. And with this basic concept, which everyone knows since they were born, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, is a perfect example of how not to make an intriguing premise. Touya Mochizuki, whose problematic existence I will bring up later on, was accidentally killed by a lightning sent by the God himself. The boy appears in heaven-ish place and the omnipresent being apologised to him, a random human child and as an apology, he wants to revive him in eponymous \"another\" world with his wished item, which is again the eponymous smartphone. See where the problem resides? \\n\\n\r\nAnd I know that it may sound flat, but it lies within this setting's level of uncreativity and stupidity. You want me to believe that from such an off-putting and downright dumb premise which sounds like an undercooked joke, you can make an engaging show? I do not know what the hell was the author of source material even thinking when he or she came up with this repellent idea of a futile isekai with a modern electronic device as its the most \"innovative\" part. A concept that had no right even to exist, due to its lack of effort in being at least somewhat ingenious. I still harshly blame Production Reed, for adapting the said idea in the form of an amateur light novel into an anime. Someone may think that by doing so, they are doing a great deed and give a starting writer and his hardly known work, an opportunity to become more recognisable. And while on paper it might sound great, it's only half true. The quality of these works is very dodgy at best, and they are very questionably written. Even if they're completely terrible, they're to put it simply, samples made by beginners, which is my guess of what Patora thinks about his/her first novel. And even though the quality of them is rather obvious, studios like Production Reed are trying to get easy attention and potentially money out of the hate that their show will receive from people who don't like to be fed up with idiotism. They seem to follow the saying: \"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd it can be seen in the quality of writing. Every single episode falls into one simple scheme: Our main character Touya Mochizuki finds someone in need, be it some random girls, or some unimportant kings and noble people, offers them his help and saves them from oppression, thus making them fall for him. But how does he do that? Is he such a charismatic personality that everyone wants to be with him? Well God himself offered him two reality bending abilities, the strongest plot devices you could have imagined: his newly given godlike powers and his smartphone. And while his Jesus level might is rather self-explanatory, his smartphone can apparently enhance magic, transfer it and be used as a magic item, which makes little to no sense. This episode structure can be seen at its fullest in the 4th episode when Touya saved duke's brother from poison in about a minute, with the usage of that one spell that apparently no one could use. In an instant, everyone in that room started clinging to him in the blandest way possible. It ideally shows how pathetically lazy is the plot itself. There's no thrill, no excitement, nothing. What's the point of creating a problem when it can be solved in a blink of an eye? For our plot to progress? It doesn't happen since we don't have a clear goal. So what is it? The only thing that seems to matter is expanding our main character's harem with cardboard cutouts and making more and more beings worship him as a God after a short showcase of his powers. Same can be said about fight scenes, and don't get me started on them. They're the most pointless moments in this show. If a monster on in worse scenario, a group of humans attack our group of main characters, they are a non-existing threat since Touya is always there to save the day in one single move. Nothing encourages us to dive in this wacky world, which by the way, is terribly built. The cause for that is Touya's ability to teleport. It leaves us dumb folded since we don't know where exactly is that place where our characters have teleported to and how far they are from their previous location. \\n\\n\r\nAnd even when there were comedy anime series with lousy concepts, they were done in a somewhat proper manner, by putting a huge emphasis on the comedy and its characters, the two aspects which Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, doesn't know how to do. \\n\r\nThe comedy is plainly weak. In some occasions, the whole joke is some stupidly forced fanservice scene, which the creators are trying to push down your throat, while in others, it's a stupid oneliner that had little to none sense and wasn't funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, let's talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStarting on with the icing on the cake, the pinnacle of this show, Touya Mochizuki. He is your ordinary young boy that after being transported into our dull fantasy world has become the worst type of character you can find within anime as a medium, the \"overpowered\" protagonist. I dislike that word as it has been thrown around in a meaningless fashion, but there is no better way to describe this kind of a character. And while we had some decently made \"overpowered\" personage, there has been an enormous amount of terribly written ones, and a splendid example of such protagonist is Kirito from Sword Art Online, the Jesus-kun. Touya shares a very similar facial line, hairstyle or even the type of clothing that Kirito is wearing, but with different colour. Touya Mochizuki, whom from now on I'll refer to as Jesus-kun the Second, just like his predecessor, has to live with the burden of having an enormous amount of \"charisma\" that attracts any brainless female character from across the ocean. It's a very cheap trick to make him into a \"reliable\" character. He's like every loser's dream and perfect version of themselves, which they can't and won't be. Jesus-kun the Second is a one-dimensional, bland and empty cardboard with zero personality and motivation whatsoever, just like the original. He is a shell with some gold sprinkling on top of it, while on the inside he is simply a hollow and odious abyss of nothingness. He has no redeeming qualities, just like...\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast. I hate this kind of characters with such an intense burning passion that it's unimaginable. While Touya and Kirito type of personage is a laughing material since they can do everything, it's quite funny to see them pull some deus ex machina bullshittery out of nowhere. However, girls surrounding them are just pitiful. I won't go on and describe every single one of them as it would be truly pointless since none of them differs from one and other. The only thing that is unique to each of them is their name and appearance since all of them are reduced to the role of being something like an achievement or even an object for our Gary Stu to collect throughout the series. They have less personality than a bag of potatoes and are simply a bunch of one-dimensional cardboards, insulting to every single girl on the face of Earth. These human wannabes are here for the only one goal: to be Jesus-kun the Second's harem, suck on to him like a leech and keep on blushing whenever he compliments them or breathes at them.\\n\\n\r\nI hate both of these character types as they are honestly worthless and offensive in every manner possible. Watching them interact with each other was an agony on itself, but could there be anything even worse than that? Oh boy, you have seen nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes from 8th to 11th, are what I would consider being the most pain-inducing amount of time spent in my entire time.\\n\r\nAt the start of the 8th episode, we're greeted with a scene that has begun the period of a new low which, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni has hit. We get an entirely forced fanservice scene, which while tasteless and unnecessary isn't utterly dreadful and might be easy to overlook. After some other terrible scenes, we spent some time of the episode following an unimportant hollow \"background\" character, and in the end, we get a new addition to Jesus-kun the Second's harem.\\n\r\nIn the 9th episode, we're treated to a scene when I started crying. It was around 15 minutes into the episode, Leen, an unimportant harem member number #421, while being invisible started sexually harassing a character introduced to serve as a joke. It was a moment when I shed a tear. Tear of agony and torture of how deeply can something fall. Then we have yet another showcase of Jesus-kun the Second's might by finishing an incredibly epic and not a randomly thrown in an evil guy in a spank of a second. The episode ends with a scenery of a beach, and you know what does it mean?\\n\r\nAnd so rolls in the first beach episode (the 10th one). We have utterly horrible and tasteless fanservice of the main female cast and some background characters reduced to the role of a boob shot material pretty much consistently throughout the 21 minutes of the episode. The 11th episode showed us how the animation from average could go downhill at the speed of light. But even that was nothing in comparison with a scene where a cyborg sex toy (I'm not even joking, that character was introduced to us like it.) pushed her tongue right in the Jesus-kun the Second's throat, and our gorgeous girls have lost their minds. As for the 12th, I'm speechless. Confessing love in the fakest and childish way possible and a random deus ex machina filled with autism, but I guess what would you expect at that point.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni? NO. I think I have never been in a situation where an anime has given me an emotional instability. From laughing my ass out at horrendous and cheesy episodes to a moment when I nearly destroyed a glass of juice which was standing right next to me, with my bare hand. The only word that would correctly describe what was happening to me would be, dying. Every single episode, every single minute and second of this 12 episodes series was painful to the fullest meaning of this word, causing me to suffer a massive mental and physical damage, from nearly everything in this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is by far the laziest, awful, insulting, and the borderline idiotic anime brought to our screens. A light novel made by an amateur and produced by a little-known studio, while at first glance looks like an entirely terrible show, let me ensure you that is even lower than you would have thought. One-dimensional cardboard cutouts with the same amount of personality as a pair of wellies, weak production value and terrible idea, executed horribly. This show is nothing more than a stinky pile of cliches and retardation lying so lowly that it has reached the core of our planet, reducing my mental stability by a huge chunk. and nearly forcing me to injure myself. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone unless you're a masochist.",

            "content": "Throughout the generations of anime, we have been given the genre called ''Isekai'' or ''In Another World''. From the video game genre of Isekai like Log Horizon and SAO, to the parallel world Isekai like Konosuba and then this anime, we all loved and hate the genre as well.. Summer 2017 season will end soon and for the past few months, it brought us a few Isekai animes. One of them is ''Isekai Wa Smartphone To Tomo Ni'' or ''In Another World With My Smartphone''. Now, when I first look at it from it's poster, I thought the anime will be good and comedic likeKonosuba... Like Konosuba.. with a Smartphone! But sometimes, when you make higher expectations to something especially anime, it bounds to fall down. And it really did for this anime. 'Isekai Wa Smartphone To Tomo Ni' revolves to the protagonist named 'Mochizuka Touya' who accidentally died, so.. God is like ''Im going to revive you into a Magical world cause you accidentally died '' blablabla. You know you should have just revive him ''God'' lol. On this review, I will talk about the story, characters, the sound, art, my enjoyment of it and overall rating. Don't worry there will be no spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nThe isekai genre have been widely popular throughout the anime so it is not that original anymore, though it is said that all stories are not really unique or original itself. Some are base on real life situations while some are based on made-up/fictional things. The same to this anime. Lack of originality of the show for viewers are already a problem of this show. Guy goes into another world and he has multiple harem girls with him and he is freaking overpowered? Common.. The story revolves about 'Mochizuka Touya', a normal boy in the real world, turned into a guy that has so many selection of girls. Hell! he can marry anyone of them because he is ridiculously overpowered not only by his power but charisma (though his face looks like someone I know from another anime out there). If you are going to take a look on the following episode, the route of the story is like this - He is OP. He helps with his OP powers then he met new girls for his harem then go to an adventure/quest, then again he helps another set of girls for his harem and so on and so on. This guy doesn't know that he is collecting girls like Ash catching Pokemons in the wild. If one character is already a mess (no balance or over the top), the viewers will think that he can do anything he wants even there will be an impossible problem. Viewers will always think the story will go on without having a major problems/conflicts because of an OP Main character. If the villain or a supporting character is OP than the main, then I think it is fine. So.. Because of the MC's overpowered abilities and continuous/ongoing set of route of collecting girls, the story is horrible...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story is bad itself.. But on the other hand, I can say that the Art is pretty good and normal for an isekai anime. I mean we don't need over the top animations like on the 'Fate' series for this anime because of the story's bad route and all so the art is not a big deal here at all..\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nLike the art itself, the sound is pretty normal like any other animes out there. The sound effects of the spells, the slashing of both sword, the background music. No major problem at all on this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThis anime proves that there is someone more OP than Kirito from SAO himself. That's what makes this anime pretty bad. The character balance between the official main character (Touya) and the other main character ( the first harem girls with him ), along with the supporting characters have intense differences of balance from power, fame, charisma and other things. This makes the author to make a story to FOCUS ALL the good things to him with almost no bad sides at all. Problems will come yeah sure but because of him being OP, he can erase that problem very easily.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWith his cringy attitude and overpowered mechanism, I don't really enjoyed this anime at all. Though there are some parts that have some slight 'ecchi'-ness, though I can say that the whole problem is the anime itself. The fights are... Well we can all predict that he will win along with his harem girls thats why the fights are not that enjoyable or entertaining. Viewers can predict what will happen and then it turns out they are right because of what they see from the MC himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... I rate this anime as 4/10. Sure there are plenty of fine fights and pervy moments but because of this kind of flow on the story, the rating for this anime (for me) is less than average. A poor grade.\\n\\n\\n",

It's not like art, or music where it has to be incredibly complex,  it just need to make your day or lighten up your mood from other stress in your life and that's just what this show does.\\n\\n\r\nIt's relaxed, stupid, and has that overpowered mc that is kinda cool.\\n\r\nSo just like any anime this is rated based off of my enjoyment and i give it a clean 10.\\n\r\nI can't and won't say you will enjoy it as much as me because everyone has different tastes but this show is worth trying out.\\n\r\nThank you for reading, hope you liked the review. :)\\n\\n",

Yes, its got its cliches, yes its got its predictable moments, BUT I don't let that get the better of me at all.  In fact, if you are a heavy harem/romance anime nerd like I am, you'd enjoy the cliches and predictable moments like I do!\r\nHonestly I know that tons of people will rip this anime a new one just because of XYZ reasons which is unfortunate, but TO ME, I am thoroughly enjoying this anime so much. \r\nSo far going from 4episodes so far, it is really fast paces which I really enjoy. The Main Protagonist Guy is the perfect guy I always liked in harem/romance. Super nice, super level-headed, always being a gentleman, and so far he doesn't get all \"nose bleed\" like most dudes in harems which is great. He's also super strong which is great in my book. \\n\\n\r\nTO ME I am really enjoying this anime. Maybe I'm easy to please? I guess I am, which is great since that means there are many shows out there that I can enjoy!",

            "content": "This is my first review and most likely will be my last in a while. I just couldn't understand how people rated this so bad while I enjoy this as much as most other fantasy animes! Isekai is fun, light and carefree to watch with bit of comedy and is something you can watch to escape from reality when you aren't in a mood to watch 100% realistic or some sad drama animes or so.\r\nIsekai reminds me a bit of No Game No Life or Log Horizon in a way that main hero goes to another world due some reason, in Isekau because he diesin his world and is sent to another one by god. Might sound weird but this is fantasy anime so you know it's not gonna be super realistic and logical anyway! The main heroes in each of these three animes are all kinda similar, all are quite OP in bit different ways on each of these animes. Also I think Fairy Tail is quite similar to Isekai as both have magic and OP main hero, but Isekai has only few episodes released so there isn't really many ways to compare these quite yet. The thing that separates Isekai from these others the most is that Isekai is harem while the others aren't.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is like any other (harem) fantasy anime, harem side isn't imo too strong like the girls don't get too close with kissing or anything, but you can see the harem in there as most of female characters likes the main hero more or less and his group consists only of female characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nI don't judge art styles usually too much, but imo art is quite neutral looking which is good. There is no any unique ways of drawing but it is simple and similar to many other animes and while it may not be super great, I don't think it's bad either.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much about sound as I'm that kind of person who skips openings and endings and as far as the sound used in the episodes goes, I don't think there is anything different or bad about them, so again quite basic what you are used to hear in most other animes too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters aren't especially super unique [quite basic OP and bit airhead main hero at least when it comes to reading female minds (as typical in many other animes, but it's quite logical as it is impossible to read girls' minds irl too :D) and bit different female heroines] but they are all quite likable and you can find the one(s) that you like the most.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime as much as I enjoy many other fantasy animes. You won't end up even looking to this unless you like this genre and if you do like it, it's pretty much as good as other similar animes. This may still be missing some depth that you can find in Log Horizon or in Fairy Tail for example, but both of those series are long ones that progress slowly and you never know how this one is gonna progress and end until it's finished so I can't say for sure yet how I should rate this overall. For me ending is very important and also if there is hints of upcoming season(s) I want to see them and base my opinion to whole series and not just on few episodes or one season if there is more seasons.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this will help at least one of you guys reading this and if some of you find this helpful I might consider writing more reviews too! :)",

            "content": "In Another World with My Smartphone epitomizes everything that a great show like Konosuba is satirizing. Touya died by accident in the real world so G-d decides to give him another change in another world and he's allowed to take his phone with him, the only caveat being that the only person he can contact is the aforementioned \"G-d.\" He also sets him up with some buffs which gets revealed early on basically means he can miraculously control every type of magic and just by reading a spell that took others years to perfect, he can cast it. So long as he has the nameof the spell and can comprehend what it actually does, he can cast it.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe this show is ultimate teen male wish fulfillment. He has a harem of girls who all either overtly or secretly have crushes on him.  He has unheard of power that basically enables him to do anything.  And everyone is amazed at how awesome he is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the beginning of this show's horrible execution. When your main character is simply UBER in ever single way, there are no real obstacles to overcome. The hero's journey is about evolving as a character and overcoming personal failings to succeed in trials. It's simply not interesting to watch a guy who has none and this is almost to the same degree as Ains in Overlord. Even in a show like Dragon Ball Z, where we know inevitably Goku will win, he faces obstacles greater than himself and he evolves (albeit somewhat predictably) to triumph.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire concept of someone going to a fantasy world and being able to use their smartphone is a pretty neat idea. There are a ton of things one could do with a connection to information in the outside world. Presumably you could look up plans to introduce \"undiscovered\" technology or use it to bridge language divides in this other world. Instead all the character has really used it for is the maps function.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are beyond boring and to be honest other than very minor personality quirks, the characters literally have no personality. The main character looks almost exactly like Kirito from Sword Art Online. And if you ever complained that Kirito was flat and boring, he has nothing on Touya, who is probably the most dull character I have yet to see develop a mini-harem. The other characters introduced thus far are a stereotypical loli character who is a noble, a samurai who eats non-stop, and a pair of twins who are not really identical or fraternal but one is assertive and physically aggressive while the other is shy and submissive.  Rounding out there party is the king's daughter, who is instantly obsessed with marrying Touya.  And her parents have no qualms with it because of a magical eye and seem perfectly okay with leaving the running of their kingdom to a child they have known for half a day, at most.\\n\\n\r\nI originally wrote this review at only two episodes in and nearly every one of my predictions already came true.  Now only four episodes in the only thing I've not predicted is when go to the beach. 50/50 chances of a nosebleed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I might be able to forgive the story a bit if there was something else to latch onto but thus far the art has been pretty mediocre and music has been very generic. The dialogue between the characters and their \"adventures\" feel more like something you'd see in a bargain bin visual novel game.\\n\\n\r\nI am not sure why I am going to subject myself to watching this if only to really see if my predictions hold true and if somehow it gets better.",

            "content": "You know, when the main Japanese demographic your anime markets towards ends up hating your anime, then you know it blows chunks. Not even pretty girls can remedy that fact. I should\u2019ve listened to OtaKing. Well, rationality is incomprehensible to anyone involved with this show's existence. If you don't want to see a rant on this crappy piece of work that is the cheap bootleg equivalent to Konosuba and an insult to harems, isekai, and entertainment, leave immediately. The gloves come off and the spell of death is cast.\r\nCreative bankruptcy. It's something that any artist of any medium worth his or her salt should dreadwhen creating a work. It's when the art has no soul of any kind, no artistic purpose behind it, meant only for the money. That brings us to our target: Isekai wa Smartphone. This pile of insufferable, bland, incompetent dreck can fuck off for giving harem and isekai shows a bad name (more so than they already have), and for not caring about being a show for people to watch. It has no soul, no drive, and is just an example of corporate greed and a lack of care by literally everyone involved in every aspect of production, outside of the voice actors. It is the antithesis of spellbinding, as it half-heartedly casts the spell of boredom and hatred.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime can't establish anything properly. It can't establish magic until way after it was used and even then the system, especially concerning null, is stupid. It doesn't establish the idea of guilds properly at all. The gauntlets, the currency, none of it! Part of it is because its worldbuilding is beyond atrocious, and there are gigantic leaps and lies, so yeah. Oh, here\u2019s an example! When a butler got hit with an arrow offscreen, how? Apparently he and the guys he was with were surrounded by lizards with swords and shields, so that can't work, and apparently part of it broke off and... yeah. Also, inconsistent magic since they say the only way to use magic (except maybe null) was with special designated crystals yet they violate that multiple times. Oh, and the protagonist knows literally every magic ever, including the personal null ones, which are already a bad system due to being contradictory (since they're supposed to be unique but they're recorded in ways that imply more people can use these null spells, but they're each limited to a few people at a time), and heck, the magic system as a while had its own tuned violated constantly with people constantly using elemental magic without a magical fragment catalyst, so fuck this anime\u2019s own rules, amirite?! Oh, and they just randomly and haphazardly insert us into a bunch of scenarios for the characters to quickly solve and have no remote emotional effect on the audience or even have any meaningful things for the characters aside from them interacting and constantly blushing. God, this piece.\\n\\n\r\nDo I even need to mention that this is a generic piece of work with so many of the worst clich\u00e9s of a typical LN and that it has some of the worst variations on them I have ever seen? Do I need to mention that this is basically an off-brand of Konosuba that actually went beyond an expiration date before airing? No? Well, too bad! What about the setting and story beats? Well, here\u2019s something interesting: we don't know how MC-kun died! Think back to any Isekai you've seen. Re:Zero? Subaru blinked and somehow fake into a fantasy world, unsure how it happened but he was summoned by Satela. Knight's & Magic? Kurata (who we know as Ernesti in the fantasy world) got ran over, though we don't know how he got to his fantasy world. Konosuba? Kazuma died of shock and tricked a stupid cunt \u201cgoddess\u201d into coming with him into a fantasy world. Here, well, God tells him that he was stuck by a bolt and then is willing to send him somewhere, we don't actually see what happened to him. It wouldn't have taken long to do something so basic, but look at what I'm reviewing. It can't have a good sweet moment either since it ruins those, even though they don't even work in the first place, but way to ruin your theoretical chance, anime! Oh, and pacing is fucked with this one, especially in the first half. I know I'm just sort of ranting and raving but damn, my brain is trying to scrape this show off of it and none of my friends want to kill this anime, so I have to now. This show has no effort put into anything at all; why should I bother? I would say because I care and because I try to put effort by honestly, my brain is committing genocide against any specifics I can bring up about this nightmare of a show.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this anime had heard of this term I'm about to say: it's called \u201ccharacterization\u201d! No character has a real defined personality, especially not the main character, who at best can be defined as the stereotypical boring and weak yet OP AF protagonist, like Ayato from The Asterisk War. By far this show's most disturbing and avant-garde offense is that I actually believe that all of the main women in the show are largely the exact same character with the most minor of different traits. No show to my knowledge has ever done that before. Obviously, these bitches are all trash, especially the tsundere one for being a typical tsundere. I can't remember any real traits from anyone else for this show has staged a coup on my brain!\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are bland and without personality and do stuff you expect, so that leaves us with MC-kun. Oh wait, I said everything about him other than the fact they he gets so OP without any actual progression that it constantly feels like he\u2019s pulling powers out of his ass, and yes, he does get a harem, to the point where all of the members can even travel with him, it's their crowded a harem, and for next to no reason beyond \u201cDude is nice enough to help and can do crazy things\u201d and not due to anything about his personality or even looks... ugh. His name is Touya, and I learned that over time but it's obviously not worth remembering. Actually, why should you remember a single character's name? Aside from weakling OP MC-kun, I certainly don't! There is nothing standout or remotely interesting about any of them. They also constantly blush and get embarrassed for no adequate reason. They're also all idiots as displayed by the crime-solving scene in episode 4. I only remember something about the blonde 12 year old princess and it's that she acts like a 6 year old half the time. Just...wow. I could go on and on about the character and especially the narrative problems, but honestly, this anime tries so little in any department that it's honestly not worth it.\\n\\n\r\nVeteran studio, Production Reed took the reigns for this and boy did they not do a good job, to put it lightly. The character art and overall animation are both so unbelievably flat, and so is the magic. It's not a pleasant view at any point, it all looks insanely plain, life-draining in fact! The character designs are pretty terrible overall, to add insult to injury. They can even get walking right as it looks like they're often moving both forward and backward in some walking scenes, like the beginning of episode 3. In fact, they always mess it up somehow, and it's just walking! How?! Why?! Oh, and when you see debris in a fight scene, it looks so poorly drawn and it doesn't fit well with any of the rest of the art at all. \\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much animation in the fight scenes either, especially in the episode 7 duel with the awful looking wooden swords; and I thought Akashic Records was bad in that department. You can also see some rather noticeable errors here, like faces being off, the fact that one of the characters who has a sword suddenly had two swords with hilts on her sleeve and not her waist, and yeah, it\u2019s pretty bad and lazy. They also use a lot of visual gag shortcuts that I thought only long-running shounens were allowed to get away with (since no other kind of show uses them and those shows have an insane amount of episodes to have to spread their budget and staff and time etc. on). It's a visual bore with blunders, though thankfully there really isn't any CGI to speak of, since I'm sure that probably would've been handled poorly, just like every there aspect of this show. You know, except it contains some atrocious CGI stairs that have a gigantic frame rate drop and get repeated verbatim later on with a different color and some abysmal fire effects that last for a while in episode 5! You know, because this anime also has to compete for the worst visuals of 2017 too!\\n\\n\r\nThe main uniform the girls wear looks awful, especially with those lines in the white part. One of the character designs is blatantly ripped from the princess from Knight's & Magic, whose anime adaptation just so happens to be airing at the same time as this, only she has been aged down by comparison to a 12-year-old. Why are we sexualizing 12-year-olds again? Also, expect some shitty digital close-ups. Lastly, for God knows what reason, they have it so that the eyebrows and eyelashes always overlap with the hair rather than being obstructed by it. This is basic anime shit and they constantly mess that up. Then again, they didn't really try here either, did they? Oh, and there\u2019s a fair amount of reused animation, so that's a sin, especially since unlike Knight's & Magic, this isn't a mecha show (not that I really excuse that show for it either). C\u2019mon, it's 2017! This shit shouldn't be happening anymore! And.. .that's everything for this one. Sadly, this is somehow the show\u2019s best, or rather, its least worst aspect, it only barely.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, the OST on its own isn't actually that abysmal, though some tracks are especially bad and wrong. Sure, none of it works or can even be considered memorable, but what's worse is the fact that almost none of it ever fits with the scenes at all. Oh, and while I'll talk about those cancerous scene transitions a bit later and how pointless and aggravating they are in every way possible, let\u2019s just say that the music makes matters worse in those moments. The OP is the most obnoxious and generic JPop song I have ever heard in my life, especially the techno aspects. Fuck this song, it's not worth naming since it's one of the worst OP songs I have ever heard. Same applies to the ED to a slightly lesser extent; it's also awful and I don't care which of the characters sings it. There is nothing of merit to the music in this show whatsoever, and that almost never happens. If that isn't sad, I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I have to ask: for those out there who actually enjoyed this anime, how? What is the appeal of this? Is it the fact that the main character is OP? Is it the fact that this is a world with magic? Is it the admittedly out there premise? Because... I don't see this as a show that really wants to entertain, like at all. I see no semblance of soul from this anime, no spirit or any enthusiasm from it or anything. It's not even just super bland to the point of feeling like it was meant for passive entertainment like some other perfunctory works out there. It's not like it even really attempts to have interesting, consistent, or involved fight scenes either. At best, it tries to pander with the whole slime nonsense, in ways that should probably be seen as an insult to the intelligence, or at the very least, ways that should be met with shrugs and groans. And as for the OP MC part, why? Isn't it boring to see some guy plow through anything, especially if he doesn't really do anything fancy or especially crazy and flashy, or have any personality to latch into while doing it? Wouldn't you want that kind of MC to have some actual personality or actually show off some crazy epic shit to cheese fights instead of cheering fights without any effort? Wouldn't you want someone like Izayoi from Problem Children over this main character? \\n\\n\r\nSo it has come to this: the transitions! Fuck these things! They are nothing but obnoxious time-wasters with blaring and equally obnoxious music, either showing the results of a scene for 5 seconds or what happened already, with these stupid and obnoxious characters and voices doing stupid and aggravating things! You see anywhere from 6-8 of these an episode too! You can no doubt tell this got irritating fast! Why was this included? Why?! For comedy? I doubt it succeeded with many viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, this show was boring and vexing as all hell. Not a single moment to enjoy. It doesn't even try so of course I feel unamused to the nth degree. Not to mention that there were a few specific moments (boob grab scene in episode 9 being chief among them) that were especially maddening, so that didn\u2019t help one bit. Some of you might say \u201cWhy not just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride?\u201d Because it's so fucking boring and stupid, that's why! If I didn't keep my brain permanently on thinking mode when watching anime, I\u2019d have dropped so many more by now since I would've quit the moment I got really angry bored from watching, hence more of my time would've been wasted! I actually heard people say this was a parody of these kinds of shows: it is not. It image then completely straight and pretends to be mildly self-aware, so that blows. So yeah, this show fails on both levels! Fuck this show, I hate it! I hate it so much!\\n\\n\r\nThis might prime some of you to ask: \u201cWhy did you watch this obviously bad show in the first place?\u201d Well, some people probably watched it out of interest of the admittedly out there premise. Maybe some wanted a trashy anime to chill to (and likely found themselves still disappointed). And of course, some of us came here just to join hands with a chunk of the community always ready to see a truly and obviously terrible burn and revel in the flames together (I mean, usually the anime suffering that fate deserves it), often coming one by one to see if it is as bad as the reputation hypes it up to be. Not gonna lie, that was part of it for me. The other part was that for all intents and purposes, this did catch my eye as something I thought would just be a below-average at best isekai title for me to watch and feel little towards, at least after I was initially put off by the cover picture. However, I can definitely say that it did deserve the fate I mentioned in the third reason because as I have been saying over and over again, this anime is the very definition of laziness when it comes to this medium.\\n\\n\r\nAnime is a very intensive and passion-filled medium. There are so many titles out there, good and bad, that obviously show a ton of passion and effort in at least some regard. So, when I see an anime as lazy as this get a sizeable viewership while better and more passionate (if not always good) shows like Knight\u2019s & Magic, ACCA 13, and so on and so forth get at best a much lower viewership and at worst the absolute shaft, I get royally angry. People had to slave over this, and no passion feels like it\u2019s coming out, no care put into anything regarding this show. I am so thankful that this show is getting quite a thrashing, and honestly, it needs all the hate it can get. Honestly, unless you really want to watch something without a soul, you should avoid this anime entirely, as this anime is an affront to the medium as a whole. Is it the absolute worst anime out there? No, there are some worse ones out there for their own reasons, but this anime really has no right to exist, and honestly, it is still very, very high up there, both in an all-time perspective and in the perspective of this season alone. It manages to be an affront to the concept of entertainment, and even the concept of a harem and isekai show. Sadly, this season isn\u2019t over yet and there are a few real duds left to cover at the time of writing, so until then, I bid you adieu.",

Take that genre, and think of every stereotype and trope imaginable. Throw them all together, and you get this show. \r\nDude dies, God feels bad, sends him to another world, he gets a better life than before, he gets a harem, he's op as hell, everythingis as convenient as can be, the list goes on...\\n\r\nSeems like pure garbage.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is not where the value of this anime lies. The reason I'm giving it a 7 overall is because it's refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nNow hear me out: it's not revolutionary, it's not beautiful, it's not emotional- in fact, it feels very clunky, has odd pacing every now and then, and doesn't offer much.\\n\r\nBut I'll be damned, this show has me smiling way more often than some of your other run-of-the-mill shows in it's genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because it's so bad it's good.\\n\r\nThis show is like eye bleach to me.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching tons and tons of the same stories/genres spun different ways, you can get tired out. This show is one where I can just sit back and relax. I already know everything that's going to happen, and I laugh and smile because it's exactly what I expect it to be, and because it's so dumb.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm just going crazy from all the time I spend watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime helps me appreciate the other stuff I watch, because it almost in a sense helps me reset, seeing as I'm so desensitized to all the uniqueness out there nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, this anime is no life-changer, and it is most definitely not for everyone.\\n\r\nBut if you're like me, and just need a little break from the anime-watching grind, and need something \"other-worldly\" (sorry, I had to) to have a good laugh... then watch Konosuba, because it's actually good.\\n\r\nBut again, if you're like me, and you've already seen it all, then yes, you can watch this, and appreciate it just like I do, appreciate it in all it's trope-y glory.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt seriously is an anime I shouldn't like, but something in my brain and all the anime I've watched makes me enjoy it. I'm sure there's a few of you out there who will agree... emphasis on \"few\".\\n",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n(The Very Definition of a Generic \u2018Isekai\u2019 Show)\r\nNoticing the word \u2018isekai\u2019 in the title, reminds me of the many related series and mangas that I\u2019ve seen and read.  Most, if I recalled, were pretty enjoyable and entertaining.  I guess, you could say I enjoy the \u2018Isekai\u2019 genre to a certain extent.  However, this series just yells with genericness from its lame title and boring synopsis to its dumb-looking thumbnail to its list of genres (i.e. adventure, Harem, Comedy, Magic, Romance, Fantasy) that are commonly found in fantasy romance-comedies.  With all this information in mind, I immediately knew thatthis show would be absolute shit.  Still, I watched it because I wanted to know how generic it was.  So, I took some notes and noticed some common \u2018isekai\u2019 tropes: \\n\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist is killed (in this case, God kills him with lightning) and is, then, transported to another world.\\n\r\n\u2013 Overpowered, dense Protagonist with no redeeming features, beyond being nice and kind to everyone.\\n\r\n\u2013 Typical medieval setting.\\n\r\n\u2013 Standard magical spells and elements (e.g. earth, wind, fire, etc).\\n\r\n\u2013 Various races and creatures with different languages (e.g. lizard men, fox girls, slimes, etc).\\n\r\n\u2013 Twin female adventurers in love with Protagonist (obviously they have purple hair).\\n\r\n\u2013 Samurai girl in love with Protagonist.\\n\r\n\u2013 Rich Princess falls in love with Protagonist at first sight, declares marriage, and the parents approve it.\\n\r\n\u2013 Exploring ruins (e.g. underwater ruins and underground ruins)\\n\r\n\u2013 Fanservice (e.g. clothes dissolving, clothing changing, boob grabbing, swimsuits).\\n\r\n\u2013 Typical quests (e.g. collect X amount, kill this monster, explore this area, etc)\\n\r\n\u2013 Typical \u201cboss\u201d monster fights (e.g. dragon, \u201cunknown\u201d creature, etc )\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist gains a \u2018free mansion\u2019 and every female lead lives with him.\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist continuously reusing overpowered skill (i.e. slip)\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist creates a \u2018gun\u2019 in a fantasy world.\\n\r\n\u2013 Protagonist forms a pact with the strongest spirit animal (i.e. tiger).\\n\r\n\u2013 'Resisting the Urge to Look at Naked Girl\u2019 Event.\\n\r\n\u2013 Slime Event.\\n\r\n\u2013 Beach Event.\\n\r\n\u2013 Harem Ending.\\n\\n\r\nYep, we have it all, folks.  Some of the most common \u2018isekai\u2019 tropes are in this anime.  Now, whether that\u2019s good or bad is up to you.  For me, it usually doesn\u2019t bother me, but, in this show, it was was more annoying than outright fun.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple and predictable, especially towards the end.  Nothing too complex or \u201cdeep\u201d, or nothing that will confuse the viewers.  In fact, if I had to summarize this series, it would be this: OP main character is trapped in a new world, OP main character encounters many people with many problems, OP character solves the problem with his OP skills and spells, rinse and repeat.  Some examples:\\n\\n\r\nExamples #1: the butler is shot with an arrow, but wait Touya can just remove the arrow and heal him back to normal.  He doesn\u2019t die and everyone is happy.\\n\\n\r\nExample #2: The Duke\u2019s wife is blind.  If only someone had a spell that could heal her and make her see again.  Enter Touya, he uses heal.  The Duke\u2019s wife can see again, everyone is happy.\\n\\n\r\nExample #3: Evil guy is controlled by evil red orb thingy in his eye.  How do we get it?  Enter Touya, he uses some retrieve magic and destroys it.  Evil guy is defeated and everyone is happy. \\n\\n\r\nFor everything else: Touya uses the spell \u2019slip\u2019 on enemy.  Enemy slips like an idiot.  It\u2019s Super Effective!\\n\\n\r\nWe can keep on going, but basically there is no tension, conflict, or buildup to these events.  And even if there was some tension, conflict, or buildup, they will be conveniently and immediately resolved within a matter of seconds because of Touya\u2019s OP spells and powers.  In addition, there too many slice of life moments (e.g. Touya making ice cream, making a board-game, making a bicycle, going out shopping, etc) that don\u2019t add anything to the story or plot, they are just there to remind the viewers that Touya is a nice and kind person.  Additional problem with this anime include: simple and bland conversations and dialogue, unnecessary fanservice, the inclusion of too many chibi scenes/transitions, and lack of world-building.  The lack of world-building is pretty frustrating; our characters never question about the various races and languages, religions, regions of the world, governments, etc.  And even when our characters venture to a new land (i.e. Eashen), they never took the time to fully explore or learns about it.  And finally, Touya fails to fully use his smartphone for other purposes, besides using it as a map, checking mail/texts, and looking up information, until around episode 5 or 6.  And even then, the smartphone is nothing special, it\u2019s just there to enhance his already overpowered skills.  But, the most disappointing thing was the fact the anime doesn\u2019t show our main character getting killed by lightning.  Would have been more entertaining had they animate it.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe background designs, such as buildings, interior designs, forests, etc, are lacking in detail and are just there to show where the our characters are.  The character themselves aren\u2019t very detailed either, in fact, one could say that all the main characters have pretty similar looking facial designs, in that everyone has a pointy chin and a rectangle face.  They only differ in eye color, hair color and design, and what clothes they are wearing, but that\u2019s pretty obvious.  Most crowd scenes just feature static characters, and if there are multiple characters moving it\u2019s usually a fight scene.  Now, speaking of fight scenes, the animations for these scenes are a mixture of still and dynamic shots of the characters punching, kicking, or slashing something.  And finally there are many chibi scenes, which are cute, but, at the same time, are annoying and interrupt the flow of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! and its sequel, then you\u2019ll be glad to know that several voice actresses have a major/minor role in this series.  Specifically, Maaya Uchida voices Elze Silhoueska (elder twin), Chinatsu Akasaki voices Yae Kokonoe, Sumire Uesaka voices Leen, and Kikuko Inoue voices Origa.  The remaining cast is voiced either by professionals or novices, especially our main character, Touya Mochizuki, who is voiced by Katsumi Fukuhara, a complete newbie starring in his first major voicing acting role.  Now, having said all this, the voice acting is okay, not the best, but decent.  Moving on, the background songs are just there to convey the characters\u2019 emotion at that given moment; the sounds of swords clashing, magic effects, and many other action sound effects are standard for its genre.  Though, I\u2019ll admit hearing the \u2019boing\u2019 sound effect whenever boobs swayed or jiggled around was stupid and hilarious.  And finally, the opening song and intro is your typical J-Pop that introduces all the girls that love our protagonist, and the ending song, also your typical J-Pop, features only one female character at a time.  By the way, it's kind of stupid to include two characters (i.e. professor and silver-haired dude) that only made a brief, and by brief less than a minute, appearance on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character has a readily established character trait and personality that will remain with them until the end of the show.  In other words, characters introduced in the beginning will not change throughout the show; they will not have any growth or development and no change in personality.  And, for some reason, we aren\u2019t given a proper background story to most of our main characters.  For example, our main character, Touya Mochizuki, is nice and kind, is dense and completely oblivious to the girls\u2019 feelings for him, and is overpowered because of God.  That\u2019s it.  He doesn\u2019t tell us about his former life, nor does he have any desire to do so.  Furthermore, he lacks any specific goals or ambitions when he enters the new world, and barely reacts to any situation or event.  A very boring and generic character, indeed.  \\n\\n\r\nThe female characters, despite looking and acting cute sometimes, are no better than our male lead.  In fact, most are common character tropes, such as the tsundere, the shy younger sister, the rich princess, the girl that-appears-young-but-is-actually-hundreds-of-years-old, the traditional girl, etc.  Moreover, they don\u2019t have any background story (except for samurai girl, Yae Kokonoe), and lack any goals and ambitions, besides wanting to get married to Touya.  Everyone else is a secondary character, so don\u2019t expect any backstories or any character development; they are just there to make certain events happen to our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, this show is boring, predictable, and lacking the humor, thrills, and intensity compared to similar shows.  The story is painfully generic and lacks tension and conflict, the animation and art is just there for show, and the characters are stale and unchanging.  The only entertainment I got from this series was anticipating when Touya would pull the \u2018Slip\u2019 card and defeat his \u201cenemies\u201d.  Overall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this show, unless you like the original source material and wanted to see the anime adaptation of it, or you are a huge fan of \u2018isekai\u2019 tropes.",

            "content": "A first impression. We get it from anime's synopsis, source material and sometimes even from the \"thumbnail\" and title alone. Something that can start a huge buzz around a particular work and can literally make it the most famous and the hottest show of the season, huh, sometimes even a show of the year, be it 2016's Erased and Re: Zero, or it can doom an anime from the very beginning, which the most recent Hajimete no Gal is a great example of. And in case of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, it's certainly the latter. Many people have been drawn back because ofhow it presents itself. At first, it looks like your generic tasteless and meaningless show in an overused isekai setting, that has become something like a subgenre on its own, due to a massive amount of anime with said framework, we see every year. And even though, judging a book by its cover is very superficial, I will try my hardest to truly show you, that in this instance that saying is enormously right and also why this anime deserves nothing more than hate and contempt.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the least odious aspect, the production value. While it's not as bad as characters and plot, that I will discuss later on, animation and sound are what I would consider being the embodiment of the word passionless. It's relatively easy to spot that there's no love and effort put into neither the animation nor the sound.\\n\\n\r\nIt feels like the studio behind this show, Production Reed if there were a website with animation techniques, would go in there, choose a \"cute mediocre animation\" template, imply it into their little project, and be happy with the results they've got. I think that I've seen these type of plain backgrounds, bright colour palette, cute character designs in quite literally every single an \"another world\" show that doesn't have any unique qualities nor any interesting quirks in its animation. A perfect example of that \"uniqueness\" is No Game No Life's animation, which bombards us with the brightest and the most blinding colours in the universe. I tried to overlook that, and for a decent amount of time, I've thought that the animation used here is not bad. I thought of it as the only thing in this show that hasn't sunk below the level of being so-so. Surprisingly enough as the series progressed, for some weird reason, which I am assuming is the lack of funds, the condition of it, has gone downhill drastically. From being mediocre, then by having junky and choppy frames in some scenes, to in the end become less of an animation and more of a drawing made by an eight years old kid in Paint, with sketchy character outlines, their expressions and actions.\\n\\n\r\nWe can say the same about the sound. And while the animation is bearable and eventually becomes abysmal, the sound has to take the cake for being the part that sank this ship called production value, below the level of being middling from the very beginning. An opening, which while I do not dislike J-pop, has nothing more to offer than being your typical and generic anime opening #2321. The ending, which has somewhat grasped my interest with its interesting enough concept of having the main female characters sing the same annoying song in different episodes. And finishing on an imperceptible soundtrack, that I don't know if even exists. These songs are not even in the slightest degree euphonious or worth remembering, and it feels like they have been thrown in randomly. There's also one thing that has bugged me and made me question my ability to hear correctly, and that element is the sound objects make when they have some interaction with a character or the environment. We can hear it very commonly in later-ish episodes, where for instance an ordinary (walking) teddybear while shaking his head, would make a beeping sound and boobs would make a sound of a trampoline.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's go into more important parts.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the premise, the very first and easily noticeable handicap. The premise is what will draw potential viewers in and will make them watch the first episode. It's the igniter of every single anime, movie or any other type of medium. Without at least semi-interesting setting, it'll be impossible to make an enjoyable piece of entertainment. And with this basic concept, which everyone knows since they were born, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, is a perfect example of how not to make an intriguing premise. Touya Mochizuki, whose problematic existence I will bring up later on, was accidentally killed by a lightning sent by the God himself. The boy appears in heaven-ish place and the omnipresent being apologised to him, a random human child and as an apology, he wants to revive him in eponymous \"another\" world with his wished item, which is again the eponymous smartphone. See where the problem resides? \\n\\n\r\nAnd I know that it may sound flat, but it lies within this setting's level of uncreativity and stupidity. You want me to believe that from such an off-putting and downright dumb premise which sounds like an undercooked joke, you can make an engaging show? I do not know what the hell was the author of source material even thinking when he or she came up with this repellent idea of a futile isekai with a modern electronic device as its the most \"innovative\" part. A concept that had no right even to exist, due to its lack of effort in being at least somewhat ingenious. I still harshly blame Production Reed, for adapting the said idea in the form of an amateur light novel into an anime. Someone may think that by doing so, they are doing a great deed and give a starting writer and his hardly known work, an opportunity to become more recognisable. And while on paper it might sound great, it's only half true. The quality of these works is very dodgy at best, and they are very questionably written. Even if they're completely terrible, they're to put it simply, samples made by beginners, which is my guess of what Patora thinks about his/her first novel. And even though the quality of them is rather obvious, studios like Production Reed are trying to get easy attention and potentially money out of the hate that their show will receive from people who don't like to be fed up with idiotism. They seem to follow the saying: \"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd it can be seen in the quality of writing. Every single episode falls into one simple scheme: Our main character Touya Mochizuki finds someone in need, be it some random girls, or some unimportant kings and noble people, offers them his help and saves them from oppression, thus making them fall for him. But how does he do that? Is he such a charismatic personality that everyone wants to be with him? Well God himself offered him two reality bending abilities, the strongest plot devices you could have imagined: his newly given godlike powers and his smartphone. And while his Jesus level might is rather self-explanatory, his smartphone can apparently enhance magic, transfer it and be used as a magic item, which makes little to no sense. This episode structure can be seen at its fullest in the 4th episode when Touya saved duke's brother from poison in about a minute, with the usage of that one spell that apparently no one could use. In an instant, everyone in that room started clinging to him in the blandest way possible. It ideally shows how pathetically lazy is the plot itself. There's no thrill, no excitement, nothing. What's the point of creating a problem when it can be solved in a blink of an eye? For our plot to progress? It doesn't happen since we don't have a clear goal. So what is it? The only thing that seems to matter is expanding our main character's harem with cardboard cutouts and making more and more beings worship him as a God after a short showcase of his powers. Same can be said about fight scenes, and don't get me started on them. They're the most pointless moments in this show. If a monster on in worse scenario, a group of humans attack our group of main characters, they are a non-existing threat since Touya is always there to save the day in one single move. Nothing encourages us to dive in this wacky world, which by the way, is terribly built. The cause for that is Touya's ability to teleport. It leaves us dumb folded since we don't know where exactly is that place where our characters have teleported to and how far they are from their previous location. \\n\\n\r\nAnd even when there were comedy anime series with lousy concepts, they were done in a somewhat proper manner, by putting a huge emphasis on the comedy and its characters, the two aspects which Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, doesn't know how to do. \\n\r\nThe comedy is plainly weak. In some occasions, the whole joke is some stupidly forced fanservice scene, which the creators are trying to push down your throat, while in others, it's a stupid oneliner that had little to none sense and wasn't funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, let's talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nStarting on with the icing on the cake, the pinnacle of this show, Touya Mochizuki. He is your ordinary young boy that after being transported into our dull fantasy world has become the worst type of character you can find within anime as a medium, the \"overpowered\" protagonist. I dislike that word as it has been thrown around in a meaningless fashion, but there is no better way to describe this kind of a character. And while we had some decently made \"overpowered\" personage, there has been an enormous amount of terribly written ones, and a splendid example of such protagonist is Kirito from Sword Art Online, the Jesus-kun. Touya shares a very similar facial line, hairstyle or even the type of clothing that Kirito is wearing, but with different colour. Touya Mochizuki, whom from now on I'll refer to as Jesus-kun the Second, just like his predecessor, has to live with the burden of having an enormous amount of \"charisma\" that attracts any brainless female character from across the ocean. It's a very cheap trick to make him into a \"reliable\" character. He's like every loser's dream and perfect version of themselves, which they can't and won't be. Jesus-kun the Second is a one-dimensional, bland and empty cardboard with zero personality and motivation whatsoever, just like the original. He is a shell with some gold sprinkling on top of it, while on the inside he is simply a hollow and odious abyss of nothingness. He has no redeeming qualities, just like...\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast. I hate this kind of characters with such an intense burning passion that it's unimaginable. While Touya and Kirito type of personage is a laughing material since they can do everything, it's quite funny to see them pull some deus ex machina bullshittery out of nowhere. However, girls surrounding them are just pitiful. I won't go on and describe every single one of them as it would be truly pointless since none of them differs from one and other. The only thing that is unique to each of them is their name and appearance since all of them are reduced to the role of being something like an achievement or even an object for our Gary Stu to collect throughout the series. They have less personality than a bag of potatoes and are simply a bunch of one-dimensional cardboards, insulting to every single girl on the face of Earth. These human wannabes are here for the only one goal: to be Jesus-kun the Second's harem, suck on to him like a leech and keep on blushing whenever he compliments them or breathes at them.\\n\\n\r\nI hate both of these character types as they are honestly worthless and offensive in every manner possible. Watching them interact with each other was an agony on itself, but could there be anything even worse than that? Oh boy, you have seen nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes from 8th to 11th, are what I would consider being the most pain-inducing amount of time spent in my entire time.\\n\r\nAt the start of the 8th episode, we're greeted with a scene that has begun the period of a new low which, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni has hit. We get an entirely forced fanservice scene, which while tasteless and unnecessary isn't utterly dreadful and might be easy to overlook. After some other terrible scenes, we spent some time of the episode following an unimportant hollow \"background\" character, and in the end, we get a new addition to Jesus-kun the Second's harem.\\n\r\nIn the 9th episode, we're treated to a scene when I started crying. It was around 15 minutes into the episode, Leen, an unimportant harem member number #421, while being invisible started sexually harassing a character introduced to serve as a joke. It was a moment when I shed a tear. Tear of agony and torture of how deeply can something fall. Then we have yet another showcase of Jesus-kun the Second's might by finishing an incredibly epic and not a randomly thrown in an evil guy in a spank of a second. The episode ends with a scenery of a beach, and you know what does it mean?\\n\r\nAnd so rolls in the first beach episode (the 10th one). We have utterly horrible and tasteless fanservice of the main female cast and some background characters reduced to the role of a boob shot material pretty much consistently throughout the 21 minutes of the episode. The 11th episode showed us how the animation from average could go downhill at the speed of light. But even that was nothing in comparison with a scene where a cyborg sex toy (I'm not even joking, that character was introduced to us like it.) pushed her tongue right in the Jesus-kun the Second's throat, and our gorgeous girls have lost their minds. As for the 12th, I'm speechless. Confessing love in the fakest and childish way possible and a random deus ex machina filled with autism, but I guess what would you expect at that point.\\n\\n\r\nSo, did I enjoy Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni? NO. I think I have never been in a situation where an anime has given me an emotional instability. From laughing my ass out at horrendous and cheesy episodes to a moment when I nearly destroyed a glass of juice which was standing right next to me, with my bare hand. The only word that would correctly describe what was happening to me would be, dying. Every single episode, every single minute and second of this 12 episodes series was painful to the fullest meaning of this word, causing me to suffer a massive mental and physical damage, from nearly everything in this show. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is by far the laziest, awful, insulting, and the borderline idiotic anime brought to our screens. A light novel made by an amateur and produced by a little-known studio, while at first glance looks like an entirely terrible show, let me ensure you that is even lower than you would have thought. One-dimensional cardboard cutouts with the same amount of personality as a pair of wellies, weak production value and terrible idea, executed horribly. This show is nothing more than a stinky pile of cliches and retardation lying so lowly that it has reached the core of our planet, reducing my mental stability by a huge chunk. and nearly forcing me to injure myself. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone unless you're a masochist.",

            "content": "Throughout the generations of anime, we have been given the genre called ''Isekai'' or ''In Another World''. From the video game genre of Isekai like Log Horizon and SAO, to the parallel world Isekai like Konosuba and then this anime, we all loved and hate the genre as well.. Summer 2017 season will end soon and for the past few months, it brought us a few Isekai animes. One of them is ''Isekai Wa Smartphone To Tomo Ni'' or ''In Another World With My Smartphone''. Now, when I first look at it from it's poster, I thought the anime will be good and comedic likeKonosuba... Like Konosuba.. with a Smartphone! But sometimes, when you make higher expectations to something especially anime, it bounds to fall down. And it really did for this anime. 'Isekai Wa Smartphone To Tomo Ni' revolves to the protagonist named 'Mochizuka Touya' who accidentally died, so.. God is like ''Im going to revive you into a Magical world cause you accidentally died '' blablabla. You know you should have just revive him ''God'' lol. On this review, I will talk about the story, characters, the sound, art, my enjoyment of it and overall rating. Don't worry there will be no spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nThe isekai genre have been widely popular throughout the anime so it is not that original anymore, though it is said that all stories are not really unique or original itself. Some are base on real life situations while some are based on made-up/fictional things. The same to this anime. Lack of originality of the show for viewers are already a problem of this show. Guy goes into another world and he has multiple harem girls with him and he is freaking overpowered? Common.. The story revolves about 'Mochizuka Touya', a normal boy in the real world, turned into a guy that has so many selection of girls. Hell! he can marry anyone of them because he is ridiculously overpowered not only by his power but charisma (though his face looks like someone I know from another anime out there). If you are going to take a look on the following episode, the route of the story is like this - He is OP. He helps with his OP powers then he met new girls for his harem then go to an adventure/quest, then again he helps another set of girls for his harem and so on and so on. This guy doesn't know that he is collecting girls like Ash catching Pokemons in the wild. If one character is already a mess (no balance or over the top), the viewers will think that he can do anything he wants even there will be an impossible problem. Viewers will always think the story will go on without having a major problems/conflicts because of an OP Main character. If the villain or a supporting character is OP than the main, then I think it is fine. So.. Because of the MC's overpowered abilities and continuous/ongoing set of route of collecting girls, the story is horrible...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story is bad itself.. But on the other hand, I can say that the Art is pretty good and normal for an isekai anime. I mean we don't need over the top animations like on the 'Fate' series for this anime because of the story's bad route and all so the art is not a big deal here at all..\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nLike the art itself, the sound is pretty normal like any other animes out there. The sound effects of the spells, the slashing of both sword, the background music. No major problem at all on this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nThis anime proves that there is someone more OP than Kirito from SAO himself. That's what makes this anime pretty bad. The character balance between the official main character (Touya) and the other main character ( the first harem girls with him ), along with the supporting characters have intense differences of balance from power, fame, charisma and other things. This makes the author to make a story to FOCUS ALL the good things to him with almost no bad sides at all. Problems will come yeah sure but because of him being OP, he can erase that problem very easily.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWith his cringy attitude and overpowered mechanism, I don't really enjoyed this anime at all. Though there are some parts that have some slight 'ecchi'-ness, though I can say that the whole problem is the anime itself. The fights are... Well we can all predict that he will win along with his harem girls thats why the fights are not that enjoyable or entertaining. Viewers can predict what will happen and then it turns out they are right because of what they see from the MC himself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... I rate this anime as 4/10. Sure there are plenty of fine fights and pervy moments but because of this kind of flow on the story, the rating for this anime (for me) is less than average. A poor grade.\\n\\n\\n",

Yes, its got its cliches, yes its got its predictable moments, BUT I don't let that get the better of me at all.  In fact, if you are a heavy harem/romance anime nerd like I am, you'd enjoy the cliches and predictable moments like I do!\r\nHonestly I know that tons of people will rip this anime a new one just because of XYZ reasons which is unfortunate, but TO ME, I am thoroughly enjoying this anime so much. \r\nSo far going from 4episodes so far, it is really fast paces which I really enjoy. The Main Protagonist Guy is the perfect guy I always liked in harem/romance. Super nice, super level-headed, always being a gentleman, and so far he doesn't get all \"nose bleed\" like most dudes in harems which is great. He's also super strong which is great in my book. \\n\\n\r\nTO ME I am really enjoying this anime. Maybe I'm easy to please? I guess I am, which is great since that means there are many shows out there that I can enjoy!",

            "content": "This is my first review and most likely will be my last in a while. I just couldn't understand how people rated this so bad while I enjoy this as much as most other fantasy animes! Isekai is fun, light and carefree to watch with bit of comedy and is something you can watch to escape from reality when you aren't in a mood to watch 100% realistic or some sad drama animes or so.\r\nIsekai reminds me a bit of No Game No Life or Log Horizon in a way that main hero goes to another world due some reason, in Isekau because he diesin his world and is sent to another one by god. Might sound weird but this is fantasy anime so you know it's not gonna be super realistic and logical anyway! The main heroes in each of these three animes are all kinda similar, all are quite OP in bit different ways on each of these animes. Also I think Fairy Tail is quite similar to Isekai as both have magic and OP main hero, but Isekai has only few episodes released so there isn't really many ways to compare these quite yet. The thing that separates Isekai from these others the most is that Isekai is harem while the others aren't.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is like any other (harem) fantasy anime, harem side isn't imo too strong like the girls don't get too close with kissing or anything, but you can see the harem in there as most of female characters likes the main hero more or less and his group consists only of female characters so far.\\n\\n\r\nI don't judge art styles usually too much, but imo art is quite neutral looking which is good. There is no any unique ways of drawing but it is simple and similar to many other animes and while it may not be super great, I don't think it's bad either.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much about sound as I'm that kind of person who skips openings and endings and as far as the sound used in the episodes goes, I don't think there is anything different or bad about them, so again quite basic what you are used to hear in most other animes too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters aren't especially super unique [quite basic OP and bit airhead main hero at least when it comes to reading female minds (as typical in many other animes, but it's quite logical as it is impossible to read girls' minds irl too :D) and bit different female heroines] but they are all quite likable and you can find the one(s) that you like the most.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime as much as I enjoy many other fantasy animes. You won't end up even looking to this unless you like this genre and if you do like it, it's pretty much as good as other similar animes. This may still be missing some depth that you can find in Log Horizon or in Fairy Tail for example, but both of those series are long ones that progress slowly and you never know how this one is gonna progress and end until it's finished so I can't say for sure yet how I should rate this overall. For me ending is very important and also if there is hints of upcoming season(s) I want to see them and base my opinion to whole series and not just on few episodes or one season if there is more seasons.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this will help at least one of you guys reading this and if some of you find this helpful I might consider writing more reviews too! :)",

            "content": "In Another World with My Smartphone epitomizes everything that a great show like Konosuba is satirizing. Touya died by accident in the real world so G-d decides to give him another change in another world and he's allowed to take his phone with him, the only caveat being that the only person he can contact is the aforementioned \"G-d.\" He also sets him up with some buffs which gets revealed early on basically means he can miraculously control every type of magic and just by reading a spell that took others years to perfect, he can cast it. So long as he has the nameof the spell and can comprehend what it actually does, he can cast it.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe this show is ultimate teen male wish fulfillment. He has a harem of girls who all either overtly or secretly have crushes on him.  He has unheard of power that basically enables him to do anything.  And everyone is amazed at how awesome he is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the beginning of this show's horrible execution. When your main character is simply UBER in ever single way, there are no real obstacles to overcome. The hero's journey is about evolving as a character and overcoming personal failings to succeed in trials. It's simply not interesting to watch a guy who has none and this is almost to the same degree as Ains in Overlord. Even in a show like Dragon Ball Z, where we know inevitably Goku will win, he faces obstacles greater than himself and he evolves (albeit somewhat predictably) to triumph.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire concept of someone going to a fantasy world and being able to use their smartphone is a pretty neat idea. There are a ton of things one could do with a connection to information in the outside world. Presumably you could look up plans to introduce \"undiscovered\" technology or use it to bridge language divides in this other world. Instead all the character has really used it for is the maps function.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are beyond boring and to be honest other than very minor personality quirks, the characters literally have no personality. The main character looks almost exactly like Kirito from Sword Art Online. And if you ever complained that Kirito was flat and boring, he has nothing on Touya, who is probably the most dull character I have yet to see develop a mini-harem. The other characters introduced thus far are a stereotypical loli character who is a noble, a samurai who eats non-stop, and a pair of twins who are not really identical or fraternal but one is assertive and physically aggressive while the other is shy and submissive.  Rounding out there party is the king's daughter, who is instantly obsessed with marrying Touya.  And her parents have no qualms with it because of a magical eye and seem perfectly okay with leaving the running of their kingdom to a child they have known for half a day, at most.\\n\\n\r\nI originally wrote this review at only two episodes in and nearly every one of my predictions already came true.  Now only four episodes in the only thing I've not predicted is when go to the beach. 50/50 chances of a nosebleed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I might be able to forgive the story a bit if there was something else to latch onto but thus far the art has been pretty mediocre and music has been very generic. The dialogue between the characters and their \"adventures\" feel more like something you'd see in a bargain bin visual novel game.\\n\\n\r\nI am not sure why I am going to subject myself to watching this if only to really see if my predictions hold true and if somehow it gets better.",

            "content": "In 2015, Hideaki Anno said the anime industry was walking to its end, that animators no longer had passion and what they did and anime was turning into nothing more than merchandising, and Japan was soon to be taken over by new animators from China or Tailand.He could have only been blind.While we do have a lot of empty shows, every year the anime industry do releases at least 9 or 10 shows overflowing with passion from the creators, and while that doesn't mean they are all great, from time from time we stumble upon masterpieces, sometimes innovative and creative, sometimes simply mastersof it's genre.In 2010 we had Rainbow, in 2014 Barakamon, in 2015 we had the incredible Concrete Revolutio, in 2016 the breathtaking Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and now, 2017, we finally have another one to this count:Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTechnical Aspects --  10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n  One may argue that this anime have bad animation, but that just shows how little this one knows about the art of animation.The studio uses what little budget they have to give the anime the breath of life in a great way.How amazing it was when they showed an entire travel, by just animating the characters on the top of the carriage or when they hide the legs in battle sequences so they can demonstrate motion with little to no cost.Truly genius of they're craft.The entire OST is also unique and rich, with remarkable compositions like \"Spells I\", \"Spells II\" or my personal favorite \"Spells IV\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Plot -- 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n  Normally, i would judge this 2 factors separately, but they are too connected to do so.In Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, both the characters and plot are groundbreaking desconstructions of any anime ever made.Rather than having such a boring concept as power progression or character development, everyone is already presented at the peak of their powers and have absolute 0 development or construction in the series, since they're already perfect without needing it.And the plot, oh the plot, it can only be the work of a genius, there's not a single moment of tension at all in the entire story, rather, everything is solved instantly by Touya, wich itself is a completely unique character, as you can see by the fact that his main ability is to make other people slip.The smartphone is also used at least once in almost every episode, executing perfectly the anime's concept.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance -- 10/10\\n\\n\r\n   You can't say that the romance in Smartphone is anything less than perfect.The first actual romance we have is between beauty-mark-knight and big-sister-furry, and is developed using a WHOLE episode, to show just how much the writer cared about making things natural.The main romantic plot, is that every girl likes Touya, this love is carried in a completely organic and coherent way during the whole narrative, peaking on the climax of the series, when Mochizuki and the girls get into a consensus of a polissexual marriage with all the four girls.This is another one of the greats desconstructions in this anime, love that overcomes bounds of race, jealousy or age(since he marries an 12-year-old girl as well).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment -- 10/10\\n\\n\r\n   IwStTn isn't anything short of a masterpiece, deconstructing countless concepts and tropes of standard anime(like showing a character that only appears at the last 2 minutes in the opening in an incredibly smart way to create hype for a second season).I enjoyed it for every second, no, every frame and would recommend for literally anyone.My best wishes for anyone watching this amazing critic to the standard relationship systems that reign in the world.",

He combines magic with a phone.\r\nThe artwork of this anime is beautiful, plot is set in medieval (castle) age.\r\nVery good use of music, author knows when to use it, and not to use it so much.\r\nI recommend you watching it because it is one of the mostinteresting anime's airing right now. 10 Points from me!",

            "content": "I see a lot of people harshly judging this anime. I understand why people might hate it. But today I am here to tell you exactly why Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is the best comedy anime this year if not the best of these past 4 years.\r\nLet me set something straight :\r\nThis anime is the literal apex of ironic comedy anime.\r\nYou heard me. Ironic comedy. If you don't like ironic comedy or you are one of those people who actually care about serious, in-depth stories, this is definitely not an anime for you. Now allow me to elucidate on how this anime perfectlyaccomplishes exactly what it is intended to accomplish. \\n\\n\r\nTo begin, this anime is full of clich\u00e9s. If you could not tell this anime was a clich\u00e9 filled anime from the title, it will be pretty apparent within the first episode. However, the amount of immense clich\u00e9s in this anime is a complete parodies of other animes. It parodies terrible anime is such a great way that it appears to be a terrible anime. Its crazy overpowered MC, the instant harem that he gets, the clich\u00e9 outfit, and it's use of \"friendship and teamwork\" to overcome tough situations instead of the MCs insane overpowered abilities. This is just a mocking of all the ridiculous clich\u00e9s used in all the regurgitation animes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even for being an ironic comedy anime, it still shines through story wise. Beyond the clich\u00e9s, it takes original turns throughout the story that one would not even nearly expect even from a regular, serious fantasy clich\u00e9 anime. Such as actually progressing the harem and the characters. Characters in typical harem animes normally always fit into the -dere categories. However in this anime, the expected \"tsundere\" characters do not vehemently deny loving the MC. Take Yumina for example. She is expected to be  a Kuudere(character with no fuckin personality at all but underlying emotions that are unspoken) but she isn't. She likes Touya, but she also respects him enough to be around other women. She also understands that polygamy exists in the world, so she is fine with that. She gets jealous, but she also understands that a lot of the clich\u00e9d misunderstandings are just misunderstandings and puts her faith in Touya. Now lets take Touya into account. His clich\u00e9s are : super overpowered, super oblivious, stupid nice to everyone, and shy when it comes to relationships and shit. However, he is a deadass pervert. He also has confidence in himself, and slight arrogance. He realizes how overpowered he can be but he does not strive for more power. These round characters are really revealing of the talent of the writers, masked behind a veil of overused clich\u00e9s to blind the audience. It is a great work of art for being a very good parody of terrible art. \\n\\n\r\nOnto everything else, the art was pretty good. The sounds were regular clich\u00e9 cutesy sound effects. The story was, beyond the clich\u00e9s, actually pretty decent. The uniqueness of magic and null magic, and the capacity it was taken to was pretty cool. You'd expect some fucking massive kamehameha blast explosion shit to take down one of the most powerful beings on the planet, but instead he takes it down using basically the youtube autoreplay button to make a snake wrapped turtle trip over and over for 7 hours. It's ridiculous simplicity makes everything funny, but also original in the fact that it isn't overly explosive and flashy to draw attention. It kind of reminds me of one punch man where the main character is so overpowered that he uses regular lame moves to get the job done.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy ironic parody comedy, or just something light in contrast to all the serious dark tryhard animes, I believe that you will love this ironic masterpiece of an anime.",

So in order to get to some sort of ending by the end of the season a lot of content is missing. So if you want character development and other stories I really suggest reading the light novel. I have bought the novel and fully enjoy it. There is so much more to the story that the novel opens up that it makes the series more interesting. As for the anime I think they looked to highlight themain stories and create something to draw people into the novel. I know it sucks they removed a lot of content, but this seems to be a tend going on in anime. I have seen a lot of new anime series that are based off of popular novels over the pass few seasons. Unfortunately most of these rarely see another season since they are primarily a way to promote the novel. And since the anime gets thrashed for lack of content it usually does not do well enough to merit another season. so if you like this kind of genre but feel the story is lacking try the novel out.",

This anime is quite interesting, where the main character brings Smartphonenya to the world of fantasy.\r\nStoryline\r\nThis anime tells a young man who accidentally satan lightning by the god, the reason is very stupid that the god did not see that there is someone there. The story in this anime is less interesting in my opinion, because this anime though in the fantasy world but the story is very flat and really - really boring. Sure the story looks simple and not confusing but the plot so - so wrote. This anime also Ican say quite unique, where the main character in this anime brings his favorite object, the Smartphone. I also quite enjoy all Genres in this anime, except comedy parts, I can say comedy is very thin and in this anime only focus on genre harem, adventure and fantasy. And also this anime just focus on daily life and surrounded by some pretty girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime will continue to grow over time. All the characters have different properties such as: smart, zealous, wise and good to others. I feel that the characters that often appear in this anime are just auxiliary characters fill the story (arguably the main character to be supporting character). For each character - each character I will not discuss, because later elongation.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe description is not very good and also not too bad, I love the coloring in this anime, I feel its fantasy really feels. Mixing colors especially green color that can be in good value. The animation is also not too rigid, and the effect when removing the magic can be said pretty good. It's just that the monsters in this anime look cute, and not ferocious at all wkwkwkwk: v\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI feel quite satisfied with the sound produced by the voice (Seiyuu), they can interpret according to the scene or character traits. Background is arguably pretty good, a very important background to set the atmosphere in this anime. Opening and Ending anime pretty good, Opening entitled Another World brought by AOP directly make us into the spirit, the most I like is Endingnya titled Jonjou Emotional that was brought by Seiyuu every heroin in this anime, very manteb voice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime has a very casual storyline especially touya do not have a strong enemy and always touya beat them easily\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10\\n\r\nStory : 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is perfect for those of you who like the world of fantasy without a serious fight, just relax and enjoy the provided, that's what I feel from this anime.",

To be honest I wasn't expecting much just passing some time, I saw the picture and I thought well this show is going to suck... But than I watched the first episode I found it to be extremely interesting, it made me laugh but at the same time I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story over all wasn't unheard of I have seen likely hundreds of anime at this point, but the way thatthe characters interact with each other and even some of the silly stuff oddly enough worked for this show. We are only into the 6th episode so we will see where it goes. But so far they have made a silly story work really well. Even how the girls interact is great fun...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is not revolutionary but at the same time its not bad. But that really depends on taste. Some might like the new Berserk anime style (not my thing but some people might like it)... Others might like the older style of Legends of Galactic Heroes... So I seem to like this type of art more than the older style or the random Berserk style...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nYou hear music... And the voices sound good... I really can't say to much unless someone has a really weird voice in a show (unless it's Kenshin because well hes Kenshin) its really hard to mess up the sound aspect of a show... The music matches the scenes well and that is important...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters sure they might have been introduced in a strange way... But I love the characters of this show, I enjoy how they interact with each other and i also like how the MC seems to be down for whatever comes his way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the main selling point of this show you might think the story is cheese its the same old thing... But the laugh factor alone makes this show truly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before the show was not revolutionary there are many shows that are similar to this. However, the show is proving to be truly enjoyable and that's all that really matters. But to be honest most shows fail to make me laugh out loud this show actually made my side hurt at one point. The fact that I am actually looking forward to the airing of the next show is an accomplishment in its own right... As I said before the amount of anime that I have consumed in many years that I have been watching anime usually means that I will power through an anime just to add it to my list of anime that I have seen... But this one I think I could watch it again and still enjoy it...  Great show!",

Instead it focuses on the characters' interaction with each other. It knows fully that you'd probably be watching this anime for the harem and romance, and that's where they excel anddoesn't give you any bullshit plot that a lot of harem anime do.\\n\\n\r\nSo, again, this anime is just a pure ball of fun, and if you're tired of watching serious anime this might just be the way to unwind from all the bullshit and just have nice trip through harem land.",

            "content": "Here comes dat boi with another short review in response to all the haters.\r\nI went into this anime because I like stories that make the MC come from \"our\" world and then they get transferred to a fantasy world but with some sort of advantage that makes them better than most people, like Overlord. \r\nThe anime doesn't have a complicated and deep storyline, but who says that's a bad thing? Coming to an anime like this and criticizing it for the story is like going to a football game to watch the romance.\r\nThe story's basically about a guy named Touya who dies, gets a giantboost to his overall traits by \"God\" along with his smartphone, and then gets transferred to this fantasy world where he has now uses his giant advantages to be a good Samaritan. He meets harem girls, fights badies in the name of justice, and even acts like a normal human being unlike most harem protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I liked this anime so much is because the MC isn't a total wimp and the harem thing actually has a conclusion, not a standstill like ever other cliche harem anime out there does. Touya doesn't just fidget an entire episode when a girl walks past him, and even better, he isn't a weakling that stands on the sidelines powerless to stop every little bad occurrence.\\n\r\nI genuinely enjoyed all the simple explanations about this fantasy world and all his interactions, especially since NO TIME WAS WASTED. They didn't waste half an episode showing them traveling some where, or 10 minutes explaining why something works and why something doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nArt, and sound were all pretty normal for a fun little anime like this. Character development was... There? I guess? But like I said, it's not super deep. I really enjoyed this anime. The MC in here is how the one in Re:Zero SHOULD HAVE been. This anime doesn't beat a dead horse with it's comedy like KonoSuba S2 did.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen people complaining about LN adaptations? Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is everything those complaints are about. Whether it is done on purpose (parody) or not is a different topic.\r\nI'll start by saying that first few episodes are tragic from technical perspective. Everything happens way too fast, we jump from scene to scene without any proper transition - like in some recap. Add to it this anime being what it is (explained later) and it's no surprise if you want to drop it after one or two episodes. Luckily it gets better after first few world and character introduction episodes.\r\nThe storyis as cliche as it gets. No, it's even more than that. The protagonist, Touya, isn't just overpowered - it's whole world that's working in his favour. Things just happen at perfect time for him to profit from them or show off his awesomeness and gather his harem. This aspect of anime is mostly visible in early episodes when he needs to build his fame - it's not so problematic later on.\\n\r\nI had really hard time telling if the story is seriously bad or if it is meant to parody isekai titles that fall into OP MC/harem cliches. On one hand it feels like cheap fanfic written by 8th grader. On the other, story doesn't seem to take itself seriously. All the conflicts are resolved quickly and painlessly without Touya even trying. Actually, most of times it ends up being comedic, even when enemies are serious evil guys.\\n\r\nThe general lighthearted feel this anime gives is actually pretty nice. I believe it's not meant to be taken seriously. You just enjoy light comedy and this weird limbo between SoL and adventure.\\n\\n\r\nNow, having very light and comedic story works better if you have nice characters. Smartphone doesn't. The cast is as one-dimensional as it gets. After you saw introduction scene of a character you already know everything there is to know about them. Huge waste, considering it's a harem and story isn't too focused, leaving a lot of time to fill with interactions between characters. \\n\r\nTouya himself also deserves mention here. There is this meme about Tatsuya Shiba being a god. I wonder what should we make for Touya Mochizuki then? He is just out of scale. While I love OP protagonists, his lack of personality really makes it hard to like him. He is most basic harem MC with the most OP powers I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art, Smartphone isn't anything special. It's pretty bland and action scenes are just weak. Backgrounds are bad. While characters look pretty good, they also lack details. \\n\r\nGenerally speaking \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nAfter everything I wrote above it's hard to admit that, of all the seasonal anime I watched weekly, I waited the most for this one. Call me crazy, but it's ridiculously enjoyable. If I watched all episodes at once it might be different though. I'm pretty sure I'll rewatch it in future, so we will see.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, I'd be hesitant to recommend this anime to anyone. While I liked it a lot, I know it's pretty weak from technical perspective and not everyone would enjoy its light story. \\n\r\nHopefully this review will help you make choice whether it's worth watching on your own.",

However, after watching the first episode i learned just how average it is. \r\nWhile the concept is new, it follows in the fantasy steps such as SAO and Konosuba, and does everything worse than they did. \r\nThe animation is nothing to brag about, the sound is mediocre and there seems to be no character developmentat all. Now bear in mind that this is only for the first 4 episodes, so development might come, however it seems unlikely from how it has developed so far.\\n\\n\r\nBut worst of all to me, is the story. While the concept seemed intriguing at first, it never made it through to create a good anime. Smartphone is part of the title, yet the part it plays in the anime is very VERY small. Instead they just decided to make the protagonist strong, making the smartphone obsolete.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing in the first 4 episodes making this anime worth watching, except that it somehow still manages to be enjoyable. It lacks in every aspect of being a good anime, yet the small skits and interactions between characters still makes it rather fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are sitting at home, in need of something with a very light mood, and just need a little bit to smile about, then watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise steer clear of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnime: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A good 7/10.",

            "content": "Well... as an Anime Casual (see Joey/TheAnimeMan's video about Anime Enthusiast types) i pretty much enjoy this one particular anime. Though there's a bit of bad editing in here, it didn't effect the story that much. Some people might think this as a \"another SAO-like anime\", but it's not that close to SAO,. SAO's Kirito is too overpowered and a bit \"fourth wall breaking\" since he knew how to beat the game. But in this anime, the main male character Mochizuki Touya, doesn't have any knowledge about the world he's in, and even though Kami-sama boosted almost every bit of his stats and his magicalstats to a degree which you can assume \"Overpowered\". But i think that Touya still could die at any moment since he is always a bit underguarded and sometimes not even awaring the situations that he's in. Pretty much this anime was made to be enjoyed and not to be taken too seriously. That concludes my review. MystoganMiku, out.",

Basically a C.\r\nBased on the way anime are rated in MAL this def doesn't deserve a 6 but isn't good enough to be a 7.5 or above.\r\nI found this anime to be entertaining. It wasn't enough to keep me excited through the whole thing, but it definitely had its ups.\r\nStory: 7 - 6 / C - D\r\nNow given that this is a harem anime, you can't expect a decent story out of it. It's either harem or it's story. However, the concept of this world and the idea behind bringing a smartphone to another worldwas unique. The combination of invincible main character and magic is unique. And of course the fact that this is  one of the few, if not only anime where the harem is completed and not just half-assed friendships.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 - 6 / C - D\\n\r\nGiven that it's 2017, this has decent animations. Not the usual overdone CG bs nor is it particularly amazing. None of the characters are particulary memorable other than hetrochromia-chan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 - 6 / C - D\\n\r\nAgain, neither good sounds nor bad sounds. It's pretty average and ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 / C\\n\r\nThis is where I will give a solid C for this anime. Because the characters ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING. How many of you have seen a harem where the relationships from episode 2 and episode 12 or 13 are the exact same. Everyone should have their hands up. Nope, at least they go somewhere. Although the \"sorry\" card may have been pulled dropping everyone's position.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - 6 / B - D\\n\r\nThe anime jumps around and has an interesting concept. It truly feels like it was made for the purpose of entertainment and doesn't have the feels of a try-hard studio. Obviously it can't compete to anything taking their work seriously, but this anime is something everyone can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nI actually think that too many people take anime seriously. Judging an anime based on it's subjective quality versus the entertainment it provides is pretty off-handed if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a solid 7.0 or a C in my book.",

Much of the show is overly sexual and the main character couldn't be more generic. Smartphone wears all of this on its sleeve and to think otherwise should in itself be considered a falsehood.\r\nThis show was just fun. A young, well to do, man saves a bunch of people, goes on stupid journeys and, ofcourse, wins the hearts of a lot of women in the process. Nothing is difficult for him because God blessed him to be OP. This makes it very easy for moments of power fantasy and ridiculousness to insue.\\n\\n\r\nI can't believe someone would watch this for 12 episodes and think that this was anything more or less than that. It was serviceable and I look forward to the statues and doujins that will come out as a result of this average show.",

            "content": "\"Isekai wa Smartphone no Tomo ni, a series so generic that yet manages to be enjoyable in a way.\"\r\nIf anything that's how I'd describe this series. \r\nHaving already watched in the past other series of the genre \"Isekai\" I couldn't help but to roll my eyes so far up my skull the first time I knew about this one that I could see my brain for a second; and even so I gave it a try, you know, just for the sake of it. And in the end I gotta say... I was surprised by how this series managed to actually do things in away it actually ended up being fun.\\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, the series is STILL trash in many ways, and uses so many of the clich\u00e9s in the book that I'm surprised I didn't actually dropped it halfway through. In some scenes the backgrounds were so badly rendered into the final product you could tell they completely overlooked the quality control. The story is nothing extraordinary from the Isekai genre aside of the elements where the MC uses his smartphone and the fact he's probably the most powerful being in that world, and on top of that it's also a freaking HAREM. And BOY, don't even get me started with the animation. \\n\\n\r\nBut still, what I found enjoyable was that despite being bad, it wasn't being a total tryhard in becoming a serious series and just focused on being exactly what the premise shows: a fun adventure in a fantasy world. The MC (who is possibly the blandest, most generic character at the beginning of the series) doesn't get too much of a progression until the end of the series where he actually starts making decisions a normal 15 year old teenager would do. It also manages to break (in some really, REALLY few occasions) some clich\u00e9s from the standard anime harems, which was also a pleasant surprise. The MC's absolutely ridiculous overpowering is put to good use and he knows it. He has the power of God and Waifus on his side anyway.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the story, and as mentioned before, there's nothing extraordinary aside of the character having a smartphone and being super OP. Not only that, but it also manages to actually go through so many stories in the span of 12 episodes which gives the viewer something to be entertained despite knowing that in the end it's all gonna be ok for the cast. Other Isekai series would probably go for 2 or 3 arcs per season, but this series managed to solve everything on the span of 24 minutes and then pass onto another scenario to bring more elements to the story, becoming an actual episodic series. A missed opportunity for character development? Sadly yes, but it doesn't really matter for this story.\\n\\n\r\nI also found some magical elements and the world building to be pretty decent and even interesting too. For a character who can wield virtually any type of magic, he knows exactly what to do when the situation arises, and even bringing stuff from our world into there. A decision so painfully obvious anyone would do had we also get that amount of power into another world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also just archetypes, they're not characters per se since none of them have any actual motivation other than wanting to bone the MC. Despite that, they manage to be charming in their way and provide good support to the cast in the end. They sadly get little to none progression in the season, but hey, at least they manage to set their feelings straight at some point. A prowess so monumental in other series that it's impressive a series like Isekai wa Smartphone beat them in that. Bonus points there. If a Season 2 ever hits, I hope we get to see more of their pasts and deeper, more meaningful motivations. But who am I kidding? We probably won't see that.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, this series is bad but not a total trainwreck. It's not mediocre either, but not a masterpiece at all. I'd say it's pretty decent at most. The story moves fast so it's not boring or slow, and the characters have their own charm, which compensates for the lack of character development. It's just a series to have fun with and not take seriously in the end. Anime elitists will pan this one, obviously, and younger viewers with not too much experience with anime will probably love it. And I? I personally liked it. I knew it was gonna be bad, but at least it managed to make me invested in Touya and the girls for 12 weeks straight. Here's for a better produced season 2 someday. Or also just read the LN.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: Guilty Pleasure / 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlso watch the dub for a better enjoyment. There the characters sound less painfully bland and it has more humor. No, really, they managed to do a good work with that. Major props.\\n",

            "content": "Quite the disappointment. Isekai brings absolutely nothing new to the Harem table. The only benefit being that harem fans can watch it just for half-hearted entertainment and nothing else...\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe lowest I've ever given. The story (if there was one) was horribly cliched (if not completely) and though cliches are not bad (coming from a cliche hater) it's always good to bring at least a pinch of originality in an anime and unfortunately the only original thing in this anime was the smartphone being there in the new world (hence the name, there's nothing else original). Nevertheless, to end on a positive note it wasa fun story more or less... And don't get me started on that joke of a last episode. That was hell at it's finest, and I'm not talking High School DXD hell, the *hell* hell.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the highest I can give this anime, it's art is really good. It was beautiful, the way the characters looked was incredibly accurate and accentuated their expressions. The backgrounds were good too. Colour was (maybe the only) one thing this anime excelled at. It was simply lovely to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was below average. The VAs did an okay-ish job. I expected better. Except for Linze (who contributed 4 points out of 7) no other character's VA did a great job. Maybe except for resident dense MC Touya who did quite well. The OP/ED was another of the many things I was disappointed at. The OP was average (being generous here) while the ending was forgettable. All of them. Other than that nothing else was that great in the sound section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nYeesh. Now I gotta write this too? The character development was an absolute disappointment too. Horribly cliched characters with zero development were both a Lose-Lose for Isekai Smartphone. Though there are many (useless) characters I've gone into detail for only those who had the most screentime. The girls fall in love with him for absolutely no reason. Even if this is a harem there should be specific reasons for a girl to love a boy. Heck, even To LOVE Ru and High School DXD and Rosario to Vampire and many other popular harem anime had girls with even half a good reason to fall for the main guy but Isekai had none of that...\\n\\n\r\nTouya: The zillionth Dense Harem MC. Touya is the Kirito of this anime right here. And anyone burnt out by SAO will have no need to go further than that. For those who haven't, Touya was your everyday dense character who is OP throughout the anime. Now there's nothing wrong with an OP character (example Saitama) if done right. But unfortunately in this anime little was done right. So to get back, Touya does very little to make himself acceptable to most people's eyes (maybe to those snotty teens who like nothing but fanservice and zero plot).\\n\\n\r\nElze: Another failed 2017 attempt at a good Tsundere, Else is how NOT to make a Tsundere character. Like the other girls, she has no specific reason to like Touya... Apart from the fact that she is used in all the cliched flat chest jokes there was nothing memorable about her. Maybe her long purple hair? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nYae: A character I quite liked at first, she was the equivalent of left out bread. As in, good at first, and moss covers it and spoils it later. Yae was a character who I came to loathe in the later part of the anime because the studio constantly tried to paint her as a Tsundere (another 2017 failed attempt) which backfired horribly. They could have gone lengths to make her good but that could be said for every other aspect of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLinze: Save the best for last, Linze was probably the only good character out here. Though she too had no reason to love Touya at least her *reactions* and behaviour were quite believable. Still, like the other girls she was also a disappointment (how many times have I said disappointment already???). Towards the end I started liking her a little as she improved her personality a bit (started being more aggressive) but other than that nothing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing a harem fan I still enjoyed this a bit (a bit mind you) and I could overlook many of it's cliches but for this review I couldn't as they were countable faults... It had a huge share of cliches and disappointing moments but in the end, the weak comedy and lame romance and harem were somewhat okay by the end. Either because it grew in you or because you were happy it was finally over (maybe both for me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.8\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime gets a 5.8 from me. I wish it'd be lower but the calculations didn't let me do so. Isekai Smartphone is a cliched adventure to harem land where everyone falls in love with you for no reason at all and you're OP too. That's basically the whole 12 episodes in a nutshell. But to end on a positive note, Isekai Smartphone is in the end a somewhat fun anime to watch. It's something you should watch only when you're extremely bored or when you've nothing better to do. Perhaps recommend this to someone who plans to watch BnP or CitH and they'll thank you maybe. A great anime for those wanting to pass time, or just to have a laugh and if you're me, watch it for the heck of it.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Linze is best girl. Yae at a close second. <3",

            "content": "Okay, here is my first review so its going to be horrible\r\nSo Konosuba is abou-\r\nWait this isn't Konosuba let me restart\r\nIn another world with my smartphone (I'll refer to it as Not Konosuba, since I'm not typing out that entire title again) is about a not edgy version of Kirito in a medievalish world with his smartphone. That's pretty much it.\r\nStory - 2\r\nThis anime has no story at all, the most \"story\" is when you are meeting characters. Everything else is pretty much just filler that shows off how overpowered our MC is, or random fanservice. Mostly everything our protagonist does is predictable, even theone unpredictable thing he did became predictable once he did it a million times (multiplying poorly animated beams of light and shooting them at people).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 4\\n\r\nIf we were to get rid of the characters clothing and hair, then change their eye colors to blue, there would be no difference in the females. I feel like they just copy and pasted the same character 4 times, then changed it up a bit when dealing with the girls. The guys on the other hand are actually unique, and have ACTUAL FACES. It's annoying how similar the King and Duke are, though its easy to remember which one is which.\\n\r\nAs for environments, I'd say it is pretty average compared to most shows. Not Konosuba isn't horrible or outstanding when it comes to this, its simply average.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\r\nI never really paid attention to any music other than the OP and ED(s) since I was /trying/ to enjoy the show, so I'll only comment on those. The songs weren't bad, but I'd like to point out that the visuals were horrific. They just showed off the characters while playing music in the background for 90 seconds. The ED shows off some random harem girl doing nothing, even if the episode had nothing to do with said girl. I'd love to go deeper into it, but I don't think the appropriate place for my 12 paragraph rant on how bad the ED / OP is belongs in the sound portion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1\\n\r\nRemember when I said it felt like they copied and pasted the same character 4 times when dealing with the females? They did the exact same things with the personalities, excluding shameless princess girl. The harem girls have about as much personality as a piece of paper. I also don't  understand why every person who holds political power acts like a child, it simply doesn't make sense to me.\\n\r\nI saved not Kirito for last. I'll cut him some slack, since a lot of protagonists are like this, but he has no defining traits at all. He's nice and somewhat perverted I guess, that's all that comes to mind when I think of not Kirito. The one unforgivable thing about this character is that he barely reacts to serious situations (for example, when he died, he didn't give a shit and just talked to God like they had known eachother for his entire life).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nThis show does have a lot of flaws, though it wasn't completely horrible. It was fun to predict what was going to happen and have it be right, though once your predictions are right 100% of the time, it gets pretty boring. The majority of the jokes weren't my taste, but there were a good amount that were, so I guess that's nice.\\n\r\nOh, I'd like to mention some things that caught my attention, too. Take Not Kirito's coat jacket thing and turn it black, and he's now Kirito. Big tits magical girl did Megumin's explosion thing. God was completely ignored for the majority of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime gets 4/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, I was scrolling through the anime list on Hulu, and saw this anime. I took one look at its description, and knew how bad it was going to be. I watched episode one, almost laughing at how bad it was. By episode 6, I was certain that this was just a pathetic cash-grab. Honestly, 4/10 is generous on my part. Lets hope that the next Isekai anime isn't as horrible as this one.",

Secondly, my overall rating of the anime is how much I enjoyed watching it, that's how I rate and critique most of the anime I watch. Now let's begin with the review.\r\nIn no regards, is this anime good. It's full of cliches, stereotypical and dull characters, a studpidly overpowered and clueless protagonist with a stupidly large harem and of course, to top it all off, set in another world.\r\nHowever, don't get me wrong, the anime is bad, horrible even, but it's refreshing and honestly fun to watch something so generic,personally I found myself enjoying all the protagonists OP-ness and his harem of women, and watching everything go right for him for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just a teenager named Tomoya being reborn in a new world as a perfect harem lead and more overpowered than anyone in this world, you watch him strike awe into everyone around him while he builds his harem. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special, not flashy or unique, but not bad either. Though, can't complain about fan service though, am I right?\\n\\n\r\nI never really noticed/was aware of any background music, so I can't really comment on that, the OP is, well, meh, and the ED is too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, dull, stereotypical and fall perfectly into your everyday harem.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how much I've said the anime is shit/mediocre, I'll say it again, its surprisingly, very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably an anime you should watch when you you're bored/got nothing else to watch and just looking for something relaxing and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal ratings\\n\\n\r\nStory (3)\\n\r\nArt (6)\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\r\nCharacter (3)\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain spoilers. Read at your own risk.\r\nWhere do I even begin with this? I'm guessing the author also thought the same thing, because this anime has little of were to start from. But let's try to start at the supposed start, the very first episode where we are introduced to our main character... who just so happens to become the ultimate Mary Sue of isekai anime for the flimsiest reason ever since Santa Claus. We get practically no introduction to his past or his goals or even a semblance of personality beyond being \"a good kid\". Now an animated representation of adeity, who apparently is inadvertedly responsible for our main character's death in his world, wants to make amends by reincarnating him into another world where he can live the life that was cut short from him. And just to spice up the deal, the boy gets all the buffs, both physical and magical, that a god can give and even gets to ask for 1 extra wish (as thought the chance to live on a new fantasy world while buffed to max level in every aspect isn't enough). And the little dork with the charisma of a breadbox asks to bring his damn, excuse me, titular SmartPhone (what brand? nobody knows, nobody cares). But what good could it be to him? He won't be able to call anyone, he won't be able to recharge his battery, it'll be little more than some souvenir from a world he left behind. Not to worry! The god-man is cool enough to buff EVEN THE SMARTPHONE ITSELF to run on magic power AND have God on speed-dial, in addition to several other features which will all combine to turn the damn thing into a literal reality-warping tool. And off the kid goes onto his new adventure in a new world of fantasy and magic. Yay. What shall be his first heroic deed? Saving a couple of girls from some goons... how original. And so the first 2 members of his harem are introduced right in the first 15 minutes of the 1st episode.  In the mean time, while discovering that he is indeed super f****** broken overpowered that can use any type of magic that he wants from that world, including those that should be unique to just 1 person, he gets to add more members to his harem, almost 1 per episode, as they are attracted by the gravitational force of his main protagonist d***. Including the clearly underage ones. ESPECIALLY the clearly underage ones. All while revealing little to no semblance of a relateable or even likable personality. All we get is Mr Perfect Perfection that can do no wrong, beats all baddies, gets all girls, etc etc, all the boring isekai protagonist tropes turned up to 11. World-building would probably be a bit more interesting if it wasn't being constantly overshadowed by just how AMAZING the main character-kun is and how he can LITERALLY ACCESS THE COMMAND CONSOLE OF THE UNIVERSE. You might be wondering how the art style and scene-play holds up to all of this. Well, wonder no longer, as the animation is mediocre at best, using the same generic art style that's been overly used in every other anime series this last couple of decades and the pacing of the animation itself contracts and expands more frequently than a beating heart. To the point where they present some generic fight scene one second and the next throw in an ecchi scene that looks like it used 90% of the series budget to animate. I'm not going to lie: I like me some ecchi here and there, but when the quality of animation contrasts so harshly with what's supposed to be the main focus, the overall result will just be disappointing.\\n\r\nIn summary: the whole series feels that it was made just to tick off some boxes on a list and not to actually present a work of originality as it should. The story is irregular, has no clear goal and is rife with awkward coincidences strictly happening to benefit the main character and his ever growing harem of future wives (which the show even clearly states will happen because of polygamy laws in that world, now ain't that a coincidence?). Now, this is without having read any light novel (if it exists) but if only we would get some sort of backstory to main character-kun as to know what makes him tick or why he is the way he is and not just some discardable hollow shell that can be easily replaced by a house cat, the show could have been a wee bit more interesting. All it needs is to tone down main character-kun's spotlight for a bit and try to present a few relatable features. As it is, he's just fiddling with his god-phone, breaking every single law of both his new and old worlds, doing the impossible without a clear reason why.",

There's pretty much nothing to his character. I could quote heroines of GJ-bu talking about their MC (who is similar to this one) \"let's nickname him 'White Rice', because his plain personality goes with everything\".\\n\r\nAnother major thing is that everything is convenient for the MC... all the time. The solution to the problem is either already in his posession or appears right away. He also has pretty much no ambition or will to improve. \\n\r\nI can't find any information on how many episodes will be released, but I'm guessing it's gonna be 12, so about 2 volumes worth of story. If so, the anime won't even reach the part where MC's personality reaches the bearable levels...\\n\r\nI guess it's an okay show if you don't have anything more original to watch. From the opinions I've gathered in a certain community it also appears to be enjoyed by kids-young teens, though it will probably end after they get to experience some more creative series.",

            "content": "tbh, I am no big fan of harems. I hate it usually because the mc is really bland or the girls are usually too silly/characterless/cliched. \r\nAnother fact -- I guess, you would call this anime also a typical harem anime. I was not interested in it initially. My friend suggested it and I read the synopsis, I decided it would be a waste of time and left it in my PTW list for a long time. But then I decided to watch it after all (I don't know exactly why though).\r\nThank god I did. I wouldn't call it a great anime or anything but itdid well the things it was supposed to do. It was definitely better than average -- in fact quite good and refreshing. \\n\\n\r\n(Actual review begins here I guess)\\n\r\nFor starters, the mc seemed to actually possess a 'brain' and thus did not seem to be a perverted idiot. The story lacks in depth or seriousness. This anime is definitely not something you wanna take seriously. This is probably one of those that kinda refreshes your mind after watching hours of serious stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe mc is overpowered right from the start. But, that is okay. I think it was better this way than having a pathetic character ending up with a harem. Moreover, the mc was also pretty smart. Not overly smart but definitely smarter than your average characters. And, I also believe the girls were not just introduced to 'be a part of his harem'. They had some role to play in almost all fights. For some reason the mc is still pretty dense when it comes to relationships, but it is bearable. He is not stupid, and tries to actually think through stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was alright. I am a hard shell to crack when it comes to comedy, but at least it wasn't forced or painful to watch. It definitely put a smile on my face throughout the season. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the ending -- it was pretty satisfying which is quite rare for harems (one of the reasons why I hate them). It also raises a possibility for another season -- if it gets one I am sure to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, I would say this is one of the underrated anime out there. As I said before, it may not have perfected everything but it did not fail flat in anything either. Therefore,  for anyone having second thoughts about watching this series, I think, this anime deserves a watch for sure. \\n\\n",

Very predictable)\r\nOverall - 5 (This anime isextremely average it's not even funny. I wouldn't watch this unless you're starting out on anime otherwise you'll just be annoyed.)\\n\\n\r\noh wow cool it's an isekai anime, I wonder if anything new and interesting will be done in thi- nope this is horrible.\\n\\n\r\nI read the synopsis a couple months ago and I got really interested and excited for it. Since then, I've hyped over it, thinking it'll be something really good like another konosuba (comedy in isekai) or NGNL (bored of life, goes off to do world-changing activities) mix. I was wrong. I've never seen something as predictable as this. This guy literally runs around with a harem to do quests even though he has the ability to use every magic type and knowledge from his world.\\n\\n\r\nIt's actually the most mediocre anime I've ever seen.\\n\r\n- Isekai\\n\r\n- is op and extremely bland in personality\\n\r\n- helps girls\\n\r\n- gets harem\\n\r\n- MC also has kirito coat (except white)\\n\\n\r\nAfter the second episode, I wanted to drop this. However, I wanted to watch the third one hoping that something interesting will happen but only to be disappointed. This harem over-credits the MC on the most obvious things (ex: episode 3, wow, you're so smart you figured this out, even though it's extremely obvious). The feeling I get from watching this anime is pure cringe and annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that nobody should watch this anime. If you're new to anime and you've only watched &lt;5 or so anime then picking this up might be a good one but if you're a person who has watched a lot of anime and seen a lot of (op MC with harem) cliches then this one will be a waste of time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nIf you've watched a lot of anime of this genre (OP and overly-nice MC gets harem ex: SAO, Asterisk War) I wouldn't watch this because this is a very cheesy and predictable anime which will only annoy you as you watch this. If you're new to anime or this genre then I guess watching this would be fine but a better recommendation would be something like Asterisk War which is somewhat more bearable.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr of tl;dr\\n\r\nIt's pretty bad. Don't watch this. Go watch something else that isn't this unless you're new to anime.",

I'll just use my smartphone...BOOM problem solved. Basically, he's nothing without his smartphone, so there's nothing to his character. The anime just gives him powers and he just uses them without a sweat, so he becomes the most op character in the entire world. He's not being challenged, cause he just gets powers for free. \r\nThe anime itself isn't as bad as people say it is. Don't get me wrong, it's bad, but It'snot really bad....it's just bland as hell. I'd say if you like cheezy op heroes that get the girls, then watch it. The fight scenes are a joke, but hey! He gets the girls in the end!",

Second of all, I'm not a super critical person when it comes to watching anime. I read the description and if it sounds even remotely interesting then I'll probably watch it. Lastly I haven't been watching anime for long, only 4 months, I have however watched a total of 43 anime series within that time, some being a lot longer than others. So this is just my opinion, if you don't agree wellthat's fine, everyone has their different tastes\\n\r\nI started watching anime only around 4 months ago and when I did, I didn't exactly knew which animes were the one's that people loved so much. Back then I went out on MAL and found this one, watched it and fully enjoyed every second of it, the art, the characters and even the plot too. It was also one of the first animes that I've watched (which may explain why I enjoyed it so much). I thought the concept was interesting and I felt like I could relate to the main character since we actually are a little similar in personality, and looks. I can understand why people think this anime isn't good, they've watched probably a lot more than me. However I prefer something somewhat more innocent, lighthearted and funny like this over something super dramatic like Attack on Titans (not saying it's a bad anime, please don't hurt me). So hopefully this helps you understand a little more of what I think of this show.",

            "content": "I will try to not give too many spoilers. But I will mention names and some characters and some of their abilities.\r\nWell then let's start with the story. \r\n-Story- (4/10)\r\nThis anime does not have an outstanding story nor complex plot twists that blow your mind, at least not in this season. (As a novel reader I can truly say this is just the tip of the iceberg)\r\nIn this anime storyline, mostly about the romance but sometimes the story just jumps into a  fight and must say from the first minute you can say how will this gonna end.But little details, comedy(a little) and romancemakes that standard and predictable story pretty enjoyable. But if you are looking for a complex story with twisted ends sir this anime is not for you.(At least this season.) \\n\r\nAnd I need to mention in the show main character is overpowered but it is kinda funny to watch. \\n\\n\r\n-Art- (9/10)\\n\r\nWell, art! First of all, we need to split this into 3 pieces landscapes, characters, and cities.\\n\r\nLandscape(out view of a city counts as a Landscape)\\n\r\nLandscape, in one word they are really outstanding. I mean studio clearly spend some time on those designs. You can clearly feel an ambiance with a look at them. If I speak for my self sometimes I pause the show and look at the landscapes. (You see the story is not that gripping.)\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nActually, they are all good. But there is nothing outstand  beside the girls (You get what I mean.) \\n\r\nCities(Inside of the cities)\\n\r\nWell, those can be better. In the show you cant fell the city it kinda feels like one street city.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound- (7/10)\\n\r\nI can just say intro and outro are good... Just kidding, but really they are really good. Fx and environment sound seem ok to me but some of the people say lip sync is bad, as a subtitle watcher I really can not confirm or deny that.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters- (7/10)\\n\r\nEh, that is a problem in this anime that because if you are watching for mystic adventure those characters may not be enjoyable. But if you are watching for comedy and romance then they are wonderful.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment- (9/10)\\n\r\nAs I say in the story part you are not going to like this if you are looking that kinda story telling. But if you are here for a mystic adventure along with romance and comedy and if you like the harem shows with cute fights in it, sir this show for you. Beside that this anime has a light novel series, with that I meant to say there is a long story.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall- (8/10)\\n\r\nI do not care too much about the story and I pretty like shows that involve cute fights over romance, the addition of mystic adventure is just extra decoration for me but I loved it.\\n\r\nAnd finally, this show is not underrated or overrated. When a show targets too many categories it cannot be perfect on every one of them. But in this way, they can access more audience. Usually, studios use this technique when they already planed more than one season.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

What harem besides maybe clannad can you look at through a microscope and not expect to find flaws when you search for them?  To each their own I suppose.\r\nI went in expecting very little tbh, but despite what I considered a pretty low score (I am starting to understand even ratings in the 6's have potential) I enjoyed the show.  Does it utilize the traditional tropes?  Yes.  Is the main character a bit OP? Yeah.  Did I go in expecting code geass? Hellno.  I expected a goofy ass harem anime with magic, and that is what I was presented.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me actually detail what I considered flaws despite low expectations:\\n\\n\r\n1) The amount and variance of magic used was redundant and unexplorative despite great opportunities with the vast elements illustrated.\\n\\n\r\n2) The usual harem issue of naive main character and immature relationship developments (but at least one character was straightforward).\\n\\n\r\n3) Typically anticlimactic ending, but that is expected with harem anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more flaws, but I believe going in looking to enjoy it rather than scrutinize every blatant failed bit of potential would ruin nearly any anime.  Same applies here. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I've seen worse, I've seen better, but I enjoyed it.",

I'm frankly a little bit disappointed it actually wasn't all that bad, a horribly dumb setup like \"guy gets to respawn in other world and of all the awful crap he could choose he brings his stupid phone and to top it off he becomes invincible\" should not have had much redeeming quality at all.\r\nThe story starts about as badly as anything possibly can, a teen guy is informed he died but just sips tea and goes \"K.\" asif the people he left behind would not be bothered in the slightest by his death, what the cheese is wrong with this moron? Same fool gets a once in a million years chance to ask the boss of the universe any random favor before being resurrected in another world, he chooses to keep his phone and just have it tweaked to work with the other world. At this point it's normal to want to high five him in the face with a chair.\\n\\n\r\nThings move forward, he gets more magic power than anyone in the new world thus eliminating any doubt that he will ever face any situation he can't handle almost immediately. I didn't like \"One Punch Moron\" but at least that show captured the struggle of someone fighting the boredom of being invincible, this anime had zero of that. The only struggle he faces is what to do with all the girls that throw themselves all over him and he's often so oblivious to their feelings you end up wanting to punch him in the nuts because you feel sorry for the girls.\\n\\n\r\nSo how doesn't the above end up being enough to warrant a rock bottom score? As bland and aimless as this OP moron is he actually does and says occasional funny things and he does in fact appreciate seeing girls exposed as opposed to many pathetic stereotype protagonists in other harem animes. How often do the girls get exposed then? Like 3 times in the whole season, and even then they don't get exposed enough for an ecchi rating. This stuff is so tame it's frankly annoying but it is slightly alleviated by the girls being rather sweet and enjoyable most of the time even with a bunch of clothes on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day this anime rides on bad jokes that are sometimes actually really funny and it does have generally pretty good art and sound. I'd even welcome a second season, despite my expectations remaining low since the main story is still crap.",

Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni: A generic anime where there are\r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni has as a great merit to be the perfect example of the generic that can be many anime that are currently broadcast.\r\nMany times I have said that many anime series in recent years seem to be mass produced. It is as if someone has written a pattern and the others simplymake copies of it. Well, to be fair, I will say that most people take the time to make some small adjustments ... but very small ones.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nHowever, from time to time there arises a series that does not want to complicate life and simply copies as is to the pattern. It is that I imagine Patora Fuyuhara, at the time he was creating this novel, with a notebook where he was checking that all the points were included.\\n\\n\r\n- Element isekai - check\\n\r\n- Protagonist so OP that fights are a joke - check\\n\r\n- Perfect one-dimensional protagonist for the audience to be projected on it - check\\n\r\n- Princess protagonist - check\\n\r\n- Fake harem with many waifus - check\\n\r\n- Generic plot dominated by slice of life - check\\n\r\n- Secondary characters that only exist to praise the protagonist - check\\n\r\n- Waifus whose personality is dominated by a clich\u00e9 and their love for the protagonist - check\\n\r\n- Antagonists that are only there for the protagonist to shine - check\\n\r\n- A lot of fanservice - check\\n\r\n- Romance reduced to the girls trying to make the senpai look at them - check\\n\\n\r\nMany series have some of these characteristics, but very few have all of them. And worse, very few have all without having made any changes. I think that if something can be boasted about Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is to be faithful to the pattern.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, talking about this series in depth does not make sense. Just look at the characters, read the previous check list and you will know what the anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I could say additional is that in the final two episodes they wanted to make adjustments in the romance by forcing things a little; however, that was so pathetic and was so badly done that it was better to have continued with the manual. I have not read the novels, but I would dare to say that what happened in the last two episodes does not go there.\\n\\n\r\nIt is incredible that at this point these clunkers continue to emerge that only serve to divert resources that could be used to encourage truly good series; or continue with better works.\\n\\n\r\nIt's sad that a grotesque like Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo has managed to get an anime; while much better novels of the same genre such as Arifureta Shokugyou by Sekai Saikyou, or Boku wa Isekai by Fuyo Mahou to Shoukan Mahou wo Tenbin and Kakeru are still waiting for an opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nEven if what they wanted was an isekai with a lot of slice of life, there are great options such as Isekaijin no Tebikisho and Risou no Himo Seikatsu. How long are you going to continue looking for generic novels, without soul and with princess protagonists?\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact that I'm not talking about the jewels that are Chinese novels. With so much material to choose from to make an anime (Against the Gods, Great Demon King God and Devil World, My Wife is a Beautiful CEO, Warlock of the Magus World, etc); the geniuses who make decisions it occurred to them that the best options were Gin no Guardian, Cheating Craft and Bloodivores ... This last one need to turn off the light ...\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nThis series is so generic that it deserves an equally generic review.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating:\\n\\n\r\n1/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is probably the most anticlimactic anime that I've ever watched. It's like a less comedic, worse version of Konosuba. In this review I'll tell you what this anime is about and what makes it so bad.\r\nIn this anime we get introduced to the main character that died not according to God's plan. For some reason the main character don't give a shit. He's super humble about God accidentally killing him and he doesn't care that he's dead and will never meet his family again. But God gives him another chance to live and sends him to another world with magic and all sorts ofcool things. When God sends him to this world God gives him his phone, max level magic and basically becoming the most powerful being in this world.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's the introduction. The reason why this anime is so bad is because he's super OP in a bad way. I like OP characters like One Punch Man and Meliodas from seven deadly sins because for example. Meliodas is funny. He doesn't care what others think of him, he has a goal and tries to find all the deadly sins to make his goal. One punch man has both conflict and goal. His conflict is that he's so powerful people think he's faking it. His goal is to become the most famous superhero.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Touya. He is super powerful. He is loved by everybody and as soon as there's conflict he exterminates it. Touya has no goal and he just \"goes with the flow\". Every episode of this anime is him walking, seeing a quest on the quest wall, asking his friends if they should go because it seems interesting. And then they go and do the quest with no problem. He practically just do things because he has nothing better to do. He has no weakness and he has no goal. That's what makes this anime so bad.",

            "content": "Oh dear, what have we done. \r\nI actually recommend people watch this show. Not because it is good, but precisely the opposite. Watching Isekai wa Smartphone is like a crash course for the anime connoisseur in how to quickly spot horrifically bad and blatantly unoriginal writing. Throughout the entire show, red flags pop up everywhere hinting to how the creators are just trying to make a quick buck off a popular genre.\r\n-Lazy character design. Every single character in this show is a one dimensional shadow clone of a character from a better show. This is not an exaggeration. Every. Single. One. \r\n-The main character hasNO personality. None. Zero. He's always positive about everything and never makes a mistake. His mood never changes. He can legitimately do anything. \\n\\n\r\n-Right from the start, the animation quality is nothing special despite being a fantasy setting. That's how you know you are watching seasonal trash - if you can tell that a shows investors are holding back it's a sign of serious caution. \\n\\n\r\n-The first girls he run into already want the D for absolutely no reason. You could take a random college student fresh out of creative writing and they could probably make better romantic setups than this. \\n\\n\r\n-It takes the main character zero time to solve any problem. Any hint of suspense is gone. All plot devices exist solely to get to the next female character to commence the same jokes you have heard a thousand times.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy genre almost seems like it shouldn't be able to be screwed up. By placing the setting in another world with different rules, it gives the writer absolute creative freedom in how they wish to build that world. These alternative dimension shows create a blank canvas for which anything is possible. And yet, here we are. It doesn't matter how much freedom you grant to people with no talent. These scrubs somehow managed to vomit up an anime that has both an abysmally nonexistent plot with characters that are all amazingly boring with zero development. Anime that is low tier but still enjoyable tend to screw up either plot or characters, but not them both. Isekai wa Smartphone manages to botch these two critical factors in a way that leaves you in awe at how such an incompetent story even got the funding for an animation in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is the kind of show you can have running in the background on a second monitor while doing something else and you won't miss anything because nothing is happening. It serves as a prime example of poor quality creative plagiarism, to the point where this anime almost defines it. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

He recognizes the cliches he's in and isn't as dense as the anime makeshim to be (at least in the Web Novel).\\n\r\nThe simple idea behind this is that, if you want to watch this, don't do it as a critic but rater as a normal viewer. In all honesty, the anime did fall short on a few things the Light Novel and the Web Novel did a better job at (namely scene development, Ende's participation, which is reduced to only a scene in the anime, and character development), but that's just consequences of it being only a 12 episode long anime. If it had more time, then it could have done a much better job at all that.\\n\r\nIf you really want to see what Isekai Smartphone has to offer, then I recomend either the Light Novel or the Web Novel (both actually). The anime is not bad, but these two do a better job at the crucial points.",

BUT, the story, the character, enjoyment and everthing is so above average, and being clich\u00e9d and unoriginal has nothing to do with it. In the end no anime is the same no matter how you look at it, like OPM is not the same as Mob Psycho 100. This is my favourite anime because, this anime is my type of anime, OP Main Character, is gifted and has the ladies. When people saythis anime doesn't have any depth or isn't realistic (I know that some people like that sort of stuff, now what I'm saying is my own opinion, not hating or nothing), I say, to heck with that. It's an anime, not a biographical and realistic one. Its not meant for serious critique and the sorts.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, the good points:\\n\r\n- Great Story, You Have Seen The Character Grow In A New Environment\\n\r\n- Visuals aren't as bad as some people make it out to be, when they make it sound like its quality is like Astro Boy 1961 (I assure you, its above average, imo)\\n\r\n-Gives you something to look forward to, not a 'hard' cliffhanger\\n\r\n-OP MC, Check, Harem, Check, Adventure, Check\\n\\n\r\nNow for the less than average stuff (that other people say) about this anime which shouldn't really be complained about when you have such good stuff in this anime: \\n\r\n-Action scenes aren't the greatest, I'll admit that, but in its defense, I say they're not bad at all, as I'd say that it's about average, like inbetween Clannad and OPM\\n\\n\r\nPS: My review's readers, I know I'm heavily biased but I would like people to see the relaxing qualities of the anime, not focusing on the bad ones as you may see it.

They have their own story, directing and different taste from other Isekai setting. But, lets see what they're all about!!\r\n'They failed to made excitement about how Isekai setting and atmosphere should be made'\r\nI know this is Harem anime. Like......... \"We dont need to make solid feel about the setting.\r\nWe just going to rush the harem and make a dream like 'Fantasy Story' about ideal man encounter with 6 or more (12 i think) attractive and interesting girl that reallyexciting and entertaining!!\"\\n\r\nSounds good right? (That just sarcasm!!! This anime is so bad)\\n\\n\r\nThey used the story with rushed Slice of life style, feel so fast and leave no trace. Everything is flow so damn flawless. They made a loop of conflict - climax - resolution for every episode and that was really easy to find the solution.\\n\r\nThis a type of 'Happy go lucky' anime for making us impress. The event to event or plot went fast and peacefully. The first impression about how the MC journey will begin really hollow. The atmospheric feel about this 'Isekai' really bland, not clear and not well delivered.\\n\r\nWhy he going to be adventurer, what is adventurer, and what his main resolve.\\n\r\nThe usefulnes of his Smartphone not so stand out than his other skill. Because what Kami-sama give to him was 'So much'.\\n\r\nStory and premise = 3\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art is mediocre, look really flat and stiff. They cant decide what artstyle they going to focus. Sometime they make cute scene fot the girls and result are fine. But they really tryhard making a fight scene. Camera prespective and background selection are bad and not vivid. Scene to scene so far appart and fast that make me so disgust.\\n\r\nAnimation and art = 3\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was fine and really helping this series existance. OP is catchy, ED not impressive.\\n\r\nBGM placement and selecton REALLY not fit and kind of annoying. They more care about the sound effect like footstep or something drop. However, result are like, we not give a ****.\\n\r\nVA, OST, BGM, SFX = 4\\n\\n\r\nThis is harem anime. Noone bats an eye about their personality. What our need is cute and more ecchi moment and playing dumb male MC. atleast some of them are entertaining and loveable.\\n\r\n(I dont want to put spoiler bruh)\\n\r\nCharacter = 3\\n\\n\r\nFor turn off your brain and just watch. Maybe you gonna like this beacuse everything gonna be fine and flat, even my feeling is hollow and not react to any should be heart-warming moment or intense scene. Even the joke and normal behavior are cringe and awkward.\\n\r\nYou gonna be like: 'haHAA', 'WutFace', and 'cmonBruh' (google image it).\\n\r\nThis series can hook my interest but execution, production quality and happy go lucky is really 'Bad' quality.\\n\r\nEnjoyment and directing = 3\\n\\n\r\nConclusion is 'Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni' may be your choice for entertain and killing time purpose (but still bad too), not for amazing or heavy material story.\\n\\n\r\nI not recommending you to watch this anime because everything in this anime seems bad and worthless. Unless you come just because the harem fantasy.  Final score = 3",

The majority of reviews I've seen have all been 1's, 2's, or 3's. And sure, this anime might not be anything to write home about. In all actuality I would consider it generic trash; however the point I'm trying to make is that being generic trash is perfectly fine. \r\nLet's take a looksie at the overall anime as a whole. From the scores I've given the anime on story, art, sound, and character the overall score should be a 5and not the 7 you currently see, but let's start my rant now.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is a generic Isekai anime about some teenager dying and getting sent to another world; a trope that has been done to death recently. \\n\r\nThe real twist this anime has to offer thought is that what made me actually enjoy this anime was the fact it was so generic. With the current abundance of anime about travelling to another, and each company trying to wrap the anime to put their own niche twist it was heartening to see an anime not give a shit about that and just be normal. \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong the anime isn't good, but it gave me the same feeling as if I was watching Rosario+Vampire. Generic and because of this normalcy I could turn off my brain and enjoy the simplicity the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is a 5, normal and plain. However I have given the rating a 7 because it's nice to every once in a while let go and watch something without caring.",

The girls meet every checklist you could want from deadpan to impish to tsundere and beyond.  The animation is sparse but well accomplished: nothing too fancy, but no disappointments either.  Some slight character developmenttoward the end, but nothing that will anger anybody because it took a daring direction. Some characters seem almost-aware that the whole situation is ridiculous: \"I'm not surprised anymore\" (or some variation) is a frequently-used line.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, you could probably watch without sound and as long as you paid attention it would  still make sense.  The very opening of the first episode explains everything you need to know: God accidentally smites your stereotypical, thick-as-a-nuclear-bunker harem protagonist, and to make it up he sends Protag to a stereotypical high-fantasy world with massively OP magical abilities and a smartphone that never runs out of signal or power.  \\n\\n",

HIS SMARTPHONE. (just another day in the isekai genre)\r\nAnimation: pretty meh, the characters are nice enough, and you don'tactually find yourself disgusted from bad animation, sometimes it feels kind strange because of course most of the work is put into the PLOT (if you know what I am saying) and the environment isn't really detailed but nothing to complain in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack/Sound Effects: the opening and the ending are nice enough, they aren't something that you want to listen everyday but it is quite nice and really gets you going to see what will happen next on the adventure. when it comes to actual sound effects it's really what you would expect from a show with not that high of a budget, it's not bad, it's only super mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: all the female cast have their own traits and personality that is inspired bad cliches we are very familiar with, and some of us have even found to actually enjoy them, for exemple: A cute timid girl with short hair and for some reason talks very politely, a tomboyish girl with long hair that acts mostly like a tsundere, your avarege everyday loli, your samurai cosplay referencing the Edo period and stuff like that. As for our main character we can see that he just does things as he likes, he is quite overpowered, he has a harem and everyone seems to fall in love with him just for the sake of it, but still he is quite nice to have as a main character because he isn't a perverted mastermind that humiliates his foes, he is just a guy that seems to be playing a game for 10 years straight and is enjoying his experience playing it once again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this show, it's a generic harem isekai with pretty good comedy, it's great to watch if you are doing a trip or you are tired of your everyday stress, the show doesn't really take itself serious and I guess that's why it is so cool, you will love and probably shipp one of the main 5 girl with the main character, and it's nice to see that a problem that would probably impossible is solved in a matter of second, which leads to every new episode be able to have it's separate beauty from the others. I think  that that the reason why so many people hate this anime is because they just take it too serious and don't relax and enjoy all the cliches we all learned to love with all these years.\\n",

            "content": "The typical fantasy 'Isekai\" plot that every anime fans would expect - OP main character, MC adapting to the fantasy world, gathering reliable allies for battle and completing quests, using the wits and knowledge from his world to unleash his capabilities in the new world and of course, gathering harem. \r\nWhen I read the plot, first thing came to my mind is the mediocre typical setting that many other series have attempted before. I came to a conclusion that there are nothing special or appealing about this anime. However, I decided to give both myself and \"Isekai wa Samartphone to Tomo ni\" a chance andattempted a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was decent but I am not very pleased with the anime artwork. It feels like a low cut budget production that the art was just dreadful. Plot wise - The MC, Touya Mochizuki were given priority and special skills that would even rival the king. Touya was able to equip all of the magic elements and inherit the legacy of the ancient civilisation - something that even a high ranking magic practitioner can barely do that. Hence, you can say that Touya has the whole world in his hands. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I hate most about this series is that there isn't any solid plot, Touya and his allies were just consistently defeating enemies, earning the trusts of Kings from various state and thus, adding more girls into his \"harem\" collection- YAY. Moreover, all he does is the SAME old deadly move to capitalise his opponent. There isn't any suspense or thrill in watching him defeat his opponent as you know that he will always easily overthrow them with that 1 godly move. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are those who just want to seek a light hearted, comedy, action with slice of life theme, this is just for you but there are MANY more better anime than this. On the other hand, if you are a hardcore action anime fan that would like to seek epic anime fights, then this will disappoint you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's mediocre and overrated.",

This show is not the kind that you watch to have a fulfilling experience, it is the kind of show that you sit down to watch with a snack and a nice bottle of pumpkin-spice bleach.\r\nTo its credit, I can nearly guarantee that this show will surprise you somehow.  At some point during your watching experience, you will almost certainly say \"there's no way they'd do something that obvious\", and at another time think \"surely they won'tjust randomly trivialize this conflict that they hyped up so much\" and then, of course, they do.  Then you will think \"at least it can't possibly get any worse.\", and then it does.  This show is shocking in its sheer boringness, and it will almost certainly keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see just how it'll manage to screw up this time.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, I will now provide the empirical mathematical formula for the creation of this show:\\n\\n\r\nSmartphone = Eromanga-Sensei + Isekai - FBI.  (Note that the lack of the FBI is solely a function of being in an alternate universe where the FBI does not exist, and that the main female love interest is still 12 years old.)",

The concept of it is kinda weird which basically normal for anime but if this your first time watching this kind of anime then this isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe Overall of this is a solid 7 you would enjoy this but not to the point you could say this is a great anime. This anime was made by studio reed and we know Studio reed isn't going well in the anime industry.

But, i do watch the entire episode from this anime. I have to say i rather like it.\r\nHaving said that it really isn't for everyone. It's super cliche and the main character is way op, plus all of the girls are basically just stereo-typical anime girls without much substance. Also, there really doesn't seem to be a real story line or goal for the main character. In my opinion, if you have aop main character he has to have some grand goal he's working towards but there just doesn't seem to be one. Also the completely oblivious to all the girls feelings is....overplayed to say to least. \\n\r\nAgain, i actually like this anime, it's one of maybe 2 series that i can sit through an entire episode this season, but it's not new or particularly well written.",

It\u2019s just vastly generic and mainstream with something like SAO and like a poor downgraded copy of KonoSuba... and we all know KonoSuba was just for fan service to get more people to read the manga. That speaks a lot of this anime. But I got to admit there are a few character designs that intrigue me like the girl with a sharp tooth like a vampire sorta...the mystic eyes girl and the girl that always ends her sentence with \u2018gozaru\u2019 which of course is trying to mimic Rurouni Kenshin\u2019s speech style. Kms the girl in Isekai Smartphone that talks like Kenshin is also a fking Samurai\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting to also quite cute, everyone in his harem and the 12 yr old princess that is about to marry him too.\\n\\n\r\nYou should probably watch if you\u2019re craving for some harem anime that you\u2019ll not get emotionally attached and with every harem anime there is of course the fan service.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nSlime scene\\n\r\nHot girls and loli\\n\r\nA pet tiger that is used as a stress ball\\n\r\nOP MC",

Our main character dies because God screwed up so in return because god can't send him back to his world, he sends him to a world filled with magic and hot girls. He even makes him the Avatar of that world as he can use all the elements. But before he goes God says he can bring one thing with him to this new world and Touya (main character) chooses his smartphone. Now, this might make you skepticalbut in reality, it was genius. He has access to our internet in this world, so he has all our knowledge. He can make and sell stuff for a fortune but... he doesn't do that and really only uses the phone when it is convenient like it just a normal tool and doesn't capitalize on it much. its a really good story arc and there are many things like Konosuba I won't mention here but its like they are trying to make references whenever they can.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great. character designs I guess are a little bland but nothing to fault it for. I can't think of much other than that to point out but there is a lot of show left and budgets can run thin.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. nothing too memorable but it is certainly not bad. I'm sure a lot of people can really get into the music and voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are alright. They suit the story well but don't add much to it. it kinda just going with the flow and they don't walk out their tropes much. character designs are good but nothing too special. no one is going to end up being your favorite character but I think you will like them well enough.\\n\\n\r\noverall, I'm loving it so far but that just might be the Konosuba reference blinding me to more flaws. definitely, give it a watch 7/10 but it might drop considerably as we go, this genre can be a little risky with so much in it.",

Now this isnt a problem, since i myself really like this genre, but the execution is terrible to begin with. To be honest i watch this anime, but only because im used to the genre being good and enjoyable, and because there arent pretty much anime this season.\r\nLets get to the points that bother me the most;\r\n-Main character:\r\nSo, the fact that he gets a smartphone to an other world is okay, now he gets maximum magical power, this gave me satisfaction for some reason, i likeOP characters, and from this point there are really exciting possibilities for character development. BUT the biggest flaw of the anime comes now - The main character's personality is exactly NOTHING. He is like a talking bag of potatoes, he has nothing original, nothing to remember of. He is like ,,-Oh okay.\", does the same as an average person would do, but that average person still would have more personality anyways.\\n\\n\r\n-Transportation\\n\r\nWhen Touya dies, and talks to the god he is too calm to be real. I know its anime but its almost as he wanted to die, he is that ,,Oh okay\" guy again. I know this is because the no-personality too but at least they would have made him be mad or freaked out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall what i hate: The fact that this world would have so many possibilities but they dont use it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI havent use any of that salty critisism while writing this review, this comes straight from my heart (xD)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, i'll be keep on watching because im bored and i want to see if that lack of personality there will get fixed in some way, maybe the meaning of the mc wearing a white jacket has something to do with being empty and eventually he will show development or whatever.\\n\\n",

I would rant more but it's not worth the time. Giving it a 1.\r\nArt and Sound:\r\nCan'tcomplain. The anime in general was animated well. It's the story that's shit. However, it's not exactly the best. The lines are much rougher and is just a typically average animation. I'm giving it a 5 for average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll the girls swoon for the mc for no fucking reason. One second into meeting him and they're already asking for his dick. The main character has overpowered abilities which is typical, but he is essentially a slave who does whatever someone asks. He has no will of his own except solving other people's problems. Literally, the anime would be better if we just delete the mc and replace it with a talking phone or something. All in all, I give the character a 1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you like a predictable storyline, a dumb as fuck slave main character, no progression in any fashion anime, then this is enjoyable. I literally only enjoy watching it because it is an anime and nothing else. So I give it a 2 because it is animated and the girls are cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is absolutely dreadful. I really don't see anything good. But because the studio that made it was decent and all the negatives are basically because of the story and the original source, I can't give it a 1. So I'll give it a 2.",

            "content": "In a world that got ruled by smartphones and stupid people, we got blessed with an anime called 'Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.' or in English 'In Another World with my Smartphone' (Summer 2017). This anime is a good example we have reached our peak of human civilistation and we're now heading towards our downfall. Pack your bags folks, it's over. \r\nI only started watching this anime as a joke because of all the negatieve reviews and I already had low expectations judging by the synopsis and the title alone. I better should taken those revieuws seriously and saved about 4 hours of mylife watching this pile of trash. Yes, I've seen a couple good 'isakai anime' before this (Konosuba & How Not To Summon A Demon Lord; don't @ me if you don't agree.) and I hate to say it I've seen now this pile of polished dog shit. You better recharge your smartphone before you're reading this, because this revieuw won't contain any bullshit 'Recovery' magic to save your ass and heal you for being injured from my negativity.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\nOur 15 year old main charather accidentally died by a lighting strike. But it's OK, because \"God\" said sorry. That's for now the most half-assed 'Isakai anime' introduction I've ever seen. But it's alright people, because the first thing that our MC thought about was \"Hey, can I use my smartphone?\" when he was told to he can get a second chance. No shock about realizing you're dead, no crying you never going to see your family or friends again. Nope, just like all those other smartphone zombies you see in real-life that are glued on thier smartphone the first thing they think about is there precious stupid smartphone. But it's OK, because he will get revived another world with his smartphone. ROLL THE CREDITS! Yeah, that's our story pretty much summed up. It's just a bummer they actully made up that his smartphone will recharge magically, becauyse they knew a battery lifespan of a smartphone battery endurence in 2017 is only for on average 5 days if you don't use the damn thing. Atleast the writers probably knew beforehand this anime would get trashed by a lot of people anyway, so I give them props for that for trolling us. Yes, Studio Production Reed, I'm mad bro. The overall story really didn't made an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10 (Very Bad)\\n\r\nThere were times I really questioned myself that I really saw that animation error or not or was I just tripping balls out of my mind like I normally do? Yeah, I probably did. Some charathers are even so badly designed that you get PTSD from our own cringy Western cartoons and this is not even over-exaggerated. Did I mention they even like to re-use animations every now and then? No? Well, they do and I'm glad I've noticed that. I can say, it's OK for me to re-use animations if you animate a meccha show for transformation purposes etc. just like they did in the much older 'Beast Wars II' (1998), but for a show like this it really cost them positive points from me if you tell me. The animators probably didn't cared about this anime iether and rather wanted this to be a short series instead or wanted to work on something different and I can't blame them. What the animators did care however was the inevitable fan service episode (episode 10). It really felt the quality of the animation increased. Who would have guessed it? The two last episodes however the quality just went down again in degencery. You can see the inevitable beach episode as a reward with the fact you're almost done with this anime. But it doesn't mean if the beach episode was done a bit better, the whole show becomes good...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10 (Average)\\n\r\nSo uh, the sound? It's passable I guess? Atleast I can say nothing really negatieve about the sound. It's just that I don't really like the opening song and I would have liked to hear a much better suited opening song, but that's just me. The background music that gets used is nice and gives you a positieve atmosphere and I can really appriciate it, because that's pretty much the best part of this whole anime. Sadly, with the sweet background music alone this won't save this anime for being a turd. Afterall, a polished turd is still a turd.\\n\\n\r\nCharather: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\nYeah, you really think I was going to be positieve about this anime it's charathers, think again sunshine. Without the blessing of \"God\" and the writers, our main charather would probably have been deceased already in the very first 8 minutes of the first episode because of his cringy attitude. He's THAT useless of a main charather, yet he got assigned to be overpowered by the blessing of the writers because MC sakes. He's that of a cringy 15 year old protagonist with a smartphone. When I used to be 15 year old myself, I still played with the LEGO's and I wasn't even allowed to have a cellphone because my parants atleast tried to raise me well even when mobile cellphones already were already a big thing back then. Standards and morals really does have changed. The only charather I really liked was the cute tiger-kitty, but that's because I like seeing cute things because I'm a moe blob piece of shit. As for the female charathers I really can't understand they all want a piece of our 15 year old smartphone addict that's been blessed by \"God\" and the writers. But then again; I have to blame the writers for this one forcing us a harem romance story after all down our troats, so yeah, go figure. Probably the writers hated themselves for not being praised on social media or something. In overall the charathers are pretty forgetable if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10 (Horrible)\\n\r\nYou really think I enjoyed this anime? I had to take a break every 5 minutes by watching the very first epsiodes. It's that boring and bad really. I tried many methods in order in maybe to find any hidden enjoyment while going trough this anime series, but I failed to enjoy this anime in pretty much in any aspect. But I managed to get trough it and that's something and I guess that's an accomplishment on it's own. Can I have a pat on my back? Pretty please? No? Awwwww... A headpat is fine too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10 (Very Bad)\\n\r\nIn overall, this is a very bad anime and the negatives outweighs the positieves for sure. Unless you can stomach the forced harem romance bullshit that's been done way too much already, the boring 15 year old MC with his cringy attitude, the lack of a good plot, sometimes a very questionable art-style by modern standards, ... I really don't recommend it. Unless you're a bit of a masochist, then sure, have fun dude or gal that's reading this. I'm not judging you. Been there & done that myself. I've sat trough this anime myself mainly for masochist purposes. This anime really failed so badly that this anime becomes a huge pile of polished dog-shit sprinkled by other trash and it got shoved down our troats and they really expect you to swallow it like how you would eat a cinnamon roll. To think this anime is already one year old when I'm writing this and still manages to have an average mean by 6,77 on MAL when I wrote ths is beyond me wich I still see as high. Maybe it's just me for having a bad taste in anime or it is just that a lot of users of this site really have lost touch with reality and are no point in saving when shit really hits the fan. In my view, this show is the worst anime show of 2017 so far I have seen. I can even proudly say and admit I even enjoyed the anime shorts 'Aho Girl' (2017) & 'Yo! Daitouryou Trap-kun' (2017) a bit more compaired with this pile of trash. If you really want to see an 'isakai anime' and enjoy yourself, go watch 'Konosuba' (2016) for entertainment or 'How Not to Summon A Demon Lord' (2018) for your ecchi-fix instead. You'll get much more worth of entertainment with those for your time investment.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \"Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.\" gets from me an overall score of 3/10 and yes, it's a very bad anime. Don't watch it, unless for for masochist purposes. I'm not judging you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther mentioned anime in order of this review:\\n\r\n* Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!

            "content": "Thoughts on \"In Another World With My Smartphone\" (some spoilers so be warned):\r\nJust when isekai felt like it couldn't get any worse or more repetitive, the least original or interesting anime I have ever seen came along to prove to me that yes, it IS possible to be worse than Death March. \r\nOnce again the series follows a bland, personality-free guy from our world who is thrown into a video-game-like fantasy world with some quirk that makes him ridiculously overpowered to the point that there is never any real threat to him, and once again he assembles a large harem of women who all fallin love with him despite his complete lack of personality, goals, ideals, etc. What makes this show \"different\" is that in this show he has his smartphone with him, since he is allowed to keep it in the new world by God at the start of the series (yes, a bizarre adaptation of the Judeo-Christian God is a recurring character in this show)\u2026 Oh wait, having a smartphone in a parallel world and claiming that it\u2019s a magical item is NOT an original concept for an isekai, since it was already done in Oda Nobuna No Yabou. Unlike Oda Nobuna however, which has stunning animation and a superb soundtrack, this series has bland visuals with mediocre to subpar animation (inexplicably by the former 1990\u2019s action mega-studio Production Reed nonetheless) and no memorable pieces of music whatsoever. So, the premise is unoriginal, and the visual presentation is bland\u2026 and it only gets worse from there. Since the protagonist is the only person in his world (until the final episode) who is able to use every kind of magic in existence, there is never any tension and he never has to put any kind of effort into solving any of the problems in the show, making all of them feel boring and uninteresting. To make up for this, the show has one admittedly cool zombie arc in the middle that amps up the tension, but it just feels out of place in terms of tone, and after that arc amps up the stakes, the stakes quickly disappear afterwards when the story changes to a fanservicey beach-arc.\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s setting looks exactly like every single other isekai show lately in terms of building design and the existence of magical guilds (which are themselves not properly explained in this show), and there\u2019s just no creativity in any of the character designs or background designs. Everything just looks like ~17th Cenury housing with medieval technology levels and bland costume designs.\\n\r\nAnyway, out of nowhere part way through the series, a robot waifu living on a flying garden is introduced seemingly just for the sake of adding awkward innuendos to the story, but the worst thing about it is that she looks exactly the same as Milinda from Heavy Object, right down to her hairstyle, colour-scheme and facial structure. The guys were so lazy that they couldn\u2019t even be bothered to come up with a different girl design, and just copied someone else\u2019s with minimal change at all. And speaking of copying other series, you know how in Type Moon, some characters have powers referred to as \u201cMystic Eyes\u201d (e.g. Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, Mystic Eyes of Petrification, etc.) Well that was ripped off in this show, as one of the girls has the power of Mystic Eyes of Personality Perception (they even ripped off the word perception), a power which causes her to instantly fall in love with the protagonist.\\n\r\nThe story itself is extremely slow-paced, with virtually nothing happening throughout most of the episodes, and when stuff with world-altering implications does get set up instead of focusing the story on those elements, all we get are distractions that focus on bringing the lead and the girls closer together, which is problematic for several reasons: All of the girls have exactly the same personality (even the girl who is set up as more shy than her sister at the start ends up acting exactly the same as her when the show ends). Some of the girls are underage, including the one who becomes his fianc\u00e9e first, who is freaking 12 years old! But don\u2019t worry about that, since we learn in the final episode that social norms from our world don\u2019t apply in the fantasy world and that as soon as he turns 18 he can marry as many waifus as he wants since apparently polygamy is normal in that world too, and the woman who can see the future says that he will have 9 wives while the camera pans out to show all 9 of the show\u2019s main female characters, some of whom are still children, which is gross! Oh, and you know how in SAO and Grimgar all of the characters go through emotional turmoil as a result of their transplantation and worry about the people they\u2019ve left behind? Not in this show, the protagonist never once seems to care about his family or anyone at all special in the old world. Heck, we learn literally nothing bout who he was before going in the fantasy setting, and he has no personality built onto him by the end! Everything about this show is terrible even by the standard of bad isekais.\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the problem with the show\u2019s theology. It\u2019s made abundantly clear that God (singular) exists in the show, and is even a character\u2026 but then in the final episode, they introduce us to another character referred to as the \u201cGoddess of love\u201d, despite the previously stated monotheistic nature of the show\u2019s universe. How can he be God (singular) if there are other gods? Why is her origin not explained at all? AAAAARGH!\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unoriginal, slow-paced, boring, forgettable, and apparently it\u2019s getting a second season (at least according to a lot of the comments on the funimation page for the last episode).\\n\r\nWhy is trash like this worthy of a second season, while great series like Trinity Blood and Deadman Wonderland get nothing? 0/10, not recommended unless you are a masochist.\\n",

            "content": "I'll start out by saying that this anime isn't for people who dislike the Isekai trend in anime. I would say that it could be considered 'Isekai trash' from those who don't enjoy Isekai anime. But from someone who has found much enjoyment in them, I would have to say that it is one of the better ones. I love the characters that for the most part carry the show but I also get a bunch of enjoyment out of the show.\r\nStory: 7, Good\r\n The story isn't really anything special up until the end where it seems to take some kind of 180 but justbecause the story isn't that special it's relatively charming. I went into this show saying to myself \"only in Japan would they make a show about a guy going to another world with a smartphone\" and expecting it to be really campy but I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't. The show took its story somewhat seriously but not too much and I found myself laughing at the outlandishness of every time the main character found some new overpowered way to function and use his magic. It was a little crazy but it was extremely fun and exciting to watch. The story never relied too much on suspense but I don't think a good story has to. The pacing is pretty good overall and it was just fun to watch it progress.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7, Good\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here. The art isn't bad and I'd say it is at least above average. Each character feels distinct in their art styles and as though I'd recognize them out of context and I don't think it looks too samey to other anime from the studio.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7, Good\\n\r\nIt is the relative same here, between the sound effects and the voice acting I never really found myself taken out of the world by it. Each voice actor does a good job at portraying their character and the sound effects in the show, while they may not stand out among other shows, are still good nonetheless and do their job which isn't something that can be said about a great number of other anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9, Great\\n\r\nI love the characters in this show. Every time I go into an Isekai show I expect some cut-out character for the MC and so far I haven't actually found that. The MC Touya having a personality of calmness, not because he is overpowered, but because that was the way he was raised, especially in the beginning scenes, stands out making you think he would have to be some kind of nice guy who is always calm. But adding the fact he is a \"closet pervert\" with a harem constantly surrounding him just gives him another layer that is often used for comedy but it makes him less 2-D. On top of Touya, each of the girls has their own personality (myself especially liking Sushie) that makes them shine without much overlap. Especially when considering characters like Sushie, Yumina, Leen, and Yae who have their own backstories it makes them feel real and makes you want to root for them and their own personal goals. Supporting characters like Kohaku and the King and his brother always are extremely fun to watch on screen. Characters like Alfred are extremely lovable beyond that of other supporting characters just because they exude personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10, Outstanding\\n\r\nThis is the one category that I believe to be completely subjective. And I loved every moment of the show that I watched it. Character interactions, how just OP Touya is, the formation of his Harem, the cliffhanger at the end, everything was right down my alley. Maybe that's why I score this so high compared to others, it just comes down to the enjoyment of not only Isekai, but the more looked-down upon genres in anime like the harem genre. Everything just fits together perfectly for me and to somewhat go off of Nux Taku, Isekai is the perfect genre because it can literally be anything, and still be relatable because it is so easy to contextualize. On top of that, I love seeing cool characters do cool things using their powers, I enjoyed SAO and many other shows with an overpowered main character that does cool things for reasons like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall while I can see why people that dislike the idea of somewhat trashy Isekai/Harem anime, I think if you like either you will like this show.",

There is no tension, storyis almost nonexistent and I felt like the sole purpose of this anime is for viewers to enjoy and relax. \\n\r\nArt is nice, sound is nice and voice actors are good too.\\n\\n\r\nSince I do not usually write reviews, I do not have much to say, but I wrote it just to let you know that you should not pay much attention to hate reviews and bad scores you see.

Everything seemed rushed and like it was done by some bunch of kids. Also it was packed with degeneracy and satanism.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's bad score, this anime is nice, enjoyable and great if you want to relax.",

Well, let me tell you...\r\nEven with the horribly bland, cliched power trip fantasy world setting, equally bland main character and equally horrible supporting cast, Trapped in Another World with my Smartphone still manages to be funny, like to the point that I think it might have been originally pitched as a parody show on the Isekai genre similar to Konosuba. \r\nI'm writing this review months after originally watching the show and somehow I'm remembering it with a levelof fondness I didn't think was possible for something so bad on the surface. It has all the marks of a bad, trend chasing anime: Overpowered main character, who despite having no charm, ends up with a harem of adoring fan girls, check. Isekai, check. Lazy/low budget art, check. blah blah blah, rant rant rant, you know a bad anime when you see one.\\n\r\nNow, what makes the show great? It takes the general Isekai tropes and very unironically takes them to levels of trash I didn't think existed. In fact, it looks like it's done so intentionally and with such seriousness, I'm afraid it's actually above me. The show is just one knowing look into the camera away from becoming a satire that could be amazing and I'd be pretty sad if this was the original intent and it just was never portrayed in the anime.\\n\r\nGo into this anime with the knowledge that it's bad, but tell yourself it's bad on purpose and you'll have a great time. Once you're done, go watch a good satire of the Isekai genre: Konosuba, and realize how close this was to greatness.\\n\r\nA+ for imagined effort\\n\r\nF for execution\\n\r\nIn the wise words of Gigguk, anime is trash and so am I",

I rated this a 6, because I rate my anime on a scale of 1-10, not a scale of 6-10 like most of MAL. This anime is clearly not for those who watch anime to think critically, and is geared towards a viewer who's just looking to just enjoy watching an anime. This anime, while trash in it's character development and story, has a quite decent sound, and is very enjoyable, as while the main character is overpowered and the outcomes inherently predictable, it stillfinds a way to stay entertaining and enjoyable. Overall, since anime is a medium of entertainment, and this anime filled it's purpose of entertaining in my opinion, and made me feel a sort of sentimentality from a generic theme, with a bunch of the little things spiced up, I give it a 6.",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nSo this is my first ever review, so I'm sorry if it's kinda bland or short as of right now I don't know where to begin. So I chose something this recent anime season drudged out. Honestly, we have such a subpar anime that the term generic is too generous of a term for it. This piece of garbage that was splattered on my screen actually surprised me. I had heard good things about it from my friend who actually enjoys harems. Don't get me wrong, I love a good harem anime from time to time (who doesn't really). It surprisedme in a way that was, in plain terms stupid. It was so bad I could barely comprehend. The main focus of a harem anime should be the girls, and even then they could BARELY do a decent job at getting the girls to be likable. Enough pre ranting, onto the review!\\n\\n\r\nStory (2)\\n\r\nHonestly, the story is bland and subpar, that calling it dreadful is an understatement. But let's start with the basics. A regular average joe is killed by God, God gives him another chance in a different world that looks like it was pulled right out of a crappy jrpg. The protagonist then learns he has a proficiency in all elements, goes onto becoming an overpowered hero. He then gets a group of girls for some contrived reason or another decides to follow him to the ends of the earth and each fall in love with him because he's essentially an all-powerful being in that world. That's pretty much it. There's actually an 'interesting' subplot, (interesting being used very loosely here as it's because it's better than the rest of the garbage that is called this anime), involving conspiracies and a giant airship but it goes unnoticed. It was instead just hinted at then shoved aside like it didn't matter, all so we can get to see the bland cardboard cutouts that they call its characters do stupid, meaningless garbage.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2)\\n\r\nTalking about bland cardboard cutouts leads me to my second point, the characters. Now the characters in a standard harem should be its bread and butter, that is to say, it should be what the anime would want to be its main selling point. But instead, in Isekai wa Smartphone, we get these cutout characters who can barely convey any emotion besides lust towards the protagonist and shyness. This reminds me of a very poor visual novel. Let's start with the main twins. Of course in typical anime fashion, you have to have an outgoing twin and a shy twin because of course, you do. Next up we have the oriental Japanese samurai girl who's only characteristic is that she has a strong sense of morals. Then we have the princess who falls in love with the protagonist for what I see is like a contractual obligation she must fulfill if she wants her time in the spotlight. Honestly, those 4 are the only main ones you should have the need to focus on because they'll be the 4 you see the most of. I actually kinda enjoyed the fairy character, if she wasn't such an obvious S&M character. She at least had a more interesting power than the rest of them with the power to program objects like one would when programming a computer.\\n\\n\r\nArt (4)\\n\r\nThe art is decent, if you play with the word decent to make it mean just average. I really can't state any faults or things the art style does well. I mean I guess it fits the anime? (By being a literal dumpster fire). It's not the worst I've ever seen, but it's far from the best.\\n\\n\r\nSound (3)\\n\r\nHonestly, the sound engineering was bad, worse than average. The voice actors and actresses sound like they're disinterested like they couldn't care less to be there. They could've breathed life into the anime if they tried a few bit more, but I couldn't get into the characters thanks to their pitiful job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime in the same sense it's enjoyable to watch someone bang their head against the wall until the wall either gives or their skull is caved in. Sure, it's interesting to look at and you might even get a few chuckles out of it from time to time, and is a great time waster if you have 6 hours you want to regret losing. But I don't think I'd ever watch it again. Nothing really stood out about the anime that I really cared about. The only reason it has a 4 is because when I was younger I would've loved this anime just because it was a harem. But it was a harem with no substance, something I find to be quite disheartening. I hope Japan hasn't forgotten how to make good harem anime's, like Date a Live.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3) \\n\r\nHonestly, I reached 3 because I threw my numbers into my desktop calculator and out popped 3.something or another. Overall I would've personally given it a 1 or a 2, but at the time of writing it's been a few weeks since I've seen it and I can't remember anything enjoyable about it. I remember there was one part about it that elicited a chuckle from me, so that's something I guess. But I would never watch it again just to get to that one chuckle point. Just save yourself the trouble and go watch Konosuba or something else instead.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my first ever anime review! I might do more when I have time. In the meantime, DON'T watch this anime, unless you're absolutely bored or retarded.",

If you like anime where the main character is ridiculously overpowered, in such a way it's comparable to Sword Art Online or Is It Okay To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?!, then this will likely be something you can enjoy. However, the harem game is also very strong, almost cringingly so, but I personally found that to be one of the more charming things about it. It even has somewhat decent fight scenes, and it was hinted to get a second season, which is great!! The main character is the typical oblivious type, which isn't too bad when it's done right,which it is in this anime. It's a feel-good type of series that can have you smiling or laughing all the way through.",

Sure it somehow lack more depth in the story and action because the Hero is so GODLIKE POWERFUL, still I really liked it.\r\nFirst is the Story, I rated it 8. The story is kind of cliche wherein the Hero is transported into another dimension and meet some new friends (girlfriends) along the way as he embark on a journey of an adventurer. What I like in this anime despite of the cliche story is the concept of magic and how the Heroapplies his magic and strength together with his smartphone.\\n\\n\r\nSecond is the Art, I rated it 9. Well I love the detail of the art of this anime and of course there are fan service scenes =))\\n\\n\r\nThird is the Sound, I rated it 7. Honestly I thought I might not like the anime because of the opening song and video because I thought this is one of those anime that doesn't make you enjoy instead scratch my head off. \\n\\n\r\nFourth is the character, I rated it 9. Although I love every character in the anime because each one of them fits their character but somehow some of the Heroine lack some character background. I like the character of the Hero because he is OP, kind, smart and most of all a closet pervert hehe....\\n\\n\r\nLastly Enjoyment, I rated it 9. I really really enjoyed it because this anime has a light feeling when you watch it. Although this might be the reason why others hate because this anime doesn't have a main problem since the Hero is so powerful that he can defeat any enemies. \\n\\n\r\nWARNING SPOILER ALERT\\n\r\nAnother reason why I love this anime because Harem ending seems to fit this anime unlike other anime wherein Harem ending is kind of forced even though you know the Hero like the one better. So please give this anime a chance so that there could be another season =))",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter the spring season this year, I had high hopes that Eromanga-Sensei would remain my worst anime of 2017, then I decided to watch \"In another world with my smartphone\" and oh boy was it pure trash.\r\nStory (3/10)\r\nNow if you've watched as many harems as I have, then you'll know the story won't be impressive, true there are some that are pretty good (Like HS DxD or Haganai), but this was just cliched as hell.\r\nThe story follows our MC Touya Mochizuki, who died and by the powers of God he ended up in a fantasy world along with his smartphone, there he meetsa lot of female characters, does some adventures with them and everything else a harem anime does, you pretty much get the gist at this point.\\n\r\nThe story is ball's, it never goes anywhere other than Touya growing his harem over time, the show thought combining Re:Zero, SAO and Konosuba would make it fantastic when really it's just a jumbled mess.\\n\r\nWhenever something slightly interesting happened it was just blown away by more cliches, most of the time I was just bored especially with how the situations were handled, it surprised me how ridiculously easy it was for our characters to get past them, which the show lost all of it's thrill and intensity from me.\\n\r\nI will admit though, when it got to the final two episodes I was completely blown away how the show did a complete 180 on me, like the first 10 episodes were just boring as hell, then these final two episodes brought out an enjoyment that the show was missing the whole time, hell they even got rid of many cliches that hold back a lot of harems, this surprised and angered me at the same time because if they had started the show like this, then it might not have been so bad and could've been tolerable.\\n\r\nHowever the ending just completely annoys me even more, because this show thinks it deserves a season 2 and I pray to the anime Gods that this will never happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters were either bland or really forgettable, but there were a few hidden gems, sadly though they were introduced later on in the series.\\n\r\nTouya is the MC, it's funny how I thought Ichika from Infinite Stratos was dense as fu*k, but this guy really takes the cake, because he was absolutely awful I couldn't get behind him as a character, plus they tried giving him Saitama op levels, but it made me hate him even more, because of how lucky and stupid the outcomes were.\\n\r\nLinze and Elze Silhoueska are the first girls he meets, probably the blandest of the female characters, these two are you're usual cliched twins, one's a Tsundere while the other is a Dandere, although I'll give some credit for their personalities sometimes being swapped around showing a different side to their characters.\\n\r\nYae Kokonoe is a girl from the Japanese like place called Iishen, a typical samurai girl, she was average although I liked how despite being a fearsome fighter she was clumsy and a bit of a gluten, however she felt alright for like one episode before the other characters showed up.\\n\r\nYumina Urnea Belfast is the forced marriage cliche girl of the show, despite being named after the capital of Northern Ireland, she was actually an ok character I enjoyed her company in the show, then you realise she's 12 years old making you having to avoid a SWAT coming in and breaking down you're door.\\n\r\nSushie Urnea Ortlinde is Yumina's cousin, despite being a main character, she really wasn't in the show all that much and it's a good thing too, because she was absolutely annoying as hell, I don't think I could've handled this show if her role was bigger.\\n\r\nLeen is a 600 or so year old fairy, despite being the final main girl to be introduced the amount of screentime she had was great, definitely one of the better characters, Leen was a bit of a surprise as she likes to be assertive, but playful too which leads to some pretty funny situations.\\n\r\nI also have to mention Francesca, who was introduced during the final episodes, stole the whole show for me, mainly because she kept saying dirty jokes to the MC even though she's some kind of cyborg who was built 5000 years ago, but her presence in the show was well received by me.\\n\\n\r\nArt (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was pretty damn poor, mainly because the locations looked boring and empty, I would also say the characters look kinda detailed, but the fact that Linze and Elze looked almost like Kyou and Ryou from Clannad along with Francesca looking like Mira from Dimension W was definitely fishy and didn't seem as creative when I thought about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe op and ed were not very enjoyable, they just felt generic and never really gained my attention, same can be said for the soundtrack too, although it's very rare with harem anime's having good soundtracks, ops and eds anyway, so I wasn't holding my breath on this one.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe whole fantasy setting was also quite lackluster, despite some interesting features with the magic, it wasn't really that amazing considering how easy it was to cast spells and other stuff, plus there wasn't that much when it came to having diverse races as there was only humans and cat people along with Leen being the only fairy in the show, but that's it.\\n\r\nThe comedy was bland as hell, it never made me laugh or even chuckle, that's how tedious this was, until the final two episodes which suddenly started making me laugh outta nowhere which surprised me entirely.\\n\r\nThe harem and romance aspects of this show are probably the most surprising parts of the show, despite being full of cliches it gets rid of the most common cliche in any harem anime and that's infighting, usually the female characters always argue with each other yet here that doesn't happen, instead the girls make a pact with each other so that they would all agree to marry Touya and despite his denseness, Touya actually manages to get further into his relationship with the girls than most harem MC's, because he actually kisses all of them and even agrees to marry all of them which is something that completely surprised me, so despite being a boring show, there are a few surprises.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show has been the worst anime so far this year and considering it's November now, I doubt I'll find an anime worse than this by the years end, but you never know.",

The concept is good like main character \"Touya\" is dashing having mighty power of controlling of all the elemental magic as well as null magic and how much kindness he shows to others. Helping others and meeting his  future wife's.\r\nBut in the story there is not much combats and action is missing which i see as an issue but except this flaw it is great story.  \r\nArt or picture quality is also good. It has smoothlooking characters.\\n\r\nBut there we can see similarities in the faces of the characters with others. It should be avoided.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good and refining.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are also good.\\n\r\nBut the main character \" Touya\" seems to have less participation in physical combats so i would like to see him in physical combats as well.\\n\\n\r\nI certainly enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its nice. I hope it has a 2nd season as in the last episode it seems that they have to control other sky fortress and 2 other main character are missing which are 2 other future wifes of the main character \"Touya\" so i would like to see them in 2nd season of in special of this anime.",

Well those days are over!\r\nCharacter development? Forget about it!\r\nSo if you are a BIG Romance/Harem anime person like me, then you will surely love this anime like I am. Yes, its got its cliches, yes its got its predictable moments, BUT I don't let that get the better of me at all. In fact, if you are a heavy harem/romance anime nerd like I am, you'd enjoy the cliches and predictable moments likeI do!\\n\r\nsoundtrack that gets you in to the mood. \\n\r\nIt's still worth watching if you actually watch anime for fun and not as some kind of critic or sport.\\n\\n\r\nI find that there is no point in looking in to it's flaws because there are too many plot holes and nothing very amazing about it to distinguish it from the others, other than the fact that this show is extremely enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAnime as a media is meant to be enjoyed. It's not like art, or music where it has to be incredibly complex, it just need to make your day or lighten up your mood from other stress in your life and that's just what this show does.\\n\\n\r\nIt's relaxed, stupid, and has that overpowered mc that is kinda cool.\\n\r\nSo just like any anime this is rated based off of my enjoyment and i give it a clean 10.\\n\r\nI can't and won't say you will enjoy it as much as me because everyone has different tastes but this show is worth trying out.\\n\r\nThank you for reading, hope you liked the review. :)",

Its like a candy bar, you buy it, eat it, savor the sweet flavor and when finished throw the wrapper away and go on about the day.\r\nThe rest of the cast were no slouches eitherlearning from one another and acting as a team when the need arose.  The artwork was less desirable and the sound track was not all that memorable.  But if your wanting something that is brain candy give this one a whirl.\\n",

Not a deep anime, in fact it's kind of shallow. Not necessarily a good first anime, but one does get tired of the same old same old eventually.\r\nThis anime parodies a parody (konosuba) which is kind of impressive in its own right. They make that pretty obvious from the start, concluding with \"explosion!\" although the anime develops its ownplot in a unique way. The art leaves a lot to be desired and it's obvious this anime was done on a budget, but apart from the cheap spell effects to the point of being corny there isn't really much I can say negative about it.",

            "content": "Have you ever tasted a dish so bland that you know if the chef only added more spices, herbs or any other aromatics it would make it hella better?\r\nThis is the precise problem of the show. It is bland. It is tasteless. It is insipid. There is nothing remotely interesting to keep you going. Just the occasional small dishes of fanservices and interesting plot development.\r\nBut when you really want to savor the development, wondering what it would become and maybe, just maybe it becomes something amazing. It just gets shot down by the overall tasteless entree known as Isekai wa Smartphone.\r\n\u203b Strength \u203b\r\n- Concept. NowI have to say the concept itself is very interesting and attracts a lot of attention. This anime reminds me of KonaSuba for the first few episodes but fails to even touch the minimum level of that god tier anime. You have all these amazing ideas and it sucks to see it all going down to the drain because of poor executions.\\n\r\n- Hype. I certainly felt this during various moments in the anime. It isn't completely boring as the transition of plot keeps it somewhat interesting that you might be hoping the show may take another turn, perhaps for the better. So many hype moments but so many let downs.\\n\r\n- Harem. If you are a fan of multiple girls flock over one guy for whatever ridiculous reason, this show definitely shows that multiple time.\\n\\n\r\n\u203b Weakness \u203b\\n\r\n- Boring. When a show repeats itself in terms of plot development, you have a sense of what's going to happen next. It really was boring to a certain degree that I can't help but gradually close my eyes.\\n\r\n- Lack of personality. It went downhills around mid-way, the girls only serve as basically objectified sex appeals to the MC. The only thing those girls have for them is visual appeal, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\r\n- Predictable. We all know that somehow the MC will save everyone with his super god-given power that he somehow gets for his favoritism that isn't even explained. Every hype moment is predictable because we know no \"good guys\" will die.\\n\\n\r\nWould I rewatch? Hell no.\\n\r\nWould I recommend? If you want to waste time on an inferior harem genre.\\n\r\nAre you sad? Somewhat. If the plot was garbage to begin with, then it's understandable. But given that this had potential. It's quite traumatic for a viewer to realize that the show had literally committed suicide due to stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThis show could have gone the KonoSuba route. This show could have had a stronger, powerful MC with a real backbone. This show could have been darker and had the MC take over the world. This show could have been filled with action, drama, rom com, psychology and so much more.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, what is done is done. \\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing more than just a typical average harem anime that will be forgotten within 2 weeks.",

            "content": "At this point the prospect of another isekai anime is greeted with a mixture of bemusement or a loud collective groan by the anime community at large. Ever since the concept was popularized by the likes of Sword Art Online, nearly every season has seen at least one take on it. Derided by detractors as nothing more than wish fulfillment for otakus, the space for isekai played straight has shrunk to almost nothing. In this it parallels the trajectory of battle harems, another brief staple of the anime scene that has largely faded away. It\u2019s telling that two of the most popular isekai stories inrecent memory, Konosuba and Re:Zero, are a parody and deconstruction, respectively. \\n\\n\r\nSo when a series like Isekai Smartphone comes along and seemingly plays the isekai premise completely straight, I wasn\u2019t going to welcome it with open arms. Still, it did have one unique hook, that of the protagonist bringing his smartphone into the fantasy with him. Perhaps, I thought naively, that would at least be interesting enough to hold my attention. \\n\\n\r\nThe problems with Isekai Smartphone are myriad. The most glaring issue is its characters, or to be more specific, the lack of any compelling characters for the audience to get attached to. The worse offender of this is the protagonist, Touya. He greets every situation with a nonchalant cheerfulness, from his sudden death at the beginning of the series all the way to discovering an ancient floating sky garden. The only instances in which demonstrates any real emotion is the prospect of seeing his numerous harem members in underwear or any other skimpy clothing. Not helping his case is the appalling ease through which he overcomes challenges. Simply put, he starts off overpowered and ends the show even more overpowered. By the end of the show, he has crafted a working gun in a fantasy world, gained two high level spirits as familiars, has ownership of an ancient floating island and is effectively a de facto member of the royal family. This bleeds into many aspects of the show, reducing every fight scene to a boring wait for the protagonist to solve the problem with a single spell or previously inconceivable strategy. That being said, the sheer overpowered nature of the protagonist somehow manages to be entertaining rather than aggravating. The whole show is so light in tone that it\u2019s impossible to truly get mad at it. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, mainly comprised of Touya\u2019s harem mates, don\u2019t fair much better, rarely distinguishing themselves beyond their attraction to Touya and the diverse archetypes they represent. It says something about their lack of character that I can\u2019t remember half their names even after twelve episodes with some of them. Wish fulfillment harem fantasies don\u2019t work when the girls feel less like actual people and more like a creator went down a checklist of character templates to add. That by itself is not an inherently bad thing. Princess Principal, from the same season, also starred a group of standard character archetypes yet gave them real depth through backstory and developed relationships between them so that the audience could invest in them throughout the story. No such thing happens in Isekai Smartphone. \\n\\n\r\nCompounding the issues with character is the show\u2019s story, which largely focuses on short vignettes rather than an overall arc. The slice-of-life approach can work if the characters and situations are sufficiency amusing, but save for the slime castle mission, most of them serve as means to give Touya even more abilities or harem antics that get repetitive fast. This is also a series that opts to tease future in lieu of any sort of climatic confrontation at the end of the series. Instead, the final \u201cconflict\u201d is whether Touya will agree to marry all the girls he\u2019s accumulated throughout the series. Despite literally having God on his side and everyone in his harem being ok with polygamy, he refuses, citing his unwillingness to take such an \u201cadult\u201d responsibility. Given that at this point he\u2019s escorted a diplomatic delegation, saved a village from a rampaging dragon, foiled an attempted assassination of the King and ended a war, this comes off as laughable. \\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned the smartphone itself because very little would change without its inclusion. Sure, it gains increased prominence and usage near the end, but considering it\u2019s prominence in the title this was a seriously missed opportunity to distinguish this show from other run of the mill isekai shows. Later episodes do make better use of the smartphone, mainly in combination with Touya\u2019s magic to resolve every bit of large scale combat off-screen. \\n\\n\r\nIsekai Smartphone, in summary, is an example of a show that does the bare minimum required. It\u2019s worse sin is that it is merely boring without being infuriating. As such, it leaves very little impression in mind, even compared to its contemporaries. If you ever wanted to know why isekai anime are greeted with such trepidation these days, Isekai Smartphone neatly encapsulates every critique of the genre into a singular forgettable package. \\n",

There is no character development, no plot or anything that would make it entertaining!\r\nEntire \"plot\" is just rip off re: zero and konosuba by that \"oh you died heh. welcome to the different world HEH!!\" Except  those shows did it well! Here we just have  guy who is overpowered  and pretty much retarded (bringing guns to such world???  WHAT THE FUCK) I dont understand why would god ever make someone that strong, it just doesnt make any sense. Also why nobody reallyquestions him? He pulls out the most stupid excuses for his phone or stuff he knows and everyone there is like \"uhmm makes sense!\" and why no one havent thought about stealing his stupid magical phone???\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is SO lazy. I wish I was blind when the tiger has appeared. Just awful flat animation without any depth. Some anime try at least put details in some scenes or character shots but this?? No. Just. UGHHH.\\n\\n\r\nPersonality of these... can I even call it characters?? The main character is a mess. First they are trying to make him look like he is nice sweet pure guy, then they force him to be pervert in that slime scene. Also why does everyone want to marry this idiot? \" Oh my wife can see again because of you... HERE MARRY MY CHILD\" The female characters are so young  meanwhile they are getting hella sexualized. I dont normally care about it but it feels very filthy coming from this anime. Some of the girls were like meh. alright (Leen, Kokonoe) but some were just horrible bitches who were getting mad for nothing, especially the twins and badly animated tiger. But still main character= worst character.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end this anime was the worst I have ever seen. And I have seen quite few. I thought that Pupa is the worst anime ever but Pupa was at least trying to do some decent animation. Not like this piece of shit.Ugh.",

            "content": "For all the people out there complaining that this anime is \"one of the worst\" and 'it sucks\", and other hateful things, you KNEW that this was a animated light novel adaption ( I don't consider them true anime) either keeping or adapting the popular \"harem king\" trope for the television ( or the internet, whichever way it gets on there). To say that it's lame just because it has a seeminly \"god-like\" MC who is essentially unbeatable is just stupid. It could have been HXDXD's first season (which  in reality sucked royally because Issei was just acting like a perv to basically hidehis lack of self-confidence and the fact that he's actually a pretty smart guy, with no explanation as to why or even how  he's pretending to be something he's not) or 11eyes (Not too bad but should have worked with the VN more.).\\n\\n\r\nComparing it to other anime and LN adaptions of similar genres and episode length this is actually more realistic in terms of character development and power gaining. It is a sad fact that in many modern anime the MC is so weak he can't do crap at the start, and as the series progresses he somehow gets abilities strong enough to wreck this planet many times over via a plot hole or filler. In Isekai wa Smartphone Touya may be a rip-off of the Avatar as well as an enhanced body but he had to put the pedal to the metal for all his other abilities and powers, even though he was chosen by God.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are properly described and their interactions fluid enough, which is a + for a industry overfilled with boobs, powers and ( sometimes ) gore. I also appreciated the fact that Production Reed decided to tone down on the ecchi while putting the LN on the big screen and focus on the story,which is good enough to keep you hooked as you go from episode to episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issue with this LN adaption is, or was that now that it's finished is the fact that it should have been longer. The season finale just ends with the MC being polygamous and if you don't read the LN you won't have a clue as to what caused that to happen. That silver-haired, purple eyed dude from the opening should have received more than a cameo but like soo many other \"anime\" these days, this is just a proof of concept. \\n\\n\r\nApart from that it's worth a watch if you're sick and tired of all the boobs and poorly done stories racking anime these days.",

SHIT!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, I simple skipped and skim the rest until I got to episode 12, so................\\n\\n\r\nOverall, pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're gonna make an anime or a manga were you would play safe to the point that the main character itself is this too perfect, then maybe you should just keep it in your imagination. Let's face the original creator Patora Fuyuhara wasn't much of a story teller and was just too protective of his main character that all he can do is just keep adding more harem members into the mix. In fact studio Production Reed made a bad bet when they choose this thing to have an anime adaption, they should have just comb more for other manga to have an anime adaption. So when watching this just skim the rest after episode 7 until you get to the last episode.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nkono te de tsukame  kono te de tsunage  kono mirai o uketsuide ikunda \\n\r\nima o hikikae ni shite  Carry on Carry on  ii ka? \\n\r\niku zo  Fly HiGH! \\n\\n\r\nsono te de tsukame  sono te de tsunage  sono sekai wa semasugiru kara \\n\r\nsono ashi de yuke  sono mimi de kike  sono riaru wa tsukurimono deshou \\n\r\nkono te de tsukame  kono te de tsunage  kono mirai o uketsuide ikunda \\n\r\nima o hikikae ni shite  Carry on Carry on  ii ka? \\n\r\niku zo  Fly HiGH! \\n\\n\r\nsono te de tsukame...  iku zo  Fly HiGH!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Mild spoilers ahead, be wary.]\r\nFirst review. Let's see how this goes.\r\nSo, this show is basically if SAO and Konosuba had a baby, and the end result is a painfully mediocre harem anime. You know the plot, the main character Touya dies accidentally to God and offers him a second chance at life being born in another world and he chooses to keep his smartphone in that world. On top of that, he also receives a significant boost to all of his senses/abilities which basically makes him ridiculously OP. I have a number of problems with the show, but let's start with the object that's thegimmick of the whole show... The smartphone.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the entire show, the smartphone has had little to no practical use in the story. It's the one thing that makes this show different from any other Isekai anime, and the smartphone is completely null and void because Touya is a literal god. I won't spoil anything specific, but he can basically solve any problem the show throws at him with the lift of a finger; It's completely effortless and his plans work every time without fail because of his vast array of skills. That means every conflict in the show doesn't feel like there's any weight to it, even though the show tries to make you care and think that they might have a problem, because nothing can touch Touya and the problem is solved in a matter of minutes. It makes a lot of sequences feel empty and vapid with no substance to it. The smartphone being useless inherently presents us with these two problems: The one unique thing in the show being near pointless, and Touya having absurd Kirito-like power. It's not interesting and it's not compelling.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kirito-like power, I must emphasize this point about Touya as well. Once again, I won't spoil anything, but there are multiple times in the show where he's able to effortlessly do things that would normally be incredibly difficult for any other person to do... Time and time again. Yes, it makes sense in the context of the story since God boosted his powers but that does not excuse making him a flimsy and boring character.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem I have is that the pacing of the show feels rushed. The pacing is just rapid and leaves no room for you to immerse yourself in the scenery or even care about what's going on. It feels like the bare minimum is done for each scene and them immediately moves on to the next one. It's unfortunate, but it's like the show could care less about what's going on and is just going down the list of things that need to happen to move the story along. Little substance makes it very boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the show is actually something that I kinda liked. The whole feel of Smartphone feels very warm and friendly. For the characters, it's a casual little adventure while traveling across the land discovering new things. While that's all well and good, the aforementioned problem of the non-existent conflict along with mediocre writing don't make the show necessarily funny or enjoyable. I see the potential here, but it doesn't really hit it's mark.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. Most of them aren't very unique or interesting, but all the girls are at least fair and fit their role. Once again, it's Touya who brings it all down since he's a Gary Stu. However, I won't harp on him much more since you already know the problems with him. The girls unfortunately get little to no background or character, and that's a shame because unlike Touya, I feel they have the potential to be interesting and varied with their character. The show sadly doesn't like to add any depth to them, because they're introduced to Touya and they're instantly part of the harem with little insight on who they are and what their motives are. Their history, interests, choice of weaponry, personality... Absolutely none of it is explored so they too end up feeling hollow and fall in love with Touya for no good reason (Besides Yumina which is explained but it still feels a tad cheap).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine, for the most part. I really like the design of the girls in particular, but they were the only ones that really stood out. Everything else feels incredibly basic for a Fantasy world. Typical villages, kings, castles, fields, giant dragons, etc etc. You've seen it all before; nothing is unique but it's at least serviceable. Action scenes aren't very good, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel smartphone had some potential to be a good show, but had to go the SAO route and make an OP main character which automatically gets rid of any conflict or tension the show offers, along with a pace that moves way too quickly and you're given no time to care about any of the characters, nor do they get any depth because of it. You know a show is bad when the best part halfway through is a fanservice scene that's been teased since the beginning.",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have finished watching In another World With My Smartphone and while care has been taken to minimize story spoilers there may be spoilers in character analysis. \r\nWhat happens when you die from an accident caused by god and choose to be resurrected in a fantasy world where monsters and magic exists with nothing but the clothes on your back, a magic enhanced smartphone and the ability to wield any magic in the new world. \r\nBased on a popular light novel series of the same name In Another World with My Smartphone is a fantasy/adventure harem anime that alsoincorporates elements of comedy into it. It\u2019s been quite a well since I actually seen a harem anime such as this but I guess nothing much has changed. As premises go In Another World With My Smartphone makes use of one that\u2019s been tried and tested in countless anime before in other more well-known anime such as the vaunted Konosuba series. What sets this anime apart from what can be seen in other anime\u2019s however is not the base concept of being resurrected in an entirely new world after perishing In the original but rather the smartphone that the main character Touya has that acts as the series main plot element. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for In another World With My Smartphone follows the life of Touya Mochizuki a 15-year-old teenager from Japan in the modern era that was killed in a freak accident by god and was given the choice to come back to life in a world of his choosing along with a wish that God would grant him. This wish and the implications of it to this new world is the centerpiece of the story and is the magic enhanced smartphone of Touya\u2019s. After resurrection Touya finds himself in a brand-new world where both magic and monsters exist and where he finds that sometimes common sense and diplomacy are worth more than having the biggest blade or the most durable of armor. In terms of setting the overall story for In Another World with My Smartphone takes place \\n\\n\r\nTouya  \\n\\n\r\nTouya voiced by new voice actor Katsumi Fukuhara with his first role is one of the main characters of the series and the main protagonist of the series. A 15-year-old teenager that was reincarnated in this world as part of the wishes that he had wanted god to grant Touya is someone that can be best described as your average Japanese teenager that\u2019s rather unremarkable both in terms of appearance, mannerisms or ambition. Indeed, Touya can be best described as someone that\u2019s just a normal guy that you can find anywhere in the world. The so-called everyman will be the best description for him. if he wasn\u2019t reincarnated in the fantasy world I would say that his life would have been rather unremarkable. A calm, brave and responsible person by nature Touya is someone that is quiet and prefers not to get involved with things that concern him. This contrasts however with Touya\u2019s strong sense of justice that manifests when he see\u2019s innocent people getting hurt which often prompts him to get involved without thinking it through. In the beginning of the series Touya was someone that despite being sent to an entirely new world was able to remain calm and composed while determining his first steps that will ensure that he has a good foundation to start with. These base traits of his largely remain unchanged as the series go on ensuring that he remains firmly anchored and calm as he encounters people and situations that will faze even the most veteran of adventurers. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Touya\u2019s personality gradually changes as he meets more people and encounter different situations in his travels. Though Touya was far from a horrible person in the beginning as the series progresses Touya becomes more humble and kind as the series progresses even when at times he was well within his rights to request a reward for his service. In fact, Touya\u2019s humble nature and the fact that he has little ego getting in his way can be said to be one of his most prominent traits and something that I admire about him. As can be expected of someone that was just sent to an entirely new world Touya is someone that gets curious quite easily and is always willing to learn new things. Here another prominent traits of Touya can be said to be of great use here which is his intelligence. Despite the fact that this is probably the first time that he encountered magic Touya in the series is noted to have an innate understanding of a wide array of subjects including magic, military tactics, firearms and ancient Japanese culture knowledge that he is shown to use throughout the series to deal with the unique situations that pop up. This wide array of knowledge combined with his ability to easily understand how something works can be said to be his second most prominent trait after his skill at magic. Arguably Touya\u2019s most prominent trait that makes him such an interesting character and such a powerhouse for the team is his ability at magic. While in the beginning of the series Touya proved to be proficient with the sword which when combined with his perception skills made him a capable opponent in melee combat it is in the realm of magic that Touya can be said to truly excel at. While most mages in fantasy settings would only be able to make use of a certain number of elements Touya is able to make use of a great number of magic spells from each of the main magic elements that serve to make Touya a very capable force multiplier when fighting on the field as he is essentially someone that can use every magic element. Naturally the major plot device that can be attributed to Touya is his smartphone which unlike a normal one actually runs on magic which in this new world is more or less plentiful. The smartphone like Touya gradually improves as he gains more abilities and powers as the series progresses becoming a very capable tool in its right.  As a character, I felt that Touya was a one that though well-designed was not one that developed much in terms of personality when compared to the other characters like the girls for example. Though the character itself was not well developed I do feel that his voice actor did a good enough job in portraying him. \\n\\n\r\nElze\\n\\n\r\nElze voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Charlotte and Musaigen No Phantom fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Touya\u2019s main allies within the series. A teenage girl that acts more like a tomboy than anything else Elze is the older sister of Linze. A brave, responsible and headstrong person Elze from initial appearances may look like a normal girl from a mere glance but that\u2019s before you actually see the over sized gauntlet that she uses as her main weapon. Personality wise Elze is someone that\u2019s very direct whether with their words in conversation or in combat she\u2019s the type of person that would prefer to the heart of a problem without becoming mired in pointless maneuvering in conversations.  Indeed, Elze is someone that\u2019s more accustomed to action rather than in diplomacy than anything which contrasts well with her younger sister. True to her personality Elze is someone that possesses a lot of self-confidence that allows her to stay motivated even when she\u2019s facing one of the most dangerous foes in the land and is someone that can be counted upon to hold the line on the field quite readily especially when combined with her skill at close combat and fortification magic.\\n\\n\r\n In the beginning of the series Elze was someone that was hard to get to know as she was slow to trust people and indeed often didn\u2019t listen to what others had to say before proceeding onwards. This is a result of the long travels that she and her sister has been through and is a direct result of the experiences that they had from relying upon one another. However once Elze trusts someone impeccably she is shown to be more attentive to them and values the advice and words that they may have. Though slow to trust Elze is shown to be quite capable of making friends with people that can brush aside her brash personality and in this we can see that Elze can be very loyal to her friends and willing to help them the best that she can if it lies within her power. Despite Elze\u2019s steely nature it was rather surprising to see that she can actually get embarrassed quite easily a trait that I find is quite refreshing for her. As the series progresses Elze\u2019s personality gradually changes as she meets new allies and encounters situations that so far has been unknown to her. While in the past Elze may charge headlong into situations without a second thought confidant that her skills in close combat will be able to get her and her sister through it this aspect of her personality began to change as she learned to show more restraint in her actions and begins to think more on the actions that she can take before taking them. Initially Elze was someone that can be considered to be very up front with their feelings that comes from her straightforward nature and personality but as the series progresses this aspect evolves and Elze while still passionate with her feelings also becomes more considerate for the feelings for others. As a character, I felt that Elze was a well-designed character that while brash and hard to control at first was someone that learned that perhaps restraint and caution is better than action and might have been the better choice. I felt that her seiyuu Maaya Uchida really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Elze. \\n\\n\r\nLinze \\n\\n\r\nLinze voiced by new seiyuu Yui Fukuo in her first main role to date is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Touya\u2019s main allies in the series. The younger sister of Elze Linze is the polar opposite to Elze in terms of both personality and behaviour. A young teenage girl and the younger of the Silhoueska twins Linze is a quiet, composed and intelligent young girl that exudes the image of an academic or maybe a veteran mage. Unlike her older sister Linze is someone that\u2019s very cautious and diplomatic and prefers conversation rather than action. Of all of the girls Linze can be seen to be the most intelligent of the girls as in addition to being well read and learned Linze has shown to be able to use this knowledge effectively on the field to help her allies. In terms of contrast Linze I felt served as a great contrast to both her sister Elze and the rest of the cast where her cautiousness and calmness served as a great asset to the team.  This contrast of Linze\u2019s is not just restricted to a personality level but also reflected in the battle talent that she has. Unlike her sister who\u2019s more accustomed to fighting at the forefront of the battle due to her skill at both close combat and at fortification magic Linze serves as a mage and is shown to be especially proficient in water magic and in its sub field of ice magic in particular.  Being able to stay rational and composed while also offering effective fire support while in battle is a skill that I thought was really appropriate for Linze. An aspect of Linze\u2019s that\u2019s only shown in battle that I find quite amusing is Linze\u2019s tendency to go overboard with her magic which given her personality is something that I did not expect from her. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses Linze\u2019s personality gradually changes as she meets new characters and makes new friends while also exploring new lands. In the beginning of the series Linze was someone that as a result of her quiet personality was someone that got nervous rather easily and in the beginning often had great trouble in not just conversing with people but also finding the right words to use. As a result of not just meeting Touya but also the rest of the cast Linze gradually becomes more confident in herself and able to make clear to others what her thoughts and opinions on matters are far more easily than what she was like before. Seeing the quiet and meek Linze that we saw in the beginning of the series evolve into someone that was not afraid of making their voices and opinions known to others was a change that I thought was well done. While becoming more confidant in herself Linze is also noted to have become more brave and willing to stand in battle to help her friends and allies when they are in danger and in doing so showing the steely determination that was the best result of her evolution as a character. Another aspect that is unique to Linze is the fact that even though Linze is at heart someone that is well mannered, kind and composed she\u2019s also someone that can get angry especially when someone irks her a lot. In this we can see that when she\u2019s angry Linze\u2019s personality markedly changes as she becomes forceful and stern and exudes a pretty menacing aura as well. As a character, I felt that Linze was an interesting character that served as a great contrast with her sister Elze and brought to the cast not just strong magical abilities but also a degree of intelligence and analytic capability that served well to help the team in their travels. I felt that her seiyuu Yui Fukuo really did a great job in her portrayal of Linze and despite this being her first main role to date I felt that she did an excellent job. \\n\\n\r\nYumina \\n\\n\r\nYumina voiced by new seiyuu Marika Kouno in one of her first main roles to me is one of the main characters of the show and is one of Touya\u2019s main allies in the series. The princess of Belfast and sole daughter of the king Yumina is a kind, caring and considerate person that as expected of a princess is also very well-mannered and diplomatic. Though within the series Yumina is but a 12-year-old girl Yumina is shown to take her duties as a princess quite seriously and is very loyal to both her parents and to the country as well and as a result is willing to take part in state visits to other countries to negotiate with the people there. Unlike the other girls in the show whose special skills come from years of practice Yumina\u2019s special skill which allows her to see the true personality of someone is something that she was born with which gave her a rather interesting ability that has proved useful to both her and to her parents and the country. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series Yumina was seen to be someone that didn\u2019t trust easily and though friendly on the surface was also shown to be wary of people that she didn\u2019t know. Both of these traits are a by-product of being a nations princess as she in this role is expected to meet a great many different people not all of which are trueful. However, as the series progresses Yumina though never completely letting down her guard gradually becomes more positive, considerate and more expressive with her true feelings which I felt was something that she needed since the heavy responsibility of being a princess I think is not something that a 12-year-old girl should have to shoulder. One aspect of her character that I found to be interesting was the fact that Yumina is actually a very capable combatant being a very capable mage and archer despite her young age. In this she differed from more traditional princess like characters that had to rely on guards to protect them. This I felt was a welcome change to her. Overall as a character I felt Yumina was interesting as despite being a princess she had none of the negative traits that they usually had and treated everyone with respect and kindness something most nobles would struggle with. I felt that her seiyuu Marika Kouno really did a great job in voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nYae \\n\\n\r\nYae voiced by veteran seiyuu Chinatsu Akasaki of Food Wars and Trinity Seven fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Touya\u2019s main allies in the series. A female swordswoman from the far away land of Eashen that Touya and the gang encounter during their time in Belfast Yae is someone that can be best described as what a typical samurai if they were sent into the fantasy world would be like. A honorable and kind-hearted person by nature Yae despite her young age is someone that has trained extensively with the sword and is a very accomplished swordswoman in her own right despite her age. Despite her young age Yae had elected to travel the world in order to both explore and learn new techniques that she can incorporate into her own showing that she is also someone that\u2019s not just brave but also a bit of a free spirit as well. Personality wise Yae has a number of prominent personality traits that serve to define her. The central motivation that Yae makes use of in the story is without a doubt her firm sense of justice which stems from not just her status as a warrior but also from her own personal beliefs that state that evil should be punished at every turn. This means that when encountering quests that call for the elimination or disabling of enemies judged to be evil Yae will often get motivated enough to fight them. Despite being a powerful combatant in close combat Yae is shown to be amusingly clumsy at times which I felt was quite amusing and helps offset the fact that she\u2019s that powerful. The last prominent trait of Yae is her manner of speech and her accent which I find to be pretty funny. As a character, I felt that Yae was a well-designed character that showed that even if you are from a far-off land the sense of justice and morals can surprisingly be the same as well. Chinatsu Akasaki, I felt did an excellent job in portraying the character of Yae despite her lack of development when compared to the other girls.  \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt that the arts and animation for the series was relative good with both the environmental settings and the scenery being pretty well made. The character designs for each of the main characters I felt were nice and each character\u2019s outfit was unique, well designed and well thought out. The combat animations though decent I felt was one thing that could be improved on. The effects of magic that were released by mages like Linze and Yumina I felt were pretty impressive. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for the series which was Another World by AOP I felt was pretty catchy and did a great job of setting the mode for the series. The series though only having one ending theme is notable for having each of the main heroines sing it for one or two episodes which was interesting. The ending theme for the series was Junjou Emotional which was also a catchy song that sounded quite relaxing and pleasant to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the series was solid and I felt that praise should go to Maaya Uchida who voiced Elze, Yui Fukuo who voiced Linze, Marika Kouno who voiced Yumina and Chinatsu Akasaki who voiced Yae who I felt all did an excellent job at voicing their characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn Overall In Another World with my Smartphone was an interesting anime whose strong points was its interesting premise, interesting story and well-designed characters. The comedic side of the show was also something that I thought was well done. The overall premise that the show makes use of namely being transported to a different world after death is not one that is rare within the industry and rather is one of the most common scenarios that originated from the renowned Re Zero series. Here though the one thing that managed to create some semblance of change to the premise was the shows ultimate plot device the smartphone. Bringing in equipment from other worlds and into a world where technology is lower is a common enough theme but here the series also introduces items that serve to improve the world such as ice cream, bicycles, shogi boards and firearms. This change was something that I welcomed as it made the story that much more interesting. Since the smartphone evolved in parallel with Touya\u2019s abilities in my view it become more than just a tool but rather it become both a weapon and a tome of knowledge for him.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the interesting premise and the capable voice cast I felt that the series had a lot of things that it could have improved on to make it that more interesting. Character development in the series I felt was rather inconsistent with the main character of Touya largely staying as he was at the start while characters like Linze and Elze get decent development while the other girls did not. The combat scenes in the series I felt were overly simple despite the care taken in designing the fights themselves. A problem that the show inherits from its source material is that the main characters with one notable exception never actually faces any real threat to their lives that they had to overcome by putting their minds and powers to novel uses. If the main characters are challenged more in their battles then I think a combination of Touya\u2019s intellect and the girl\u2019s various abilities would have been better used. Overall as a final score I would give In another World with my Smartphone a final score of 6/10. While the premise and story were good and the main characters were well designed the lack of effective character development  made it too genetic in my eyes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I believe almost everyone who starts watching this anime would think the same thing as me, \"Is this Konosuba rip-off? MC dies and 'god' revived him to another world. This is exactly same as Konosuba!\".\r\nWell, that's what I thought at first, but I won't go by that wild mind for the rest of the season, so I accept the fact that there are a lot of Isekai theme out there and the plot could be similar to one another. Case closed with \"Konosuba rip-off\" everyone talking about.\r\n(updated my review for the last episode)\r\nStory: 5\r\nFirst of all, this anime is more like a Slice of Lifestory rather than an Adventure and while I said that this anime is not a rip-off of Konosuba, I won't lie to myself that I didn't get the enjoyment like I got from Konosuba, both anime have the same plot as MC dies and revived but the BIG difference from both anime is the whole character themselves.\\n\r\nI won't talk much about Konosuba as you already know that anime well.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start talking about the MC, he is OP AS F***. 'god' gave him a buff as a compensation from his blunder ('god' accidentally dropped some lightning on the world and it hits the MC ).\\n\r\nInstead of giving the MC a slight buff to make him capable of casting magic, this 'god' make the MC like a freakin' god himself.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the MC got massive buff as he could cast all the elements and could copy others \"null\" magic. (watch the 1st episode and you'll understand this null thing).\\n\r\nI watched 'til episode 9 and there is no such thing as \"the MC got wrecked or the MC having a hard time to deal with his New World\".\\n\r\nI heard that in the Light Novel the story also goes like this and the MC still never having a hard time to everything. Welp.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the girls, all the girl are cute and strong enough to defend themselves from monster's attacks. Done.\\n\r\nYes, that's the only worth telling. lel\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art style is suited with the theme but still lacks of animation. As long as the art style is suited with the theme, I'd always give it a good rate.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing special but still \"okay\" to listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nNo character development at all as the MC can pull all the basic spells or even rare spells easily.\\n\r\nAnd for the girls there is no development as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all about MC and the girls go rekt here and there and do some harem things.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nWhile this anime is not so special but I still like it, yeah it is just my personal preference. I love both anime with weak MC or OP MC, as long as they are not dense on everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nSeems like there is nothing \"good point\" from this review but that's what it is.\\n\r\nDespite from that, I still recommend this anime if you like generic plot anime with magic and OP MC.\\n\\n\r\nMy review for the last episode\\n\r\n[SPOILER]\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nI almost lost all my respect for Touya when he said that he will marry all those 4 so lightly. If only Touya originally is from this Isekai in the first place maybe I won't be thinking this way, because the difference of culture with our REAL world. \\n\r\nIn our world you can't just marry 4 or even 9, yeah, NINE girls at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nSome people find it (last episode) fun to watch because not many harem anime would actually have this kind of route. But some poeple (including me) would get irritated by Touya's decision.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to take this anime seriously -especially the ending- because this is just parody but unfortunately I can't.",

            "content": "This anime would be a great way to explain one of Descartes' theory of existentialism. Touya dies in his \"real world\" but wasn't supposed to die so his God (a supreme being is a confirmed in this anime) apologizes by putting him in another world where magic exists and the industrial revolution never happened. Here's where it gets interesting, it wouldn't be far from the realm of reality to assume that Touya was never actually placed in a second external world by God but that he was deceived by God to think that he was in a real genuine second world where magic exists. Away to affirm this is how God made him the most powerful entity (aside from himself) in this world and told Touya to live a little when confronted with the moral dilemma of marrying a 14 year old (Touya is 16). This means (just a theory) that there is no real external world where magic exists that Touya is currently in but this is just a dream state that God put Touya in when he died and went to heaven. It can be summarized and assumed that the world Touya is currently in was made for him to live out his wildest fantasies. The only thing that technically can be proved is ones own existence, so there is no proof that can be offered that Touya is in a genuine external world instead of a dream like world. \"Cogito ergo sum.\" - Descartes",

            "content": "The problem with this series is that it is a Titanic. It had an idea that, for an anime, could have turned into something truly epic for a fantasy story but instead it took its plot and crashed it straight into an iceberg.\r\nThe main character isn't drawn too well and his character is blander than vanilla ice-cream. He is made pointlessly OP and the main drawing point of the anime, the smartphone, is almost never used.\r\nInstead it is merely mentioned or pulled out once or twice an episode to ensure we never forget it.\r\nThe other characters are all such stereotypes that it only serves tograte on the nerves every time one of them speaks. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is only good in that it is so bad it might make you laugh and guffaw at its mediocrity and regurgitation of other, far more superior anime with similar themes. \\n\\n\r\nMy advice then is to watch it only if you are a zealot for fantasy anime of any kind or if you want to laugh at a bad anime with some friends.",

Once in a while, a special kind of series comes along, one that looks like the anime equivalent of a movie you'd see on MST3K.\r\nIt's not really about the personality-less girls, nor is it about how tropey this show gets. \r\nFor me, as with many from what I'm seeing, the entirety of this show comes down to it's incredibly overpowered protagonist. \r\nWhich brings us to Touya, our main character... or as I like to call him 'jesus'. And I think that episode 9 has a line that sums up whats so bad..yet surprisingly endearing about this anime.\\n\r\n\"It's not even surprising at this point.\"\\n\r\nThis is the problem with Jesus-kun, by the third episode, the viewer has become used to the idea that the hero wins by pulling some kind of spell out of his ass mere minutes after the problem/villain appears.\\n\r\nEven in most 'battle harem' anime, the protagonist, while designed to be 'relate-able' so to speak, always has his own obstacles to face and more often than not the majority of villains are stronger than him when they first appear.\\n\r\nWe're all used to the concept of characters 'breaking their limits', but the MC has no limits to begin with, and thats... abundantly clear..\\n\r\nIn addition, the rest of the cast is composed of incredibly bland and predictable archetypes that you could basically make a drinking game out of the constant tropes in the show\\n\r\nYet surprisingly, all this is exactly what makes this anime so goddamn great, while not exactly self aware, it doesn't even bother to hide any of this. The typical episode goes as follows\\n\r\n1. Problem\\n\r\n2. Everyone panicking and terrified\\n\r\n3. MC non-chalant about it\\n\r\n4. MC nonchalantly solves problem\\n\\n\r\nIt gets to the point where the other members of the cast actually acknowledge how powerful he is, but while the show seems self aware, it doesn't give us enough comedic moments to pass off as something like Konosuba.\\n\r\nInstead it passes off as what it is, a show that is self aware about it's blandness and lack of stakes and originality\\n\r\nAnd whenever the show does something, it almost becomes a game among viewers in the room to name what anime they had already seen that done better in.\\n\r\nIn the long run, if you want an anime that you wanna riff on with your friends.... this is that anime for the season\\n\r\n.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nWhile the story in the anime is turning out to be complete trash, the standards it uses coupled with it's intended demographic and genre make it appropriate for what it is. The only thing stopping me from dropping the score down to a 2 is the fact that it was never meant to be an action-packed show.\r\nArt:\r\nIf this anime came out in 2010, I would rate this no less than an 8. However, so many anime came out with the same art direction since then, that this one does not do anything new and innovative, actually looking a bit bland on the color department. Buthey, I've seen much worse; however, I've seen much better as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm only on episode 4, the soundtrack so far does not do anything memorable or sticks to me anyway at all. Both the opening and the ending don't really symbolize much at this point and the songs are kind of lame and unmemorable. It certainly doesn't offend me, nor does it make me want to jump out my bedroom window, but again, I've heard much worse and better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nCharacter by far is the worst part of this show. None of the characters receive any proper development or backstory nor go through any personal struggle. This is mainly because of the MC, your run of the mill overpowered god (I understand the reference) that automatically possesses the power to negate any personal strife that they need to overcome, a pivotal point for the progression of the story and any of the attachment that the viewer might have to the characters. This is not pathetic, because the intended genre is specialized for these types of MC's.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nComing from a 15 year old, seeing a boy of similar age with jaw dropping girls drooling all over him certainly does not offend me. However, I'm no pervert either. This does get old as you move to episode 4, and I can't imagine anything refreshing about it either; however, something about this anime, whether it be the humanized MC or my raging hormones prevents me from rating this any lower than a six. However, they stop there as logic takes over, preventing me from rating this any higher either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like female harems and women who would instantly get on their knees for a man, want to see the MC succeed in every task and blow everyone away like he's God, then this is the anime for you. However, those of you searching for anything else should look elsewhere, because this probably would disappoint.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "How can you describe this anime; Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.? It's pretty easy. Just say out loud the official English title of this anime; In Another World With My Smartphone.\r\nIn Another World With My Smartphone is about Mochizuki, a young teenage boy who was accidentally killed. To apologise to Mochizuki, God allows him to ask of any one thing to be brought with him to be summoned to another fantasy world to which Mochizuki asks for merely a smartphone to be brought to this fantasy world. Being an anime that is set in a fantasy world where the protagonist is being summoned intoafter their death on Earth, this is seen as a cliche and is compared greatly to Konosuba. Being summoned by God himself, he is given an over substantial amount of magic power to which he is \"OP\" and able to conquer anything in this fantasy world. This is what sets this anime apart from Konosuba, and is also what makes it comparably worse. \\n\\n\r\nTo distract us from his over powered buffs he gets from God and immense invincibility, this anime makes sure to set up a harem-like setting where he forms a group with some girls with him being the only male and leader of the group. Again, this is another similarity to Konosuba and this anime can be called a clone of Konosuba; a much worse one in fact.\\n\\n\r\nAs Mochizuki is over powered, we know that any complication in the plot and any \"suspensful\" moment becomes meaningless as we already know that there will be a simple resolution as he can just say the \"magic word\" and he saves the day and ends the episode to this pointless Konosuba copycat of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST to this anime is not that good. The music get's too dramatic and distracting, especially when it comes between the dialogue and interactions between characters. The soundtrack is usually meant to fill the blank space to not make the dialogue so bland, but the soundtrack merely just overpowers the dialogue and distracts us from the plot and what is going on. On the contrary, the voice acting for the characters are good. There's nothing really bad I can say or criticise about the voice acting. The seiyuus are all good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is done well in this anime. Since there is no deep complications that happen in this anime, development of characters are done easily with no need of dramatisation and development is also complemented by the harem-setting of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very familiar and pretty average. There is nothing unique and the characters all look like either your sterotypical male protagonist in a fantasy world or the accompanying female moe cast who are in this endless harem on this one male protagonist. There is also nothing really special about the animation style. It's pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a pretty average show that is probably not worth your time if you were looking for something different or substantial. But, if you wanted to see something fast-pace that gets straight to the point regardless if there is no suspense or barriers for the main cast, then I recommend that you watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn Another World With My Smartphone. The title sums up the plot of the anime. If that's what you're looking for, then that's what you're getting.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Like, the best character in the entire world at every single thing he tries his hand at.\r\nFine, I've seen this Gary Stu nonsense before - it's poor writing wish fulfilment nonsense, but it is what it is.\r\nExcept then it turns out to actually be some harem animenonsense - the protaganist is swarmed by perpetually flustered hordes of essentially breasts with sketched in personalities appended. Sure, it's an unhealthy attitude to women viewing them as essentially props for the audience and main character to lust over (while of course the writers make him feign innocence). It even acknowledges this - ironic lampshading being the main form of humour in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut the bit which is particularly objectionable is that the creators have included literal children as love interests. This has gone from \"pathetic wish fulfilment\" to \"pathetic wish fulfilment for the sort of people who assure you that 'she's very mature for a 12 year old'\".\\n\\n\r\nThis is symptomatic of a problem across anime, which justifiably gets it looked down upon by the majority of people who are aware of this aspect, but yet for some reason it is still not only accepted as a subculture, but shows like this specifically design characters around having children for that part of the audience to lust over.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, the main character saying he'll wait until she is 14 before he marries her is not an acceptable way to get around this problem.\\n\\n\r\nY'all should be ashamed of yourselves.",

            "content": "At first I had my doubts, my first thoughts were oh this is just your average isekai, with the obvious character tropes they always have, and while that might be true, it's still entertaining to watch. Unlike most isekai, this show doesn't have much in terms of tension or drama, because in every situation where something could happen, the mc, Touya, always has the spell to solve the issue. And because he can do this, after every girl he saves from some kind of situation, they inevitably fall for him and join his group.\r\nI want to get the record and say that this show isin no way comparable in terms of quality to the greats such as FMAB, Steins;Gate and all but it has a special charm to it. The show excels on what it intended to do, i.e. entertainment, humor, and sending a message.\\n\\n\r\nThe cons:\\n\r\n- Mediocre art and animation\\n\r\n- Unoriginal character personality types\\n\r\n- Bad character designs\\n\r\n- Not much character development\\n\r\n- OP MC\\n\r\n- Problems are solved too quickly\\n\\n\r\nNow, the Pros:\\n\\n\r\nThe show went all out unlike most serious in this genre, the MC is right in the middle from most male mc's in isekai harems, he isn't a super shy, weak, bashful guy, but he also isn't a super perverted, strong but dumb hero, and his goal isn't to get all the girls. Instead he is a smart, strong, morally correct, confident hero, who isn't completely dense. He makes sure to bring up his morals in almost any instance where it is important, including the last episode which was very satisfying compared to most harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks only purpose is to fit the mood of each scene which does well at doing that but nothing more. The story isn't anything special, just your average isekai, harem just without the usual drama.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going into this show expecting a masterpiece, well don't unless you find harem anime extremely good, but for anyone else, you should expect an entertaining harem/comedy with a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was enjoyable about the series was that it had it's funny moments where isekai usually fail to hit, as well as where harem anime also fails to hit. By all means this isn't an anime for story driven viewers but more for a person who enjoys isekai or a person of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like my verdict just check out my list and favorites for an example of my tastes and credibility.",

Prime examples of this include the expertly written Saitama and Mob from genius writer ONE. So why is it that this show fails so spectacularly in writing an OP MC and as a show in general? Let's break it down.\r\nCharacters are only made interesting by their flaws or their challenges. Saitama faces existential dread wondering what his purpose in life is after achieving the overwhelming strength he desired. This challenge of finding fulfillment in life is universal of the human experience and achieves the incredible featof making a person with godlike strength feel human and relatable. Mob is a kid going through puberty and trying to deal with all of these new emotions he's experiencing while also possessing godlike powers that are directly influenced by his emotions. Once again this makes him feel relatable as we all went through this and felt new emotions that made us confused. The reason I bring these two good OP MCs up is to help convey how poorly written Touya and by extension this show is.\\n\\n\r\nTouya faces no real challenges or flaws in his character. He's killed at 15 due to a mistake from God. Now you'd think this would cause some conflict or some trials. But nope! He takes it perfectly in stride and God decides to buff him as his way of saying sorry. He has superhuman speed and durability and can use every magic element in his new world. He heals the blind and poisoned, saves the king, helps random children who are lost, and is successful at every single thing he does. That is the main issue with this show. Touya is a pure Gary Sue in every sense of the word. There's no personal conflict with him. No trials or tribulations or failure. Touya therefore comes across as an incredibly boring character who feels completely unrelatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show is very paint by numbers. The art is fine. The sound is fine. Really the rest of it is just fine. If you can look past the complete failure of character writing this show has then it's a perfect little time killer. But if you want a good OP MC show check out ONE's shows. They're funny, action packed, and most importantly well written.",

The characters are all flat, clones of something you've definitely seen before somewhere else. The plot doesn't really seem to go anywhere, and there is an inherent lack of a main antagonist anywhere. There are some humorous moments strewn throughout the show, and i must admit that i managed to scrounge some enjoyment out of powering through the 12 episodes at once. The biggest issue that I faced with the show was that almost nothing gets accomplished by the end of the show.A good time waster, if nothing else.  6.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nSlogan of this anime in a nutshell. \"It was oddly so generic that it made it good.\"\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nThis whole Anime or story itself or the whole setting felt really odd. To sum it up it felt as seeing some seasoned developer becoming some sort of gamemaster (GM) of some sort of a RPGmaker generic game, but playing the game in debug mode plus using development skills to implement some new things into game however that developer wants to.\r\nHard to explain, but everything that happens in this Anime isoddly plain and generic, but it feels so generic, that is somehow makes it good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd seeing our MC to adventure in such a world was comical and oddly satisfying. Every story element and every thing thing that got introduced in that world felt like something out of old typical RPGmaker game. We get overpowered character in a comical and odd manner, world has essentially most basic and plain stock spells, where our MC can learn all \"free of charge\".\\n\\n\r\nBut how the story was presented and built, even know actively knowing that it was quite \"generic\", it was simply superb. I generally don't dislike \"generic\" as I translate it as \"traditional\". But the idea how such a troupe was used and handled felt as parody itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great element is having funny modern device that is oddly very useful and powerful in the fantasy world. It had a lot of oddity and questionably about quite some story elements and characters considering how our MC brought shift in power balance and \"tech\".\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\n\"Stock assets of RPGmaker.\"\\n\r\nJokes aside, art felt very underwhelming, but I did like the character designs and some of the magic. Oh... and I really didn't like most of the swimsuits there...\\n\r\nMusic did actually have some presence. Did enjoy quite a few tracks.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\n\"Stock filler NPCs and a bit better built party member NPCs\".\\n\r\nOnce again, jokes aside, I found that the stereotypes were used quite nicely and in a entertaining way. Our main character was a bit less standard than most isekai series. He was less standard and maybe I even I didn't really like him as much, but how he was set-up in that world and how all of it went along, somehow made it comical thus I can accept him as character.\\n\\n\r\nAlso we have a superb harem of all sorts of girls. Some I liked, some not. But the best part about this harem is. Would be that it actually is successful harem and can and probably will be legitimate harem in that world.\\n\\n\r\nGeneric and stereotypical characters that were shown in a very enjoyable way. As I have said in the past. \" \"Generic\" and \"stereotypes\" are superb if they are done and used right.\"\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nIt was all around odd Anime, but how everything was put together and used. Felt as whole satisfying, straightforward, chill and fun. In another words it felt good, thus it gets 7 from me.\\n",

Touya is the most generic and nice character I've ever seen. He's just nice and helpful and can do anything and everyone is constantly in awe at his amazing powers?? like every episode youjust realise \"oh without him doing anything he can actually use this random other super rare ability with little effort\". He doesn't have any motivation or...anything really in him?

Enough that I went and bought every light novel that has been translated to English and have number 10 on pre-order through Amazon.\r\nPart of the reason I like it so much is the light novels, they have gone so far beyond the the final episode that there's enough material for 3 or 4 more seasons, which I would happily watch. There are some minor differences, but overall, the anime is faithful to the light novels, the script must have been written by a fan.\r\nThe final episodes is loaded for bear with hints of what's tocome, the introduction of Ende, the number and identities of Touya's brides-to-be through end credit artwork(although I'm guessing at the final bride's identity, she has not been revealed as such in volume 9) The initial 4 plus two(Introduced, but they aren't revealed as brides in the first season) are the only ones you'll meet in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis was not a series I had great hopes for initially, the title almost kept me from watching it. Is it great art or a masterpiece? I can't claim that, but I will say it is great fun, worth multiple rewatches and the novels rereading for favorite parts.

            "content": "What stood out to me in this anime, above all else, was the MC. Touya is probably the closest to Mr. Perfect I've encountered thus far. Aside from being oblivious to the romantic intentions of his companions, he's smart enough to find solutions to problems relatively painlessly. He's overpowered, but only uses as much as he needs to for any given situation and isn't overly flashy. He's humble, but not shy. He's very kind, but doesn't put himself down for the sake of others. The only thing I could dislike about him is that he's too perfect. Subaru is my favorite male MC for thesame reasons he's so hated by most fans - he's heavily flawed. I can relate to him because of that. Touya is just so perfect that he never needs my sympathy and he never makes me reflect on myself. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, I wasn't enthralled by any of them, but I couldn't find anything wrong with them either. The only change I would make would be introducing Francesca much earlier on, because I think her personality is a foil to the others that adds a lot of depth. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was pretty average in general, but the pacing was good. There wasn't a gripping storyline that I wanted to see to the end; instead, there was a series of minor arcs that were all interesting enough to make me want to keep watching, without any stretches of boring nothing in between.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have anything interesting to report for the art and sound. They're both pretty average. Taken together with everything else, this anime is a solid 7 for me. I guess for most people that's not very high, but I standardize my ratings so 7 is very good.",

I binge watched it and it's been a while since an anime has gotten me to do that.         The story doesn't really have a goal but that's not the point. The point is to just enjoy a show about a fantasy world with cute anime girls, while the MC is so OP and can do anything he wants todo.  You can imagine yourself as him. This show is supposed to be a feel good show. You get to put yourself in the MC's shoes and the MC is overpowered and has it all. He get's so much social gratication wherever he goes. The social gratification is one of the main parts that this shows uses a lot. This show gives you a lot of social gratification since it gives the MC a lot of social gratification. It really is just a nice simple adventure fantasy anime. All that stuff about having an end goal isn't always necessary, since it puts a strain on anything else other than that. The art is good but the animation and fight scenes sometimes look a bit rough but its not a big deal at all. Easily ignorable. In this show lots of good stuff keeps on happening and its just a really posative and happy anime and I really enjoyed it. Sometimes its good to just have a laid back anime thats always posative.                   BIG SPOILER TO THE ANIME AHEAD:  \\n\\n\r\nSpoiler ALERT if you keep reading down......\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show actually fucking ends with an actual harem for once. That's a big one. No harem anime's actually show that ending. This show is like the first or one of the few. (I'm pretty sure atleast).    At first it sort of felt awkward for it to be a harem ending with him being engaged to marrying all the girls. He plans to marry all of them.    It felt weird since that's not our tradition in this world but fuck it. Once you get over that, the ending is amazing.\\n",

That simplicity is something I can apreciate in a show.\r\nThe writing is abhorrently bad, in sense that the show is full of clich\u00e9s, extremely inconsistent within it's logic and really predictable when it comes to how things happen withinthe episodes. Thing is, it didn't bother me. Probably because I completly turned off my brain while watching it. When I watched it I wasn't looking for proper writing or proper world building and realistic charaters. All I wanted was a fun medieval fantasy style show about a harem. A proper harem, not one of those dumbass \"harems\" where the author decides to say fuck you to every single character you've come to like because apparently they were only there to create waifu wars within the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable anime if you have an enormous tolerance for bad writing and enjoy a relaxed medieval fantasy setting with a bunch of cute girls in the mix.\\n\\n\r\nAs I think enjoyement is the only score that should ever matter, I give this anime an 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nFun stuff.

Turns out, I've got something different from what I expected... \r\nStory:\r\nYou guys read the synopsis right? There you have it. The story is sooo peaceful that I felt like nothing bad happens throughout the ending. There's some intense and fighting scenes but, damn this dude's cellphone is useful and he's got a 'real life aimbot'. Oh wait, it was an offer from God, so that's why...\r\nArt:\r\nNot the best, but I can live with it.Drawings are fine, but the animations are quite lacking... But whatever, you get fan service anyways.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYou've got a generic high tempo pop music (battle style) OP or whatever I just don't know how to describe it. Its not bad, OK? It just fits the anime theme. ED? didn't listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMC - CheatEngine, aimbot, trainer, hesoyam, worshipme, helloladies \\n\r\n4 girls - Loves the MC very much, generic tsundere, kawaii\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment;\\n\r\nThis show didn't actually quite grab me (I've paused this for awhile just to watch other shows). I do enjoy some moments but not enough to keep me watching till the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI think this show is suitable people who just needed some break after watching heart-breaking or intense shows. Nothing fancy, just a very peaceful OP life with girls and no sacrificing stuff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh my god! The premise is just like Konosuba, with no creativity what so ever.  Dying, being reborn and choosing whatever you want to bring. Like what!!! I can\u2019t believe they just copied the idea like that.  From the guilds to the types of people they encounter everything is identical, although, everything was put on easy mode.\r\nI could list so many things in common like:\r\nEp 2: The magic spell \u2018aports\u2019 is the same as steal. The reference to stealing pantsu was ALSO there.\r\nEp 3: Fighting a dullahan and Megumin\u2019s Explosion which is now Linze\u2019s Explosion\r\nEp 5: The neet in Konosuba is very comparableto the slime researcher, and Satou helping Megumin train like Touya helping Linze.\\n\r\nEp 6: The wagon trip in ep 6 is also like Konosuba S2 Ep 7.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nIn this show, there was an overarching story about an advanced civilization but it didn\u2019t really dive deep into it much. It was mostly small adventures where Touya just saves everyone and they all praise him.  It can get very boring at times for some, since he is pretty much an unstoppable force that just does everything perfectly.  Everything goes well and it\u2019s very predictable.  Some parts of the comedy ran off as being very clich\u00e9 although I believe that was what the writers were trying to do.  Overall, the story was very forgettable but if you enjoy seeing the main character putting everyone in awe then this will be a good watch for you.  There were so many things left as a cliffhanger to this show like the Fraze and the Partheno Civilization, which are probably the most original things that this series offered.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art style is your typical isekai show but it is sub par compared to other shows.  Its barely polished and very flat. Especially in the insides of rooms, where you can clearly see windows with the sun shining in but no shadows casted in the room. The animation from the fight scenes were so terrible with barely any movement either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe opening was to my liking.  The other soundtracks were average.  It works fine with the scenes but aren\u2019t really remarkable.  There\u2019s nothing really wrong with any of their voices but they are very boring when put with their character types.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nNone of the characters were memorable or unique but their interactions are still pretty funny.  The main character was very cookie cutter.  They all have many of the isekai tropes but they are well done.  The problem is that they are unchanging.  From the start to the finish of the show there is barely any character progression.  It seems like the only reason the harem girls were there were to show how perfect Touya was.  They are very boring characters that are the downside of this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThese types of isekai shows are my guilty pleasure.  I just love the reactions that characters from the fantasy world have from interacting with the main character, who has tons of knowledge from our world about trivial things like making food like ice-cream or riding bicycles. It was so generic and clich\u00e9 that it had me laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\r\nI recommend this show to people who enjoy the usual isekai shows where the mc is trapped in an RPG type world with overpowered abilities.\\n\r\nBut if you want to see the better shows of this genre, I recommend series like Konosuba or Overlord.\\n\\n",

I'm a massive fan of the Isekai genre, and while this show itself isn't that bad, it definitely could've been much better. I've heard rumours for a season 2 so hopefully they can improve.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe uttermost worst part of this show had to be the story, so many different parts were just planned out horribly, I loved that they displayed the differences in culture by making the Main Character create stuff from his Original World in the worldhe's been faced with. It really shows how much cultures differentiate, I also loved the parts how they showed the economy, a lot of good other worldly anime skip the whole aspect but I love having a look at the economy such as Guilds and how much they get for their adventures.\\n\r\nThe whole \"adventure\" part ends abruptly, leaving you with a ton of disappointment, it ended in about the fourth episode I'd say. Around that time you have EVERY female character falling head over heels for the single male character (there were others but an extremely insignificant amount had ANY meaning at all.)\\n\r\nThe ONLY other reason this even gets a \"poor\" scoring in my eyes is the comedy. It was quite humorous at times, but, really, doesn't save it much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was the saving grace for me, it looked stunning to me. Nothing much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters' voice acting but the Opening itself wasn't the greatest, I just ended up skipping through it most of the time and I didn't even take the time to listen to the Ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI've already explained the reasons for the low score when it comes to the Characters, they were just made horribly. I don't believe any thought process went into this, probably should've just made this into a Hentai instead. The characters were made extremely horribly and I was actually amazed at how fast the writers changed this from Adventure to borderline Hentai.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the reasons above, the comedy was quite fun but I wouldn't recommend it based on that alone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nReally, a mess of a show. Started off AMAZING but it turned around extremely fast and really, it's embarrassing. I definitely will not be watching this again nor would I recommend it.",

            "content": "Normally I'd write a comprehensive review, and probably almost repeat myself a few times, but I feel like my sentiments can be summed up in one word: disappointment.\r\nThe plot had potential, and was ruined by the sudden influx of harem jealously and boobs. And the lack of plot development, beyond the very generic main story line of regular guy turns extremely OP master race  left me very deflated.\r\nMany compare this to Konosuba, but the only factor they have in common is roughly how both main characters end up in a parallel world filled with myth and magic. Both worlds operate similarly, but that's wherethe fantasy element kicks in. The story lines have nothing in common.\\n\\n\r\nWhile at first I did enjoy the story, line delivery, and scene transitions, the last few episodes left a less pleasant taste in my mouth (yeah yeah, that's what she said. Shut up, baka hentai). Because this was a manga first, I have no idea if the plot is better than the anime. However, there's a very cliche beach episode, and to me, this is where it suddenly becomes a very generic magical harem anime. \\n\\n\r\nThinking back on how the show develops, it does feel like things happen a bit too quickly. Like Inuyasha, modern concepts are introduced to a more medieval fantasy realm. Nothing about our modern world is truly explained, nor do we know if this has a negative impact on how the world would have otherwise developed. It just feels like, \"Oh sure, here, have some modern conveniences, I can't tell you where it came from though! I'm just going to accept being an OP genius!\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's rare that I agree with the ratings and reviews from others, but for once I feel like we're all on the same page. I didn't hate the anime, but it lost its appeal after the beach episode with the Jiggly Puff hammocks. It isn't a bad anime to watch, but because the ecchi-style fan service was very suddenly introduced, it just felt like I started losing the plot I was initially interested in. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point I feel like I'm venting my disappointment, so I'll just shut myself up here, lol.",

            "content": "This review will not be terribly long or complex (just long enough that MAL allows it to be posted).  And will be almost totally SPOILER-FREE. \r\nI can't in good conscience give this a 1, as that implies there was nothing of value gained from it at all.  There's also no way to justify a 10.\r\nThis is very much akin to delivery boy-man from Futurama.  They gave the protagonist too many powers.  There was never even a remote chance he could lose/not do something. \r\nThe whole point of this anime was supposed to be that he had his smartphone (that still somehowworked the same) in another world.  Well, the writers seem to have forgotten that after about episode one.  It instead becomes a story focused on the most over-powered protagonist known to man.  Lost your keys?  He has a spell for that.  Need Sherlock Holmes?  He has a spell for that.  Need to destroy a planet?  I can easily surmise he has a spell for that as well.  Want to get the girl?  He doesn't have a spell for that... but apparently he doesn't need it, since every girl in existence is drawn to him anyway.  Honestly... I'd feel a bit better about it if he WAS a pervert who used a spell to get the girl.  Would at least add a potentially funny bit of personality to his character.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show's title there is one thing you won't see  in this anime... and that is using a smartphone (ok technically you do see it for like 10 seconds each episode, and episode 1 they actually had made an effort to fit it in... so you get like... 20 seconds).\\n\\n\r\nThis show really has no points it excels in.  But at the same time, it can still be enjoyable to mindlessly veg-out and watch, as long as you go into each episode knowing there will be zero tension and a new girl will most definitely be added to the harem.",

            "content": "Oh boy. I remember when I first found out that this show existed as I was browsing an anime site for something worth watching when this came up on the sidebar. \"In Another World with my Smartphone\" appeared as a recommendation, and my first instinct was to disregard it for being nothing more than a shitty clickbait ad. But no, it wasn't. It's real. People put time, money, and effort into making this show; but in hindsight they probably didn't put a whole lot of those things into the production of this anime.\r\nThat aside, this anime deserves to be seen by everyone. It deserves tobecome one of the most popular anime out there not because people might get invested in the characters or the plot, but because of how irredeemably shitty it is. A good friend of mine and I have taken to scouring the planet for the worst anime out there to entertain ourselves by laughing at the awfulness of Japanese cartoons, and so far this has been one of the best we've seen. The show is bad, yes, but it's GOOD bad. The \"development\" of the \"characters\" and \"plot\" is executed in such a way that makes every episode filled with enjoyment just because it leaves the viewer thinking \"is this really fucking happening right now?\" When it comes to terrible anime, this show reigns supreme because it seems to constantly ask itself \"how can I make the main character and plot get even dumber than it already is?\"\\n\\n\r\nReally, there isn't much else to say that hasn't already been said by countless others. For the most part, I feel it's necessary to let people know that yes, this anime is indeed horrible, but if you're the odd soul like me who likes laughing at some really poorly-made entertainment with friends every so often, then this is the show for you. I look forward the Smartphone season 2 and all the stupidity that will come along with it, because that will be roughly another 6 hours of enjoyment for me and my friend.",

Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is actually a combination of all those mentioned. Honestly, I have never felt so right about my expectations of an anime before. I was so surprised about my expectations hitting the mark that I can't even compare to how much optimistic this anime is. Don't get me started on even how overpowered the main character was. If only Subaru was able to put his phone to actual use like the main character ofthis anime, Re:Zero could've gotten a better scenery. So this anime was like KonoSuba deprived of comedy, Danmachi with no Action and Re:Zero with an OP main character. What kept this anime going for me is the Harem genre but I could've had better. So.. I don't know if I should recommend this but give it a try, you might find some drama in it. \\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10: Too optimistic!! Not even a touch of drama or difficulty for the characters. All enemies are taken cared of within 5 minutes. The most difficult part in this anime is the main hero's density. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: I have to admit that the art style is nice. I think it's the only factor carrying this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: A Harem.. Character development? none. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Maybe you'll enjoy an anime with no troubles at all.. An anime where everyone gets along. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10: If there is a sequel, I hope they would improve the story a lot. The Cliffhanger at the end of this should be settled.",

            "content": "Why should you watch this anime? I'll keep this short to play the devil's advocate.\r\nMost people are giving low scores of this anime, and for the reason most of them say, they are correct. The pace is fast, the MC is a little TOO op without any apparent weaknesses with makes him hard to relate to. The characters aren't exactly very interesting and the over all story is a little dull.\r\nWhere this anime shines, however, is in the \"harem\" tag. Most people dislike harem anime for a few reasons that this anime avoids. If you're concerned about these, please, know that you are in fora surprise and watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\n1) MC is too spineless and doesn't pick any of the girls because he doesn't want to hurt any feelings\\n\\n\r\n2) Girls are too spineless and none of them ever tell MC that they love him.\\n\\n\r\n3) The \"main\" (most likeable/developed) girl is the one that gets the least attention.\\n\\n\r\n############ The rest will spoil the romance, but not plot. ############\\n\\n\r\nThis anime casts off those stereotypes and presents a harem in a realistic way: All of the characters love MC, and they do their best to be honest with him and he does his best to be honest with everyone else. It's a true poly relationship, one that thrives by open communication and trust, and making sure that everyone is on equal footing and no one gets left out. To do this, the show also doesn't show a preference towards any particular girl because he doesn't have a \"childhood friend\" or anyone like that. All of the girls are new to him, and they all get to know each other together.\\n\\n\r\nI almost missed this gem because of what i typed above. It's nice to see a relationship that isn't immature, and people that actually realize what is at stake when you decide to fall in love with someone. This anime will obviously have another season, but even with the big question mark this first season brings, the relationship between the girls and the MC is truly satisfying.",

            "content": "This show is little more than ego masturbation and it plagiarises pretty heavily from Konosuba and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei in theme and concept.\r\nThe story could be summarised as \"what would happen if your fantasy came true and everything went your way\".\r\nThere was a pretty meta discourse in one of the Matrix movies where Neo meets \"The Architect\" (TA), wherein TA explains how an attempt to provide a perfect alternate reality to appease the human conscious in order to maintain the body by keeping it engaged was rejected by the psyche because it was so, to a lack of better words, unnatural.\r\nYou could be forgiventhen for having your suspension of disbelief fail you thanks to this completely unrelatable protagonist in anything other than the context of obviously pure fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off KonoSuba style in which a boy dies before his time, but is offered a reincarnation opportunity in recompense for what was apparently a mistake by God which caused said death.\\n\\n\r\nThe impossibly humble 15 year old is then given a reward for his humility in death (despite having achieved nothing) by allowing him to take anything he wants with him (also KonoSuba style). He, as the title of the series suggests, takes his (smart)phone with him. So what he really wanted was more of a tablet than a phone because he mostly uses it for its various \"apps\", especially since the only person he can phone is God himself who you would think by his very nature would find a phone redundant in light of abilities like telepathy or even omnipotence. He also gets a set of arbitrary enhanced abilities such as improved memory retention and combat based muscle memory that allows him to fight with no training. Just because.\\n\\n\r\nWhat unfolds later are a series of fortunate events in which money, women and all around general success are achieved with little to no effort. Resulting in what could otherwise have just been a wet dream were it not for the plot device played by God tying it all together. Which really makes \"God\" just an excuse to cut corners in writing. It was at this point i thought there was the potential for it to take a Log Horizon/No Game No Life approach of applying principles from his world like particle physics to develop technology/magical concepts through (re)innovation. But beyond his personal firearm and a few bicycles it's all very vacuous.\\n\\n\r\nThe world is fun, i suppose. If not incredibly superficial. Plus the complete lack of personality (or the eventual erasure of any personality that may have been hinted at) in the characters, beyond their expected tropal archetypes, really only fails to provide stimulation. Stimulation otherwise, one would think, relatively easily procured via making them individuals with their own desires, fears and ambitions (beyond \"i wanna do lewd things to the MC, if only he'd let me\").\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing the average nerd couldn't think of day dreaming away for 5 minutes. The characters are disappointingly shallow, even for a harem, the art is acceptable, if not dynamically challenged. The value of this shows entertainment can be concisely appraised on its services because that is literally all it provides. It does what it intended to set out, which is not very much at all beyond grasping at the lowest hanging fruit; appealing to the lowest common denominator.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fantasy RPG, alternate realities and ego trips and have a guilty pleasure often found in harem stories then you may find this a moderate way to pass the time. But you could do far better.",

If I had watched  Attack on titan, Fairy Tail, SAO, FMA and MHA before watching this (have still only watched two of the examples),  I would absolutely HATE this anime. So all you who has seen a bunch of BIG and popular anime series and movies, stay away from this one... or not :P\\n\\n\r\nThe point is, this is not a serious anime, it's not an anime based on story and dark emotions, it's pretty much a happy-go-lucky comedy-harem anime. And that's why I liked it. Serioustly, i'm a super emotional person, I cried through the final part of SAO 2 because of (SPOILER) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuuki... and I cried when I watched episode 4, 7, 11 and 12 of Death Parade... but this was a super good relief for me. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching SAO 2 break my heart into pieces, I needed something less serious, something solemly focusing on happyness, which is why I gave it a go (that and the fact that I browsed the ongoing shows in crunchyroll and clicked on this because it grabbed my attention with the incredibly silly title, which told me everything i needed to know) \\n\\n\r\nAnd, I liked it. from the first episode, when I saw what type of anime this is, with thhe main character being OP and all that. and I liked it. I liked the sillyness and unseriousness.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're new to anime and/or need some unserious and silly anime, you should give this one a go. it had me smiling all the way through, and laughing at some of the stupid stuff because of my weird humor.",

If they limited his power slightly he would have been more interesting. \r\nBUT! If you stick with this anime, and you learn to laugh at the ridiculousness instead of agonize how he fixes every problem instantly, it is a fun anime. Its funny to see Touya instantly kill 100 enemies, then heal 100 allies. They hardcore embrace the Harem anime theme fitting him to many wives at once, and its fun to see him get the attention of many cutegirls and dance around it. I definitely would rate this what I call a 'trashy anime', they wasted their chance to have him actually do interesting/clever things with his smartphone, but if you can get past caring about intelligence its \"fun\".",

            "content": "Well. This is definitely a weak anime, but I can't bring myself to give it a bad rating. It has some sort of a somewhat silly, naive and charming quality to it, despite its numerous failures and shortcomings.\r\nLong story short... it is a story about a completely overpowered protagonist that ends up in an isekai world after having an accident in normal life. The protagonist is a supreme Gary Stu, meaning he is pretty much perfect in every aspect and effortlessly solves any problem thrown at him, meanwhile getting involved with more and more girls. I think his Gary Stu power surpasses even that ofthe main character of Mahouka. As a result, the anime is often dull to watch, because something that could be a huge issue often ends up being effortlessly solved by toya (protagonsit) via convenient application of some power.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it is like watching someone play a game with god mode on and all cheats enabled. However... supporting, despite being realtively weak/cliched and fairly predictable have some charm to them, and if you treat the anime as some sort of relatively weakly done comedy, it works. Sorta. \\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown below.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10:\\n\r\nWell, the main character is a Gary Stu, meaning he is perfect and pretty much without any flaw. Aside from being awkward when interacting with girls, that is (at least he doesn't have glasses and isn't an otaku). Due to his superior power, there's no real conflict in the anime, because all situations are resolved effortlessly. I only saw a similar story in a Re:Monster manga, but toya is even more powerful. However, due to lack of real conflict or danger, the anime looks like some sort of relativley weak comedy with very tame attempts of fanservice. And I mean it that they're very tame - there's no actual nudity in anime, and in situations where it is implied, things usually cover character up. Basically... it is on the \"characters get shy over things like holding hands\" level. Lots of awkwardness, blushing, etc. The anime also fails to resolve the main storyline and ends with a promise of a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nFairly standard cookie-cutter art. Nothing special about it. Average through and through. Characters are okay, but there's no unique style there, and no great deal of detail, and no superior animation. It does the job, but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nSame applies to the sound. Nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10:\\n\r\nCharacters are predictable and  cliched. Toya is the worst, rarely displaying any real personality (aside of getting awkward when interacting with heroines), due to being \"perfect\". The heroines, however, have some charm/cuteness to them, but it is not kind  of charm where you like the characters, but rather watching an archetype you know well react in a way you can predict. Basically, if you watched a lot of stuff already, it coudl work. Hopefully that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 5/10\\n\r\nDespite the anime being weak, I did not hate it and did not feel like I wasted time watched it. It isn't great by any means, but there was some sort of appeal of watching something with no real danger in it, with people acting awkward all the time in a \"cliched anime teenager\" way, blushing, etc. Basically it works if you don't expect it to depict an adventure, and watch it like a silly comedy. Or something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nAnd because of it, I rate it 5/10. Having said that... I think that this anime doesn't offer much of interesting comment, and it is safe to skip it. You won't lose anything if you don't watch it. It has some value if you watch it to unwind, for small elements of comedy and a bit of silliness, but that's about it. It is not a masterpiece, and if you have some other stuff on your \"to watch\" list, the best idea would be to watch THAT instead. \\n\\n\r\nSo, this is a material you can safely skip and is not \"recommended to watch\".",

The main & support characters are awesome and nothing much to comment about. Also, regarding the sound, arts and enjoyment, it is totally a 10 as there were not many problems.\r\nDespite that, I think that the story should be more of where Mochizuki faces difficulty and we need more CUTE LITTLE CHIBI EMPERORS. A SEASON 2 is a MUST as it's the season that thingsgo UP and DOWN like in a roller coaster.",

But many of the conflicts that occur are very original. It may be difficult to understand, so summarizing: The conflict is original, but the way to get there is not.\r\nAlso, the way the character resolves the conflicts is very bland as the authorcould very well create a smarter resolution.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am not a critic of art, but for me, the animation was very well done, (although it would be better taken advantage of with scenes of action and struggle) But despite this, all animation appears in a '' smooth '' way\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are very good, and the songs that play during the scenes are also good, but they are not remarkable. Either way, the songs adapt to where they are applied.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved all the anime characters, seriously. Although I hated the ending in which {Spoiler to follow}: (all characters end up marrying the main character), the characters are still well built and have their own motivations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this anime, but it sure would have more fun if the conflicts had a better resolution.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I have repeated thousands of times, what is missing in this anime are just cool resolutions, in which the character does not solve everything with a single magic or something. The other characters should also have more function in the fights.",

            "content": "The premise of a character bringing a smartphone into a fantasy world was really interesting to me, but unfortunately this was a bit of a disappointment.\r\nThe main character is hugely overpowered. If you don't like characters who never really have to struggle to win then you will not enjoy this anime. In fact, the closest thing to genuine conflict the main character faces is him trying to decide how many wives he should have (hint: it's a lot).\r\nMost of the fights are resolved as quickly as possible, so \"the harem\" can continue being impressed while they stand on the sidelines and do nothing even thoughthey're all supposed to be capable fighters. A good portion of the fights are ended in an instant with the use of a single spell that was played for a gag in the beginning but just...kept...getting...used. Seriously, the main character has the ability to use any spell in existence, but most of the time he instantly wins most of his fights by making his enemies fall over. There are no spectacular fight scenes or visually stimulating battles, he just makes everyone fall over or uses his phone to instantly paralyse everyone in the area.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that the main character really has no character to speak of. Most of the time he's pretty unflappable, always doing the right thing and all the other characters love him but in reality he's incredibly unlikable. I can barely remember his name off the top of my head, having marathoned the entire first season just yesterday, and I definitely can't remember a single notable thing about his character. He has no interests or hobbies, no motivations or goals, no personality whatsoever.\\n\r\nThis goes for most of the other characters as well, although at least some of them get brief, fleeting moments of characterisation over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is the sheer number and size of the plot holes.There are multiple things that happen in the series that don't really have any explanation as to why they happen, and I found it hard to suspend my disbelief that most of the situations in the show would ever arise naturally. I mean, he setup for the series involves God being so apologetic for accidentally killing someone with lightning that he sends them to a fun new world, gives them amazing magical potential and let's them take any item from their old life with them. What about all the other people who die from natural disasters? Where are they? It feels like an exercise in wish fulfillment, where the author couldn't think of a reason for God to be so generous and just made up the first the thing they could think of.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of this pales in comparison to the biggest issue for me. Which is that, in an anime about a guy who takes his smartphone into another world, the main character hardly ever uses his phone as anything. He pretty much just uses it as a SatNav or a camera.\\n\r\nActually, that's not fair. I think I remember him playing games a few times.\\n\r\nStill, this was criminal for me. Considering the premise was what attracted me to the show, it was really disappointing that very little thought had been put into ways that a modern phone could be used in a pre-technology world.\\n\r\nNot only this, but when he does use the phone, it's in a completely alien and unrelatable way. Most of the time he uses the phone's maps app to cast spells. Occasionally he takes pictures of stuff or googles things. That's about it. There's never any mention of problems with signal, and the electricity problem is explained away as \"don't worry, you have magic for that\" (no, really). No mention of any of the other myriad of things that a phone can do that would appear like magic to someone in a technology-less, fantasy world - which seemed like a huge waste for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was very excited when I heard about this show and very disappointed when I'd actually seen it.",

            "content": "NOTE:  In this review I will be talking about the ANIME, not the manga or the LN. I only have some vague ideas as to how the story unfolds in the other media forms but not enough to be a certified expert on the content of the manga or LN. So my review is based solely upon my experience of watching the anime.\r\nIsekai wa Smarphone is a simple and easygoing fantasy adventure anime. It's not an anime of the year let alone anime of its season contender for me. It has its flaws but even in its flaws I still enjoyed the anime forwhat it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the story itself is your basic guy ends up dying in the real world and is resurrected again in another world, bringing with him only the clothes on his back and his smartphone. Now if people are familiar with the Isekai genre and have watched other series, you know exactly what you're getting into. For this anime, that's basically it. Story revolves around the adventures of our MC wandering about in this new world, making new friends and allies. Nothing too serious, no demon king needing to be defeated, no saving some princess or a kingdom under siege, just your typical dude ends up traveling in the world.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise there isn't much to see her. The animation itself looks uneven at places, with character models appearing uneven at times and assuming rather odd poses, such as the certain weird tilts of the faces and facial expressions seeing too static at times. To me the animation is reminiscent of early 2000s anime. The overall aesthetic of the fantasy world did help me to believe that the MC is living in another world, and to that I'll give the anime and its animators some credit. But the unevenness of some of the animations are a bit jarring and shocks me out of my suspension of disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound of the anime is generic at best. Your symphonic melodies when a fight scene happens, to the relaxing tones when the characters are walking around in the towns, to the character themes. Personally I enjoyed the piano theme of a certain character. Other than that the sound does convey the right moods at the right times, but don't expect anything too epic. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto characters. The MC himself is the fish out of water who with a kind heart and willing to help others when necessary. Apart from that good guy personality that he has, that's just basically the depth of his character. I don't seem him grow to be a braver or stronger character up to the series's end, but his simple good guy persona grew on me as the series went on. The other characters your basic fantasy trope characters, who unfortunately lost more of their personality except for some small bits here and there. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters I've seen only one character I really liked was the MC's main (the series seems to portray her as thus) love interest. You can see by her subtle motions and movements that she seems to genuinely love our MC. She constantly does her best in conveying her emotions to the main character and the concessions she makes for the sake of her beloved and the people around him made me admire the character that she had. In a show where the characters are cookie cutter bland some form of character in the show is better than none.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy this anime. Sure, story isn't as deep as the ocean, artwork is questionable and the characters showed little or no character at all but I enjoyed it for what it is. I found it to be a relaxing experience, of a guy who basically just ends up living a second life in a world filled with magic and monsters. \\n\\n\r\nJust because an anime isn't as grandiose as some other better well animated series out there doesnt make it any less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a very chill anime involving a protag in another world, then I suggest watching this anime. If you're looking for an anime with a meaningful story and deep characters than this anime isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I'd suggest it's worth a watch or two. I enjoyed the Isekai wa Smartphone for what it is, a simple anime of a guy living in another world.",

            "content": "(almost) every half-decent anime has a target audience. If you're bored to death of cliches and prefer a series in which stuff actually happens, then Isekai is not for you.\r\nAfter watching a few episodes, I thought what many probably would've thought, something along the lines of \"didn't I just see the same scene last week?\",\"what big eyes you have o.o\", \"terrible!\",\"reverse satire of konosuba!\",\"as flat as a 5 year old's chest\", etc...\r\nStrangely, this series was the only one from this season that I've finished so far, just from the sheer fact that it's such a relaxing watch.\r\nHalfway through, I threw out all my needs fora decent plot, I lost all care for whether or not it's just a cookiecutter fanservice anime or how one-dimensional the characters are and how it's just plain generic (you wouldn't think it's generic unless you watch a lot of anime anyway :P).\\n\\n\r\nHow easy the show was to pick up kept me coming back each week. There's almost no plot, suspense or conflict and it's just a slice-of-life-ish series set in another world where the mc, Touya, effortlessly beats up baddies and gets the girls. When you think about watching the next episode, you don't expect anything from it, thus you have no room for disappointment!\\n\r\nI found myself finishing each episode very relaxed, something I don't get when watching a suspenseful, actionpacked or meaningful series that irks me until the next episode comes out.\\n\r\nSomething happy & upbeat can be a very nice way to finish off a stressful day\\n\\n\r\nIsekai just what you think it is, nothing more, nothing less, no surprises. Just enjoy it for what it is - if you can't, why watch in the first place?\\n\r\nSo as a relaxing series, it's very good! Nothing to think about, yet with enough comedy to keep you barely awake (just how bad it is is funny enough sometimes)\\n\r\nAs an intelligent series with a meaningful plot, it's absolute trash and terribly executed.\\n\r\nGiven that, I'll give this a 6/10 (a lot of room for improvement but not bad!)\\n",

            "content": "You know when LA thinks of having a smartphone in another world, LA would think it would be easy...but NOT THIS EASY.\r\nTo be honest, LA had a lukewarm reception when it comes to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni., it's a non-conflict, piece of cake adventure with no stakes, harem hijinks we have seen over and over again and characters that are blander than plain bread on a white featureless plate with vanilla on top. Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. does everything in it's power to not try AT ALL and revels in giving us easy non-conflict conflicts for the sake of filling theepisode's quota. Does LA utterly hate this anime or is LA hiding something?...\\n\\n\r\nWell let's start with it's many flaws.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.'s characters are by in large stereotypes of many harem shows we've seen time and again, we have the main protagonist Touya Mochizuki who was reincarnated in another world where God tells him he can bring one item to another world (gee where has LA heard this before *cough* KonoSuba *cough*), he obviously brings his smartphone and his personality is the typical nice guy who's dense as a brick on par with Ichika Orimura. Touya is your wish fulfillment character bar none by the way, from the ability to learn EVERY element of magic in this another world, gathering a sizable harem by the anime's end, owning properties and even getting recognition from Kings of TWO Kingdoms, getting almost everything he wants sometimes unintentionally but he goes with the flow anyways and gathers the aforementioned harem in the process. LA is gonna say what LA has been feeling about Touya's character which is \"This is what happens when you give Subaru from ReZero the easy route with no deaths\", you want Subaru to NOT be a controversial asshole main protagonist who shakes up the plot well here ya go, have Touya instead!. Now what about the harem?..well we have Yae Kokonoe, the Japanese-eqsue lady who's in love with Touya, Leen a magical fairy who is interested in Touya and his magic, twins, Elize and Linze Silhoueska who first meet Touya and get him acquainted with his new world and are generally the older brutish older sister and the shy demeanored younger sister respectively and finally Yumina Urnea Belfast, a princess and Touya's bride to be as she becomes infatuated with Touya after helping her father/king...she's also 12. So yeah basic harem archetypes through and through and really, the characters are the LEAST of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. problems.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the \"skits\" this anime pulls. You'd think that Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. where it focuses on another world would have some attracting features to it...well not really as most of the skits falls flat from pure execution and lack of not trying. For one, there are a couple incidents where Touya creates things from his world which would be interesting for a setting like another world and all, it's the execution that fails in this, as such when Touya makes a bicycle because he wanted to, he makes them, but when Linze and Yumina sees it, they do question what it is, but then forgets it and tries to woo Touya by trying to ride a bike, the lack of execution was that what was suppose to be intrigue from characters from another world looking at new items from Touya's world, the focus becomes not about questioning what Touya is making and what it is, but instead trying to have a harem moment by having the majority of the cast trying to woo Touya over something as mundane as riding a bike, something similar also happens with shogi and a GUN of all things with the same deadpan unfocused reactions but the gun creation only works on the grounds that a medieval world having a gun is anachronistic and weird in general and for comparison, in ReZero LA would mention that something similar but better executed happens which actually involved a phone where Subaru was trading his fliptop phone to get an important item from someone and the trader was wondering what it is and was interested in it and wondered how it worked thus giving MUCH more interesting reactions compared to the incidents in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.  Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.'s skits tend to be on the fanservicey side of things as well, from slime monsters trying to tease up the harem members with Touya looking in glee to blatant beach episodes to the talk and showing of panties out of nowhere...yes a bit of fanservice is acceptable even for LA, but when it is this blatant and this forced on it becomes more eye-rolling than acceptably added into a scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe conflicts in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. is just soo not trying it's boring to watch, LA does find the notion of having a smartphone in another world to be interesting, however when having the smartphone is pressing the easy button time and time again from killing zombie armies in one fell swoop, killing a dragon in no time flat, to HELL why not tame TWO gods with a simple trick, it wears out it's welcome and gives easy access to the anime just not caring about the stakes at hand, it's rather more worried about the harem members blushing at Touya every chance they get and bicker at each other of them trying to push each other to confess to Touya.\\n\\n\r\nFor comparisons LA will even say that an anime that came out at the same time as Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. the \"isekai mecha anime\" Knight's & Magic main protagonist Ernesti goes through more conflicts that aren't easily resolved (besides mooks), he works HARD to get what he wants which uses the anime's central mecha element to his advantage in showing this and goes through hardships through loving what he does and even then Ernesti's rivals aren't just one hit kills or are easily taken care of before the episode ends in comparison to Touya who takes care of the threat in less than a minute and heck Ernesti's rivals even have a dynamic to him of having a different philosophy but same thinking as Ernesti, for Touya he doesn't even HAVE a rival or villain.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about the animation from Production Reed?...well although the character designs are exotic and fantasy based, once again because of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. just not caring about it's battles and stakes, the animation does as little as possible in terms of fighting. Sure there are some fighting here and there but even then it's limited. Production Reed also has many animation derps at times and even dips in quality for an anime already doing as little as possible and LA will mention this but the transitions that appears alot in this anime (you know the transitions with the golden flairs with animated chibi-fied characters doing an aftermath of a situation in question) though good for halfway eyecatches, Production Reed ABUSES this by trying to use as many transitions from each scene to the next and that causes both spatial and location problems ALOT in this anime. What does LA mean?...well because of the transitions meddling in many scenes it causes a disconnect to what area the characters are in and diverts the scene we were just shown for an even lower quality chibi-version of it not knowing what happened after besides the transitions giving the vaguest clue. It's just sloppy and messes with the spatial area the characters are as LA just cannot remembered that ohh yeah Touya owned a mansion, because the transitions showed so little of it LA had forgotten. Production Reed wanted as little effort to do with this anime and it showed.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is something LA will praise in some manner of it only in the form of Maaya Uchida and Marika Kouno as it felt like they did try to muster up what little they could from this anime and did it enough for LA to even recognize them. Maaya Uchida as Elize was LA's favourite character by default (and LA says this because again the entire harem doesn't have much personality besides being infatuated with Touya and some preset personalities) due to her brutish tsundere behaviour and Marika Kouno was good as Yumina as she was the competent one/the Momo Deviluke of the harem in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. though not Momo's devious side, but nonetheless good to see Marika Kouno again LA just wished it was in a better anime, also was it just LA or did LA find it funny that Sumire Uesaka was voicing the foreign chunnibyou character (Leen) in an anime where Maaya Uchida was voicing an aloof older sister archetype? (LA is referring to Anastasia and Ranko Kanzaki from The iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls as they swapped character roles in Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni.)\\n\\n\r\nThe finale?.....well what do ya know, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. actually got pretty good, it took them 11 episodes of almost nothing for them to get here, as although the anime was focused on the dynamic of Touya's harem as in the polygamy deal which Yumina instigated, it however fell flat by the end of it. But sparking the notion of it actually happening even in a harem is nearly unheard of (though To Love Ru Darkness is still did it first and better executed and interesting) thus got LA's interest and waned immediately from Touya's answer...but it got LA's interested. Was it enough for LA to watch through all 11 episodes to get to this point? NOPE.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. is by in large a poor man's version of an easy run of ReZero or a less funny KonoSuba with a smartphone, it's definitely not the worst anime LA has seen, definitely not as this anime was just boring and not much else, it hardly cares about it's isekai elements and it's harem elements are typical fair cept the one factor during the finale. Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. was hard to accept as a \"so bad it's good\" with no stakes, bland characters, plot that is given to the main protagonist instead of earned, harem hijinks we've seen time and again, low effort animation with decent voice acting here and there and ultimately it was in LA's worst anime of Summer 2017 because it's flaws just overwhelmingly outweighed it's strengths.",

Also I have a special power since I can watch anything because I will always compare it to School Days which is one of the worst things that I\u2019ve ever seen. Watching School Days is like being tortured by Ramsay from Game of Thrones. \r\nWell if I\u2019m being positive about Isekai wa Smartphone the animation is decent. That\u2019s it, watching the anime is like being in jail and get beaten up by inmates. Well let\u2019s start with the plot. The anime is about\u2018Touya being send to another world and he brings his freaking smartphone with him and he meets girls and they forma guild. This anime is really cringeworthy with a episode that has jelly fanservice to a pants vs swimsuit debate. The characters are so bland. Touya is so OP that it\u2019s boring and he\u2019s so freaking dense. The female characters are also bland I can\u2019t fully remember their name, but I know that the girl with kimono\u2019s name is Yae. The princess name is Yumine or Yumina something like that and it\u2019s lolli there\u2019s a kiss scene that involves her and she wants to get married with him together with the other girls and she\u2019s only FREAKING TWELVE!!! and then there\u2019s these Clannad sisters knockoff. Also there\u2019s one character that has a sudden personality change that comes right out of nowhere in episode 11 These girls have no real goal and personality other than they love MC and I hate that most animes the girls have no real goal other than they love MC. Clannad is a good example were the female characters have goals like to be a kindergarden teacher or do theatre and not just love MC. This also has a lot of fanserivice and the worst kind of fanservice which is cringeworthy fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard that this anime is a deconstruction of the isekai genre, but that gives it credit so no it\u2019s not a deconstruction of anything (also School Days is not a deconstruction of the romance genre because that would also give it credit). This anime is piece of garbage and it\u2019s the emoji movie of anime because this shows how lazy and not caring the anime industry is and it\u2019s the worst anime I\u2019ve seen from 2017.",

            "content": "When it comes to Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, I thought it was average and the definition of a very cliche anime. The story starts of like how many isekai stories do and then it becomes a lighthearted journey of Touya and his budding harem across this land. It's very easy for anime like this to be hit or miss and Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni falls more near the \"miss\" category. I think the main cause for this is that the attempts at comedy mostly end up failing making the show feeling bland at points.\r\nThe art and animation are slightly below astandard level. The soundtrack just like the story evokes that feeling that the anime is just very cliche although at the very least the soundtrack does make you feel you're in a fantasy setting.\\n\r\nThe characters are the same cut and dry stereotypes you'll see in any other harem anime. Not that there's anything necessarily too bad about that, it's just that they don't bring anything that's too interesting to the table as a result.\\n\r\nAs much as I have talked down the anime at this point, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni wasn't terrible and it was relatively easy to get through. Also I can commend the show for being one of the few harem anime that established it was going to go with a true harem ending.\\n\r\nIf someday a second season comes around I won't mind at least trying it out. Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni isn't a show I would really recommend but if you happen to have some free time to kill then this anime could be the fix for that.",

That does not save it from what I am about to dive into but it must be noted that there is a sort of captivating charm that surrounds this show.\r\nAnyways, the show's plot is pretty barebones. Dude \u201caccidentally\u201d gets killed by God. God moves kid to another world with his smartphone and just happens to make him attuned to all the different types of magic in the show. Kid eventually meets 4 other traveling companions (all female of course) and they go on various adventures. That's the main jist of the plot. There aresome other elements that get introduced later on but it would be kind of spoilerly to bring up. I'll list them at the bottom of the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with this show's plot is that it is so unapologetic with how generic it is showing its presentation. This will be brought up in all the other categories but for how it comes into play in the story element, the show just doesn't even attempt to go outside the box. The scene transitions? They are just gifs and/or screenshots with like 3 seconds of dialogue. Character development/interactions? MC does something then one or multiple girl(s) blush and fall in love with him even more. Don't get me started on (point #1 at the bottom of the review). Like come on this is the most pandering show I've seen in quite a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe show just comes off as a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d; yes there is a plot and yes things progress but there was no effort put in to make the show interesting or different than all the other isekai shows. Don't even get me started on the dialogue...\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4.3/10\\n\\n\r\nLiterally the most average animation and art I've seen in an anime. It's just...so plain that it's borderline offensive. Colors are bland, the meaning behind the colors are non-existent (colors can tell you a lot about character personalities, make scenes more interesting, ext), the characters models are uninspiring (so many of the main characters look like they were straight up ripped out of other anime), and the animation is as barebones as possible. In fact there are some moments where it literally looks like a slideshow. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMeh. I wasn't \u201cwowed\u201d with any of the music in this show. It sounded pretty uninspiring and by-the-books for a fantasy themed show. The miscellaneous sound design was much of the same; just bleh and uninspiring. At least it doesn't have the loud distorted sound effects that are present in Fate/Apocrypha...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are super bland and cookie-cutter. They don't even feel like real characters; maybe it is because the MC is so OP and because of that it ends up robbing the other characters of any sort of spotlight moments. Regardless, the other main characters are essentially cardboard cutouts that can blush. The only thing that I can is a positive about this cast is that because the writing is so bad, they, ironically, are actually funny in a decent amount of scenes. Like actually laughing coming out of my mouth because of how horrid their lines are. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the fact that they are all ok with (point #1 at the bottom of the review) really just makes the show even more uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is average. It is as bland as bland can be. Because of that, it also means the show isn't bad. If you want to waste some time watching bland tropes unfold in front of you, this is not that bad of a time sink. It's by far better than some of the other offerings from this year (cough cough Eromanga Sensei cough cough) so it has that going for it. Like I mentioned in at the beginning, there is a sort of charm within the series but it's not nearly enough to make up for the show's fault. It might however just keep you hanging around till the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers:\\n\\n\r\n(1) So...by the end of the show the MC gets proposed to by all 4 of his traveling companions. Not only that he is prophesied (by a character that can see the future) to eventually have 9 total wives. This is just pandering to an unfathomable level.",

            "content": "In nutshell, It was quite enjoyable in the mean of relaxing until the last 2 episodes.\r\nLet's list what we have in this anime first. An OP MC, A twin sisters, A samurai girls, a loli, a hundred years old loli.\r\nI enjoy the pace at the start admittedly, OP isekai MC gets the girls, moves to next adventure. They develop it in a pretty fast way without dragging. The MC is OP,  they don't prolong much of the fight just for the sake of it. After each episode, we get to see a new side of something. Even though frankly, there is nothing new tobe awe about, you can feel they also did not intend to introduce you to something 'new', but it is more like they briefly introduce their own world in a fast-pace-yet-relaxing-pace-style. It's the same magic fantasy you see out there, they tell you that without trying to make it more complicated than it should be. Therefore it only takes a short time, and we have the rest of screen time for our adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe adventure we have is also not something impressive but I also don't have problems with it -Sure there are flaws over the cliche encounter style, but it is something that can be forgiven due to how they treat it. It is merely a device to introduce something new 'briefly'. Briefly here is probably the keypoint that erases the cliche problem for me.\\n\\n\r\nYou can see all chicks start flocking to our MC, but as what it did is exploring its own world, I didn't feel bad about this development. For one reason, it didn't make the MC deal with their feeling just for the sake of resetting it back to status quo. We see the obvious love for the MC, we see how the girls play their little jealous game for MC attention, it's cliche but somehow still funny, and it never pushes the boundary of confronting the feeling, because, again, it's focusing on exploring its own world and their little game only sneaks in for a short time once in a while- at least for the first 10 episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows would have been a bit better without the last 2 episodes. It failed and did what it shouldn't have done. The straightforward story with no romance dragging is destroyed in the last 2 episodes. Because that is what it did. It is revolving around making a drama of romance and finally reset it back to status-quo. I thought this anime won't do this cheap reset-development, but alas, they did it, and it turned me off greatly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing impressive exists in this show, it also isn't bad due to its straightforwardness and focusing on what it is doing.",

Talking shit about SAO is overrated; just do it to the even lower hanging fruit. \r\nBesides that, the Character designs were done by \u514e\u585a\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8 (Usatsuka, Eiji), aka the illustrator of the Familiar of zero series; so they aren't bad. \r\nMusic is decent enough, then again the storymakes everything else seem great in comparison. \\n\r\nThe story is a cluster of convenience and void of any narrative stakes. The one thing the author did do right was foreshadowing. However, foreshadowing does not excuse extraordinary plot convenience. \\n\r\nThis show is bad, but do not let that ruin the enjoyment of this show for you.

As Amano Keita from Gamers! said, you can try your best to please everyone and include depth in what you make, or you can just throw a bunch of cliches together and make something that's incredibly fun. This is the latter. There is no merit to its plot, depth of character, and even the main character knows that he is way too OP. His harem doesn't even bother hiding their lack of surprise when something incredible happens. There is no struggle. More than an isekai series, this is slice oflife. \\n\\n\r\nIn all, this is incredibly fun to watch, especially if you have gone through a lot of other animes and you know all the stereotypes that exist in anime. Nothing phenomenal, and I'm surprised it even got funded. But I would say that's sort of its charm. This is not unlike cult-gathering films such as Napoleon Dynamite in how exaggerated the stereotypes are, and much like Napoleon Dynamite, I'm pretty sure this series won't be forgotten anytime soon.",

            "content": "Alright. I haven't written a review on an anime in so long but this one really caught my attention. \r\nDISCLAIMER- There may be spoilers up ahead, minor or major. So here's a heads's up. You can skip to the bottom to read my overall rating for this series. \r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni/ In another world with my smartphone \r\nThe whole premise of this series starts with Mochizuki, Touya. He dies right in the beginning of the series (reminds me of KonoSuba) But he was actually not meant to die at the moment. \r\nSo God/Kami spoke to his soul and offered Touya to beresurrected in a fantasy world. Touya accepts this offer. God also offered Touya to bring with him one item when going into this world. \\n\\n\r\nYou guessed it, he brought his phone with him. That, and an overpowered affinity for magic and combat. But hey, that's not unusual anymore. Let's be real. \\n\\n\r\nLet's go ahead and take this step-by-step, shall we? \\n\\n\r\nStory and Character- 6\\n\r\nHonestly, it's very similar to KonoSuba. The way the MC's die and are reincarnated into fantasy worlds. The differences are very few in between if we look at it. However, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni does have a bit serious vibe to it. Not /too/ serious, but it has a healthy mix of seriousness and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the things that do transpire, however, do seem to be cliche at times.  The character archetypes present are also the common ones we see. The MC is rather bland, though there are times where he does shine. \\n\\n\r\nIt is rather interesting to see Touya, being an entity from a technological civilization, interact with people are not very advanced as of yet. There are those funny moments where people see ice cream or bicycles for the first time and they are ecstatic about them. So I give this series points for that. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is hardcore going for that harem route. Why? Because apparently, in their world, having multiple partners is A-Okay. That seems to fix the whole \"you can only choose one of us\" thing that is common in harem anime. Everyone wins in this series. \\n\\n\r\nBut because of that, there won't be any interesting conflicts and character interactions since they'll all end up with the MC anyway. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound- 6\\n\r\nThe art style for Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is not the best, but not bad either. There are some times where the character's eyes are too close to each other, or his/her shoulder is too big than it supposedly is. But aside from that, it is very vibrant and they do have some attention to facial expressions. Good for them. \\n\\n\r\nThe VA's did a nice job for voicing the characters according to their archetypes. The shy one sounded shy. The tsundere sounded like a tsundere. I do not have any complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nI was not very attached to the OP and the ED of this series. It's neither good or bad. It's right in the middle for me. I do have this one gripe about the video, however. There is one sequence where the girls show off their power and stuff during the OP. During Yae's sequence, there was a lack of \"oomph\" to it. All the other girls looked powerful while Yae just ran at the enemy and.. slapped them? Yeah. That's kinda bs to me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment- 6.5/10\\n\r\nIf you're tired of the whole \"transported into a fantasy world\" plot, then maybe this series is not for you. But if you do take the time to watch it, it's surprisingly enjoyable despite the many cliche's found in it. Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is not a total waste of your time, guaranteed.",

Like... retro videos games (bare with me) the graphics were so basic, that your imagination made up detail that was missing. The characters here tap the same vein for me. This can only do so much of course when there's zero payoff but, hey: Tom never did eat Jerry.\r\nOn the upside(?),Main guy just straight uses his powers and fixes everything. I've nicknamed this show \"Jesus-kun iPhone\" It's a great example of wish fulfillment and how it can refreshing when everything doesn't return to status quo at the end of the episode. The main dude is an innocent griffith in disguise with how fast hes moving up the rungs in his new world.

            "content": "There are times when you have to ask the ultimate question: Why do I like this?\r\nIt follows every cliche and trope that you expect in this type of anime. It's more on the comical side of things, but not to gag anime level. The characters, the story lines, everything is just your basic trope anime.\r\nYet I find myself enjoying it. I don't know why, these are the things I'm normally 'meh' about. \r\nI do know one thing, and it's the fact that even though it's a comedy, it's jokes are more subdued than what you would expect from a comedy anime. To me that isa good thing, I'm not really into over the top comedy. I like some, but those are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I have no clue as to why I find enjoyment in this particular anime. This is the type of anime my sister would love, but I never pegged it to be one I would like.\\n\\n\r\nIs it a good anime. No, it's just average. Will I defend it in any sort of way. Psh, no way. Trash it all you want. Will I re-watch it any time in the distant future............. um, no I don't think so. As I've said comedy anime, even ones I think are really good, aren't my cup of tea. Plus this anime really has nothing to it, an okay watch but that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all.... this is just odd. I can't even think of it as a guilty pleasure like some of my other shows. Why do I enjoy this?!?\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: Okay, I've been wanting to do a follow-up for awhile now, but I only had one episode left at that time so I wanted to wait and finish (just to make sure nothing I said was nullified by the last ep).\\n\\n\r\nSo before anything else I have to say ........ the novelty of it has worn thin. As I have stated before, I don't care for the harem/ecchi type anime. There are certain peeves I have that they tend to bring in spades (example- girl's skirt gets blown up by the wind, yet the boy gets called a pervert even though he had no control of what happened). This anime starts heading to that but stops short of it, which is something I am grateful for. But at the same time.... it doesn't stop. Every episode has some sort of ecchi (close to being called a perv) moment, and honestly it's getting tiring.\\n\\n\r\n{It may seem I'm going off topic but it connects} This reminds me of a book I read a long time ago. It gave me the sense that it was a self-publish book, it had a few errors. Not spelling errors, rather the way certain sentences were structured was odd. The first time I noticed was on a sentence that I spent a good amount of time re-reading both it and the paragraph, just to figure out what it was saying. It wasn't bad, just one or two odd sentences, but as I continued these errors became more and more noticeable. It got to the point where I had to stop reading it because it was starting to really get on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the same. The ecchi moments were okay when I started the show, but as it went on..... it was the same thing over and over and over and over, till I almost wish it went completely into my peeves just so I could've dropped it sooner (almost). \\n\\n\r\nBefore anyone asks: the reason I did continue, well there are a few reasons. First- while I did realize that I wasn't enjoying it like at the start, I only noticed it annoyed me after episode 11 (I can be slow for certain things), and when I figured that out it made me ponder the series as a whole. Which made me come to the realization that the story was nothing but fluff, and all the jokes were just the same one-trick-pony.\\n\r\nSecond- I was curious about the white-haired, red-eyed boy in the opening. I figured he wouldn't have a big part, seeing that he only appeared in the last episode, but I still was curious enough to stay. [spoiler: he doesn't show up till the very end, after the end credits]\\n\\n\r\nIf the impossible happens, and this gets a second series you can bet that I will NOT be seeing it. I am done with this show. Completely through with it.\\n\r\nOver and out!",

The female characters are pratically the same in terms of personality, the main guy is just... the best way to describe him is \"Kirito made in china\". The art style is very lazy and poor aswell as the animation especially during action scenes. The plot is extremely bland, like one of those old animes for kids except its made to look like its not really for kids. Theres pretty much no main plot, no goal for the character to do which makes the show even more lacking. Andthe only satisfying thing about the show is how OP the main character is, the only reason to even watch this \"thing\".",

            "content": "This anime series is bad.  I won't beat around the bush it's down right terrible.  As a whole.  It has some good points.  Mainly the visuals and sound but that doesn't make a series complete.  Vincent van Gogh could paint an actual turd and it's still just a turd and Mozart could have written the music to Friday and it would still be a crappy song.  Anyway, after witnessing 6 episodes so far here's my views...  (spoilers of course)\r\nStory:  1\r\nIt's a bland story that has been done better.  Guy dies and is reborn in a magicalworld.  But even how he died is boring.  God accidentally killed him cause he was tossing lightning in a field he thought was empty...  Yup,  that's the origin of the story.  Impressed yet?  Neither was I.\\n\\n\r\nSo he dies and is able to take anything he wants.  So he take his smartphone...  and somehow it works in this mysterious world with no issues...  no power, no cell network, etc...  maps work, he's able to view peoples locations on it despite them not having a gps tracking device at all...  it just works however he wants.  \"how does he keep it powered?\" you might be asking...  he learns magic that can charge it...  and speaking of magic.\\n\\n\r\nSo in this world people can learn magic.  There are elemental magic like fire and lightning but also something called null magic.  Which is magic developed by single people pretty much over a lifetime which only the people you created it are able to use.  Well guess what?  MC can use ALL the magic.   ALL OF IT.  Making him basically a god in this world which leads him to have no real obstacles in this new world as of yet.  Guy even took down a dragon and was able to summon a god level animal companion on his first attempt...\\n\\n\r\nArt:  8\\n\r\nThe art is well done.  It's bright and colourful and the character designs, though lazy, are well done.  No real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nLike the art it's well done.  Voice actors are on par, music and sounds effects work.  These two fields are where the show shines.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  2\\n\r\nThey may be drawn well but good god are they bland and one dimensional.  MC is OP and clueless to the people around him.  The female characters have all fallen in love with the MC and pine over him.  It's just bleh all over.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  10\\n\r\nThis is the twist to my review.  I am honestly enjoying it.  Not because it's good but because of how bad it is.  It's so bad I can't look away.  I want to see how they can top how OP the MC is in the next episode.  Like I mentioned earlier one episode has him summoning an animal companion with yet another magic he learned and he summons a god level creature on his first time.  \"Oh my god this is ridiculous there is no way this can get any worse.\"  Cut to the next episode where the MC takes down a black dragon.  \"well, I thought it couldn't get more ridiculous but here we are again.\"  \\n\\n\r\nThis show is a train wreck.  But it's a train wreck that was full of fireworks so you definitely don't want to look away despite the carnage surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nJust the average score of the different categories.  Like I said,  this anime is bad.  It's terrible but it's so terrible it's enjoyable to watch for that fact alone.",

One thing I've never seen in another anime, the hippie God... Yeha, a hippie God.... \r\nEverything on this is perfect in a bad way, the main character solve any problem easily....You see a dyingperson, but you don't even care because you know that the protagonist will save him effortlessly. The protagonist has full power. And so far, hasnt even hinted at a villain at his level\\n\r\nI could handle the first episodes, but after that ....Jesus christ..... It just boring in a new level....The heroines have no history, the protagonist doesn't have one too.... Oh, I can say a lot of deffects, but let's go to the next one...\\n\\n\r\nArt - Well... the art is acceptable, this anime copy exerything of others animes, so they catch the beautiful characters and just put in this...\\n\\n\r\nSound - Ordinary, I don't like to talk about the audio.... so lets go ahead.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Ordin..... nooooooooooo, isin't the ordinary ones, is the worses ones... It's just a cover of Kirito with a white mantle and a lot of girls around him... Oh God why this Kirito is so boring? He don't have any own personality,he accepts everything easily, even if they tell him that he died... He don't care about himself and your family.... just about his smartphone...\\n\r\nThe heroines are all the same, I cant even remember their names so dull they are... they only have a beautiful design... but otherwise...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Im watching this when I dont care much for defects... I just watch to see the big harem at the end.... I can be better to you if you havent watched many animes, but for me its very boring.... Is even the same.... sometimes I like to wacth a cliche one, so this anime is exactly for those times. So if I want to watch a cliche this anime is perfect, if I dont want, this is very boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverral - I hope he gets better in the next episodes.This anime is not at all bad, but the cliche in excess is boring to see ... I want to see more action and moments of suspense, not the protagonist save everything without effort... If you do not mind the cliche and a more serious story ... this anime can please you...\\n\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the mistakes in this review, especially in writing, since I am a beginner in English and I still use the Google Translator... Sorry about that...",

            "content": "I think it's early to give this show a verdict. Because it is currently only consist of 4 episode out of 12 episode. But it isn't to early to judge this anime based on 3 episodes rules of watching anime. This is my summary according 1st to 4th currently airing episode. \r\nI think Isekai wa Smartphone is an isekai anime 101. Mc reborn to another world check, mc got unique power or something check, bunch of cute girl check, adventure check, magic power check, guild check, a medieval European look alike check. Everything is presented within the anime. \r\nSo what make this isekai anime differentthan the other? Well the MC got a smartphone. Thats the difference. Is that bad? I say nope. It can be good if the MC really using the Smartphone other than usual smartphone. Like using magic base skill using smartphone. That will really emphasis the name isekai wa smartphone to tomo ni. \\n\\n\r\nIts an isekai show with fun lighthearted adventure. But lacking to use the basic premise the show had to begin with. To me thats the biggest drawback this series have.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5 (average) \\n\\n\r\nI think average is the best to sum the story Isekai wa Smartphone to tomo ni current airing story. Its an average isekai show eith little tweak here and there. If you like isekai show. I recommends to watch the series. If not i thinks you can skip this anime to watch other Good show currently airing. \\n\\n\r\nArt : 6 (fair) \\n\\n\r\nIsekai wa smartphone isn't ugly. Its like run on the mill art with cute girl and pleasant art to watch. Although sometimes its a bit clunky but overall the art is a pass to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 5 (average) \\n\\n\r\nThe music this show present really isn't that remarkable. Of you came for the music i think other show easily surpass this one. The only think this show is good to me is the voice acting. They have enough cute voices actress without being to annoying. The way they have conversations really easy to grasp. Even if you aren't to familiar with Japanese language. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 5 (average) \\n\\n\r\nThe main character isn't that phenomenal. Its just an average guy with mild mannered nature. But the girls have distinct personality from each other and its cute without being sound too annoying. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 5 (average) \\n\\n\r\nIt really is a normal isekai show. Its not to serious but not too goofy. Some arc is good but something it fails to give us a good storytelling. I think that have to do with this show being one cour. To me the first episode skip some story detail about the world building this show had. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5 (average) \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show really is different. But the lack use of the smartphone really make this show isn't that differ than any of the isekai show that came before. I really like the show because its lighearted nature. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the final verdict. I will be back when the show 12th episode came. :)  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Minor spoilers included.\r\nIf you're looking for an isekai / another world anime for pure fun and relaxation without that rollercoaster of feelings, then this might just be for you.\r\nIsekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni is an anime that's a level-down version from other known isekai anime, such as Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!. \r\nInstead of having an eccentric MC that you follow, meet a Kirito look-alike whose calm enough not to freak out that he met God and he died without any curiosity whatsoever. The premise of the story is to live ina new world, yet he asks for a smartphone to have connections with his old one. Stupid? Well, that's what makes this anime different from the others. It gives you an 'if' scenario, what would happen if I bring my phone in another world? \\n\\n\r\nFollowing the trope of isekai anime, he gets an overwhelming power that no one else can have. Having power that's needed at the right time. The usual Kirito stuff. SAO + Kono Suba.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, it will not be completed without a harem. The OP is obviously a series of girls that the MC will meet and most likely, join him on his quest to.. live in the new world with his smartphone that's not really as important as the show says.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is a generic, \"Japanese person\" with morals, humble, helps others, and calm. He's not that dense, yet there are times that he will show it. He doesn't show a sense of goal, and is simply riding the wind as the saying goes. It's hilarious how easy it is to predict what's gonna happen next on this anime. Even more so, it's funny how every episode, a part of his new abilities are shown and overwhelms everyone else, and that ability is needed at that same time. Like everything is going right with him around. \\n\\n\r\nHer harem has once again, generic personalities. Nothing too much revealed as of the moment, but they're just there to support the MC.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an anime that its fine to forget or never watch at all, as you won't lose anything significant or impactful to the anime world. You watch this anime because it's plain entertaining. You want the MC to be powerful, has a lot of girls with him, stable enough not to go crazy, and for him to win. A simple anime for entertainment.",

But nothing good..\r\nThe only enjoyment I can get out of this is to compare it to Konosuba. Because this is how KonoSuba would have been if the MC didn't pick the useless goddess. Then I laugh at how much easier the MC in this has it compared to Kazuma. \r\nI'm pretty sure it was intentional to be this bland. Probably an experiment to see how bland they can make stuff or just a quick money grab for better anime.\r\nIf youlike projecting yourself into shoes of MCs and want them to be OP badasses then you might enjoy this. Or if you like things that are bland.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Free Review]\r\nWarning: I'm not a professional reviewer, so this is a loosely typed, informal review.\r\nI'll be honest, I like watching bad shows and finding the redeeming qualities of them. For example, Big Order. That show was destroyed by critics, but me, I thoroughly enjoyed the show. The main character's power was desirable, useful, and cool. Touya Mochizuki's smartphone, however, is not, which I will get into later in the review. Isekai wa Smartphone is easily one of the worst bad shows out there, and it is extremely difficult to find a redeeming quality in it.\r\nThe story of Isekai wa Smartphone is nothing extraordinary. It'sabout a guy who is killed and transported to another world, and God said he could have one thing and he chose his smartphone. This is normal for an anime of the isekai subgenre. The part where it gets a bit fishy is when it's revealed that not only can his smartphone function normally and never run out of battery, but he has a high affinity with every elemental magic in the new world, as well as null magic (the concept of null magic is confusing too, by the way). He has no restrictions on his powers whatsoever, and every obstacle he comes across in the show is overcame without effort. The story is utterly atrocious. The girls are introduced too fast, some plotlines are dragged out for way too long, and some unnecessary things are thrown in by the creators in an obvious attempt to prolong the plotline, or liven up the show when it gets boring, and it gets boring a lot. Near the end of the show, I began fastforwarding (only about 5 seconds or so until the dialogue was over. Calm down, reader, I still partially paid attention) through their more predictable conversations. I also drifted off near the end of one of the episodes, and instead of rewinding to see what I missed, I just kept watching the show, certain that whatever I missed wasn't important (I was right). To wrap this up, I can't imagine what the creators were thinking when they decided to make this story the way it is. Touya has no end goal to reach, he just spawns in an unknown world, quickly establishes himself as one of the strongest in the world, and badda bing badda boom, end of the anime. Oops, I think I just spoiled the nonexistent plot of the show. Please forgive me.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the art. The art is one of the better things in the show, but it gets very annoying at times. There is waaaaaaay too many chibi transitions between scenes. There's AT LEAST 5 per episode, and no, I'm not over exaggerating. The animators really didn't feel like just cutting to the next scene, there always had to be a chibi transition. It could be something as simple as stepping into a portal. Animation. Everyone assembling in a room? Animation. Walking in the town? Animation. Sleeping? Animation. Meeting someone new? Animation. You get the point. Other than the chibi animations, there was nothing special about the colors used. The world does however always stay bright, and to a certain extent, the characters each have their own unique look. \\n\\n\r\nNext comes the sound. I don't really care about sound effects that much, so sound for me translates into how good the opening and ending theme are. Sound is easily a 1 for me. The opening is your generic anime opening, the song is not interesting at all. Even the animation is generic. Since there is not a lot of action and fighting in the show, the fighting scenes shown are overdramatized, and an eyesore to look at. As for the ending, I've listened to it once or twice. Out of 12 episodes, I've had the strength to listen to it once or twice. Because of this, I can't say much about it other than it's appalling.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters. I won't spend a ton of time on this because I don't really care for the characters. None of them get the slightest bit of backstory other than Yae, the samurai girl. Not even our protagonist, Touya, gets a backstory. What the hell, creators? None of the girls even got close to asking, \"So, Touya, what was your life like before I met you and fell in love with you in the same day?\" So for the whole show we know nothing more about Touya other than he's Japanese, cool, smart, dense, handsome, and has a smartphone. After being transported to the world, he never once wonders whats going on back at home, how his mother is doing, or anything of the sort. Touya's smartphone is also a dumb \"power\", by the way. He doesn't actually start utilizing it until the middle of the show, and even then he finally fully takes advantage of it near the end of the show. The smartphone being what Touya brought with him seems more like the author did less thinking it through and more time thinking about how to resonate with the current generation of teens. Moving on to the girls, the girls (save Yae) follow Touya's introduction pattern as well. They're introduced briefly, maybe a sad or relatable story, then they join the harem and voila, you've got yourself a generic character. Personally, my favorite girl is the princess. I do have a problem with how similar she looks with Sushie (nice name btw), who's her little sister, I think. I really don't know, Isekai wa Smartphone's kingdoms sound similar, look similar, and their royal families are similar. Another character who I have a problem with is the homeless girl Touya recruited for his mansion staff around episode 9 or 10. WE'RE 3/4 DONE WITH THE SHOW, DO WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER CHARACTER? I can't even remember her name, that's how irrelevant she was. I was expecting her to be the daughter of a noble family, or the princess of an enemy kingdom, but no, she legit serves no purpose whatsoever in the plot of the show. I'm pretty sure I commented on this back in the story section of this review too, how some events are completely meaningful and just exist to waste our precious time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment... 5. Yes, a five. Pretty shocking, considering how I just picked and picked at the show for multiple paragraphs. I can't lie, however, I did enjoy the show just a tiny bit. It was amusing yelling at the characters to make a move or to not do something. It was enjoyable trying to predict when Touya would use \"Overpowered Moves #9 and #13\", also known as \"Slip\" and \"Aport\". The show did make me laugh with it's jokes at times, and the various cast of characters livened it up enough to never make it too boring. That's pretty much all I found enjoyable about this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show gets a 1. I am a man of odd tastes. I like watching bad shows, but this show, I wish I had never watched this show. My life would have been better off not knowing this show existed. The show was so bad, I had to crawl out of review retirement (I made a couple of reviews in the past for shows I liked or disliked) to conceive this review and warn you, the reader, not to read this review. Even though it's been nearly two years since the show first aired and I'm very late with this review, the show still should not be watched. Even if no one reads my review of this show, I am just happy I've been able to possibly warn you in the future to not watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're legit still thinking of watching it even after hearing me say all of this bad stuff about it, godspeed, brave one.",

The MC was entirely too OP and vastly overshadowed every single other character in the series - And that's saying a lot, considering my shadow has more depth than the MC. Probably would've enjoyed it a bit more if MC and/or the harem had some individuality but they all tended to blend together. Also would've liked to have seen the MC show a hint of effort and development, but alas that's too much to ask for from this genre.\r\nIt horrifies me that a story with such lack of effort, on part of the plot, as well as the overall depths of each character,could find it's way to becoming an animated series.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully, this will be the final and last they animate for this series.",

            "content": "Horrible.\r\nThe  good point to this story is their artwork. Beautiful art. Much appreciated. Love the heteromacia \r\nIsekai wa smartphone to tomo ni. Is a story about a guy who accidentally got killed by god. And god gave him a chance to be reincarnated in a world of magic with his smartphone. Got a harem. The end.\r\nTop 3 Genre I love : Isekai. Harem/ Reverse Harem. Overpowered MC.\r\nAnd somehow this show can destroy everything.\r\nI officially rated 2 but for the review I rated 1.\r\nI'm going to talk about why I found it horrible by genre.\r\nOver powered MC\r\nLife comes easy for the boy. Literally sooo easy.God grant him the ability to use magic. He can use all spell in existence. There's no point in worrying whether the characters is going to win or lose in the battle. All he have to do Is cast one spell and he won. In every fricking match.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC isn't like one punch man. Yes one punch man can kill someone with a punch woot woot. But one punch man is a comedy show and talks about his road to becoming a pro hero. The MC has nothing to do other then work and earn money while being so kind. This show however despite putting comedy on genre has nothing funny in at least one episode. It's a very dry show and it get worse as episode come.\\n\\n\r\nThis time I won't compare the MC to One Punch man a show to shounen. I will compare it to Death March. Very similar in genre. It shows Harem.  Over power MC and Isekai. With no romance. But at least the MC has some motivation in life and uses his mind. I would like to explain death march more but this isn't the right place.\\n\\n\r\nNext. Harem\\n\\n\r\nOh look girls everywhere I look at. Oh look this guy I was trying to save turn out to be a girl. Oh look that guy wearing a Cape is actually a girl. Girls everywhere. You won't even be surprise if the king say he's a girl.\\n\r\nIt's normal for harem shows to depict more girls then guys. And reverse harem to depict more guys then girls in the Anime. Just like the infamous SAO. But can't that guy at least be in the same room with another guy for a whole ep? Can't he? I'm not asking him to be alone with a guy. But every scene you will se a girl and I'm bored of it. And I'm bisexual.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly, Isekai.\\n\r\nUrgh. This show seriously manage to reach a new low for me. I have never hated Isekai plots before. And that says a lot with all the books I'm reading is Isekai. If theres a Isekai drama sign me up. But this show only logic for Isekai is that he can't be Reborn to his original world but he could in another world because of his friends and family. But he could use his smartphone? Though its only to search and such. Most Isekai doesn't explain how they ended up there and i guess I prefer it like that.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how action isn't under this genre. Cause even with all the 'fights' it's just seems like a bad play. It seems like they add some fight seems to try an attempt to label it as action\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters. \\n\r\nLet talk about the main male characters first. His overpower aside. The story first start about the MC wanting to follow his grandfather saying about be kind or something. But his grandfather is just a useless character. He is already nice fron the start. If he wasn't he should at least have some anger moment or something like he was a gangster in his past life and such. But none. \\n\r\n Trying to be seen as pervert while not being seen as a pervert. Sure surrounded by girls of all shapes and sizes. Most guy would get horny... Maybe can't say for other guys right?. It seems like the MC is a pervert to see but not to touch. ESPECIALLY when he have the permission to. \\n\r\nWhat I mean Is. He would dream of the girls clothe less. And stare at them in their swim suit. But the moment the girls ask him to kiss and touch them he be acting like I'm not a pervert. Like alright he is portray as a closet pervert but? If he dreams of it. And get the permission. He be hesitant until the girl force him by blackmail or puppy eyes to kiss them? Really?. Then he be acting like he has no choice while doing the deed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHow many main female characters nah let me phrase is how many female characters are there in this world? 1. Just one maybe two. Though some or most of you might disagree with me when I say that.\\n\r\nEvery girl looks unique. Different size breast included. But in this show they are the same.  They have no other personality. They behave the same way. Like the writer open a cloning personality factory. All the girls behave the  same you would have thought they are siblings. All the girls acted weak and embarrassed. Some from the start. Some midway. Some at the end. \\n\r\nAnd all pushy. Their only uniqness is the way they look. If you close your eyes you could barely or none to see any difference in characters. True some are feisty but it's not one. It 2 or 3. When you figure there's a new character you will realise ahh they match. They are from the same factory . The girl who acted wise but again weak and embarrassed. There's 2 or 3 of them. Oh the girl that acted strong before becoming weak. Ah they match. \\n\\n\r\nThen you see this one girl. Wow surprise the biggest shock of the show. She is interested in another guy and they are about to date. \\n\\n\r\nThis show taught me how to get a harem is just to say 'you're cute' and ' I like you' just by saying this two words you are going to marry 9 girls. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo that concludes. Weak plot. Weak characters. Weak characters development. Strong MC and beautiful art. \\n",

The Isekais have had a bad reputation since their recent overexploitation.\r\nTechnical work is nothing special, and in fact you could say it is bad. The series moves with the typical archetypes of an isekai and is flooded by flat characters, starting with the same protagonist who is there only for the viewer to automatically insert himself into the story. The series is not content with putting us in the typical escapist situation in which a person leaves their life and is trapped in a world of video games (without worryingabout their situation), but also puts us in romantic situations with all the girls. And as if that was not enough ... (Spoiler Alert) marries everyone!\\n\\n\r\nThe end forces a false emotional crisis in the protagonist only to decide to stay with everyone without having done anything to win the hearts of these sexualized cardboard girls. It is clear to what he wants to appeal this series and how low he has to fall to keep alive the fantasy of the most depraved otakus. One of the worst series I've seen.",

            "content": "I'll get it out of the way right now: This show sucks. \r\nThe most basic problem this show has is that none of the characters have a personality. The main character is a Mary Sue of the highest order. He's good at everything, and is basically an RPG game character that has been hacked at the start of the game and has had his level and all his stats maxed out to beyond the point that natural leveling would allow.\r\nToma pretty much skates through the show. There's nothing that is a threat to him and he never fails at anything, he is insufferably nice, andhas no real flaws. There is no problem he can't immediately solve, no consequences for his actions, and no conflict he can't resolve alone. He's boring and uninteresting. His only flaw is the typical density that prevents him from noticing how others feel about him.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls all have a cute design, but are pretty much a hive mind. None of them have a distinctive personality that separates them from each other. They largely exist to look cute and praise the MC for how awesome he is.\\n\\n\r\nThe show wants to run on moe, but the fanservice is tepid, and the girls lack of personality makes that fall flat. It also fails on the comedy front, going more for cute. What jokes there are don't really hold up well enough to make up for what it lacks in personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both decent, but nothing special. The OPs and EDs are generic, but passable. However, there are issues where the music in the show is out of place for the tone or overpowers a scene when it shouldn't.\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything redeeming about this show, it's not lewd enough to work as a fanservice driven show, not funny enough for the comedy to carry it, and lacks character development or personality.\\n\\n\r\nDon't bother with this, it's not worth your time. The only reason I finished it is because I had started watching it later in the day and didn't want to start something new that late in the evening. Avoid, there are better isekai shows to spend your time with.",

            "content": "\"To rate an anime appalling requires that a show goes past offensive, and into a world of its own. It is a rating reserved for shows that revel in how terrible they are. These are the masterpieces of disgusting; the types of work that fail so spectacularly that these failures are discussed in hushed whispers for years to come.\"\r\nI don't rate a show with a score of appalling just for being bad. To reach this lofty rating a show must go above and beyond what I consider terrible. It must truly love the things it does wrong. \"In Another World With My Smartphone\" does exactlythat, and with a gusto that is rare to witness.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen bad anime before. I have seen truly horrible anime before. I have seen series that ignore all that we have learned over the years about storytelling, pacing, world building, strong characters, and an engaging plot, in favor of clich\u00e9s, stereotypes, inexistent plot progression, and caricatures posing as characters. What I have never seen in a series is the utterly glee that this show projects while committing some of the worst sins of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progressed we were treated time and again to more and more evidence that this was not a mistake. To me all the evidence suggests that this show was not a result of someone simply being bad at telling a story, but a conscious decision to ignore they key elements of storytelling to create the ultimate piece of filler media. This was a show that was extremely good at taking all that it takes to make a good story, and throwing it into a wood chipper.\\n\\n\r\nI will recommend this show to exactly one type of viewer. The one that wants to see the worst of the worst. The one that is genuinely curious about the depth that may be reached, not by a series that simply doesn't suit a person's taste, but by a series that genuinely tries to explore how much people will tolerate if it's presented in a shiny enough package.\\n\\n\r\nThere may be others that might somehow find enjoyment in the self-insertion level characters, the utterly contrived situations, the near godlike power of the main character, superseded only by a denseness that would make even of the most obtuse anime characters that have graced our screen stop and say, \"Dude, what is wrong with you?\" Maybe this might appeal someone that has never watched a single anime, movie, tv show, nor never read a book, or even a short story. This review is not for those people, because that is not a perspective that I can put myself in. Instead, this is for the ones that are genuinely saddened that a show like this can be made, and that it can merit a score above the one I give it.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this anime appalling, 1 / 10. Read on to find out why.\\n\\n\r\n--- Story ---\\n\\n\r\nHumanity, as a species has had a long history with storytelling. We have studied the art of stories, which we have told for as long as we have had language, dating back to ancient days of small tribes resting around camp fires after a long day of hunting and foraging. Throughout this time, we have figured out what makes a story interesting, memorable, and engaging. We have described and understood the concept of narrative arcs, and archetypes, we have identified the critical elements of world building, and characterization, we have defined thousands upon thousands of tropes that appear again and again.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does not care about any of that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story can be summed up with one sentence. A guy gets everything he wants with no downsides. The formula for any conflict is as follows: there is an issue, so the main character pulls a new power out of his ass to resolve it. Is someone dying from injury or poison? Magical healing spell that cures anything. Need to be somewhere in a rush? Magical teleportation spell that goes anywhere you've seen. Need to go somewhere you've never seen? Magical mind reading spell to see a place from a person's memory. Need to destroy an army of enemy soldiers without collateral damage? Magical fuckin pin-point WMD.\\n\\n\r\nAt no point is there a crisis of any sort, or even the risk that there might be a crisis building. Every problem introduced is resolved within minutes of appearance, without an ounce of struggle, character growth, or any semblance of an obstacle. Any potential long-term complication that is even remotely hinted turns out to be a non-starter through a contrived resolution within the same episode. Need some money for survival? Sell some clothes for a small fortune. Need a place to live? Get a mansion with a butler and a few maids just because. Can't decide between a love interest? No problem, they all get along, and have actively been working together to form a harem. \\n\\n\r\nSurely there must be some saving graces here. Perhaps the world that the characters occupy has some sort of redeeming qualities? Sadly, that's not to be either. The setting is the most generic magical world possible, distilled down to the basest of qualities. There are castles and kings, there are people with animal ears, there is elemental magic, there is a floating island. It is the starting point for any RPG set in a magical world. However, that's where the series draws the line. There is next to no politics. All the inhabitants of this world are all perfectly happy with their place in life. There are a few monsters, but little more than the trash you would experience at the beginning of any JRPG ever.\\n\\n\r\nFailing all of those, at least some common anime tropes must be played out to good effect, right? Not so, dear reader. This anime even fails at exhibiting the more entertaining tropes of the genre. There was the potential to offer some commentary, or parody in the style of KonoSuba, but all the events and characters are played perfectly straight. There was the potential to have some wacky, ecchi hijinks in the style of To Love Ru, but would demand at least some level of romantic rivalry and hillarious misunderstanding to arise. Failing all that, from the beginning there was the potential inherent in the very damn title of the anime, the Smartphone. Surely something could be played around the idea of introducing a wholly new, unheard of technology to this magical world. Sadly, the phone is little more than a prop; it's an excuse for giving the main character a minimap, access to recipes, and the ability to track anyone anywhere. Every other character just accepts it as magic, and there dies that idea.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, even the most slow-paced examples of the healing, fluffy, slice-of-life genre has more happening that this anime. This series maintains the story pacing of a piece of fan fiction written by a bored 7th grade middle school student during math class.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does that leave this anime? In place of a narrative arc, we have a flat line of constant minimal tension, with occasional feeble attempts to pretend to have a conflict which fizzle out almost immediate. Instead of a setting we have a generic magical world where nothing is happening. We don't get challenge or a crisis, or even a villain. We just have a guy with nearly godlike coming to terms with the fact that he's ok with having a harem. That's not a story, that's a joke played at the expense of the viewers. Worse, towards the end the show nearly breaks the fourth wall to suggest that this was all intentional, and for that I give the story a 1 / 10.\\n\\n\r\n--- Characters ---\\n\\n\r\nI suppose the best I can say about the characters in the series is that they exist. There's nothing to really differentiate one character from another, save an occasional vocal quirk, and their outward appearance. Given the utter absence of conflict in the show, it should not come as much surprise that character growth is wholly absent from the equation. The characters we get at the beginning are identical to the characters that we see at the end. Absent any growth, the characters must stand on their own innate complexity. Unfortunately, there is none to be found.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in the series can be described by two or three adjectives, which in turn reveals every element of their personality. The main character is nice, and intelligent, but socially inept. Girl A is shy and quiet. Girl B is forward but dumb. Girl C is direct but reserved. Girl D is outgoing and clever. This goes on and on for every character in the series. Any one of these characters placed into any event will behave in accordance to their characteristics, and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also nothing happening in terms of the relationships that exist among these characters. Early in the series all the main female characters agree that they want nothing more than to be a harem for the protagonist, which excludes any sort of romantic rivalry before it even has a chance to build. Meanwhile, the main character remains blissfully unaware of all this development until confronted with it in the last episode, at which point we are treated to a few scenes of him dreading the difficult decision of accepting his utterly willing harem, before accepting it as the best way forward.\\n\\n\r\nAfter taking all that into account, what are we left with? Well, there are characters... At least the story was breathtakingly bad, but the characters are just... There. A feature of an otherwise horrid anime, not even worth the lowest possible rating, a 2 / 10.\\n\\n\r\n--- Art ---\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least the visuals are not horrible at first glance. It is certainly not stellar, but the characters have fairly distinct costumes, the character colors are bright and vivid, and there is some consideration of lighting and composition.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that is where my praise for this aspect of the show ends. Any motion is slow and jerky, like it's missing half the key frames that would pass minimal muster. Outside of action scenes there is very little motion. Walking loops are lone, and involve the same static drawings bobbing up and down, with an occasional change in expression. Forget small details like flowing cloth, hair shifting in the wind, or idle motions. Even action scenes are utterly minimalistic, with little movement and a bunch of exposition between each motion.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are largely a bust. Most backgrounds are minimalist designs; walls, hallways, brick walls, green blobs passing for trees, or even just single-color panels. Anything more complex, such as towns and cities gets the minimalist treatment, with basic shapes, and single shade color palette. Even the scenes meant to show a large vista barely get a passing grade.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the CG stands completely out of place. It adds very little to the overall visual effect of the series, and just serves to remind that the animation around it is jerky by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, it's obvious that the show had next to no budget, and tried to cut corners everywhere it could. I'm being very generous when giving the art a 5 / 10. \\n\\n\r\n--- Sound ---\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest pet peeves in anime is the abuse of music. I'm of the opinion that music should heighten the experience of an anime. It should highlight emotional states, foreshadow events, and guide the mood of the viewers. It should not just fill a lack of background sounds, which is what this series does. \\n\\n\r\nThe music here just blatantly emphasizes the events happening on screen. If a scene is tense, the music sill be discordant. A peaceful scene will have some calm chords on a violin, guitar, or piano. Silly scenes will be light and flighty, while action scenes will have a powerful, epic orchestra. It is music that adds nothing to the experience, and just highlights the events that are happening.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least the voice actors seem to treat this seriously, for the most part. Character emotions come across quite clearly, and the voices seem well suited to the character designs. I can't judge beyond that, simply because the lack of powerful story moments means that we rarely got to see the characters put into situations that would require extensive mastery on the part of the actors. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the sound design is actually decent, though again not particularly special. Actions that clearly require sound effects get them, and the sounds seem to reflect the characteristics you would expect from the environment within which they occur. There are background loops in places that you would absolutely expect it, but nowhere else; while you'll hear stock banter in the city, birds chirping in a garden, or footsteps from people walking, there won't be any wind rustling leaves, water dripping from ceilings. Not that you'd be able to hear any of these things given how often the music cuts in to remind you of the intended mood.\\n\\n\r\nIn recognition of the genuine hard work put in by the voice actors and sound engineers I will rate the sound as the best aspect of the series at 6 / 10. \\n\\n\r\n--- Enjoyment ---\\n\\n\r\nReading everything above you would think I did not enjoy the show, and you would be correct to a degree. This show was a trial to watch as an anime that takes itself seriously. However, I did not drop it like I normally would when it comes to a series this bad. The reason is simple, this show does things so wrong that I simply cannot recognize it as an accident.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, I actually found entertainment in guessing how \"In Another World With My Smartphone\" would disappoint me next. The simple fact that I could never guess what trope, rule of storytelling, or archetype it would mutilate next kept me coming back for more. I cannot deny this experience, so while I did not enjoy the anime as a story, I will still rate my enjoyment of it at 5 / 10 for keeping me guessing.\\n",

If only the creators had developed this premise instead of turning him into an OP magic weilder with a harem of overdeveloped 12 year old girls.... All of which really has NOTHING to do with his smartphone. Even his smartphone becomes magical hocus pocus, not that he needs it AT ALL, given he is easily the most powerful being on this world.\r\nThis show is everything I hate about theharem genre: Slapstick jokes and a pedophile's dream. Like a bad porno, the story is just filler for the boob-shots.\\n\\n\r\nHere's how the show should have developed: A bright geeky teenager with NO magical powers is transplanted to a magical world with only his smartphone, magicked to work, which he uses at first to survive, then to strive, and finally to thrive. With his seemingly endless supply of revolutionary new ideas, Kings and Princesses alike are charmed by him. This despite the fact that, unlike practically every one else in this world, he has no magical talent. Along the way he will meet magically gifted people who can make his ideas reality using their magical crafts. To the baker who gave him bread when he was starving, he teaches a method to make fine white flour. To the alchemist, he shows how to make something gold plated. And on and on... the power of modern civilization is mixed with ancient magic to create something new.\\n\\n\r\nOh well :(\\n",

The best way to describe this show is that it is the equivalent to anime junk food. If you want another Isekai harem that's easy to watch without thinking that has a fast pace and an OP protagonist, then try this anime. There's nothing special about the animation or sound or anything and comes out mediocre but somehow is still quite enjoyable.\r\nThe best way I can describe itis, remember back in the old PS2/Xbox days when cheats in video games were a thing? remember when you would turn on moon gravity in Tony Hawk games, or the weapon cheat in GTA Vice City, or the Big Daddy in Age of Empire, or Big Head mode in NFL Blitz.. Remember that feeling of being Over Powered and steam rolling the game and having fun? If you enjoy that kind of feeling then this anime is right for you.",
