            "content": "I'm quite surprised that no one's actually written a review for this yet. \r\nI have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expect from this show. The synopsis didn't really give any clues as to what I should expect, and that is probably the best thing about it - it isn't quite what you expect.\r\nThe story takes place on what used to be Mars (the first thing I didn't expect), in a place called Neo-Venzia (New Venice), and is about a girl training to be an Undine (the story uses the term to refer to a female gondolier rather than a water spirit). Thestory itself isn't linear in any way, as each episode is a story in it's own right. Normally this is a recipe for disaster in the anime world, but it works in this show - I'll explain why in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are of a very high standard, and the city and it's surroundings are beautifully rendered - and you will see a lot of the city in this show. The characters are very well depicted, even when they show their chibi side, and the best bit is there's not a panty shot in sight - hooray!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one area where this show excels. Everything is there if you listen, from the sound of the waves to the hubbub of of a crowd. The music is ideally suited to the show and, unlike many anime, actually heightens the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely well realised. I can't think of one character I actually disliked in the entire show. One of the things I liked about the show was how each character actually fits into the story, and the world in which they exist - even the cats have a purpose. One of the other things I liked was the use of fairytale and mythological creatures in the show. The females gondoliers are referred to as Undines, with the top three being called the Great Fairies. The weather is controlled by salamanders, the gravity is controlled by gnomes, etc. One thing that puzzled me was why the female characters names begin with A (except Grandma, however her real name is Akino), but that's by-the-by.\\n\\n\r\nSo the important question is: Will you enjoy the show? \\n\\n\r\nIf you're an action junkie, or into horror or angst, then this is not the show for you (although it never hurts to give it a try). This show is funny and quirky in many ways, without going over the top, but the one word I would use to describe the show is RELAX. It took me two weeks to finish this show and it's sequel (which is a long time for me by the way), and this is because this show is so relaxing that I was falling asleep whilst watching it. Normally it takes a lot for me to fall asleep, and even boredom doesn't work, but somehow this show just relaxes you to the point where you just drift off to dreamland without a second thought, and never once was I bored with this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a show that deserves to be watched, as it has a unique appeal that the like's of Sketchbook ~full colour'S~ and Kokoro Toshokan just can't quite match up to. The reason why the non-linear story works well in this show is because it's so relaxing that you honestly just don't care about the fact there's no real plot - which is a rather refreshing perspective to have.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to watch the show? Have a shower, have a good meal, get comfortable, and relax...",

            "content": "I stumbled upon Aria years ago when reading a review about the manga and made a mental note to check it out later. Positively drawn in by Kozue Amano's original work, I soon picked up the anime as well. For a reason I still can't recall I dropped the show nearly three years ago, and it wasn't until just recently that I finished what I started back then. And though not much had changed for either better or worse from what I remembered, I'm glad I did so.\r\nAria the Animation is not for you, who prefers a clear cut and classically constructed storyline that movesfrom point A to point B with some key events in between. Aria the Animation is not for you, who requires relentless action and constant fast-paced happenings from their anime. And most certainly Aria the Animation is not for you, who finds little to no enjoyment in just sitting back and watching as a close-knit group of girls, not in their bra and panties with guns ablaze, but with their gondolas and oars go through ordinary day-to-day activities instead of epic adventures and intense situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut on the good chance you are the type to approach your anime with an open mind and the patience to watch and see the magic in the moment, you are likely to find the company of Akari, Aika, Alice, and the rest of the undines and undines-in-training much to your liking. Because that's what Aria the Animation is ultimately about: a journey to uncover the joy of the obvious, the excitement behind the mundane, and the possibilities underneath the sorrows. \\n\\n\r\nThese scenarios are played out to us by a cast of characters who depict a variety of different personalities. Akari is the naive amateur who treats all she experiences with childlike wonder; through her most of the show's message is brought across to the viewer. . Aika is her best friend and almost her exact opposite: no-nonsense and feet firmly on the ground-kind of girl who constantly berates Akari for her dreamy ways. And Alicia is their mentor and the big sister-type of character, who's there to provide insight and help the juniors along the way. They're surrounded by a pack of friends who similarly have their quirks and qualities defining them and making their role contributing to what the creator is trying to tell us.\\n\\n\r\nYou're right if you argue that the story is boring and seemingly pointless at times. Saying the characters being archetypes of their respective personalities (and almost exclusively female as well!) is cliche and overused is valid. Complaining that having cats as business company presidents is just plain stupid and ridiculous is justified.\\n\\n\r\nBut as one who no doubt has already seen quite a bit of anime in their life, you have for sure come across these common failings before. And in case you've reached the point of having made peace with them, or feel like challenging yourself to do so, Aria the Animation may prove to be an eye-opening experience for you that anime can be good even if no heavens are pierced.",

I gave it about 6 episodes to get good but nothing.\r\nStory - Um... what story? This show is a show about nothing, and not in the funny Seinfeld way. Nothing really happens from what I saw. Each episode has some type of strife occur, but there is no antagonist or villain of the sort. I'm kind of confused as to why it is so beloved. But to be fair youmight want to give Aria a try, I just happen to dislike it with a vengeance. \\n\\n\r\nArt - A modern anime using modern technology and techniques, so nothing to complain about. It manages to live up to the current status quo, but fails to do anything amazing or innovative.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Ehh... very laid back and mediocre. Fits the anime well, but doesn't float my boat. If you like the action music or romantic comedy type music, don't expect much watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Everyone had the same personality. Well, to be more accurate, they had the same personality with slight variations for each character. All generally nice, good, people who are definitely getting a thumbs up from the man upstairs.\\n\\n\r\nI am a fan of Action-Adventure and Romantic-Comedies for the most part, yet I severely dislike this show. So if you like these animes you may not like this show, but I might just be weird and dislike Aria.",

            "content": "\"May this town's kindness reach the hearts of many people...\"\r\nFrom what I saw, I'm sure it will. \r\nThe first idea I wanted to share in this review is that Aria is a series that speaks for itself. What I'm doing here is merely trying to explain a complex story within a few lines. I would never be able to summarize all the pros/cons of Aria, first because each person will see it in a deferent way, and second because you would need to watch it in order to understand all the comparisons, metaphores and symbolism I would mention. \r\nThat said, I'm reviewing it with thesole purpose of bringing more viewers for this amazing chronicle and hopefully introduce more and more people to Aqua and its habitants. \\n\r\nAria is an anime that everybody should watch, still, it's not an anime that will work for everybody. Whether or not you will enjoy it, is up to you, your personal interpretation and the mood of the moment. I would say that what matters the most is the timing. If you watch it while in the mood for a thriller, you'll drop it even before understanding the idea of the story.\\n\\n\r\n\"Now, please take my hand\"\\n\r\nIs what you would heard from a radiant Undiine while boarding her gondola. With a gentle smile she would gracefully ask you where to and start conducing you trought Neo-Venezia, a city modeled after Venezia in Man-Home (Earth). She would show you turistic spots and you'd start to notice that even being in 2053 the city moves slowly, without traffic jams, rush hour, polution, cellphones, noise pollution... The only evidences that you are really in the XXII century would be the spaceships that are continually transporting passangers from one planet to another. This relaxed athmosphere would start to embrace you while the Undiine continue to show you wonders and misteries from this planet that were once dry and empty and is now filled with water and life. \\n\r\nIt's impossible to not enjoy such cozy enviroment.\\n\r\nEvery episode is a kind of fairy tale, filled with cultural values and a sense of friendship, always coming up with a poetic moral in the end. Aria stands out from the average and prove us that the essence of the Slice-Of-Life is not dead. Characters can be lovely and elegant without being \"moe\". All the great stories in human history never needed movies or TV series to be remembered, they passed from generation to generation depending only in the power of words and its storyteller. Aria didn't have a high budget, neither big sponsors, so the quality of the animation could never be compared to a \"top\" studio, even though, the artwork values itself from this modest simplicity, that even with a medium quality, brings you gorgeous scenarios and handsome characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point you probably already noticed that Aria raise some questions a regular slice-of-life doesn't. This is only possible because of two main reasons: The already mentioned storyline progression, that works with a character-driven story and a \"not-so-linear\" time progression, and the well said characters. \\n\r\nUsually what you see is a cast made of a group of high schoolers in a school enviroment, 99% of the slice-of-life stories are like this. Not saying they are bad, but it only provides a unilateral point of view from a given subject. Of course each character, if well planned, will have a difference in personality and see things in a different way, otherwise it would get boring to watch. Aria on the other hand change things in a \"macro\" way, and brings a entire community as characters. Works with different generations and people with the most different styles of life and personality traces, bringing to you a much more rich story  that resemble our lifes.\\n\\n\r\nIt stays apparent whenever or not a studio made an effort to create something special when one of the basic points of a series steals the show. Financial issues or other external factors can put a \"barrier\" to graphics, effects, art, post-production development, but sound is relatively free from it. Music can be made by anyone, anywhere. Anonymous people can create masterpieces, and some kid can be playing right now a perfect cover of Beethoven. Why am I saying this?\\n\r\nBecause Aria's music deserve to be praised. Wonderful acoustic pieces by Choro Club and Senoo was the perfect match for the enviroment of the series. The entire OST is performed with string instruments (even a rhodes) without any kind of pop song or eletronic. The songs are slow paced, almost hitting a andante and sometimes a vivace, while the vocal collection are mostly ballads. It's undoubtedly the best choice of OST for a story with the values of Aria. \\n\r\nCan you fell the nostalgia already?\\n\\n\r\nAria made something special here. \\n\r\nI wish not enter in the merit of originality but it is perceptible that after its publication, lots of other franchises started producing series which bended more to this side of a philosophical slice-of-life with tones of self-discovery on it. One could say the strenght of this series lies into two major standards. The fact that we all wish for hapiness and a calm life, and the philosophic notion that this happiness and this ability to see the wonder in things is already inside of us. You just need to find it.\\n\r\nBeing honest, I don't really mind that Aria is little of a underrated series. If it's like this, the amount of haters are minimal, there's no controversy around it, neither people arguing to see \"which is the best character\". The way it is, Aria will continue to be slowly recommended from friends to friends, just like in the pace of the anime itself. \\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, it sure hits the maximum score. Without any action scene or a suddenly twists in the plot, Aria still managed to amuse me every single episode. There's no way I would watch one episode and don't feel refreshed, all warm and fuzzy inside. Meaning-of-life anime? This is definitely one.\\n\r\nI probably went full-philosophic in the last paragraphs, then for a closure to this review, a funny observation:\\n\r\nAria is not perfect. There's something pretty annoying on it, that will chase you from the 1st episode to the last of the 3rd season (...) 99% of the characters' names and/or last names starts with \"A\". Aqua, Aria, Akari, Alice, Alicia, Aika, Akira, Athena, Ai, Al, Anna, Akatsuki...\\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to memorize who is who before you get used to them!\\n\\n\r\nI hope I was able to introduce at least a little bit of this great story that is Aria. Now, the rest is up to you.\\n\r\n\"Thank you for choosing Aria Company. Have a safe trip! See you again!\"",

            "content": "Is Aria a good series? Probably. Does it deserve to be held up as a masterpiece? I doubt it. \r\nAria tends to be hyped up as *the* epitome of slice-of-life, so I expected an anime with all the strong points of the genre, including fleshed-out, relatable characters. Aria fails in that respect, and that compromises the amount of enjoyment I can derive from this series as a slice-of-life fan who has no specific interest in cute girls doing cute things.\r\nWhat I object to isn't the fact that the cast is female-dominated, though more gender balance would have been nice. [The first half of Haibane Renmei,for instance, is an example of an anime with a mostly-female cast that rises above the \"cute girls do cute things\" formula, and manages to have some characters (not all, admittedly) with depth.] What I object to is the use of generic character traits and catchphrases as a substitute for actual characterisation. There's the sweet ditzy one, the feisty one, the -_- one, the sweet onee-san type... The characters are generally likeable - they're just not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMy other main issue with Aria is that it is heavy-handed and mawkish. Other iyashikei series like Natsume Yuujinchou and YKK manage to be heartwarming without being horribly unsubtle, and have variations in mood and tone as well. For most of the series, Aria's mood setting is stuck on \"painfully sweet\". Conflicts are always easily resolved, and the characters cheerfully spout trite platitudes for at least half of each episode. The first time we get an episode with any sense of wistfulness or melancholy is episode 11, and that's far too late in the series.\\n\\n\r\n(President Aria also came across as annoying rather than cute, partly due to the irritating noises that he made.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for technical issues: For the most part, Aria manages to look beautiful despite having occasionally clunky animation and slightly jarring CGI. This is partly because its backgrounds are largely copies of actual Venice (only a lot less crowded with tourists, lol), but there's some great art direction as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pleasant and well-suited to the gentle tone of the anime, but not outstanding. If you have a low tolerance for cutesy, unrealistic voice acting, this isn't the best series for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're happy watching a sweet and fluffy iyashikei series, this will suit you fine; but if you prefer something that has depth, is nuanced, and has a gently melancholic mood, you're not going to find those elements in Aria.",

            "content": "Slice of life anime are difficult to represent to audiences in an entertaining manner without being a boring spectacle; that's why most of these have dramatic or romantic elements, or a lot of fanservice in them in order to be appealing to the viewer. But then there is Aria: The Animation, a slice of life in its purest form, that proves that such type of anime doesn't need any of the above to be succesful. Having dived in without any expectations whatsoever, I was pleasantly surprised: it was proven how wonderful and relaxing such a simple anime can be.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe premise of Aria: The Animation isof simple nature: Akari Mizunashi, a teenager who moved from Manhome to the planet Aqua (formerly known as Mars), joins the Aria Company to become a professional Undine - or a professional tour guide - in Neo Venezia, a flawless presentation of Venezia itself. This may seem as something totally uninteresting, learning how to become a undine, yet while it certainly is an aspect of importance, its main focus lies in the interactions with the people in the city, in addition to world building of the location.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect is the fact that it is a planet covered in water and while it gives the impression at first of being a simplistic and somewhat regressed humanity technologically wise, it is for the matter not: it is mixed with futuristic vehicles and devices such as gigantic airships, or flying machinery, whereas everyday tools are simple, which gives the viewer a feeling of attachment to the setting itself, as this may be something that would happen in the near future. Now it must be said that not much of the world and how it came to be is revealed, which will maybe be done in the sequels.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story focuses on the different interactions with the people of Neo Venezia, and naturally fellow apprentice undines, as well as professional ones. It doesn't stop there: world building is done through the different, but intricate people of the city necessary to maintain a working society. Audiences may think that this anime has the approach of \"cute girls doing cute things\", yet with Aria it doesn't give this impression at all: they're just humans living their everyday life. These interactions are truly fascinating and heartwarming to watch, as it is in addition very relaxing as it also represents the ups and down life has. \\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Aria: The Animation is not big, and is by no means necessary; in fact, it fits well with the story to have a better and more realistic fleshing out of a handful of characters, than to have an excess of those. It must be mentioned that the fleshing out is limited and nothing outstanding, as well as character development itself. The characters are simple and have distinct personalities, that fits well with the setting and different relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat however stands out in Aria are the character interactions: these are very well presented, in a realistic and soothing manner. These are heartwarming and varied, nothing overly dramatic, which relay simple messages as enjoyment of the simple things of life, or realization of your own flaws through your environment and relationships with the characters. Which leads to other great aspect of the anime: the females are in no way sexualized, which is a huge plus to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspect that was really soothing and amusing to watch were said interactions: these were often witty and funny that managed to make me smile, and sometimes even blurt out quite often, which was something unexpected. These can be in addition quite emotional as well, as viewers observe how some of the characters are affected by their environment. What also struck me was the fact that the anime didn't seem to focus on Akari, rather her friends and companions as well.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Aria: The Animation (ha, animation) was well done, character movements being fluid, at times even being surprisingly well done. The art style itself is average, but fulfills its purpose well, having distinct character design and well drawn backgrounds that represented well the world and atmosphere the anime was trying to convey to the viewer. Another bonus is the smooth transition between the introduction and opening of the show, as well as the ending: it never felt an abrupt change.\\n\\n\r\nWhat however really stands out is the soundtrack used: besides the wonderful opening and ending songs that matched well with the story, were the individual OST's used. These were particularly of high quality to what the show was trying to convey, in addition to not being overused throughout the show. The voice actors performed their role well, matching well with the personalities of the characters and was relaxing to listen at.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nWhat I initially thought to be a boring show about Venezia and how to become a undine, proved to be so much more interesting and relaxing than ever expected. The narrative and interactions with the characters, the humor and wonderful OST did a fantastic job to have a wonderful experience. The fact that it was no \"cute girls doing cute things\" type of show, in addition to females not being sexualized in any manner, was a huge bonus to the show. It certainly lacked in character development and having any type of story which I usually am no fan of, however the story set out what it meant to do.\\n\\n\r\nSome may wonder why I only gave it a score of only 8 despite all the positive things I mentioned in the review: this is mainly because nothing really happens, it is purely oriented on slice of life with no goal apparent. World building was a bit lackluster as well. I could recommend to anyone with an interest in the slice of life genre, just don't expect anything groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Aria the Animation is not an anime for everybody. It's perceived as boring to many people, which is understandable. There is little action here and the plot is somewhat slow and aimless. There's also little moe compared to other slice-of-life anime. I should also mention as this IS set in a utopian society, there won\u2019t be nearly as many sad emotions as happy ones, so those looking for a realistic anime should also not expect to find it here; Aria is blissful if nothing else. However, if you are in the mood to watch something relaxing and heartwarming, Aria the Animation would be a perfectchoice.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting takes place in the Utopian society of Neo Venezia, in the planet of Aqua, a terraformed planet filled with water. Though it does take place in the future and is classified as \u201csci-fi,\u201d Neo-Venezia often feels like more of a past, halycon world. It centers on Akari and her friends Aika and Alice as they set out on their journey in becoming prima-undines, the greatest undines (or tour guides) in the region. \\n\r\nThe overall plot is not linear though trio do have a goal in mind (becoming prima-undines), it is not the prime focus of the anime. Rather, each episode is its own adventure, and by this I do not mean the kind of adventure like a hero\u2019s quest to slay the evil dragon.  Instead, it is the adventure of Akari discovering the wonders of Neo-Venezia that are yet to be found. She meets new friends and experiences the many joys of friendship and the love of those close to her. Through its loveable characters and serene and idyllic environment, Aria the Animation manages to transform things usually mundane and perfunctory into something heartwarming and beautiful. Each episode leaves behind a warm, fuzzy (and inexplicable) feeling in your heart. Some also leave a hint of sadness as the trio realize that their lives currently filled with euphoria will not last forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Aria the Animation are all likeable and fit perfectly in the anime, adding to its lovely atmosphere.  All the characters start their name with \u201cA,\u201d though I\u2019m not entirely sure why. Though the characters are likeable, they lack relative depth (and little character development) and stick to their portrayed characters (to some people, to a repetitive extent). However, I feel as if this isn\u2019t too bad of a thing, as Aria the Animation stands out for its simplicity and the characters add to that unique trait. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Aria the Animation was captivating, and was a considerable factor in what made Aria the Animation\u2019s atmosphere so magnificent. The portrayals of the city and background were beautiful throughout. The amount of detail was consistently impressive, which is paramount to creating the impression that Neo-Venezia is a real place. In fact, the team in charge of creating Aria and its art traveled to Venice in order to create the most accurate depiction as possible; needless to say, they succeeded. Though there were some chibis here and there, the characters were generally nicely designed. And praise the lord, no moe in sight. \\n\\n\r\nA little downside to Aria\u2019s art is that it\u2019s not in high definition (at least not yet, perhaps the Blu-Ray will change that). And while this lack of video quality is limiting, it never prevents Aria from creating the vivid landscapes and magnificent spectacles that Aria is well known for. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was amazing as well, and it blends well with the anime. The background music added to certain scenes helped maximize its effect to the fullest extent, and each piece of the OST was aesthetically astounding. The sound is one of the most astounding parts of the anime, and are of utmost importance in creating its atmosphere. The OP and ED were just some of the amazing songs, and after finishing Aria the Animation I would recommend checking out the rest of the album as well. \u201cRainbow,\u201d in particular, is one of my favorite songs I have ever encountered in any anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of Neo-Venezia itself plays a fundamental role in Aria. As previously mentioned, the detail of the surrounding environment bring life to the picture, and the decoration of buildings and scenery in the background bring Neo-Venezia a sense of place. One of Akari\u2019s greatest joys is learning more about the wonders of Neo-Venezia. As the audience, we follow her in her quest of knowledge, as we visit new places and meet new people throughout the episodes, we begin putting together the picture of Neo-Venezia. By the end of the trilogy, Neo-Venezia is nothing short of a fully fleshed-out world, leaving behind a certain touch of sadness as we experience the dreamy world one last time. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, it is through its atmosphere that Aria works its magic. The result of a perfect combination of the plot, the setting, and the audiovisuals, the atmosphere of Aria makes it what it is. Aria is almost always cheerful and uplifting, warming the heart to its very core. Yet it is also calm and relaxing, evoking a sense of tranquility. This atmosphere is the inner core of Aria, but it is also what makes it a hit or miss series. You really have to \u201cfeel\u201d the atmosphere of Aria to enjoy it, and as this is the case, Aria often comes off as soporific to those who don't feel the same.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation was an amazing anime, and I greatly enjoyed it. I recommend it to those who enjoyed Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou or any slice of life fanatic. With its lovely character crew, stunning audiovisuals, and blissful and relaxed atmosphere, Aria the Animation gives you a feeling of contentment and tranquility.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, don't expect to be at the edge of your seat in every episode, because you won't be. Rather, sit back and relax, as you slowly drift into the world of Neo-Venezia...\\n\\n\r\nI decided to end this review with a song that, while trite, I felt encapsulated Aria:\\n\\n\r\n\"Row, row, row your boat,\\n\r\ngently down the stream.\\n\r\nMerrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,\\n\r\nlife is but a dream!\"\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nThe story is unique, in my book. I mean, who thinks of making a slice of life on Mars. That's just really original and awesome. The episodes are slowpaced and deal with the daily lives of the undines, small discoveries, new friends and so on, all of it executed in a fine manner. Still, it was a little too slow sometimes.\r\nAnimation\r\nOverall I thought it was good. Nice colours, and good character designs. And the many shots of Aqua were nice. But I still got a feeling it wasn't perfect. I guess it could have been more detailed, specially the people and their faces. But itwas pleasant still.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis is just great, there is some soothing background music nearly all the time, and it gets you really relaxed. The opening and ending themes are also nice songs, that I never skipped. There are also a lot of insert songs, and when the undine Athena sings, it's just lovely. The voiceactors are great too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI liked the characters. No doubt about it. The undines were especially great, they were so diverse, and not to forget; funny. My favourite is Akari, the heroine, there are so many things about her that are memorable, and how she behaves with the other undines is hilarious. Aika and Alice are really funny as well, and the three fairies. I must say that the sidecharacters are good too, heck even the cats, even though I found them a bit irritating at first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nDue to the show's slow pace, it took some time for me to get into it. But when I did, I liked it a lot. It's really relaxing to watch, with no action or drama, and such. Compared to most of the western media, this is really refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nA very good show, about daily life. Not much happening, but still great. If you want something different, watch this, and you're in for something good.\\n\\n\r\n9 / 10",

            "content": "The past has always been a concept of fascination and longing, sometimes even to the point of obsession. One only has to read Scot Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" or J.D. Salinger's \"The catcher in the Rye\" to see wonderful examples of stories and characters obsessed with time and living in the ostensibly golden world of the past. Humans are very guilty of this crime, we constantly refer to the good old days, we flock to ruins and ancient cities as we believe them to have an almost magical quality, we invariably ignore the words of George Orwell who once said \"contrary to popular belief thepast was not more eventful than the present\". It would seem to me that this love of the past is as ubiquitous as love itself, and so it should come as no surprise to find it alive and well in the anime world\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nAria may be a series set centuries in the future, but its heart is very much in the past, be it in its setting, its customs, its outlook or its characters. But before we get into that, a quick summary of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation is the first season of the highly acclaimed Aria series, the setting is a terraformed mars, renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water. Here mankind has settled into a quieter existence, more reminiscent of the early 19th century than one would expect of a space colony. The main city is Neo-Venezia, a complete reconstruction of the ancient city of Venice, it is here that our main character, Akari Mizunashi, arrives to fulfil her dream of becoming an Undine (female gondolier). She soon falls in the love with the city, its people and their quiet way of life\u2026 \\n\r\nFrom this point on the show for the most part drops its sci-fi shawl and becomes much more fantastical and archaic, to the point that it becomes easy to forget that your on mars or even watching a sci-fi show at all. Instead a slow but steady atmosphere is built up and a tangible world appears before your eyes, it becomes not a story but an experience, and a truly unique and beautiful one at that.\\n\\n\r\nUpon hearing this synopsis it would be perfectly within reason to assume this series will be nothing more than a lighthearted fluffy sci-fi show with some hippy free spirited tendencies, nothing could be further from the truth.  \\n\r\nI take issue with people who label, or worse, accuse this series of being \"just episodic\", granted the series can indeed give this impression and the record of the episodic genre is not a particularly clean one, but there are many things that set this series apart from that taboo genre. One is the excellent characters which help to tie everything together while conveying the feeling that your watching real people living their lives and not just acting out a plot or random adventures. And the other is the recurring themes present in the series, in particular the theme of the past and of manmade miracles...    \\n\\n\r\nWith it slow pace, longing for the past and love of beauty, Aria manages to convey a feeling thats hard to describe, but is best summed up with the face you make while watching it, a sort of sad smile, a sardonic grin, a longing to be there but a desire to be distant, to keep from tainting its peace and beauty. From its canals and streets flooded with moonlight, its rustic buildings, the different Undine companies and traditions to the simple mailman, a world is quickly built up that soaks you in its cooling imaginative water. The show itself becomes a celebration of mankind and it ability to create beauty, but also destroy (more later). I mentioned earlier the theme of manmade miracles, this idea that man can create wondrously beautiful things if he really wants to  is extremely prevalent, after all the whole planet is essentially of human construct, the cities, the air, the water, the atmosphere, the temperature is all man and woman made. A point the show is constantly reminding us of, \"No Gods or Kings only man\" seems an extremely fitting quote to apply to this spirt, here mankind and individuals came together to create something incredibly beautiful with the result being that people's feelings and desires have actually allowed for an atmosphere where more conventional miracles can occur. \\n\\n\r\nThis atmosphere is unique among anime, or any series I know of for that matter, few come close to achieving its healing and peaceful aurora, only certain episodes of Natsume Yanijico or the manga Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou can touch it.  But do not get the wrong impression of what i mean, this is no frosted cake of sugary sweetness, superficially perhaps, but under it all there is a distinct bitter after taste, oh its subtle all right but make no mistake its there. From Akari's occasional references to the state of Manhome (a.k.a Earth, I know its a stupid name) and how \"you can't swim in the sea's of Manhome anymore\" give earth a distinct dystopian feeling, and her fascination with all the simple wonders of utopian Neo-Venezia make one wonder just what her childhood was really like back on earth, which seems to have been all but ruined by man and woman. On top of that we have episodes dealing with letters to dead men, journeys to the past and worrying about the future. Again seeing this fascination with the past tinged with sombre nostalgia which sees to permeate throughout the whole show, creating this mix of feelings, happiness tinged with remorse, joy mixed with regret, jocoseness juxtapositional with a realisation that this bliss cannot last forever...\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with themes, on to the shows central pillar upon which everything else is able to rest comfortably, the characters. And do not let first impressions sway you to believe that they are going to be moe fools splashing water on each other as the picture M.A.L has chosen to encapsulate the series would seem to suggest... \\n\r\nInstead the characters, like the show are quite subdued and not in any rush to explain to the viewer who they are. One must also take into account that this is only the first season, and the real character development doesn't come until really the late second and third seasons, all the more aesthetically so for it, but here the ground work is set for the future masterpiece, every great work of art had to begin with a few basic sketches, a few simple outlines and in a similar way that is what is happening here. At first it may appear a bit jarring and one dimensional to see Akari's simple minded fascination with everything and her close friend  Aika's constant scolding of her wonder and \"embarrassing remarks\" or to see Alicia's (her senior) ever-present smile and gracefulness, but before long they become like reassuring kisses to your soul. Besides the show quickly makes it clear that these people are far deeper than a quick glance would suppose. I have already alluded to Akari's past and the possible reasons for her fascination and wonder at Neo-Venzia but there is also Aika and her struggles with her confidence and Alice their other undine friend who struggles with the stigma of being a child prodigy.\\n\r\nBut one thing all of the three main girls Akari, Aika and Alice have in common, besides their frustratingly similar names, its that they each have a senior who mirrors them in some shape or form, the original three \"water fairies\" as they are known, who guides them in their own unique way and whose friendships and past is similar, reminding one of what Mark Twain once remarked, \"History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme\"...\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the visuals and the music of this series is to do it a disservice, not only are the visuals stunning and the music divinely/hauntingly unforgettable, but everything fits so well with the atmosphere that you'd hardly even notice that music is playing or animation happening. I hate to beat a tired drum but i must stress that this atmosphere, is the show, this strange mix of feelings and wondrous healing aurora is only possible thanks to the perfect tone setting music, while portraying the themes of the series so vividly is only possible thanks to the exceptional art, showing us this man made miracle, this rusty but alive city\u2026 Speaking of the city, you might be wondering why even bother to set this series on Mars if your just going to have a quiet little character driven series with little to no sci-fi. Well I suspect that the extravagant setting was to allow for two things, more creative freedom without the constraints of being set in a factual Venice, and to allow the introduction of certain characters and idea's such as Akatsuki Izumo a character who lives high above Neo-Venezia in a floating city and works to control the temperature to make it habitual for humans, all in all it was a paramount decision that helped to create a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nTo culminate, as with the past itself, Aria only gets better with age. Like some great golden tower it seems to rise out of its genre and set the bar for all utopian works. Making no attempt to disguise what it is or be what its not it sets its own pace and like a gentle breeze we are carried along with it. The challenges its characters face are not of a life threatening disposition and all the better for it, its love of the past and of man-made miracles provide a look into something we all feel but rarely discuss or think about. Like the beating of the tide against the buildings of venice or the rhythms of a poem, Aria seems to subtly ebb and flow between joy and sadness, future and past, the miracles of man and moments of magic, without ever losing focus of its characters or their hopes and feelings. And while Animation may be the weakest of the three seasons, it is only so because it must be, all that would eventually become a masterpiece is set-up here and the foundations of greatness firmly laid upon which its tower is built. \\n\\n\r\nLike the golden past we long for so much, Aria the animation isn't perfect, but it does open the door to future seasons, which damn well come pretty close\u2026",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThere's a lot that goes on in a day-to-day basis that can easily elevate stress levels. Rushing to work due to oversleeping or caring for a crying child bring about more trouble than was initially had. Eventually, these separate events can pile together to the point of breaking. It's at this time that a reprieve is needed. A much-earned break, that brings simple serenity and peace of mind. And it's during this mellow moment that one discovers that the simple things in life are truly precious. Aria the Animation takes this to heart, marking the start of arather laid-back journey.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation essentially follows Akari, a young woman working for the Aria Company, a tour-by-gondola establishment. Alongside her best friends Aika and Alice, they meet many different people as they aspire to be \"Prima Undines.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a word that best describes the show, the first one to come to mind is \"calm.\" Above anything else, Aria exudes a blissful feeling that washes over the audience like the waters they ride upon. Its ability to achieve such an effect is done mostly by the way in which it portrays itself. Aria first and foremost makes it its mission to avoid conflict or high-pressure situations. The \"action\" taking place never goes beyond leaves blowing in the wind; at most, riding an air-bike and paddling backwards are the extent of the \"dangers\" that take place. The norm is much quieter: a small conversation by the fire with cocoa, a nighttime look at the shining stars, and basking in the warmth of the sun at the beach are poignant scenarios that demonstrate exactly what makes Aria so peaceful.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's also more than just the scenes themselves. Each episode follows a simple format: a small talk in the beginning to present its theme, providing the evidence to support it, and finally a few words tying it all together. The majority of the themes tackled are general, and therefore apply to most people. Ideas such as taking a step back to look at a situation from a different perspective or learning to see the silver-lining are applicable to anyone. Now, the themes are not particularly powerful; not only is there a constant turnover but also, due to their overall generality, it makes many of them rather clich\u00e9. The execution is there -- due mostly to the calm atmosphere and basic approach -- but it's missing endearment or everlasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nMost slice-of-life shows end there, but Aria twists the formula slightly. Typically, this genre of anime requires a strong cast due to a weaker narrative, and therefore much of the focus is placed on the characters. However, here, it does the opposite; the world, Aqua, is what matters most. Akari and the girls, being Neo-Venezia tour guides, are tasked with explaining the setting to the tourists aboard their gondolas. But what's interesting is that it's not just the tourists gaining knowledge, but the viewer is, too. In essence, the watcher is getting the same experience as the people who paid for the trip. This sounds straightforward: they're all guides, so it's normal for them to describe Aqua out loud. And it is, but that is the beauty of this simplicity. Learning about the Salamanders who work in Ukijima that keep track of water and temperature levels, witnessing the different Undine companies, and understanding the Gnomes who are responsible for regulating the gravity of the planet comes off as completely natural because it's both the girls' livelihood and forte. While the world-building isn't always done \"on the job,\" it's delivered in a concise manner; a figurative gondola ride.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Aria the Animation is nicely done, but it seems to be missing the second part of its title.\\n\\n\r\nPutting Aqua at the forefront once more, the art style puts a lot of attention towards what Neo-Venezia and the surrounding area has to offer. Rustic bridges, multi-windowed houses, outside cafes, prominent statues, and narrow canals really do make it look and feel like the Venice it envisioned. At the same time, the colors and lighting are very soft, adding once more to the calmness of the package. And when the anime is looking to inject some comedy here and there, the girls adopt different faces -- Akari's becomes rectangular-like, Aika's becomes cat-like, and Alice's becomes fish-like -- to good effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are actually rather interesting. Besides just the varying hair styles and colors, of important note are the Undines' attire. Consisting of a white cap and gown, laced with the color of the company they represent, the outfit is both futuristic and classic. Alongside them are the goggled, jacketed Woody, the formal Akatsuki, and the short yet cloaked Al, each of whom fit the look of their respective roles nicely.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is usually about average, when it is present. The problem lies in the aforementioned refusal to do anything even remotely with their bodies. A lot of talking and sitting is had, meaning most of the animation is comprised of moving mouths or shifting positions slightly, with the occasional over-exaggeration. On top of this, the camera purposefully provides more scenic views of Aqua to accomplish two tasks at once: less actual animation and more environment viewing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Aria the Animation play their parts, but not much more.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is a young girl who works for the Orange Company. Initially isolated due to her lack of empathy, she learns the value of friendship through Akari's way of dealing with others and their predicaments. In other words, Alice begins to go \"more with the flow,\" enjoying what life has to offer now; she sees that that is a much more rewarding way to live. Extremely talented in the art of gondola controlling, she becomes a pseudo-rival to Aika, motivating each other to perform better during training. Above all, while she rarely speaks, she isn't afraid to speak her mind, letting others know precisely how she is feeling should she be pushed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nAs the \"head\" of the Himeya family, and subsequently working for Himeya Company, Aika is a proud and determined Single. Her best friend is Akari, and from this relationship sprouts her most famous phrase: \"No sappy lines allowed!\" Idolizing Alicia but loathing Akira, Aika comes to understand two vital lessons. One, that people are complex; just because someone acts a certain way doesn't mean that the extent of their person has been discovered. And two, life isn't always about working or training; everybody deserves to have fun from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the up-and-coming Primas is Akari. With her unending happiness, affable personality, and beautiful optimism, she exemplifies kindness in all of its forms. Working for the Aria Company, she cares for the President of the same name while receiving wisdom from Alicia. As the lead, she experiences every motif firsthand. Cherishing memories, believing in miracles, and providing help; each message given throughout the anime fits wonderfully with Akari's softhearted ideologies. Interestingly, Akari literally goes into the past in three, separate instances. The clue for why this occurs is found in the third, when Ai -- her Manhome friend and messaging buddy -- also goes with her. And it is love. Not love for the people she doesn't know, not love for her closest companions, but love for Aqua itself. Above anyone else, Akari understands what the world is and what it can offer. In short, Akari knows that it's love that makes a difference.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, there is an intriguing comparison to be made between the trainee and master pairs. When looking closely, there exists a similar yet dichotomous relationship for each individual coupling. Athena and Alice are both prodigies, but the former is known for her singing while the latter is known for her rowing. Akira has a harsh outer shell but is soft on the inside, as opposed to Aika's outwardly composed yet inwardly critical self. And Alicia listens while rarely speaking, but Akari can always be heard providing some poetic line. The young women have the Three Great Water Fairies teaching them because they complement what each lacks: confidence, balance, and patience, respectively. While their influence has yet to fully latch on, the purpose for their connection has not.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a rather beautiful song. It starts with gentle singing, and is followed by the tapping of drums and soft violin. The vocalist is given the opportunity to demonstrate some prowess through nice vocal range, providing the audience with the \"winding down\" that is needed to watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is a strange step down. In comparison, it is rather lame but can still be quite catchy. The fun guitar, more plain vocals, and background singers give the whole piece a tame feeling that fits the show but doesn't have the same power as its counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, like the events and art alongside it, further adds to the soothing feel of the show. Guitar-playing, simple piano pieces, whistling tunes, and caring violins are interspersed throughout the entire experience. Everything is quite slow, following the crawling of the story itself. However, at certain points, there are played more lyrical-heavy tracks that detract from the anime and its overall goal of keeping easygoing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, the performances involved are mostly above-average. Eri Kawai, as the singer for Athena, was always captivating to hear. Erino Hazuki as Akari for her kind way of speaking, Sayaka Ohara as Alicia for her motherly inflection, and Chinami Nishimura as President Aria for her unintelligible but cute sounds; each deserves a special shout-out.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the show, it really did give me that sense of being \"chill.\" That the happenings going on to Akari and the gang were so regular and sweet that it became quite difficult not to be at ease. Unfortunately, some of the moments were unemotional when they should have been -- Akari delivering Ami's letter and Akari seeing her snowbug friend off at the start of winter are some that come to mind.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the segments are not particularly engaging, but it can be quite humorous when it wants to be. Akari's usual \"Ehh?\" replies after being scolded by Aika, Athena's clumsiness, and Alicia's constant use of, \"My, my\" are repetitive, but were usually able to make me smile. And this goes for every character; they have their shtick that is used quite frequently yet never really feels overdone.\\n\\n\r\nHeading in the right direction, Aria the Animation, for the most part, accomplished what it wanted to begin. It's calming, it's funny at times, and most of all it's simple. While the characters are weak and both sound-work and animation could see some improvement, the story and art help to alleviate some of the issues. All that being said, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Akari, Aika, and Alice will be showing me next in the city of Neo-Venezia.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, master of calm, general and forgetful themes, figurative gondola ride\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, interesting character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, play their parts while holding mirrored relationships\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, relaxing, somewhat funny, with low emotional investment\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Yes, I think Aria the Animation is mediocre. I'm saying this with thrown chest, and proud gaze, that I watched as much as I could stomach, and finally shown myself mercy at 10 episodes mark.\r\nStories are just weak, and it's not the \"there are no boobies and guns blazing, and no one is punching someone\" weak, it's a \"nobody gives a single fuck about this story, and it's not written well enough to be interesting\" weak. I've seen my share of slice of life, no-drama anime, and it's my favorite, which is why I tried watching Aria, so don't shit me with your \"hurr durrit's animu for acquired tastes of elite individuals, not bleach fans\".\\n\r\nALL of it's characters have annoying catchphrases that they try to force into every single thing that escapes their badly animated mugs (i'm looking at you, alice. I'm fucking looking at you. fuck your dekkai everything.), the main mascot is just ugly and retarded (it took me 2 episodes to determine it's actually a cat, and only thanks to characters explicitly saying that it does belong to felis catus species).\\n\r\nSlice of life genre itself exists as a testament to superior ability of storywriters, who manage to make day-to-day life interesting, soothing and fun to watch, a concept the creators of aria obviously failed to grasp.\\n\r\nAnd before nostalgia templars move in, no, this anime doesn't deserve any bonus points for being 10 years old, nor it's \"quirkiness\" can be appreacieated only by \"not kid audience\", as there are many, MANY shows with better stories than this.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \\n\r\nshow is mediocre at best, and if there are any hidden values or qualities making it worthwhile, I certainly couldn't find them. I don't know how do succesing seasons fare, obviously, but this one effectively discouraged me from giving them a chance.",

            "content": "We all live in a very fast paced world.  To us humans, time is everything, and every second used is a second that can be used to be more \"productive\" or \"better\".  Because of this, we become creatures of habit, living cogs that let life fly by us without a moment's thought.  We don't really take time to enjoy the smaller things in life, to just sit down, relax, and take in the finer things that can go unnoticed.  It is here where we have Aria the Animation, a gem from 2005, and the beginning of the whole Aria series.\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's note:  If I write down any sappy lines, I'm sorry.  It's just hard not to do that for this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8.00/10): Aria the Animation takes place in the world known as Aqua, an alien planet settled and created by humans as a sort of \"second planet\" in order to satisfy the human population.  It is here on this newly created blue planet where we have Akari, our protagonist in this series, settle down on the new planet in a city named Neo-Venezia, a city built based on the city of Venice in Italy.  Here, she learns how to be a Prima Undine, a gondola driver, as she begins her life on this new and peaceful world.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Aria is a very simplistic story, focusing more on the day to day lives of the characters here on the planet of Aqua, mainly the lives of three specific girls, as they train themselves to be Prima Undine.  For any given episode, the characters in the series essentially live their lives on this planet, not really doing much else aside from dealing with the trials and tribulations that lives throw at us.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the storyline of the series, it's quite clear that Aria is not really a series that deals with conflicts as heavily as many series these days do.  The tone of the show is calming, serene, and overall, less dramatic than your average anime.  With the whole of its runtime, the show never tries to deviate from its relaxing tone.  As a result, the overall feel of the show is very unique because as you're watching it, you never really get the sense that anything dramatic will happen.  Now, with zero conflicts, does that mean that this show is bad?  Quite the opposite in fact.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles the smaller things in life.  Throughout the whole show, we are presented with scenes of the characters doing what people generally do in life.  Spend time with friends, doing chores, eating a meal, and even going on an outing; stuff that you would normally see in any given slice of life show.  However, Aria takes this idea one sep further.  Aside from just seeing that characters experience these moments in life, it also takes them into account, putting them in retrospect to one's own life, affirming how we as people can miss the finer details, the smaller experiences that we sometimes fail to see.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the show does a decent job at world building.  Rather than just letting the setting of a different world be just a stated fact, Aria the Animation adds in to that by spending a good chunk of its runtime explaining the world's history, tying that into its life affirming story, making the two work in conjunction to make the story a lot more cohesive and adds to the experience.  \\n\\n\r\nWith all these good points, what is there to be said badly about this series?  Well, more or less, it's the calming atmosphere that the story has.  Because this show is quite slow and doesn't possess any lingering conflicts, Aria can at times be rather boring.  (I found this to be the case at times.)  It's not that the show itself is bad, it's just that watching something so slow can leave someone to be desiring a little bit more.  Of course, that's not true for everyone, but personally, I couldn't watch more than a couple episodes at a time simply because of how I sort of lost interest sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of that side effect of Aria's wonderfully calming atmosphere, the story of Aria is still very exceptional.  It puts the things in life that we sometimes forget, forward, giving the audience a feeling of appreciation of things that we may often forget.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Some World building\\n\r\n+  Very calming show\\n\r\n+  Fantastic themes\\n\r\n-   Calming factor can leave some people bored (To combat this, I suggest watching 2-3 episodes at one time rather than marathoning.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.99/10): Similar to its story, Aria the Animation doesn't have very complicated characters, each of which really following their own certain characteristics and never really deviating from the traits that they were given at time.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Akari Muzunashi, the \"main protagonist\" of this series.  As the only apprentice in the Aria Company, Akari plays off as a very simple girl, wanting only to enjoy the time that she has on Aqua, frequently throwing out \"sappy lines\" in order to express her gratitude or overall enjoyment of the time that she spends with the people that she's grown to know in her time in Aqua.  Akari also plays a very crucial role in this series by writing these letters at the end of every episode, essentially writing down any given episode's important takeaway, bolstering the things that the episode is talking about.  It is because of this specifically that I think Aria excels at what it does, because the things that it talks about can really be an eye opener at times.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Aika Granzchesta, a Single from the Hime Company, a different gondola company that rivals the Aria Company.  Being the girl that is somewhat more outgoing than the other two, being very proud of her own abilities, Aika is the second girl in the series you meet with her classic line of \"No sappy lines\" (or any other variation of that phrase.)  In addition, to round out the trio of girls in this series, is Alice, a Pair from the Orange Planet company, (And no, she does not belong to a pest-control agency.)  acting as the youngest of the trio, working to hone her abilities as well as spending time with her senpais from the other companies.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from these main three girls in this series, we also have their instructors Alicia, Akira, and Athena, who serve similar roles to their apprentice counterparts, as well as the three feline company presidents.  In addition, there are side characters that appear every once in a while, filling in the gaps to make the series feel more populated and overall more enjoyable as you see the personalities of all the characters come together and just live life.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters themselves aren't really that complicated.  Like general slice of life, the traits that they are given at the start of their appearances persist with them throughout the whole of the series, with slight growth every now and then to show progression.  Above all, what I think is most interesting is that these characters are very memorable.  They're not very complicated, but even if they don't show up for a while, the characters that you meet aren't really that easily forgettable, which I find to be a plus for the series.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very simple characters that are easily memorable\\n\r\n+  Good character dynamics\\n\r\n+  Good side characters\\n\r\n-   Mostly one note characters in a sense\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10 and 8.78/10):  The art for Aria the Animation itself is honestly a surprise to me.  Because of its age (being that it's a 2005 anime), I had originally thought that the artstyle wouldn't stack up and would be less graphically well done as the anime that we see as of now.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was rather well animated.  T\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle reflects the feeling you get from the anime of serenity and calmness.  There are no horrendously bright colors, there isn't any dark brooding colors, and there is certainly no ecchi.  Aria's artsyle itself is very classic, being an individual looking style of animation that is bother memorable and very well made for its time.  (Like seriously.  I saw things in 2014 that looked worse than Aria.)  It's a very simple style of animation with enough detail to make the city of Neo-Venezia look beautiful, and it just simply...works.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, for comedic feel, every one of the main characters has a \"second face\", where they all have a specific expression that they make whenever they want their audience to bust a funny.  (Just a detail that I found to be quite amusing.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, Aria boasts a very well made OST that reflects the feel of the series.  In addition to having \"Undine\" and \"Rainbow\" as the OP and ED respectively, the series has a very calming and beautifully crafted soundtrack that adds to the calm feeling of this series.  As for the OP and ED, Undine, its opening, is a very calm and serene peace that I bet can calm any spirit, sounding like flowing spring water as it wafts through your ears, cleansing you of any hardships that you may be experiencing.  As for Rainbow, its ED, it showcases a very cheerful and bouncy feel that is very upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.  Overall, this soundtrack is beautiful, a masterpiece that is timeless.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very good animation for its time period\\n\r\n+  Very classic looking artstyle\\n\r\n+  Exceptional soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.00/10): When I first heard about Aria the animation, I was always puzzled why it was so popular, and why it was so revered as a classic.  After some time, I decided to watch it, and boy, am I happy I did.  The themes of the series were very well delivered, and I couldn't stop wearing a smile on my face when I was watching it.  (Above all, I listened to the OP and ED every time.  That doesn't happen very often.)\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  A very big yes.  Aria showcased something that anime for me has been lacking for a while; a simple story that is at the same time, very powerful.  Coupled with the beautiful soundtrack, the great animation, and some pretty memorable characters, there was hardly anything about this series that I didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like was how at times, I admit, I felt kind of bored watching this series.  With its lack of conflict, Aria's peaceful tone can sometimes be overwhelming.  As a result, marathoning this show can be difficult for some.  Apart from that, I have no complaints.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAfter finally watching the legendary Aria the Animation, yes, I would recommend people to watch this series.  Contrary to anime today, there is no fanservice, it's deep without needing any drama/melodrama, it's a simple story that doesn't poke itself into any other genre aside from Slice-of-life, and above all, it is considered to be a classic.  This show is an instant cheer-up, and to this day, is still a very revered series.  So, if you haven't watched this series, I highly recommend you do.  It's an experience that you won't want to forget.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:  8.35/10  (I'm sorry if there were any sappy lines.  I can't help it!  :S   )",

            "content": "Danger Danger!Keep out if you can't handle strong language and sarcasm...And humour in general...And if you have some kind of allergy in different opinions..Basically sod off and read something else.\r\nI don't know why i do this to myself..I really don't.I may be a masochist and not even know it.Cause i was hearing them little voices in my head screaming at the top of their imaginary lungs to not watch Aria.Did i listen?Of course not cause as it seems i may have a tendency towards the leather and gag ball end of things.If by any chance you are a goth mistress and on the look fora hat stand give me a shout,will ya?\\n\\n\r\nBut let's dive into Aria..Not literally,unless you're into cats..No not cats like people with cat ears,i mean cats,those hairy bastards that want to conquer the world,make us their slaves and bathe in a pool full of human blood.If you're a cat owner get rid NOW or forever be doomed.Get a dog,they're loyal and i've seen vids where they're trained to fetch beer from the freezer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we hit it off with the story..Or the lack of one.I say that cause the story is the one told in the synopsis and only there,nothing even remote to a story exists in the anime itself.So let's see what the synopsis says:The story takes place on Aqua,formerly known as Mars until they filled it with water 150 years ago,in the city of Neo-Venice,a replica of Earth's Venice.The recreation of Venice is one of the things i liked about Aria.They actually took time to do research in order to include famous Venetian landmarks such as the St Mark\u2019s Basilica,the island of Burano and Plaza San Marco.The architecture and feel of the place is rather accurate,but unlike the real Venice if you happen to fall in the water you don't end up with 2 heads.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode follows some \"plot\" of some sorts,but as far as i can tell there's no life in this anime's plots.They are just some small adventures everyone has seen in one way or another in other animes.Imagine an anime about someone stopping at a small mart to buy some milk and he realises he doesn't have enough money on him.So he has to go to the bank and take some money and go back to buy the milk..That's it..Nothing even remotely interesting.But you might say:\"yeah it has some shit going on here and there\"..And that's the problem.The only few surprises that try and spark some life into this corpse are some random shit,like \"hey time travel\"...As to why and how this happened that remains a mystery.Nothing is being explained.It's just your basic moe cancer with the pleasant feel.And last time i checked moe isn't story or plot it's just ebola through the internet.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters you have Akari who dreams of being a gondolier at pro level(pilot of the boats Venice is famous for)under the guidance of the wise Obi-Alicia who is blond.Then a weird thing happens as we are being introduced to other characters that their names begin with the letter \"A\"..I guess the alphabet wasn't invented?Get this for unimaginative naming..Aika who has blue hair,Akira who is the bitchy bitch teacher and Alice who i don't remember what she was doing there.Oh yes....There is a cat like creature that tries endlessly to sag another catlike creature...Soooo....Yeah it's moe..\\n\\n\r\nAnimationwise the details in the way the whole world is built and even the water movement and rflections are spot on..The characters themselves are pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nSongs and VA were ok-ish i think..Maybe they were good and i was sound asleep.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now i must conclude this review so i can go drink my arse off and forget i even saw this.It isn't bad as such.And what with all these praising reviews and 3 seasons in total i expected something among the lines of a Japanese blockbuster.Unfortunately,little good can be said about this anime but not all of it is bad.I can only say that if you want an anime you can watch with your eyes and brain completely shut,then this is for ya.If you want substance of any sorts,even if it's just a little watch something else.How the hell did this thing manage to get so many seasons?Were you there on the land of the rising sun on drugs or something?Or maybe do you happen to have a weird sense of humour and thought it would be fun to export this shit to the west and stand back and laugh?",

            "content": "Aria the Animation is the first of three anime series adapted from the Aria manga and focuses mainly on introducing the main characters - Akari, Aika and Alice - and the world of Aqua and Neo-Venezia, without going into much depth and while keeping an extremely relaxing and soothing atmosphere.\r\nFor that reason the pacing of the first series can be a little off-putting to some viewers, as the new elements each episode adds are developed only to a limited scope (the introduction) and it might feel as though the whole series is nothing more than cute characters, chilly backgrounds, and relaxing BGM, especially to thoseviewers who aren't used to the slice of life genre - The Animation is more about taking it easy than actually developing the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, the animation is quite good for a slice of life show, and the amount of effort put by the creators can easily be seen in the backgrounds, water motion, coloring, and the detail of the buildings and scenery. The beautiful art, together with the soundtrack, which is the most memorable out of the three seasons, really creates atmosphere and attempts to draw the viewer in without much effort.\\n\\n\r\nAria accomplishes the hard task of keeping characters simple while maintaining a degree of originality that allows them to always look fresh; the interactions between characters feel natural and both the comedy and dialogue are presented as though they are part of normal conversations, rather than a crafted script beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I enjoyed the series immensely and would highly recommend it, I must admit the series might not suit everyone's tastes, especially if the viewers are expecting realistic characters and situations because NOTHING is realistic in Aria.\\n\\n\r\nThe utopian setting and the unrealistic character portrayal are instruments the series makes use to achieve its main goal: healing. Aqua is a world where everyone is nice, and the dialogues are often sappy (to the point of making recurring jokes about it).\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation slowly invites you to join the characters in their discovery of that beautiful world, almost as if Akari invited you for a ride on her gondola.",

            "content": "This is pure therapeutic bliss. Literally.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is simple and in execution turns out great. Taking into account the fact that this is a slice-of-life, the pacing is so wonderfully planned out, and the episodic stories so well-rounded in themselves, that one should never find oneself bored out of his wits from exploring the wonderful place that is Neo-Venezia.\r\nAnd that is a real feat.\r\nART\r\nOh god the background is beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.\r\nAnd accurate (mostly) too, as some guy from Lonely Planet frequenting Animesuki and going on a (mostly business) trip to Venice found out.\r\nDecent effort was also made for the characters. Only 1 obvious QUALITYimage ever jumped out at me after the third rewatch and for the most part there were no flaws. Though it'd have been nice if the faces were drawn anywhere nearly as detailed as in the manga. But then that'd have to be budget-busting stuff.\\n\r\nProduction IG was roped in for the CG but it didn't seem all that impressive to me, though it certainly was enough to add to the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nAnd here, sir, is where this anime is made into the ideal therapeutic experience. Every single piece of music in every single scene is perfectly fitted together. The decision for Choro Club to cut a major album out of this meant the resulting music was absolutely, astoundingly brilliant. Coupled to the show, it was outstanding and perfectly fitting, while on its own it can be summed up as &quot;perfect&quot; (...that is, if you don't hate the Brazilian-style choro and the relaxing tune). The late Kawai Eri worked her magic into the very fitting OP that was soothing to the ears, while Round Table as usual put in a brilliant song for an ED. The insert song was pretty catchy too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nHere unfortunately I'll have to put in some criticism. Most of the characters are simply not well-developed. We get to see the character of every, uh, character, but not much else. The sempai especially. There's almost no background story on them. Plus, they all seem so eerily close to perfect, it's unreal.\\n\r\nThat aside, Akari elevates herself to Goddess status as we see through her beautifully clear eyes the wonders of her world. And it is through her that the stories turn out so beautiful, so wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nNeedless to say I loved this to bits. Every episode left me yearning for more wonderfulness, and I eventually wasted a whole day marathoning it when I should have been rushing for projects. It's guaranteed to lift your spirits, relieve whatever pressure you might of had, and turn any pessimist into a perenially happy optimist.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nA beautiful slice-of-life anime all in all, and considering the popularity this had at its airing, way too under-watched. This show needs some love; spread the Aria lovin'.",

            "content": "I have been told from many different internet sites that Aria is the greatest of all slice of life animes. While slice of life animes usually don't attract me, I decided to give Aria a try. I just finished the first season over about a week and still have the buzz of the last episode all over. It definitely was a unique watch.\r\nAria takes place far in the future. Mankind has successfully given Mars a habitable environment, complete with the same force of gravity as Earth's, an atmosphere that is equally capable of absorbing blue light, massive oceans rivaling Earth's, and a very diverse biolife,all imported from Earth and successfully multiplied. They have also created an extremely fast and efficient method of travel between Earth and Mars and now people come to Mars for vacations. Despite all this, the world of Aria is very rural, with very little technology at all. The only pieces of technology I can recall, in fact, are the space shuttles that float in the sky, the mailman's flying motorbike, data cards, along with a very old type of phone.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on the lives of three undiines [girls in training to become primas (girls who row the gondolas in this water filled planet)]. These girls have almost no problems in their lives and are free to train and relax as the days pass. Its peaceful, relaxing, stress-free, but I can't say I was really able to relax that much while watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story by itself is fine I suppose. Many of the middle episodes were a little too slow and calming, but the end episodes were good. The problem is that the whole time I was watching this anime, I was dying to know answers that were never going to be answered. For example, there was one episode where the whole girl team goes to a uninhabited island and have a good time at the beach. Somewhere in there, one of the girls says \"I'm so happy to swim in the ocean. Nobody can swim in the oceans back at Man Home anymore so I've never done it before\". Ehhhh is that so? Exactly what happened to the oceans back on Earth that they are no longer alright to swim in? Is there mass pollution on Earth now or are the oceans too cold or what? I really wanted the anime to stop focusing on peace on Mars and transfer to the potential mayhem happening on Earth. It never does though, and I am left with no answers.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I am one of the people of enjoy this kind of anime. I really just don't see the charm in it. Why are slice of lifes so typical in lacking any elements that make other anime so great? An anime can still be a slice of life anime and at the same time contain drama, action, adventure, Plot. Slice of life doesn't have to equate to happy go lucky peaceful animes featuring an almost all female cast doing almost nothing (looking at you Lucky Star). But at least Lucky Star was humorous, this anime was not. It was basically a sleep inducer, with almost every episode almost putting me to sleep. A better adjective for this anime would be 'boring'. I'm sorry but in such an interesting science fiction world such as this, I want to see some science fiction, not some slice of life sleep inducer. \\n\\n\r\nLots of people like this type of anime though, so I'll go ahead and recommend it. However, people like me, who like a core plot directing the anime with action, humor, drama, romance, or whatever will flee from anime like this and go back to other slice of life animes with those things, such as NHK Ni Youkoso, Toradora, or Clannad.",

            "content": "If I were to describe this anime with a single word, the word would probably be \"boring\". Surprising perhaps, given that it lies in the \"Good\" region of my rating scales, but that's what this anime is. In this case, \"boring\" isn't used so much to label \"Aria\" as an unwatchably dull anime (though to some it probably is) as to describe what actually happens in it, which is absolutely nothing. For \"Aria\", in many ways, represents the very essence of a slice-of-life anime.\r\nIn \"Aria\", there are no evil villains to fight, no complicated plots to untangle, no philosophical conundrums to contemplate... just about theonly interesting detail in \"Aria\" is that it's set on Mars, a Mars of the future that resembles Venice with its abundance of water and gondolas. But don't let this exotic location fool you into thinking this is a setting for a futuristic sci-fi anime, because you'll be sorely disappointed. That detail is pretty much restricted to being background information - as far as the anime itself is concerned, it may as well be set in Venice, as it doesn't really do much with the Mars bit.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond its settings, \"Aria\" is plain to such an extent that no measurable aspect of this anime stands out in any way: the animation is ok... in a boring way; the music... despite often having unconventional melody progressions that gave it a distinct feel, only manage to leave an impression of being boringly good; as for the content... it's virtually non-existent. Every episode is pretty much just a case of the unremarkable characters going about their mundane daily tasks - they barely even qualify for the adventure-of-the-week description. But then, this is what the slice-of-life genre is all about, right? Yes, \"Aria\" may not be the most interesting of anime, but it does deliver in the department where this kind of anime is expected to deliver, and that is in the \"heart\" of the show - the part that gives it that indescribable feel good factor. This is epitomised by the last episode, which is a very typical slice-of-life open ending where there's no grand finale, but there's a vague sense of temporary closure at the end, with the option of extending into a second season wide open. But despite the lack of a climax, it does leave you bursting with a wonderful glowing feeling inside, with a twinge of sadness that comes from reaching the end of the series that you've become fond of. It's this that allows \"Aria\" to soar above the sum of its very plain parts.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I have a soft spot for Aria, I'd hesitate to recommend it to many people. A lot of them would probably fall asleep watching it. Other slice-of-life anime have additional aspects to keep you watching - Genshiken has its comedy and entertainment values; Planetes has its humble (and also not so humble) heroics and intense drama; Paradise Kiss has its eccentricity and interesting relationship dynamics... \"Aria\" doesn't have any of these things, and instead offers the viewer a simple yet hard to quantify pleasure that comes from watching a slice-of-life that's been distilled down to its purest form. It's something for the connoisseurs of the genre to slowly enjoy. And if you ask them why it's good, their response would probably be the same as mine: it... just is!",

            "content": "For starters, this anime has quite literally changed my outlook on life. Having gone through a fair amount of distress this past year, I was looking for something that could bring some tranquility to past few hectic months. Watching Aria brought me this, and so much more, and I'll explain later on.\r\nThe story takes place in the 24th century on a terraformed Mars (now called Aqua), where Akari (our MC) strives to be a top class Undine in Neo Venezia. Truly sticking to the nature of SoL, past the first 3-4 episodes Aria the Animation is almost entirely episodic, yet it never feels boring orpointless despite the direction of the plot. Each episodes digs into each of the characters and their relationships with one another, and how they grow as people. It feels real, and it feels natural. Even the trope beach/hot springs episodes are extremely well done with 0 pandering fan service, truly sticking to the themes and ideas Aria is presenting.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound is where this show really starts to kick in. The art style is absolutely superb, with lush colors used in every frame and character design being memorable. The animation is very high quality as well, besides some of the chibi moments that feel very jarring next to the usually-smooth animation. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Sound, Aria hands down, has one of the best OSTs around period. From the relaxing OP to the light-hearted ED, and even all of the background soundtracks playing throughout the show, the music for this show is astoundingly well-realized. It is an absolute perfect fit, both for the Italian setting and for the overall mood of the show. Special mention to the OP which is, by far, one of the best OPs I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also surprisingly well-developed for the plot being as lax as it is. All of them are likable, and they all serve a purpose in the plot. Special mention to how well developed Aqua is as well, almost every plothole that could have come from essentially setting Venice on Mars was covered (i.e weather being artificially controlled, gravity being regulated undergrounds by gnomes etc.). You can clearly see how much thought the author put into not only the characters, but Aqua itself. \\n\\n\r\nAll these elements fuse together to form an experience unlike any other. No drama, no action, no conspiracies, no villains, just a tranquil story of three young girls realizing their dreams, little by little in a beautiful world. You really do feel bliss when watching this, even more so after going through some rough times. Aria teaches you to look at the bright and positive things in life, a profound yet very forgotten message in the current industry saturated with excessive action and drama. \\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation is definitely as least worth a try, if for no other reason that it just being different from any other show out there. A masterfully crafted anime, held back by a couple of technical issues, it truly is a heart warming and positive experience.",

The story does however give a romantic view of the world, from small things to big, and is quite beautifully done at times. One of the points that I really like about the story is how the concluding episodes tie back to the beginning to give the story a very wholesome feeling. \r\nAnimation: The artwork was splendidly done and really enhanced the mood. I noticed that the series' depiction of water especially, a central theme to the show, was beautifully portrayed and could be mesmerizingin its serenity. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is elegant and fits well with the rest of the anime. Although not outstanding on its own, it really works well to create the tranquil mood that defines the series so well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were solid and thoroughly enjoyable. The main trio's personalities worked well in tangent with one another which provided for a lot of fun scenes. The supporting roles were also developed well and they contributed to the anime's overall theme and storyline. Every new character that Akari met had something to add that gave more meaning to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite a lot of solid good points about the series, the slow pace was honestly boring at times. There wasn't enough to draw me in and give me incentive to continue watching other than a desire to see watch a beautiful story. The story didn't have much tragedy, romance, or action through which to provide excitement and could feel lacking at times. In the end, the slow pace really impaired my ability to fully enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: There were many points I liked about the story and several others I disliked. In the end though, the story synthesized its elements into a well-developed piece. The story, art, sound, and character development all came together to produce a beautiful and idealistic story that leaves you feeling relaxed and content.",

            "content": "I'm quite surprised that no one's actually written a review for this yet. \r\nI have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expect from this show. The synopsis didn't really give any clues as to what I should expect, and that is probably the best thing about it - it isn't quite what you expect.\r\nThe story takes place on what used to be Mars (the first thing I didn't expect), in a place called Neo-Venzia (New Venice), and is about a girl training to be an Undine (the story uses the term to refer to a female gondolier rather than a water spirit). Thestory itself isn't linear in any way, as each episode is a story in it's own right. Normally this is a recipe for disaster in the anime world, but it works in this show - I'll explain why in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are of a very high standard, and the city and it's surroundings are beautifully rendered - and you will see a lot of the city in this show. The characters are very well depicted, even when they show their chibi side, and the best bit is there's not a panty shot in sight - hooray!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one area where this show excels. Everything is there if you listen, from the sound of the waves to the hubbub of of a crowd. The music is ideally suited to the show and, unlike many anime, actually heightens the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are extremely well realised. I can't think of one character I actually disliked in the entire show. One of the things I liked about the show was how each character actually fits into the story, and the world in which they exist - even the cats have a purpose. One of the other things I liked was the use of fairytale and mythological creatures in the show. The females gondoliers are referred to as Undines, with the top three being called the Great Fairies. The weather is controlled by salamanders, the gravity is controlled by gnomes, etc. One thing that puzzled me was why the female characters names begin with A (except Grandma, however her real name is Akino), but that's by-the-by.\\n\\n\r\nSo the important question is: Will you enjoy the show? \\n\\n\r\nIf you're an action junkie, or into horror or angst, then this is not the show for you (although it never hurts to give it a try). This show is funny and quirky in many ways, without going over the top, but the one word I would use to describe the show is RELAX. It took me two weeks to finish this show and it's sequel (which is a long time for me by the way), and this is because this show is so relaxing that I was falling asleep whilst watching it. Normally it takes a lot for me to fall asleep, and even boredom doesn't work, but somehow this show just relaxes you to the point where you just drift off to dreamland without a second thought, and never once was I bored with this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a show that deserves to be watched, as it has a unique appeal that the like's of Sketchbook ~full colour'S~ and Kokoro Toshokan just can't quite match up to. The reason why the non-linear story works well in this show is because it's so relaxing that you honestly just don't care about the fact there's no real plot - which is a rather refreshing perspective to have.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to watch the show? Have a shower, have a good meal, get comfortable, and relax...",

            "content": "I stumbled upon Aria years ago when reading a review about the manga and made a mental note to check it out later. Positively drawn in by Kozue Amano's original work, I soon picked up the anime as well. For a reason I still can't recall I dropped the show nearly three years ago, and it wasn't until just recently that I finished what I started back then. And though not much had changed for either better or worse from what I remembered, I'm glad I did so.\r\nAria the Animation is not for you, who prefers a clear cut and classically constructed storyline that movesfrom point A to point B with some key events in between. Aria the Animation is not for you, who requires relentless action and constant fast-paced happenings from their anime. And most certainly Aria the Animation is not for you, who finds little to no enjoyment in just sitting back and watching as a close-knit group of girls, not in their bra and panties with guns ablaze, but with their gondolas and oars go through ordinary day-to-day activities instead of epic adventures and intense situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut on the good chance you are the type to approach your anime with an open mind and the patience to watch and see the magic in the moment, you are likely to find the company of Akari, Aika, Alice, and the rest of the undines and undines-in-training much to your liking. Because that's what Aria the Animation is ultimately about: a journey to uncover the joy of the obvious, the excitement behind the mundane, and the possibilities underneath the sorrows. \\n\\n\r\nThese scenarios are played out to us by a cast of characters who depict a variety of different personalities. Akari is the naive amateur who treats all she experiences with childlike wonder; through her most of the show's message is brought across to the viewer. . Aika is her best friend and almost her exact opposite: no-nonsense and feet firmly on the ground-kind of girl who constantly berates Akari for her dreamy ways. And Alicia is their mentor and the big sister-type of character, who's there to provide insight and help the juniors along the way. They're surrounded by a pack of friends who similarly have their quirks and qualities defining them and making their role contributing to what the creator is trying to tell us.\\n\\n\r\nYou're right if you argue that the story is boring and seemingly pointless at times. Saying the characters being archetypes of their respective personalities (and almost exclusively female as well!) is cliche and overused is valid. Complaining that having cats as business company presidents is just plain stupid and ridiculous is justified.\\n\\n\r\nBut as one who no doubt has already seen quite a bit of anime in their life, you have for sure come across these common failings before. And in case you've reached the point of having made peace with them, or feel like challenging yourself to do so, Aria the Animation may prove to be an eye-opening experience for you that anime can be good even if no heavens are pierced.",

I gave it about 6 episodes to get good but nothing.\r\nStory - Um... what story? This show is a show about nothing, and not in the funny Seinfeld way. Nothing really happens from what I saw. Each episode has some type of strife occur, but there is no antagonist or villain of the sort. I'm kind of confused as to why it is so beloved. But to be fair youmight want to give Aria a try, I just happen to dislike it with a vengeance. \\n\\n\r\nArt - A modern anime using modern technology and techniques, so nothing to complain about. It manages to live up to the current status quo, but fails to do anything amazing or innovative.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Ehh... very laid back and mediocre. Fits the anime well, but doesn't float my boat. If you like the action music or romantic comedy type music, don't expect much watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Everyone had the same personality. Well, to be more accurate, they had the same personality with slight variations for each character. All generally nice, good, people who are definitely getting a thumbs up from the man upstairs.\\n\\n\r\nI am a fan of Action-Adventure and Romantic-Comedies for the most part, yet I severely dislike this show. So if you like these animes you may not like this show, but I might just be weird and dislike Aria.",

            "content": "\"May this town's kindness reach the hearts of many people...\"\r\nFrom what I saw, I'm sure it will. \r\nThe first idea I wanted to share in this review is that Aria is a series that speaks for itself. What I'm doing here is merely trying to explain a complex story within a few lines. I would never be able to summarize all the pros/cons of Aria, first because each person will see it in a deferent way, and second because you would need to watch it in order to understand all the comparisons, metaphores and symbolism I would mention. \r\nThat said, I'm reviewing it with thesole purpose of bringing more viewers for this amazing chronicle and hopefully introduce more and more people to Aqua and its habitants. \\n\r\nAria is an anime that everybody should watch, still, it's not an anime that will work for everybody. Whether or not you will enjoy it, is up to you, your personal interpretation and the mood of the moment. I would say that what matters the most is the timing. If you watch it while in the mood for a thriller, you'll drop it even before understanding the idea of the story.\\n\\n\r\n\"Now, please take my hand\"\\n\r\nIs what you would heard from a radiant Undiine while boarding her gondola. With a gentle smile she would gracefully ask you where to and start conducing you trought Neo-Venezia, a city modeled after Venezia in Man-Home (Earth). She would show you turistic spots and you'd start to notice that even being in 2053 the city moves slowly, without traffic jams, rush hour, polution, cellphones, noise pollution... The only evidences that you are really in the XXII century would be the spaceships that are continually transporting passangers from one planet to another. This relaxed athmosphere would start to embrace you while the Undiine continue to show you wonders and misteries from this planet that were once dry and empty and is now filled with water and life. \\n\r\nIt's impossible to not enjoy such cozy enviroment.\\n\r\nEvery episode is a kind of fairy tale, filled with cultural values and a sense of friendship, always coming up with a poetic moral in the end. Aria stands out from the average and prove us that the essence of the Slice-Of-Life is not dead. Characters can be lovely and elegant without being \"moe\". All the great stories in human history never needed movies or TV series to be remembered, they passed from generation to generation depending only in the power of words and its storyteller. Aria didn't have a high budget, neither big sponsors, so the quality of the animation could never be compared to a \"top\" studio, even though, the artwork values itself from this modest simplicity, that even with a medium quality, brings you gorgeous scenarios and handsome characters.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point you probably already noticed that Aria raise some questions a regular slice-of-life doesn't. This is only possible because of two main reasons: The already mentioned storyline progression, that works with a character-driven story and a \"not-so-linear\" time progression, and the well said characters. \\n\r\nUsually what you see is a cast made of a group of high schoolers in a school enviroment, 99% of the slice-of-life stories are like this. Not saying they are bad, but it only provides a unilateral point of view from a given subject. Of course each character, if well planned, will have a difference in personality and see things in a different way, otherwise it would get boring to watch. Aria on the other hand change things in a \"macro\" way, and brings a entire community as characters. Works with different generations and people with the most different styles of life and personality traces, bringing to you a much more rich story  that resemble our lifes.\\n\\n\r\nIt stays apparent whenever or not a studio made an effort to create something special when one of the basic points of a series steals the show. Financial issues or other external factors can put a \"barrier\" to graphics, effects, art, post-production development, but sound is relatively free from it. Music can be made by anyone, anywhere. Anonymous people can create masterpieces, and some kid can be playing right now a perfect cover of Beethoven. Why am I saying this?\\n\r\nBecause Aria's music deserve to be praised. Wonderful acoustic pieces by Choro Club and Senoo was the perfect match for the enviroment of the series. The entire OST is performed with string instruments (even a rhodes) without any kind of pop song or eletronic. The songs are slow paced, almost hitting a andante and sometimes a vivace, while the vocal collection are mostly ballads. It's undoubtedly the best choice of OST for a story with the values of Aria. \\n\r\nCan you fell the nostalgia already?\\n\\n\r\nAria made something special here. \\n\r\nI wish not enter in the merit of originality but it is perceptible that after its publication, lots of other franchises started producing series which bended more to this side of a philosophical slice-of-life with tones of self-discovery on it. One could say the strenght of this series lies into two major standards. The fact that we all wish for hapiness and a calm life, and the philosophic notion that this happiness and this ability to see the wonder in things is already inside of us. You just need to find it.\\n\r\nBeing honest, I don't really mind that Aria is little of a underrated series. If it's like this, the amount of haters are minimal, there's no controversy around it, neither people arguing to see \"which is the best character\". The way it is, Aria will continue to be slowly recommended from friends to friends, just like in the pace of the anime itself. \\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, it sure hits the maximum score. Without any action scene or a suddenly twists in the plot, Aria still managed to amuse me every single episode. There's no way I would watch one episode and don't feel refreshed, all warm and fuzzy inside. Meaning-of-life anime? This is definitely one.\\n\r\nI probably went full-philosophic in the last paragraphs, then for a closure to this review, a funny observation:\\n\r\nAria is not perfect. There's something pretty annoying on it, that will chase you from the 1st episode to the last of the 3rd season (...) 99% of the characters' names and/or last names starts with \"A\". Aqua, Aria, Akari, Alice, Alicia, Aika, Akira, Athena, Ai, Al, Anna, Akatsuki...\\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to memorize who is who before you get used to them!\\n\\n\r\nI hope I was able to introduce at least a little bit of this great story that is Aria. Now, the rest is up to you.\\n\r\n\"Thank you for choosing Aria Company. Have a safe trip! See you again!\"",

            "content": "Is Aria a good series? Probably. Does it deserve to be held up as a masterpiece? I doubt it. \r\nAria tends to be hyped up as *the* epitome of slice-of-life, so I expected an anime with all the strong points of the genre, including fleshed-out, relatable characters. Aria fails in that respect, and that compromises the amount of enjoyment I can derive from this series as a slice-of-life fan who has no specific interest in cute girls doing cute things.\r\nWhat I object to isn't the fact that the cast is female-dominated, though more gender balance would have been nice. [The first half of Haibane Renmei,for instance, is an example of an anime with a mostly-female cast that rises above the \"cute girls do cute things\" formula, and manages to have some characters (not all, admittedly) with depth.] What I object to is the use of generic character traits and catchphrases as a substitute for actual characterisation. There's the sweet ditzy one, the feisty one, the -_- one, the sweet onee-san type... The characters are generally likeable - they're just not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMy other main issue with Aria is that it is heavy-handed and mawkish. Other iyashikei series like Natsume Yuujinchou and YKK manage to be heartwarming without being horribly unsubtle, and have variations in mood and tone as well. For most of the series, Aria's mood setting is stuck on \"painfully sweet\". Conflicts are always easily resolved, and the characters cheerfully spout trite platitudes for at least half of each episode. The first time we get an episode with any sense of wistfulness or melancholy is episode 11, and that's far too late in the series.\\n\\n\r\n(President Aria also came across as annoying rather than cute, partly due to the irritating noises that he made.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for technical issues: For the most part, Aria manages to look beautiful despite having occasionally clunky animation and slightly jarring CGI. This is partly because its backgrounds are largely copies of actual Venice (only a lot less crowded with tourists, lol), but there's some great art direction as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pleasant and well-suited to the gentle tone of the anime, but not outstanding. If you have a low tolerance for cutesy, unrealistic voice acting, this isn't the best series for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're happy watching a sweet and fluffy iyashikei series, this will suit you fine; but if you prefer something that has depth, is nuanced, and has a gently melancholic mood, you're not going to find those elements in Aria.",

            "content": "Slice of life anime are difficult to represent to audiences in an entertaining manner without being a boring spectacle; that's why most of these have dramatic or romantic elements, or a lot of fanservice in them in order to be appealing to the viewer. But then there is Aria: The Animation, a slice of life in its purest form, that proves that such type of anime doesn't need any of the above to be succesful. Having dived in without any expectations whatsoever, I was pleasantly surprised: it was proven how wonderful and relaxing such a simple anime can be.\r\n~Story~\r\nThe premise of Aria: The Animation isof simple nature: Akari Mizunashi, a teenager who moved from Manhome to the planet Aqua (formerly known as Mars), joins the Aria Company to become a professional Undine - or a professional tour guide - in Neo Venezia, a flawless presentation of Venezia itself. This may seem as something totally uninteresting, learning how to become a undine, yet while it certainly is an aspect of importance, its main focus lies in the interactions with the people in the city, in addition to world building of the location.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect is the fact that it is a planet covered in water and while it gives the impression at first of being a simplistic and somewhat regressed humanity technologically wise, it is for the matter not: it is mixed with futuristic vehicles and devices such as gigantic airships, or flying machinery, whereas everyday tools are simple, which gives the viewer a feeling of attachment to the setting itself, as this may be something that would happen in the near future. Now it must be said that not much of the world and how it came to be is revealed, which will maybe be done in the sequels.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the story focuses on the different interactions with the people of Neo Venezia, and naturally fellow apprentice undines, as well as professional ones. It doesn't stop there: world building is done through the different, but intricate people of the city necessary to maintain a working society. Audiences may think that this anime has the approach of \"cute girls doing cute things\", yet with Aria it doesn't give this impression at all: they're just humans living their everyday life. These interactions are truly fascinating and heartwarming to watch, as it is in addition very relaxing as it also represents the ups and down life has. \\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Aria: The Animation is not big, and is by no means necessary; in fact, it fits well with the story to have a better and more realistic fleshing out of a handful of characters, than to have an excess of those. It must be mentioned that the fleshing out is limited and nothing outstanding, as well as character development itself. The characters are simple and have distinct personalities, that fits well with the setting and different relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat however stands out in Aria are the character interactions: these are very well presented, in a realistic and soothing manner. These are heartwarming and varied, nothing overly dramatic, which relay simple messages as enjoyment of the simple things of life, or realization of your own flaws through your environment and relationships with the characters. Which leads to other great aspect of the anime: the females are in no way sexualized, which is a huge plus to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspect that was really soothing and amusing to watch were said interactions: these were often witty and funny that managed to make me smile, and sometimes even blurt out quite often, which was something unexpected. These can be in addition quite emotional as well, as viewers observe how some of the characters are affected by their environment. What also struck me was the fact that the anime didn't seem to focus on Akari, rather her friends and companions as well.\\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Aria: The Animation (ha, animation) was well done, character movements being fluid, at times even being surprisingly well done. The art style itself is average, but fulfills its purpose well, having distinct character design and well drawn backgrounds that represented well the world and atmosphere the anime was trying to convey to the viewer. Another bonus is the smooth transition between the introduction and opening of the show, as well as the ending: it never felt an abrupt change.\\n\\n\r\nWhat however really stands out is the soundtrack used: besides the wonderful opening and ending songs that matched well with the story, were the individual OST's used. These were particularly of high quality to what the show was trying to convey, in addition to not being overused throughout the show. The voice actors performed their role well, matching well with the personalities of the characters and was relaxing to listen at.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nWhat I initially thought to be a boring show about Venezia and how to become a undine, proved to be so much more interesting and relaxing than ever expected. The narrative and interactions with the characters, the humor and wonderful OST did a fantastic job to have a wonderful experience. The fact that it was no \"cute girls doing cute things\" type of show, in addition to females not being sexualized in any manner, was a huge bonus to the show. It certainly lacked in character development and having any type of story which I usually am no fan of, however the story set out what it meant to do.\\n\\n\r\nSome may wonder why I only gave it a score of only 8 despite all the positive things I mentioned in the review: this is mainly because nothing really happens, it is purely oriented on slice of life with no goal apparent. World building was a bit lackluster as well. I could recommend to anyone with an interest in the slice of life genre, just don't expect anything groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Aria the Animation is not an anime for everybody. It's perceived as boring to many people, which is understandable. There is little action here and the plot is somewhat slow and aimless. There's also little moe compared to other slice-of-life anime. I should also mention as this IS set in a utopian society, there won\u2019t be nearly as many sad emotions as happy ones, so those looking for a realistic anime should also not expect to find it here; Aria is blissful if nothing else. However, if you are in the mood to watch something relaxing and heartwarming, Aria the Animation would be a perfectchoice.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting takes place in the Utopian society of Neo Venezia, in the planet of Aqua, a terraformed planet filled with water. Though it does take place in the future and is classified as \u201csci-fi,\u201d Neo-Venezia often feels like more of a past, halycon world. It centers on Akari and her friends Aika and Alice as they set out on their journey in becoming prima-undines, the greatest undines (or tour guides) in the region. \\n\r\nThe overall plot is not linear though trio do have a goal in mind (becoming prima-undines), it is not the prime focus of the anime. Rather, each episode is its own adventure, and by this I do not mean the kind of adventure like a hero\u2019s quest to slay the evil dragon.  Instead, it is the adventure of Akari discovering the wonders of Neo-Venezia that are yet to be found. She meets new friends and experiences the many joys of friendship and the love of those close to her. Through its loveable characters and serene and idyllic environment, Aria the Animation manages to transform things usually mundane and perfunctory into something heartwarming and beautiful. Each episode leaves behind a warm, fuzzy (and inexplicable) feeling in your heart. Some also leave a hint of sadness as the trio realize that their lives currently filled with euphoria will not last forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Aria the Animation are all likeable and fit perfectly in the anime, adding to its lovely atmosphere.  All the characters start their name with \u201cA,\u201d though I\u2019m not entirely sure why. Though the characters are likeable, they lack relative depth (and little character development) and stick to their portrayed characters (to some people, to a repetitive extent). However, I feel as if this isn\u2019t too bad of a thing, as Aria the Animation stands out for its simplicity and the characters add to that unique trait. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Aria the Animation was captivating, and was a considerable factor in what made Aria the Animation\u2019s atmosphere so magnificent. The portrayals of the city and background were beautiful throughout. The amount of detail was consistently impressive, which is paramount to creating the impression that Neo-Venezia is a real place. In fact, the team in charge of creating Aria and its art traveled to Venice in order to create the most accurate depiction as possible; needless to say, they succeeded. Though there were some chibis here and there, the characters were generally nicely designed. And praise the lord, no moe in sight. \\n\\n\r\nA little downside to Aria\u2019s art is that it\u2019s not in high definition (at least not yet, perhaps the Blu-Ray will change that). And while this lack of video quality is limiting, it never prevents Aria from creating the vivid landscapes and magnificent spectacles that Aria is well known for. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was amazing as well, and it blends well with the anime. The background music added to certain scenes helped maximize its effect to the fullest extent, and each piece of the OST was aesthetically astounding. The sound is one of the most astounding parts of the anime, and are of utmost importance in creating its atmosphere. The OP and ED were just some of the amazing songs, and after finishing Aria the Animation I would recommend checking out the rest of the album as well. \u201cRainbow,\u201d in particular, is one of my favorite songs I have ever encountered in any anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of Neo-Venezia itself plays a fundamental role in Aria. As previously mentioned, the detail of the surrounding environment bring life to the picture, and the decoration of buildings and scenery in the background bring Neo-Venezia a sense of place. One of Akari\u2019s greatest joys is learning more about the wonders of Neo-Venezia. As the audience, we follow her in her quest of knowledge, as we visit new places and meet new people throughout the episodes, we begin putting together the picture of Neo-Venezia. By the end of the trilogy, Neo-Venezia is nothing short of a fully fleshed-out world, leaving behind a certain touch of sadness as we experience the dreamy world one last time. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all else, it is through its atmosphere that Aria works its magic. The result of a perfect combination of the plot, the setting, and the audiovisuals, the atmosphere of Aria makes it what it is. Aria is almost always cheerful and uplifting, warming the heart to its very core. Yet it is also calm and relaxing, evoking a sense of tranquility. This atmosphere is the inner core of Aria, but it is also what makes it a hit or miss series. You really have to \u201cfeel\u201d the atmosphere of Aria to enjoy it, and as this is the case, Aria often comes off as soporific to those who don't feel the same.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation was an amazing anime, and I greatly enjoyed it. I recommend it to those who enjoyed Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou or any slice of life fanatic. With its lovely character crew, stunning audiovisuals, and blissful and relaxed atmosphere, Aria the Animation gives you a feeling of contentment and tranquility.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, don't expect to be at the edge of your seat in every episode, because you won't be. Rather, sit back and relax, as you slowly drift into the world of Neo-Venezia...\\n\\n\r\nI decided to end this review with a song that, while trite, I felt encapsulated Aria:\\n\\n\r\n\"Row, row, row your boat,\\n\r\ngently down the stream.\\n\r\nMerrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,\\n\r\nlife is but a dream!\"\\n",

            "content": "Story\r\nThe story is unique, in my book. I mean, who thinks of making a slice of life on Mars. That's just really original and awesome. The episodes are slowpaced and deal with the daily lives of the undines, small discoveries, new friends and so on, all of it executed in a fine manner. Still, it was a little too slow sometimes.\r\nAnimation\r\nOverall I thought it was good. Nice colours, and good character designs. And the many shots of Aqua were nice. But I still got a feeling it wasn't perfect. I guess it could have been more detailed, specially the people and their faces. But itwas pleasant still.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis is just great, there is some soothing background music nearly all the time, and it gets you really relaxed. The opening and ending themes are also nice songs, that I never skipped. There are also a lot of insert songs, and when the undine Athena sings, it's just lovely. The voiceactors are great too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI liked the characters. No doubt about it. The undines were especially great, they were so diverse, and not to forget; funny. My favourite is Akari, the heroine, there are so many things about her that are memorable, and how she behaves with the other undines is hilarious. Aika and Alice are really funny as well, and the three fairies. I must say that the sidecharacters are good too, heck even the cats, even though I found them a bit irritating at first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nDue to the show's slow pace, it took some time for me to get into it. But when I did, I liked it a lot. It's really relaxing to watch, with no action or drama, and such. Compared to most of the western media, this is really refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nA very good show, about daily life. Not much happening, but still great. If you want something different, watch this, and you're in for something good.\\n\\n\r\n9 / 10",

            "content": "The past has always been a concept of fascination and longing, sometimes even to the point of obsession. One only has to read Scot Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" or J.D. Salinger's \"The catcher in the Rye\" to see wonderful examples of stories and characters obsessed with time and living in the ostensibly golden world of the past. Humans are very guilty of this crime, we constantly refer to the good old days, we flock to ruins and ancient cities as we believe them to have an almost magical quality, we invariably ignore the words of George Orwell who once said \"contrary to popular belief thepast was not more eventful than the present\". It would seem to me that this love of the past is as ubiquitous as love itself, and so it should come as no surprise to find it alive and well in the anime world\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nAria may be a series set centuries in the future, but its heart is very much in the past, be it in its setting, its customs, its outlook or its characters. But before we get into that, a quick summary of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation is the first season of the highly acclaimed Aria series, the setting is a terraformed mars, renamed Aqua due to the now abundance of water. Here mankind has settled into a quieter existence, more reminiscent of the early 19th century than one would expect of a space colony. The main city is Neo-Venezia, a complete reconstruction of the ancient city of Venice, it is here that our main character, Akari Mizunashi, arrives to fulfil her dream of becoming an Undine (female gondolier). She soon falls in the love with the city, its people and their quiet way of life\u2026 \\n\r\nFrom this point on the show for the most part drops its sci-fi shawl and becomes much more fantastical and archaic, to the point that it becomes easy to forget that your on mars or even watching a sci-fi show at all. Instead a slow but steady atmosphere is built up and a tangible world appears before your eyes, it becomes not a story but an experience, and a truly unique and beautiful one at that.\\n\\n\r\nUpon hearing this synopsis it would be perfectly within reason to assume this series will be nothing more than a lighthearted fluffy sci-fi show with some hippy free spirited tendencies, nothing could be further from the truth.  \\n\r\nI take issue with people who label, or worse, accuse this series of being \"just episodic\", granted the series can indeed give this impression and the record of the episodic genre is not a particularly clean one, but there are many things that set this series apart from that taboo genre. One is the excellent characters which help to tie everything together while conveying the feeling that your watching real people living their lives and not just acting out a plot or random adventures. And the other is the recurring themes present in the series, in particular the theme of the past and of manmade miracles...    \\n\\n\r\nWith it slow pace, longing for the past and love of beauty, Aria manages to convey a feeling thats hard to describe, but is best summed up with the face you make while watching it, a sort of sad smile, a sardonic grin, a longing to be there but a desire to be distant, to keep from tainting its peace and beauty. From its canals and streets flooded with moonlight, its rustic buildings, the different Undine companies and traditions to the simple mailman, a world is quickly built up that soaks you in its cooling imaginative water. The show itself becomes a celebration of mankind and it ability to create beauty, but also destroy (more later). I mentioned earlier the theme of manmade miracles, this idea that man can create wondrously beautiful things if he really wants to  is extremely prevalent, after all the whole planet is essentially of human construct, the cities, the air, the water, the atmosphere, the temperature is all man and woman made. A point the show is constantly reminding us of, \"No Gods or Kings only man\" seems an extremely fitting quote to apply to this spirt, here mankind and individuals came together to create something incredibly beautiful with the result being that people's feelings and desires have actually allowed for an atmosphere where more conventional miracles can occur. \\n\\n\r\nThis atmosphere is unique among anime, or any series I know of for that matter, few come close to achieving its healing and peaceful aurora, only certain episodes of Natsume Yanijico or the manga Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou can touch it.  But do not get the wrong impression of what i mean, this is no frosted cake of sugary sweetness, superficially perhaps, but under it all there is a distinct bitter after taste, oh its subtle all right but make no mistake its there. From Akari's occasional references to the state of Manhome (a.k.a Earth, I know its a stupid name) and how \"you can't swim in the sea's of Manhome anymore\" give earth a distinct dystopian feeling, and her fascination with all the simple wonders of utopian Neo-Venezia make one wonder just what her childhood was really like back on earth, which seems to have been all but ruined by man and woman. On top of that we have episodes dealing with letters to dead men, journeys to the past and worrying about the future. Again seeing this fascination with the past tinged with sombre nostalgia which sees to permeate throughout the whole show, creating this mix of feelings, happiness tinged with remorse, joy mixed with regret, jocoseness juxtapositional with a realisation that this bliss cannot last forever...\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with themes, on to the shows central pillar upon which everything else is able to rest comfortably, the characters. And do not let first impressions sway you to believe that they are going to be moe fools splashing water on each other as the picture M.A.L has chosen to encapsulate the series would seem to suggest... \\n\r\nInstead the characters, like the show are quite subdued and not in any rush to explain to the viewer who they are. One must also take into account that this is only the first season, and the real character development doesn't come until really the late second and third seasons, all the more aesthetically so for it, but here the ground work is set for the future masterpiece, every great work of art had to begin with a few basic sketches, a few simple outlines and in a similar way that is what is happening here. At first it may appear a bit jarring and one dimensional to see Akari's simple minded fascination with everything and her close friend  Aika's constant scolding of her wonder and \"embarrassing remarks\" or to see Alicia's (her senior) ever-present smile and gracefulness, but before long they become like reassuring kisses to your soul. Besides the show quickly makes it clear that these people are far deeper than a quick glance would suppose. I have already alluded to Akari's past and the possible reasons for her fascination and wonder at Neo-Venzia but there is also Aika and her struggles with her confidence and Alice their other undine friend who struggles with the stigma of being a child prodigy.\\n\r\nBut one thing all of the three main girls Akari, Aika and Alice have in common, besides their frustratingly similar names, its that they each have a senior who mirrors them in some shape or form, the original three \"water fairies\" as they are known, who guides them in their own unique way and whose friendships and past is similar, reminding one of what Mark Twain once remarked, \"History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme\"...\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the visuals and the music of this series is to do it a disservice, not only are the visuals stunning and the music divinely/hauntingly unforgettable, but everything fits so well with the atmosphere that you'd hardly even notice that music is playing or animation happening. I hate to beat a tired drum but i must stress that this atmosphere, is the show, this strange mix of feelings and wondrous healing aurora is only possible thanks to the perfect tone setting music, while portraying the themes of the series so vividly is only possible thanks to the exceptional art, showing us this man made miracle, this rusty but alive city\u2026 Speaking of the city, you might be wondering why even bother to set this series on Mars if your just going to have a quiet little character driven series with little to no sci-fi. Well I suspect that the extravagant setting was to allow for two things, more creative freedom without the constraints of being set in a factual Venice, and to allow the introduction of certain characters and idea's such as Akatsuki Izumo a character who lives high above Neo-Venezia in a floating city and works to control the temperature to make it habitual for humans, all in all it was a paramount decision that helped to create a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nTo culminate, as with the past itself, Aria only gets better with age. Like some great golden tower it seems to rise out of its genre and set the bar for all utopian works. Making no attempt to disguise what it is or be what its not it sets its own pace and like a gentle breeze we are carried along with it. The challenges its characters face are not of a life threatening disposition and all the better for it, its love of the past and of man-made miracles provide a look into something we all feel but rarely discuss or think about. Like the beating of the tide against the buildings of venice or the rhythms of a poem, Aria seems to subtly ebb and flow between joy and sadness, future and past, the miracles of man and moments of magic, without ever losing focus of its characters or their hopes and feelings. And while Animation may be the weakest of the three seasons, it is only so because it must be, all that would eventually become a masterpiece is set-up here and the foundations of greatness firmly laid upon which its tower is built. \\n\\n\r\nLike the golden past we long for so much, Aria the animation isn't perfect, but it does open the door to future seasons, which damn well come pretty close\u2026",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThere's a lot that goes on in a day-to-day basis that can easily elevate stress levels. Rushing to work due to oversleeping or caring for a crying child bring about more trouble than was initially had. Eventually, these separate events can pile together to the point of breaking. It's at this time that a reprieve is needed. A much-earned break, that brings simple serenity and peace of mind. And it's during this mellow moment that one discovers that the simple things in life are truly precious. Aria the Animation takes this to heart, marking the start of arather laid-back journey.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation essentially follows Akari, a young woman working for the Aria Company, a tour-by-gondola establishment. Alongside her best friends Aika and Alice, they meet many different people as they aspire to be \"Prima Undines.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a word that best describes the show, the first one to come to mind is \"calm.\" Above anything else, Aria exudes a blissful feeling that washes over the audience like the waters they ride upon. Its ability to achieve such an effect is done mostly by the way in which it portrays itself. Aria first and foremost makes it its mission to avoid conflict or high-pressure situations. The \"action\" taking place never goes beyond leaves blowing in the wind; at most, riding an air-bike and paddling backwards are the extent of the \"dangers\" that take place. The norm is much quieter: a small conversation by the fire with cocoa, a nighttime look at the shining stars, and basking in the warmth of the sun at the beach are poignant scenarios that demonstrate exactly what makes Aria so peaceful.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's also more than just the scenes themselves. Each episode follows a simple format: a small talk in the beginning to present its theme, providing the evidence to support it, and finally a few words tying it all together. The majority of the themes tackled are general, and therefore apply to most people. Ideas such as taking a step back to look at a situation from a different perspective or learning to see the silver-lining are applicable to anyone. Now, the themes are not particularly powerful; not only is there a constant turnover but also, due to their overall generality, it makes many of them rather clich\u00e9. The execution is there -- due mostly to the calm atmosphere and basic approach -- but it's missing endearment or everlasting impact.\\n\\n\r\nMost slice-of-life shows end there, but Aria twists the formula slightly. Typically, this genre of anime requires a strong cast due to a weaker narrative, and therefore much of the focus is placed on the characters. However, here, it does the opposite; the world, Aqua, is what matters most. Akari and the girls, being Neo-Venezia tour guides, are tasked with explaining the setting to the tourists aboard their gondolas. But what's interesting is that it's not just the tourists gaining knowledge, but the viewer is, too. In essence, the watcher is getting the same experience as the people who paid for the trip. This sounds straightforward: they're all guides, so it's normal for them to describe Aqua out loud. And it is, but that is the beauty of this simplicity. Learning about the Salamanders who work in Ukijima that keep track of water and temperature levels, witnessing the different Undine companies, and understanding the Gnomes who are responsible for regulating the gravity of the planet comes off as completely natural because it's both the girls' livelihood and forte. While the world-building isn't always done \"on the job,\" it's delivered in a concise manner; a figurative gondola ride.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Aria the Animation is nicely done, but it seems to be missing the second part of its title.\\n\\n\r\nPutting Aqua at the forefront once more, the art style puts a lot of attention towards what Neo-Venezia and the surrounding area has to offer. Rustic bridges, multi-windowed houses, outside cafes, prominent statues, and narrow canals really do make it look and feel like the Venice it envisioned. At the same time, the colors and lighting are very soft, adding once more to the calmness of the package. And when the anime is looking to inject some comedy here and there, the girls adopt different faces -- Akari's becomes rectangular-like, Aika's becomes cat-like, and Alice's becomes fish-like -- to good effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are actually rather interesting. Besides just the varying hair styles and colors, of important note are the Undines' attire. Consisting of a white cap and gown, laced with the color of the company they represent, the outfit is both futuristic and classic. Alongside them are the goggled, jacketed Woody, the formal Akatsuki, and the short yet cloaked Al, each of whom fit the look of their respective roles nicely.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is usually about average, when it is present. The problem lies in the aforementioned refusal to do anything even remotely with their bodies. A lot of talking and sitting is had, meaning most of the animation is comprised of moving mouths or shifting positions slightly, with the occasional over-exaggeration. On top of this, the camera purposefully provides more scenic views of Aqua to accomplish two tasks at once: less actual animation and more environment viewing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Aria the Animation play their parts, but not much more.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is a young girl who works for the Orange Company. Initially isolated due to her lack of empathy, she learns the value of friendship through Akari's way of dealing with others and their predicaments. In other words, Alice begins to go \"more with the flow,\" enjoying what life has to offer now; she sees that that is a much more rewarding way to live. Extremely talented in the art of gondola controlling, she becomes a pseudo-rival to Aika, motivating each other to perform better during training. Above all, while she rarely speaks, she isn't afraid to speak her mind, letting others know precisely how she is feeling should she be pushed to do so.\\n\\n\r\nAs the \"head\" of the Himeya family, and subsequently working for Himeya Company, Aika is a proud and determined Single. Her best friend is Akari, and from this relationship sprouts her most famous phrase: \"No sappy lines allowed!\" Idolizing Alicia but loathing Akira, Aika comes to understand two vital lessons. One, that people are complex; just because someone acts a certain way doesn't mean that the extent of their person has been discovered. And two, life isn't always about working or training; everybody deserves to have fun from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the up-and-coming Primas is Akari. With her unending happiness, affable personality, and beautiful optimism, she exemplifies kindness in all of its forms. Working for the Aria Company, she cares for the President of the same name while receiving wisdom from Alicia. As the lead, she experiences every motif firsthand. Cherishing memories, believing in miracles, and providing help; each message given throughout the anime fits wonderfully with Akari's softhearted ideologies. Interestingly, Akari literally goes into the past in three, separate instances. The clue for why this occurs is found in the third, when Ai -- her Manhome friend and messaging buddy -- also goes with her. And it is love. Not love for the people she doesn't know, not love for her closest companions, but love for Aqua itself. Above anyone else, Akari understands what the world is and what it can offer. In short, Akari knows that it's love that makes a difference.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, there is an intriguing comparison to be made between the trainee and master pairs. When looking closely, there exists a similar yet dichotomous relationship for each individual coupling. Athena and Alice are both prodigies, but the former is known for her singing while the latter is known for her rowing. Akira has a harsh outer shell but is soft on the inside, as opposed to Aika's outwardly composed yet inwardly critical self. And Alicia listens while rarely speaking, but Akari can always be heard providing some poetic line. The young women have the Three Great Water Fairies teaching them because they complement what each lacks: confidence, balance, and patience, respectively. While their influence has yet to fully latch on, the purpose for their connection has not.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a rather beautiful song. It starts with gentle singing, and is followed by the tapping of drums and soft violin. The vocalist is given the opportunity to demonstrate some prowess through nice vocal range, providing the audience with the \"winding down\" that is needed to watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is a strange step down. In comparison, it is rather lame but can still be quite catchy. The fun guitar, more plain vocals, and background singers give the whole piece a tame feeling that fits the show but doesn't have the same power as its counterpart.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, like the events and art alongside it, further adds to the soothing feel of the show. Guitar-playing, simple piano pieces, whistling tunes, and caring violins are interspersed throughout the entire experience. Everything is quite slow, following the crawling of the story itself. However, at certain points, there are played more lyrical-heavy tracks that detract from the anime and its overall goal of keeping easygoing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, the performances involved are mostly above-average. Eri Kawai, as the singer for Athena, was always captivating to hear. Erino Hazuki as Akari for her kind way of speaking, Sayaka Ohara as Alicia for her motherly inflection, and Chinami Nishimura as President Aria for her unintelligible but cute sounds; each deserves a special shout-out.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the show, it really did give me that sense of being \"chill.\" That the happenings going on to Akari and the gang were so regular and sweet that it became quite difficult not to be at ease. Unfortunately, some of the moments were unemotional when they should have been -- Akari delivering Ami's letter and Akari seeing her snowbug friend off at the start of winter are some that come to mind.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the segments are not particularly engaging, but it can be quite humorous when it wants to be. Akari's usual \"Ehh?\" replies after being scolded by Aika, Athena's clumsiness, and Alicia's constant use of, \"My, my\" are repetitive, but were usually able to make me smile. And this goes for every character; they have their shtick that is used quite frequently yet never really feels overdone.\\n\\n\r\nHeading in the right direction, Aria the Animation, for the most part, accomplished what it wanted to begin. It's calming, it's funny at times, and most of all it's simple. While the characters are weak and both sound-work and animation could see some improvement, the story and art help to alleviate some of the issues. All that being said, I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Akari, Aika, and Alice will be showing me next in the city of Neo-Venezia.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, master of calm, general and forgetful themes, figurative gondola ride\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice art style, interesting character designs, about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, play their parts while holding mirrored relationships\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, relaxing, somewhat funny, with low emotional investment\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Yes, I think Aria the Animation is mediocre. I'm saying this with thrown chest, and proud gaze, that I watched as much as I could stomach, and finally shown myself mercy at 10 episodes mark.\r\nStories are just weak, and it's not the \"there are no boobies and guns blazing, and no one is punching someone\" weak, it's a \"nobody gives a single fuck about this story, and it's not written well enough to be interesting\" weak. I've seen my share of slice of life, no-drama anime, and it's my favorite, which is why I tried watching Aria, so don't shit me with your \"hurr durrit's animu for acquired tastes of elite individuals, not bleach fans\".\\n\r\nALL of it's characters have annoying catchphrases that they try to force into every single thing that escapes their badly animated mugs (i'm looking at you, alice. I'm fucking looking at you. fuck your dekkai everything.), the main mascot is just ugly and retarded (it took me 2 episodes to determine it's actually a cat, and only thanks to characters explicitly saying that it does belong to felis catus species).\\n\r\nSlice of life genre itself exists as a testament to superior ability of storywriters, who manage to make day-to-day life interesting, soothing and fun to watch, a concept the creators of aria obviously failed to grasp.\\n\r\nAnd before nostalgia templars move in, no, this anime doesn't deserve any bonus points for being 10 years old, nor it's \"quirkiness\" can be appreacieated only by \"not kid audience\", as there are many, MANY shows with better stories than this.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \\n\r\nshow is mediocre at best, and if there are any hidden values or qualities making it worthwhile, I certainly couldn't find them.

            "content": "We all live in a very fast paced world.  To us humans, time is everything, and every second used is a second that can be used to be more \"productive\" or \"better\".  Because of this, we become creatures of habit, living cogs that let life fly by us without a moment's thought.  We don't really take time to enjoy the smaller things in life, to just sit down, relax, and take in the finer things that can go unnoticed.  It is here where we have Aria the Animation, a gem from 2005, and the beginning of the whole Aria series.\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's note:  If I write down any sappy lines, I'm sorry.  It's just hard not to do that for this series.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8.00/10): Aria the Animation takes place in the world known as Aqua, an alien planet settled and created by humans as a sort of \"second planet\" in order to satisfy the human population.  It is here on this newly created blue planet where we have Akari, our protagonist in this series, settle down on the new planet in a city named Neo-Venezia, a city built based on the city of Venice in Italy.  Here, she learns how to be a Prima Undine, a gondola driver, as she begins her life on this new and peaceful world.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Aria is a very simplistic story, focusing more on the day to day lives of the characters here on the planet of Aqua, mainly the lives of three specific girls, as they train themselves to be Prima Undine.  For any given episode, the characters in the series essentially live their lives on this planet, not really doing much else aside from dealing with the trials and tribulations that lives throw at us.  \\n\\n\r\nFrom the storyline of the series, it's quite clear that Aria is not really a series that deals with conflicts as heavily as many series these days do.  The tone of the show is calming, serene, and overall, less dramatic than your average anime.  With the whole of its runtime, the show never tries to deviate from its relaxing tone.  As a result, the overall feel of the show is very unique because as you're watching it, you never really get the sense that anything dramatic will happen.  Now, with zero conflicts, does that mean that this show is bad?  Quite the opposite in fact.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tackles the smaller things in life.  Throughout the whole show, we are presented with scenes of the characters doing what people generally do in life.  Spend time with friends, doing chores, eating a meal, and even going on an outing; stuff that you would normally see in any given slice of life show.  However, Aria takes this idea one sep further.  Aside from just seeing that characters experience these moments in life, it also takes them into account, putting them in retrospect to one's own life, affirming how we as people can miss the finer details, the smaller experiences that we sometimes fail to see.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the show does a decent job at world building.  Rather than just letting the setting of a different world be just a stated fact, Aria the Animation adds in to that by spending a good chunk of its runtime explaining the world's history, tying that into its life affirming story, making the two work in conjunction to make the story a lot more cohesive and adds to the experience.  \\n\\n\r\nWith all these good points, what is there to be said badly about this series?  Well, more or less, it's the calming atmosphere that the story has.  Because this show is quite slow and doesn't possess any lingering conflicts, Aria can at times be rather boring.  (I found this to be the case at times.)  It's not that the show itself is bad, it's just that watching something so slow can leave someone to be desiring a little bit more.  Of course, that's not true for everyone, but personally, I couldn't watch more than a couple episodes at a time simply because of how I sort of lost interest sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of that side effect of Aria's wonderfully calming atmosphere, the story of Aria is still very exceptional.  It puts the things in life that we sometimes forget, forward, giving the audience a feeling of appreciation of things that we may often forget.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Some World building\\n\r\n+  Very calming show\\n\r\n+  Fantastic themes\\n\r\n-   Calming factor can leave some people bored (To combat this, I suggest watching 2-3 episodes at one time rather than marathoning.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.99/10): Similar to its story, Aria the Animation doesn't have very complicated characters, each of which really following their own certain characteristics and never really deviating from the traits that they were given at time.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Akari Muzunashi, the \"main protagonist\" of this series.  As the only apprentice in the Aria Company, Akari plays off as a very simple girl, wanting only to enjoy the time that she has on Aqua, frequently throwing out \"sappy lines\" in order to express her gratitude or overall enjoyment of the time that she spends with the people that she's grown to know in her time in Aqua.  Akari also plays a very crucial role in this series by writing these letters at the end of every episode, essentially writing down any given episode's important takeaway, bolstering the things that the episode is talking about.  It is because of this specifically that I think Aria excels at what it does, because the things that it talks about can really be an eye opener at times.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Aika Granzchesta, a Single from the Hime Company, a different gondola company that rivals the Aria Company.  Being the girl that is somewhat more outgoing than the other two, being very proud of her own abilities, Aika is the second girl in the series you meet with her classic line of \"No sappy lines\" (or any other variation of that phrase.)  In addition, to round out the trio of girls in this series, is Alice, a Pair from the Orange Planet company, (And no, she does not belong to a pest-control agency.)  acting as the youngest of the trio, working to hone her abilities as well as spending time with her senpais from the other companies.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from these main three girls in this series, we also have their instructors Alicia, Akira, and Athena, who serve similar roles to their apprentice counterparts, as well as the three feline company presidents.  In addition, there are side characters that appear every once in a while, filling in the gaps to make the series feel more populated and overall more enjoyable as you see the personalities of all the characters come together and just live life.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters themselves aren't really that complicated.  Like general slice of life, the traits that they are given at the start of their appearances persist with them throughout the whole of the series, with slight growth every now and then to show progression.  Above all, what I think is most interesting is that these characters are very memorable.  They're not very complicated, but even if they don't show up for a while, the characters that you meet aren't really that easily forgettable, which I find to be a plus for the series.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very simple characters that are easily memorable\\n\r\n+  Good character dynamics\\n\r\n+  Good side characters\\n\r\n-   Mostly one note characters in a sense\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10 and 8.78/10):  The art for Aria the Animation itself is honestly a surprise to me.  Because of its age (being that it's a 2005 anime), I had originally thought that the artstyle wouldn't stack up and would be less graphically well done as the anime that we see as of now.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was rather well animated.  T\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle reflects the feeling you get from the anime of serenity and calmness.  There are no horrendously bright colors, there isn't any dark brooding colors, and there is certainly no ecchi.  Aria's artsyle itself is very classic, being an individual looking style of animation that is bother memorable and very well made for its time.  (Like seriously.  I saw things in 2014 that looked worse than Aria.)  It's a very simple style of animation with enough detail to make the city of Neo-Venezia look beautiful, and it just simply...works.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, for comedic feel, every one of the main characters has a \"second face\", where they all have a specific expression that they make whenever they want their audience to bust a funny.  (Just a detail that I found to be quite amusing.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, Aria boasts a very well made OST that reflects the feel of the series.  In addition to having \"Undine\" and \"Rainbow\" as the OP and ED respectively, the series has a very calming and beautifully crafted soundtrack that adds to the calm feeling of this series.  As for the OP and ED, Undine, its opening, is a very calm and serene peace that I bet can calm any spirit, sounding like flowing spring water as it wafts through your ears, cleansing you of any hardships that you may be experiencing.  As for Rainbow, its ED, it showcases a very cheerful and bouncy feel that is very upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.  Overall, this soundtrack is beautiful, a masterpiece that is timeless.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Very good animation for its time period\\n\r\n+  Very classic looking artstyle\\n\r\n+  Exceptional soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.00/10): When I first heard about Aria the animation, I was always puzzled why it was so popular, and why it was so revered as a classic.  After some time, I decided to watch it, and boy, am I happy I did.  The themes of the series were very well delivered, and I couldn't stop wearing a smile on my face when I was watching it.  (Above all, I listened to the OP and ED every time.  That doesn't happen very often.)\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  A very big yes.  Aria showcased something that anime for me has been lacking for a while; a simple story that is at the same time, very powerful.  Coupled with the beautiful soundtrack, the great animation, and some pretty memorable characters, there was hardly anything about this series that I didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like was how at times, I admit, I felt kind of bored watching this series.  With its lack of conflict, Aria's peaceful tone can sometimes be overwhelming.  As a result, marathoning this show can be difficult for some.  Apart from that, I have no complaints.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAfter finally watching the legendary Aria the Animation, yes, I would recommend people to watch this series.  Contrary to anime today, there is no fanservice, it's deep without needing any drama/melodrama, it's a simple story that doesn't poke itself into any other genre aside from Slice-of-life, and above all, it is considered to be a classic.  This show is an instant cheer-up, and to this day, is still a very revered series.  So, if you haven't watched this series, I highly recommend you do.  It's an experience that you won't want to forget.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score:  8.35/10  (I'm sorry if there were any sappy lines.  I can't help it!  :S   )",

            "content": "Aria the Animation is the first of three anime series adapted from the Aria manga and focuses mainly on introducing the main characters - Akari, Aika and Alice - and the world of Aqua and Neo-Venezia, without going into much depth and while keeping an extremely relaxing and soothing atmosphere.\r\nFor that reason the pacing of the first series can be a little off-putting to some viewers, as the new elements each episode adds are developed only to a limited scope (the introduction) and it might feel as though the whole series is nothing more than cute characters, chilly backgrounds, and relaxing BGM, especially to thoseviewers who aren't used to the slice of life genre - The Animation is more about taking it easy than actually developing the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, the animation is quite good for a slice of life show, and the amount of effort put by the creators can easily be seen in the backgrounds, water motion, coloring, and the detail of the buildings and scenery. The beautiful art, together with the soundtrack, which is the most memorable out of the three seasons, really creates atmosphere and attempts to draw the viewer in without much effort.\\n\\n\r\nAria accomplishes the hard task of keeping characters simple while maintaining a degree of originality that allows them to always look fresh; the interactions between characters feel natural and both the comedy and dialogue are presented as though they are part of normal conversations, rather than a crafted script beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I enjoyed the series immensely and would highly recommend it, I must admit the series might not suit everyone's tastes, especially if the viewers are expecting realistic characters and situations because NOTHING is realistic in Aria.\\n\\n\r\nThe utopian setting and the unrealistic character portrayal are instruments the series makes use to achieve its main goal: healing. Aqua is a world where everyone is nice, and the dialogues are often sappy (to the point of making recurring jokes about it).\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation slowly invites you to join the characters in their discovery of that beautiful world, almost as if Akari invited you for a ride on her gondola.",

Taking into account the fact that this is a slice-of-life, the pacing is so wonderfully planned out, and the episodic stories so well-rounded in themselves, that one should never find oneself bored out of his wits from exploring the wonderful place that is Neo-Venezia.\r\nAnd that is a real feat.\r\nART\r\nOh god the background is beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.\r\nAnd accurate (mostly) too, as some guy from Lonely Planet frequenting Animesuki and going on a (mostly business) trip to Venice found out.\r\nDecent effort was also made for the characters. Only 1 obvious QUALITYimage ever jumped out at me after the third rewatch and for the most part there were no flaws. Though it'd have been nice if the faces were drawn anywhere nearly as detailed as in the manga. But then that'd have to be budget-busting stuff.\\n\r\nProduction IG was roped in for the CG but it didn't seem all that impressive to me, though it certainly was enough to add to the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nAnd here, sir, is where this anime is made into the ideal therapeutic experience. Every single piece of music in every single scene is perfectly fitted together. The decision for Choro Club to cut a major album out of this meant the resulting music was absolutely, astoundingly brilliant. Coupled to the show, it was outstanding and perfectly fitting, while on its own it can be summed up as &quot;perfect&quot; (...that is, if you don't hate the Brazilian-style choro and the relaxing tune). The late Kawai Eri worked her magic into the very fitting OP that was soothing to the ears, while Round Table as usual put in a brilliant song for an ED. The insert song was pretty catchy too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nHere unfortunately I'll have to put in some criticism. Most of the characters are simply not well-developed. We get to see the character of every, uh, character, but not much else. The sempai especially. There's almost no background story on them. Plus, they all seem so eerily close to perfect, it's unreal.\\n\r\nThat aside, Akari elevates herself to Goddess status as we see through her beautifully clear eyes the wonders of her world. And it is through her that the stories turn out so beautiful, so wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nNeedless to say I loved this to bits. Every episode left me yearning for more wonderfulness, and I eventually wasted a whole day marathoning it when I should have been rushing for projects. It's guaranteed to lift your spirits, relieve whatever pressure you might of had, and turn any pessimist into a perenially happy optimist.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nA beautiful slice-of-life anime all in all, and considering the popularity this had at its airing, way too under-watched. This show needs some love; spread the Aria lovin'.",

            "content": "I have been told from many different internet sites that Aria is the greatest of all slice of life animes. While slice of life animes usually don't attract me, I decided to give Aria a try. I just finished the first season over about a week and still have the buzz of the last episode all over. It definitely was a unique watch.\r\nAria takes place far in the future. Mankind has successfully given Mars a habitable environment, complete with the same force of gravity as Earth's, an atmosphere that is equally capable of absorbing blue light, massive oceans rivaling Earth's, and a very diverse biolife,all imported from Earth and successfully multiplied. They have also created an extremely fast and efficient method of travel between Earth and Mars and now people come to Mars for vacations. Despite all this, the world of Aria is very rural, with very little technology at all. The only pieces of technology I can recall, in fact, are the space shuttles that float in the sky, the mailman's flying motorbike, data cards, along with a very old type of phone.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on the lives of three undiines [girls in training to become primas (girls who row the gondolas in this water filled planet)]. These girls have almost no problems in their lives and are free to train and relax as the days pass. Its peaceful, relaxing, stress-free, but I can't say I was really able to relax that much while watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe story by itself is fine I suppose. Many of the middle episodes were a little too slow and calming, but the end episodes were good. The problem is that the whole time I was watching this anime, I was dying to know answers that were never going to be answered. For example, there was one episode where the whole girl team goes to a uninhabited island and have a good time at the beach. Somewhere in there, one of the girls says \"I'm so happy to swim in the ocean. Nobody can swim in the oceans back at Man Home anymore so I've never done it before\". Ehhhh is that so? Exactly what happened to the oceans back on Earth that they are no longer alright to swim in? Is there mass pollution on Earth now or are the oceans too cold or what? I really wanted the anime to stop focusing on peace on Mars and transfer to the potential mayhem happening on Earth. It never does though, and I am left with no answers.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I am one of the people of enjoy this kind of anime. I really just don't see the charm in it. Why are slice of lifes so typical in lacking any elements that make other anime so great? An anime can still be a slice of life anime and at the same time contain drama, action, adventure, Plot. Slice of life doesn't have to equate to happy go lucky peaceful animes featuring an almost all female cast doing almost nothing (looking at you Lucky Star). But at least Lucky Star was humorous, this anime was not. It was basically a sleep inducer, with almost every episode almost putting me to sleep. A better adjective for this anime would be 'boring'. I'm sorry but in such an interesting science fiction world such as this, I want to see some science fiction, not some slice of life sleep inducer. \\n\\n\r\nLots of people like this type of anime though, so I'll go ahead and recommend it. However, people like me, who like a core plot directing the anime with action, humor, drama, romance, or whatever will flee from anime like this and go back to other slice of life animes with those things, such as NHK Ni Youkoso, Toradora, or Clannad.",

            "content": "If I were to describe this anime with a single word, the word would probably be \"boring\". Surprising perhaps, given that it lies in the \"Good\" region of my rating scales, but that's what this anime is. In this case, \"boring\" isn't used so much to label \"Aria\" as an unwatchably dull anime (though to some it probably is) as to describe what actually happens in it, which is absolutely nothing. For \"Aria\", in many ways, represents the very essence of a slice-of-life anime.\r\nIn \"Aria\", there are no evil villains to fight, no complicated plots to untangle, no philosophical conundrums to contemplate... just about theonly interesting detail in \"Aria\" is that it's set on Mars, a Mars of the future that resembles Venice with its abundance of water and gondolas. But don't let this exotic location fool you into thinking this is a setting for a futuristic sci-fi anime, because you'll be sorely disappointed. That detail is pretty much restricted to being background information - as far as the anime itself is concerned, it may as well be set in Venice, as it doesn't really do much with the Mars bit.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond its settings, \"Aria\" is plain to such an extent that no measurable aspect of this anime stands out in any way: the animation is ok... in a boring way; the music... despite often having unconventional melody progressions that gave it a distinct feel, only manage to leave an impression of being boringly good; as for the content... it's virtually non-existent. Every episode is pretty much just a case of the unremarkable characters going about their mundane daily tasks - they barely even qualify for the adventure-of-the-week description. But then, this is what the slice-of-life genre is all about, right? Yes, \"Aria\" may not be the most interesting of anime, but it does deliver in the department where this kind of anime is expected to deliver, and that is in the \"heart\" of the show - the part that gives it that indescribable feel good factor. This is epitomised by the last episode, which is a very typical slice-of-life open ending where there's no grand finale, but there's a vague sense of temporary closure at the end, with the option of extending into a second season wide open. But despite the lack of a climax, it does leave you bursting with a wonderful glowing feeling inside, with a twinge of sadness that comes from reaching the end of the series that you've become fond of. It's this that allows \"Aria\" to soar above the sum of its very plain parts.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I have a soft spot for Aria, I'd hesitate to recommend it to many people. A lot of them would probably fall asleep watching it. Other slice-of-life anime have additional aspects to keep you watching - Genshiken has its comedy and entertainment values; Planetes has its humble (and also not so humble) heroics and intense drama; Paradise Kiss has its eccentricity and interesting relationship dynamics... \"Aria\" doesn't have any of these things, and instead offers the viewer a simple yet hard to quantify pleasure that comes from watching a slice-of-life that's been distilled down to its purest form. It's something for the connoisseurs of the genre to slowly enjoy. And if you ask them why it's good, their response would probably be the same as mine: it... just is!",

            "content": "For starters, this anime has quite literally changed my outlook on life. Having gone through a fair amount of distress this past year, I was looking for something that could bring some tranquility to past few hectic months. Watching Aria brought me this, and so much more, and I'll explain later on.\r\nThe story takes place in the 24th century on a terraformed Mars (now called Aqua), where Akari (our MC) strives to be a top class Undine in Neo Venezia. Truly sticking to the nature of SoL, past the first 3-4 episodes Aria the Animation is almost entirely episodic, yet it never feels boring orpointless despite the direction of the plot. Each episodes digs into each of the characters and their relationships with one another, and how they grow as people. It feels real, and it feels natural. Even the trope beach/hot springs episodes are extremely well done with 0 pandering fan service, truly sticking to the themes and ideas Aria is presenting.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound is where this show really starts to kick in. The art style is absolutely superb, with lush colors used in every frame and character design being memorable. The animation is very high quality as well, besides some of the chibi moments that feel very jarring next to the usually-smooth animation. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Sound, Aria hands down, has one of the best OSTs around period. From the relaxing OP to the light-hearted ED, and even all of the background soundtracks playing throughout the show, the music for this show is astoundingly well-realized. It is an absolute perfect fit, both for the Italian setting and for the overall mood of the show. Special mention to the OP which is, by far, one of the best OPs I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also surprisingly well-developed for the plot being as lax as it is. All of them are likable, and they all serve a purpose in the plot. Special mention to how well developed Aqua is as well, almost every plothole that could have come from essentially setting Venice on Mars was covered (i.e weather being artificially controlled, gravity being regulated undergrounds by gnomes etc.). You can clearly see how much thought the author put into not only the characters, but Aqua itself. \\n\\n\r\nAll these elements fuse together to form an experience unlike any other. No drama, no action, no conspiracies, no villains, just a tranquil story of three young girls realizing their dreams, little by little in a beautiful world. You really do feel bliss when watching this, even more so after going through some rough times. Aria teaches you to look at the bright and positive things in life, a profound yet very forgotten message in the current industry saturated with excessive action and drama. \\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation is definitely as least worth a try, if for no other reason that it just being different from any other show out there. A masterfully crafted anime, held back by a couple of technical issues, it truly is a heart warming and positive experience.",

The story does however give a romantic view of the world, from small things to big, and is quite beautifully done at times. One of the points that I really like about the story is how the concluding episodes tie back to the beginning to give the story a very wholesome feeling. \r\nAnimation: The artwork was splendidly done and really enhanced the mood. I noticed that the series' depiction of water especially, a central theme to the show, was beautifully portrayed and could be mesmerizingin its serenity. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is elegant and fits well with the rest of the anime. Although not outstanding on its own, it really works well to create the tranquil mood that defines the series so well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were solid and thoroughly enjoyable. The main trio's personalities worked well in tangent with one another which provided for a lot of fun scenes. The supporting roles were also developed well and they contributed to the anime's overall theme and storyline. Every new character that Akari met had something to add that gave more meaning to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite a lot of solid good points about the series, the slow pace was honestly boring at times. There wasn't enough to draw me in and give me incentive to continue watching other than a desire to see watch a beautiful story. The story didn't have much tragedy, romance, or action through which to provide excitement and could feel lacking at times. In the end, the slow pace really impaired my ability to fully enjoy the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: There were many points I liked about the story and several others I disliked. In the end though, the story synthesized its elements into a well-developed piece. The story, art, sound, and character development all came together to produce a beautiful and idealistic story that leaves you feeling relaxed and content.",

            "content": "Aria has garnered one of the most interesting reputations I have seen. Put on such an impossibly high pedestal yet still as polarizing as any other slice of life series if not more so makes it an oddity that one can't help but be curious about. And, if nothing else, Aria is a very unique challenge and experience for just about anyone.  \r\nAria is about a group of girls who want to become the best professional boat rowers possible. There is a lot of food and tea in between.\r\nAria, for better or worse, doesn't change much throughout the course of the series. Forme this caused an already episodic and formulaic series to wear thin even faster. Most of the episodes end with a message about appreciating the beauty of life, or something similar, accompanied by scenery porn and calming music. While this is admittedly quite comfy, it would work infinitely better if the series didn't run fifty-two episodes and one OVA because there's is only so many times you can impress me with an all too similar life lesson and scenery porn, Aria.  \\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying slice of life series usually don't have much in the way of story in their attempt to be as feel good as possible. While not unexpected Aria sacrifices more than most since it actually does have clear overarching story with the three main characters trying to become Undines. Unfortunately this only gets sporadic focus throughout and ultimately isn't as rewarding as it should be. Instead we get a a lot of episodes focusing on the main characters doing something outside of that main goal and there is really no sense of progression. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the meandering structure I did enjoy the main characters of Aria a good deal despite not knowing if I wanted to pat their heads or violently face fuck them. A wise man once told me multitasking is key. They all have good characterization as well as cute designs, which is all that they really needed to have for this type of story. Like many other things in Aria they can come off as overly sappy but I suppose that is part of the charm.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from that there are a few minor issues I had with Aria. I didn't quite understand the character of Alicia who everybody in the series has a massive lady boner over. She is portrayed as ethereal and perfect which I suppose is setup for later episodes which show her face some of her faults, but these are less faults than they are sympathetic and endearing traits thus making the odd direction of her character pointless or at the very least not as effective as it could have been. The super natural elements in the series seem like they are abandoned just as quickly as they are picked up which I assume there is more to them in the manga but we are left with what we get in the show. Finally, the dialogue gave me diabetes. I know that just kind of comes with the territory of Aria but it really is over the top sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all my misgivings with Aria I still find the series incredibly thoughtful and charming. The atmosphere is unmatched and with the soft colors of the art and serene music the series is just on another level when it comes to aesthetics. Though I probably will never appreciate Aria and the slice of life genre as much as most, I can't help but enjoy the simplistic beauty of its tranquil and contemplative moments. And really, what else does Aria aim to do if not that. Well, besides making  your friends and family think you are a closeted gay. \\n",

            "content": "Aria the Animation and it's sequel's are pretty much held up as the pinnacle of slice of life anime. If you take a look at the reviews and the overall rating it's nothing short of glowing. Take my review with a grain of salt, since I'm definitely not a big slice of life person.\r\nTake any literature class, or even high school English, and you'll most likely come across the plot diagram. Introduction, rising action, climax and resolution. Conflict drives almost every story, and in terms of anime it tends to be on a fantastic scale. The end of the world, the fate of a nationor even  the ebb and flow of a romance in a harem or romantic comedy anime. Well, aria doesn't really have any conflict on a fantastic scale. In fact, it doesn't really have conflict at all. Any conflict that does pop up is quickly resolved to demonstrate is easy going mood. It barely suffices to have the skeleton of a plot. Akari, a girl from earth, travels to a terraformed mars made up entirely of water specifically to the the city of neo-venizia. It's essentially just venice on mars or Aqua as the show calls it. Akari is trying to become a professional gondola tour guide within the city, and the show supposedly follows her in trying to achieve her goal.  The pace is glacial, and most episodes are only tangentially related to Akari trying to become an undine if at all (said tour guide). Most episodes are simply the characters traveling the city by gondola in between ordinary activities.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any kind of real plot irks me a bit but I'm getting ahead of myself. It's a slice of life show, one shouldn't expect it to be plotted like a spider web. Slice of life shows are about character interactions. Unfortunately, though initially likeable, the cast doesn't really develop much beyond basic archetypes. Among the  undines in training, there's the driven, uptight type in Aika, the reserved and mysterious Alice, and the airheaded, unfailingly cheery Akari. For their teachers and seniors, there's the motherly, gentle type in Alica, and the strict older sister of Aika in Akira.  There's a curious lack of any major male characters perhaps attributable to the show's heavy use of moe. The three trainee undines often react and act the exact same way, with blushing, cries of 'ehhhhhhhh?' or 'ahhh' and deformed cartoonish reaction faces. A few have their own catch phrases and keyed reactions to situations. That's really about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with a ghost of a plot, a very basic character set, what exactly does aria have to keep you watching? The show actually turns out to be more than the sum of it's parts. The music is laid back flemenco and is very good, if recycled a bit, and the art depicting neo venizia is usually beautiful, except when it takes a nose dive in quality due to poor backgrounds or shoddy animation. The show has a genuinely calming effect and manages to be very charming. It takes away any stress you have and transports you to a world free of any kind of strife. So is aria a good anime? Probably. A masterpiece? Not in my opinion. If you're looking for deep characters, action or a complex plot, steer far away. It's not to me what it's cracked up to be, but judging by the other reviews and the overall score I probably can't tell you whether you'll like this or not. In any case, it's decent enough to warrant at least a few episodes worth of viewing from their each viewer can probably decide if they want to continue with the rest of the Aria franchise.",

            "content": "\"Lots of things change with the flow of time. But there are things that never change. Things that are precious because they change, and things that are precious because they don\u2019t change\u2026 Both are precious. Don\u2019t you feel the same?\"\r\nI watch anime to enjoy myself. Every fan does. I have horrible days, awesome ones, but always after, I find myself opening up my Laptop and watching some good ol\u2019 anime. You see, there\u2019s a special charm to the medium. A unique aspect that distinguishes it above all the rest. Whether it be its exclusiveness to its respective origin country, or just the shows in generalthat can only be made from the minds of the Japanese, I always find myself appreciating the wonderful world that anime has given me. I haven\u2019t watched enough shows for my opinion to matter, if I\u2019m being completely honest, due to time constraints and a filled-up schedule but whenever I come across an anime that I love, I obsess over it for days, weeks, even months. With this obsession comes my desire to write a review that expresses my thoughts and why I cherish the said anime with all my heart. And it seems Aria the Animation is one of the few that have rekindled this feeling.\\n\\n\r\nEnter the beautiful world of Neo Venezia, the city of a now-populated, man-made planet named Aqua, which to no surprise to its name, is filled mostly with water. A Utopian wonderland filled with the bustling life of citizens and tourists alike, Neo Venezia is also the setting of which we meet our main protagonist for the first time, Mizunashi, Akari. Akari is a bright and cheerful girl, always optimistic in the face of conflict. Due to her positive mindset in life, she is constantly greeted with many characters who all come to be drawn into Akari\u2019s liveliness. Among them are Aika and Alice, two other trainees who share the same goal as Akari. To not just be a Prima, but to also surpass their seniors. In the show, Prima\u2019s are basically tour guides who introduce newcomers to the wonderful city of Neo Venezia in their gondolas. In reality, Neo Venezia could very well be Venice, located in Italy, with most of its area being filled with water and the presence of gondolas being felt everywhere. Think of Neo Venezia as the future of Venice.\\n\\n\r\nThrough Akari and her friends\u2019 desires, they come across many kinds of obstacles but always overcome them in one way or another. They help each other as friends should and trud through it all no matter how tough the going gets. Yet, the problem that matters most is not about achieving their goal and becoming a Prima, it\u2019s when their expedition ends and they are forced to part ways due to the fact they\u2019re all in their respective rival companies. An internal conflict that lingers in the mind. What happens when they become Primas? Will they be able to maintain their friendship? Will reaching their destination bring more hardships? Questions like these are addressed in the anime in a way that stirs up drama genuinely, not with any half-assed melodramatic exaggeration and tons of crying, but with actual sincere emotion that is believable and convincing.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode begins with an opening monologue that leads to the pleasant and calming Opening, Undine, a song so beautiful, you could end up trying to sing along with it (at least that\u2019s what I did). Each episode is devoted to fulfilling its role as individual short stories, every detail matters and every bit of character interaction helps in developing the characters, making them realistic and authentic. The main appeal from Aria the Animation lies in its overall message. Every episode contains a neat little adventure that almost always gives us a reason to appreciate whatever we have in life. Not just that, but the Ending song perfectly wraps the story without leaving any bitter aftertaste. Aria is not merely just an (extremely) well-done Slice-of-Life. It\u2019s an entire experience. The city of Neo Venezia is brought to life with the help of Akari and her friends. Every character has a purpose, each and every one of them all have one unique facet to their personality that is needed for the show to thrive. It is solely dependent on its characters, and while each individual story that Aria carries around with it is certainly intriguing and required some actual thought, it\u2019s the characters that bring this anime to the pedestal that it is now standing at. They are the reason the community praises the Aria franchise to be the truest to the Slife-of-Life genre. That is the core of Aria. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike many other SoL\u2019s, it does not rely on any sub-genres or anything exciting for that matter. There is nothing spectacular, nothing that makes you leap off of your couch. Due to this, when reading the premise of Aria, the show can come off as \u201clackluster\u201d or \u201cuneventful\u201d. It\u2019s common to think that there isn\u2019t anything really special about Aria, that it\u2019s wholly plain and not worth your time. But if you\u2019re willing to embrace this show for what it is, for what it wants to offer us, the audience, that\u2019s when you can fully understand why it\u2019s repeatedly regarded as the best SoL to exist. Period. In Aria the Animation, you come to appreciate the little details, the tiny things that may have just been forgotten, all these little aspects that surround the anime are all connected and realised in some way. It persuades us to appreciate life, OUR lives, for what it is and what it could be. Aria inspires us to be able to reach for what we initially thought was impossible. And that was what drew me into embracing Aria and fully loving what it\u2019s all about. I\u2019ll be honest. It does take a while, I admit the first few episodes seem like a slow trip, you might even want to stop watching as it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll go anywhere, but trust me. You\u2019re about to be in for a sweet ride. The show takes its time and it does so for good reason. Every episode matters, no matter how unimportant it may seem while watching, as the show begins to come to an end, everything will fall into place and you\u2019ll come to realise that every single element ties itself together forming a united whole.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not all. Aria doesn\u2019t just give us compelling and wonderful characters, it goes above and beyond with its animation and soundtrack. Aria the Animation makes good use of its animation and despite it being old and outdated, it still accomplishes its purpose. Every beautiful scene is dazzling and alluring, showing that even an anime that's more than ten years old can still hold up against shows such as Violet Evergarden and Koe no Katachi, known for its beautiful exterior. The same can be said about the anime\u2019s music and sound design. The songs are attractive and easy to listen to. The sound is the backbone that supports the show and brings the emotions to its full scope. Consisting of piano melodies and string instruments, each minute of music causes Aria to be 5 times as elegant as it already is.\\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation is an overall endearing, soothing ride that casts a net of serenity on the viewer, utilizing its animation to its full extent and incorporating a soundtrack that can only be described as perfect, with a graceful Opening and a lovely Ending that surround the show. Because of its calming nature, there\u2019s a certain way of watching the anime for you to fully enjoy it. First, take a shower, grab a cup of coffee, and press play on your Laptop. There needs to be no distraction. Nothing else needs to be in your mind. With that, you can truly acknowledge this masterpiece. I can understand why it might be easy to dismiss Aria completely. Some people just can\u2019t get into it no matter how much they\u2019re persuaded. Others just don\u2019t like Slice-of-Life. Every person\u2019s taste is different. Anime, like all other mediums, is subjective. It\u2019s art that can be interpreted in many ways. But if you\u2019re a fairly new anime fan or just someone who wants to get into the genre of Slice-of-Life, then Aria the Animation is the perfect introductory piece. This anime will remain as one of my all-time favorites and I\u2019m eager to watch the two next seasons of the franchise. To put it simply, Aria the Animation is gorgeous.",

It does not look like life at all. \"Aria\" series is a different world, which drags you into like a tornado. And once you are there, you don't want to go back.\r\nObjectively, nothing happens for the whole 53 episodes  + OVA. There is, literally, no action or plot. At all. What we see is a girl's everyday life in Neo Venezia, an imaginary city in the future at Mars. She works as a tour guide, hangs out with friends, etcetc. Why is the show so facinating?\\n\r\nThe answer is atmosphere. I don't know what should you do to create such an atmosphere of love, innocence and peace. Artwork, pretty simple but stunning in its simplyness, along with soundtrack create something impossible... You turn this show on and your daily worries melt away into the endless ocean of peace. Aria is a cure for my soul, the best medicine I ever found. I keep rewatching this show - slowly, gradually, repeating my favourite episodes... I don't want to leave   Neo Venezia. Ever.\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite anime. I would put hundreds if availible. 10/10",

            "content": "Sometimes, the mundane and ordinary can be the wellspring of life's greatest stories. Aria takes this idea, bludgeons it mercilessly, and runs with it. Strangely enough, it works. Actually, bludgeoning likely isn't the best verb. Sedating is more suitable, since Aria is probably the most relaxing show in recent memory. \r\nAesthetically, Aria the Animation is a gorgeous series. From the pristine water that the gondolas so gracefully glide over to the well kept stone buildings, the city of Neo Venezia is brought to life by its splendid colors and vibrant tone. There's a feeling of life and soul breathed into it, yet it's calming inits tranquil beauty. History is exuded from every structure, almost as if Neo Venezia has existed for well over a thousand years, like its Earth-born counterpart. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well designed and well animated, all unique and memorable enough to endear themselves to the viewer. Even the bit characters are given appearances that don't feel entirely generic, which is a definitely plus. During its more amusing moments, the characters' faces turn into some of the best chibi faces ever brought to anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe audio, from the stellar voice acting to the soothing background music, is simply divine. While the music wouldn't likely stand on its own, it's the perfect complement to the series, bringing to life the soothing rhythm of Neo-Venetian life through acoustic guitars and soft singing. \\n\\n\r\nAs a slice of life series, the story aspect takes a backseat to the characters and their interactions with each other and their environment. Strangely, it's when the story veers away from everyday life that Aria's at its weakest. The few supernatural-themed episodes are a strange departure from the norm, not really having any bearing on the overarching plot. \\n\r\nWhile it can be argued that they're perfectly fine since the whimsical  overarching plot is broad enough in scope to allow the encompassing of a few more somber subplots, I still feel that Aria is at its slowest during these strange few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a slice of life anime, the characters are the focus. The three undines in training, Alice, Aika, and Akari, are supported by their superiors Athena, Akira, and Alicia respectively as they go through and explore their daily lives, becoming ever closer to achieving their collective dream of becoming master gondoliers (Undines, as they are known). \\n\\n\r\nTo make for even more lighthearted fare, the main trio are usually accompanied by the absurdly cute President Aria, a cat who has the sheer force of personality to carry an entire episode by himself... and seems to be harboring a deep secret that has only been alluded to. Animals have been put in series for the sake of cuteness overload and comedy before, but President Aria is arguably the best around.\\n\r\n Most will probably argue this, and I can see why. He's obnoxious enough to deter some viewers, though it didn't work on me in the slightest, so fair warning if you find small animals who yell random gibberish annoying beyond belief. \\n\r\nNow, before I write a dissertation on why I think President Aria is the best cat in history ever (He has a sailor hat! What's not to love in a cat who wears a sailor hat?), I'd best wrap things up. \\n\\n\r\nAria the Animation is a fun little series that does well in breaking away from the mold. Original for slice of life fare, with a few deviations that I felt detracted more than added anything, it will sedate you with its snail-like pacing and soothing aesthetics. Some may be put off by this, but rest assured that it's not nearly as boring as it sounds. Also notable is the overall optimistic tone. While the mood may drift into the melancholic at times, it never loses its upbeat charm and aforementioned whimsy. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I haven't viewed its sequels yet, and I do plan to, I can comfortably say that Aria sits toward top of my favorite series list. It does Slice of Life differently, and it does it well. Like an actual gondola drifting through the canals of Venice, Aria is relaxing and slow, the whole purpose being an observation of the everyday life of the people.\\n\\n\r\n Never before has a show left me feeling completely at ease, unburdened by the hardships of this world. 9/10 stars",

            "content": "There's just something magical about the way Aria the Animation strikes a chord deep inside you. It doesn't show up in the typical manner nor in an easily discernible way, but slowly, inexorably, steals your heart and before you know it, you've fallen in love with each and every character. There is no moe; there are no crazy plot turns; there is no artsy action. Instead, Aria the Animation goes deeper than you think; judging a book by its cover becomes less and less relevant when diving into the waters of Neo-Venezia. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI really, really wanted to label this as \"slice of life\" andmove on. But honestly, I couldn't - not because there actually was a crazy, flip-flopping story you'd normally expect, but because every episode was fresh and had meaning, not just some slapstick humor and that was that. There were several heart-warming moments; nothing so sad it left you depressed and nothing so happy it seemed fake, but lessons like enjoying the little things in life really hit home here. This wasn't an anime of plenitude, but instead one of deeper meanings below a facade of happy, go-lucky trio of girls. The constant references to Italy, Italian mythology and beliefs, as well as traditional food and drink kept the atmosphere lively and had a unique sense of familiarness, despite this being on a completely different planet. In general, though, I loved every last bit of every part of the story. There wasn't a plot point I didn't enjoy. The warm feeling inside after each episode made me think that this really hit the spot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is slightly older than I would have liked, but the animation was excellent. Nothing was skimped, from the beautifully recrafted Venice (hence the name Neo-Venezia) to each character's uniform ornamental arrangements. I couldn't find anything wrong with the animation style; everything was beautifully crafted and honed to near-perfection. There were frequent changes in style, such as when a character said something sarcastic, their faces become much simpler, to reflect such humor. In my book, any sort of simple, yet elegant art gets a darn good score anyway. Plus, nothing was ever an eyesore, and every scene generally had something new in it, reflecting the continually entertaining and changing environments the characters interacted in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really shine in this anime as well. There wasn't too much of an airhead, too much of a tsundere (kind of) or any sort of typical anime characterizations; no, this was something much more special. Each character fit the role laid out for them almost too perfectly. Every personality was represented, albeit in a toned-down and subtle sort of way. I found it hard to find a character I hated, for crying out loud. Every anime has that one character you wish were dead or flying into another dimension, forever forgotten and alone. But this was something unique, something I found vaguely comforting that I wasn't willing death, but life. Their daily interactions, though very wistful, belies a childlike tone and lessons of life, things rarely found in anime nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this was n interesting amalgamation: a blending of whimsical, steampunk-like science fiction, slice-of-life, some slapstick humor and genuine life lessons really impacted my heart. I kept feeling all warm and tingly inside, something you should be prepared for with plenty food items, because the food on here looks dang delicious. Generally, though, this deserved a high-ranking score, because of the lack of things I had problems with. I never had to pause for effect, never had to stop watching it because of boredom nor because it was too much; but it floated along at its own pace, never quite hurrying, yet never becoming tedious. It was interesting to say the least; I highly recommend it. Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed, sorry, I was getting all gushy.",

It is only fitting that a guide is written for a story about Aqua's guides (I think).\r\nFirst off, let me state that this is a guide to the -entire- ARIA collection, i.e. Aria the Animation, the Natural, the OVA and the Origination. I feel that it is necessary for the entire collection to be presented together since a potential viewer should watch the entire collection instead of just any one part.\r\nI won\u2019t be describing what ARIA is about; it is well-described in the synopsis and other reviews. You too, would want to bethe one discovering and understanding what ARIA is about to you. \\n\\n\r\nLet me first give you a rundown on what you can expect from ARIA: \\n\\n\r\n1.\tYou want to take a break from the usual action-packed and angst-filled anime. ARIA is a slow-paced and smooth-sailing anime. Every single episode, except the ending episodes of Origination, is standalone, but all of them will contribute to creating your vision of the world of Aqua. ARIA will not invoke strong emotions and desires, only a sense of calmness and curiosity.\\n\\n\r\n2.\tYou want the feeling of happiness. ARIA epitomizes happiness. Every single act or occurrence or thing that appears in ARIA will bring happiness to its characters. And happiness is contagious.\\n\\n\r\n3.\tYou wonder about the state of the world today, and think that the future of the world is bleak. ARIA will make you think otherwise. ARIA is filled with so much faith in its people and so much optimism in its future that it can probably bring hope to someone in (insert worst situation you can think of).\\n\\n\r\nHow you should watch ARIA in order to enjoy it?\\n\\n\r\n1.\tWatch it in order. Aria the Animation will introduce to you the setting and its characters. Aria the Natural will take you on a tour of its world and the many mystical happenings that occur within it. Aria the Origination will delve and develop each character to the fullest before concluding.\\n\\n\r\n2.\tDon\u2019t rush through the story. Savor every moment and every scene, like tasting a glass of well-aged wine. Heck, re-watch an episode if you want to. I sometimes tend to replay a single scene over and over before being satisfied of the feels it was conveying.\\n\\n\r\n3.\tOpen your mind and your heart. Don't be too quick to dismiss something as impossible, stupid, or lame. ARIA will contain varying degrees of these elements, and you should look deeper into the abstract meaning of each of them instead of judging hastily. \\n\\n\r\nExperience and maturity are essential in order to appreciate this collection to the fullest. Hopefully, ARIA will change your perspective about life.",

            "content": "I like Mushishi. I like Hetalia. I like Fruits Basket.\r\nI don't like Aria the Animation! \r\nJust to make one thing perfectly clear, I'm not above of SoL-shows or even a shows that have no over-branching story to give! As long as the premise and the characters are enjoyable, I can pretty much swallow any kind of SoL-experiences there is... mostly! When I was adviced to pick the Aria up, I was spectical, yes, but still optimistic enough to give it atry, and after the experience that I would describe at best as a \"4 hour nap-time\", I'm greatly dissapointed!\r\nFirst of, what is good? Or \"good\",if you will. Well... the art is decent, often times quite pretty, actually! The Aqua as a location is pretty to look at, but not very innovative nor interesting to look at. I mean... when you have a Mars turned into \"secon Earth\", there should be imo something much more interesting to invest into, than snowflies and bizarre cats for crying out loud! The sounds of the characters are really mellow and soft - read; I hate them! - but the music is really beautiful, expecially the opening songs and endings, with their lovely animations - I just adore those \"brush-painted\" endings so much! Is there anything else to praise about?\\n\\n\r\nWell... not really.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really bare-boned, shallow, and completely lacking any kind of conflict, or suspence. Which is to be expected, I quess, when the story revolves around these three clones... I mean \"truly individual and/or unique\" girls, dreaming to someday \"row, row, row the boat, gently down the canal of this not-at-all-copy-pasted-image-of-an-Venice-that-comes-to-mind-to-every-japanese-animator-that-hear-the-word-of-condola-and-ask-if-it's-some-kind-of-musical-instrument\", because apparently, the profession of the condoliers is in this world pretty much at the same level, as the supermodels and popstars... before they hit the meth.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very linear - despite it taking a place in a city, that's covered in water! - and can often times feel either quite draggy, or rushed, which is very easy to pin-point on the fact that it's a short show. I for one refuce to accept that as an excuse! I know, that if the story is good, the amount of episodes has nothing to do with it! The story told in under a 13-episodes can be amazing, if the story is good, just as the show with 50-episodes or more can be jut as afwul, if the story is bad! Aria the Animation has a bad story, and no amount of episoded couldn't have saved it from it's predicament. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so, the story didn't obviously win me over. So, how about the characters then?\\n\\n\r\nWhat characters?! There are none! \\n\\n\r\nAtleast... not anyone that I would whole-heartedly think of as a character! They're all the same - you're typical \"nice-girls\" with their sweet expressions and \"cute\" quirks, with no actual dilemmas, or flaws to speak of. They all even have the exact same goals, and what ever little personality they all have, leaves them just bland, boring, and one-dimensional. The humor is also really dry, and wears off really quickly, but it's actually not that visible, so my brain was pretty save from that one. \\n\\n\r\nBut let me swear... if I hear that \"my, my, my\" even one more time I'll...!\\n\\n\r\nThat being said... did I hate it?\\n\\n\r\nNot really!\\n\\n\r\nIt's mellow and soft atmosphere was actually quite pleasant, and a nice breather from my more common, action-oriented and plot-heavy shows with multi-dimensional characters, that I seem to favor over more light-hearted shows.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I wouldn't watch it agains, since it didn't have that same SoL-hook, that so many other shows tend to have over me. It doesn't invite me to come back and pick it up againd, which leaves me quite cold towards it.\\n\\n\r\nBut, would I still recommend this?\\n\\n\r\nSure... if you happen to ride condola for a living!\\n\\n\r\nNo, seriously!\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Aria the Animation for those, who like mellow atmosphere, aren't really into action or heavy plots, and just want something relaxing and comforting to watch, without any conflicts, drama, or villains. Those who enjoy their animes with a little bit more content, and more fleshed-out characters, this is a easy skip!\\n\\n\r\nI can only hope, that the Natural is better than this, because I really wanted to like Aria! Sadly, this isn't an promising start.\\n\\n\r\n\"My, my, my!\"\\n\\n\r\nAaaargh!!!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 6\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5",

            "content": "Antithesis of the exciting effects of coffee, \"Aria\" is an anime that leads us to a peaceful dream without ever closing our eyes, tightened in the desire to be us also inhabitants of the wonderful Neo Venice and have the chance to take a few turns on a gondola, very different from those of our, although real, rather decadent (without any offense) city on the sea.\r\nWe are in the year 2301, or about 150 years from the terraforming of Mars. While the Earth has been given the new name of Man-home, the red planet is now known as \"Aqua\" and hosts, among other attractions, thecity of Neo-Venice, or the perfect reconstruction of the Venetian capital now submerged by the waters . It is here that the adventures of our protagonist Akari Mizunashi take place, which is committed to becoming, one day, an expert Order.\\n\r\nLike the following ones, the first series of \"Aria\" perfectly shows that weaving tragic or spectacular plots is not strictly necessary to hit and excite the spectator. A dreamy and relaxed atmosphere, the magic of everyday life and extreme simplicity are the elements that are the masters in this wonderful work and that make it a product of all respect.\\n\r\n\u00a0Another essential element of the work are the sentences and thoughts of his characters, in particular of his protagonist: they are expressed with the most genuine naturalness and come directly from the heart. In the contemplation of a place or an extraordinary event, our Akari cannot help but let itself go to simple comparisons, far from complex and sought-after scripts, and similar to poems that only children would be able to compose and that adults would never have the courage to write. The occasional sickness that could derive from it, then, is wisely damped by Aika's torment \"Forbid embarrassing sentences\".\\n\r\nFirst of all, it is often pointed out how the world in which our protagonists live is an \"extraordinary miracle\": the planet Aqua, in fact, is the product of the hard work of human beings who have worked together to offer people a place pleasant and comfortable to live in. If the following series are more dedicated to exploring the streets and canals of Neo-Venice, in \"The Animation\" we often move outside the city and travel between suggestive spas, bucolic landscapes and white sand beaches. On each of these occasions, Akari cannot fail to contemplate the wonderful world that was given to her, and she will not fail to thank the people who created her and those who continue to make her existence possible.\\n\r\n\u00a0As for the adjective \"extraordinary\" I used previously, it should be pointed out that in most cases it is synonymous with \"ordinary\". Obviously it sounds like a strong contradiction, but one of the prerogatives of \"Aria\" is precisely the absence of sudden developments and striking twists. An expression that in this work would fit perfectly is, in fact, \"Happiness is in the small things\": every episode is an invitation to rejoice, to be moved, to be moved by everything that surrounds us and by the small events of each day.\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, there is no need to dwell much. These thirteen episodes have essentially served to introduce and give us a general smattering of protagonists and supporting actors, while for a more in-depth characterization we will have to wait for the following seasons. At first glance, however, they are all very nice, each with its typical interlayer and the distinctive super-deformed face (the latter, perhaps, a little too much used).\\n\r\n\u00a0The sound sector is characterized by an excellent soundtrack. After the opening theme that directly touches the heart of the viewer (able to give even a few thrills on certain occasions) we move on to the tracks, governed by the Italian popular musical instruments and perfectly remembering the Victorian atmospheres of the real Venice, enveloping the spectator more and more with its magic. Everything is never invasive and always remains a delicate outline. To finish it all, the closing theme is taken care of, more musical and sought after in rhythms than the others but always a light and pleasant song.",

            "content": "If you guys are thinking about what anime to watch next, then I could not recommend Aria enough. I've just finished watching the first season and holy shit was it beautiful. The music, the animation, the artwork, the storyline! Everything syngerized so well together. Sure, the genre is slice-of-life, but then again, so was Clannad, was it not? Once I've finished my errand that I needed to attend to, I'm so going to watch the Aria the Natural. It is a fucking beautiful anime and it makes me a little mad that such anime like Aria have now become, for lack of a better metaphor,diamond in the rough.\\n\r\nThe manga equivalent is just as good as well. The artwork is nice and it the manga does go more in-depth story-wise. However, I'd recommend watching the anime ONLY for the wondrous harmony of audio and visuals. No other anime have approached audio and visuals the way this had. Not then, not even now. That's because of the genius storyboarding: these writers knew EXACTLY what to do and they've done it fucking well.\\n\\n\r\nI rarely give out nines and tens to anime and manga series, but this one gets a clear 9.5 out of 10. It is a beautiful anime. Every episode will warm your heart and tug on your heartstrings. It is the anime that you most likely draw some connection to. The tempo is slow and the pacing laid-back. But this is a design-choice. The producers WANTED this to happen due to the inherent nature of the story. As all of you should know by now, the anime adaptation should appropriate the manga. It's synchronous ability to do just that is sublime.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it! If you're not watching anything else right now, watch Aria. If you're watching something else right now, drop that shit and watch Aria instead. Nah, I kid! Finish that first and then watch the anime.",

Atmosphere, yes, because this is the main thing that Aria sells.\r\nFirst,\r\nLet me tell you upfront, aria is NOT for you who is a die-hard fans of action, tension, thrill, and suspense.\r\nSecond,\r\nAgain, read the first.\r\nI'm telling you guys this because Aria has none of them. Like i said before, Aria sells the atmosphere. \r\nAria tells the story of Mizunashi Akari and her adventure becoming a Prima Undine. Almost every ecounter, conflicts, and adventure is meant not to amaze you, but to make you realize how importantsmall things are, and relaxes you at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe visualization of Neo-Venezia(Yes, Neo, because the real Venezia is sunk here.) is very sublime, so imaginably fitting with the sci-fi concepts that Kozue Amano presents.\\n\\n\r\nThe great visualization is accompanied with amazing scoring and sound tracks. As i'm writing this, the ending song of Aria, Rainbow, is playing in my head.\\n\r\nThe opening song, \"Undine\", is very hypnotizing, hits me in the very heart of mine. I dare you, when you hear \"Undine\" you will think of Neo-Venezia and it's beauty.\\n\\n\r\nNot that this series is perfect, i almost fell asleep too many times watching this, which is not a good thing, but hey, i fell asleep not because it was boring, but because it's \"Aria\", which makes it a good thing on the other hand.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this with your heart wide open and feel the magic of Neo-Venezia, and then you'll see small things around you differently and appreciate them more.",

            "content": "Feeling a little melancholy? Had a rough day at work? C- on that last history exam? If so, Doctor Penguin recommends a good dose of Aria the Animation to cheer you up. This delightful slice-of-life story is sure to have you smiling again as you follow along the training of three young undines (gondoliers) on the newly terraformed planet, Aqua (Mars). Known for its sleepy pace, serene settings, and whimsical nature, it is sure to delight any slice-of-life fan. Fans that require more story driven shows or action sequences will obviously want to avoid this one. On to the breakdown! \r\nStory: 5/10 - Slice-of-life showscertainly aren't usually known for their complex plots and storytelling. Aria is no exception to the rule. In fact, it probably contains the simplest plot out of any show I've seen. The show is episodic in nature, with each storyline propelling the characters toward a new life lesson. I enjoyed that the writers for the show avoided overly sentimental or sappy story lines for the most part. They kept the same lightheartedness atmosphere consistent through the entire series. I still have to give it a low score though, because like I said, there's not much story to be found.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 - The art style works well for the anime. The artists use lots of bright vivid colors to reinforce the cheerful atmosphere. Their recreation of Venice was competently done, but I think they missed out a little on a chance to really make the settings spectacular. Character designs were fairly traditional, but they worked. The only oddity in the show was the design of President Aria, the mascot for the Aria company. What the hell was up with that cat?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - The voice actors (I watched the Japanese version) were average. No one performance stuck out as incredible or awful. The soundtrack fit well with the animation, but isn't something I'd listen to as a standalone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 - The characters above all were very likeable. That's probably the most important aspect of a slice-of-life series. I found myself emotionally connected to them throughout the story, which is very crucial for my only personal enjoyment. If I were to be more critical each character in the show is a little underdeveloped.  I would have liked to have seen a little more back story for the main characters. At only 13 episodes, with each of those having very little plot, it's an understandable problem though. The only other thing I can say about the characters were that a few were a bit too idyllic. A few flaws always helps make a character more believable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 -  On to the intangibles... How is it that everything else gets rated 7 or below, and this receives a 9? I really don't know. It just made me really happy as I was watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "As someone who is not a real fan of shounen, sci-fi or not particularly fantasy either, Aria does not look like the show I\u2019d enjoy a lot. Or to put it in other words, the introductory page of the show with its sci-fi and futuristic elements created a completely different image in my head than my personal experience of it. It is in no way a typical example of the above-mentioned genres and it is always a worthy experience when a show transcends your preconceived ideas. \r\nAria, as the synopsis already reveals, takes place in Aqua, formerly known as Mars, a completely \u2018man-made\u2019 world. Withinthis brave new world, the story centers on a young girl who aspires to be a great undine in the canals of Neo Venezia, a place that reminisces Venice in Manhome.  Contrary to what you\u2019d expect from a futuristic show, the series does not offer a world that is a continuation of life on earth but rather a re-start, (even the names of the characters all starting with A gives us an Adam-like sense of a fresh beginning) thus, offering a world devoid of the robotic experiences of the technological urban life. Here, you are exposed to beautiful scenery of Neo Venezia, like a guest in the gondolas of sweet undines, gazing through the city surrounded by nature and the serenity that comes with it. Not to mention the relaxing music that accompanies you in every step of the way.\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of the series that I did not expect is the way the \u2018story\u2019 is revealed. If you expect to get curious about what is going to happen next, it is not the case with Aria. The whole experience is like the acknowledgement of little things in life that are more than enough to make someone happy. Instead of a storyline, the series reflects an alternative dream-like world, an anime version of Neverlamd,so to speak. The imaginary elements such as gondoliers being called undines - mythological nymphs - and the top three gondoliers being the three water fairies add to the man-made, dreamy nature of Aqua. Here, you can get away from the worries of mundane life affairs and take it easy. If anything, it is not a travel to the future but to the depths of human nature, revealing its secrets, wishes, and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nAs can be inferred from what I already mentioned, thematically, the show focuses on what it means to be human, how to appreciate the small things we normally take for granted in life and more than anything, what it means to be able to dream without any boundaries of the adult perspective on life. \\n\\n\r\nIf you need some tranquility and recharge for your soul, this show surely feels like a warm hug and the whole experience will tickle you all the way to the end, letting you take a taste of exploring the future in the most nostalgic manner possible. Wish you all a good sappy time!\\n",

            "content": "This will be the first of my series of reviews for the ARIA animes. My perspective on these reviews will be based on how I felt after finishing the season my first time.\r\nARIA the ANIMATION is the first season of the series adapted from Kozue Amano's AQUA and ARIA manga series. I will say right off the bat that this is not an anime for everyone, for those who cannot stand slow paced, happy and calm slice of life shows this anime IS NOT for you and should turn around now :P\r\nStory: In the year 2301, Mars has been terraformed into a water planet andrenamed Aqua. Neo Venezia, an exact replica of the old city of Venice, was build on Aqua. It is there where Mizunashi Akari, a girl that has come from Man-home (formerly called Earth), has arrived in hopes of becoming one of Neo-Venezia's trademark female gondoliers called undines. As a slice of life anime, there is not much of a real ongoing plot going as most of the episodes consists of the day to day life of Akari as she trains under Aria Company with her friends in order to become a full fledged undine. Regardless, each individual episode has a certain charm to it that draws you into the world of Aqua, so its not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As far as the character art goes, it is nothing incredible, but it is consistent and well animated. The real charm in ARIA's graphics are in the backgrounds and landscapes which resemble the real Venice with incredible accuracy. The sky, the oceans, and the city looks beautiful in this anime and is a real treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is without a doubt the best aspect of this show, the various instrumental and vocal songs in this show really makes you lose yourself in the world of ARIA and are just very enjoyable to listen to. Some of these songs are so relaxing you might find yourself slowly drift into drowsiness sometimes when watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Another great aspect of this show are the characters, the six main undines we are introduced all have their own distinctive personalities and they all interact so well with each other that just watching them talk about everyday events is very entertaining to watch. I would describe ach character to you but its better to just experience them yourself to fully enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm surprised I managed to watch such a slow paced show yet not feel like I wasted my time. I was on the verge of falling asleep various times watching this yet I did not hate it. There is a certain charm in this show that kept making me come back to it. And im glad i did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is a very good show, however if you decide to watch it I recommend that you DONT marathon this 4-5 episodes at a time. This is an anime meant to be enjoyed at a slower pace over a longer period of time. Watching this show felt like going a tour around a city that both fictional and real. It was a very calming experience and i can definitely say I enjoyed watching it.",

            "content": "Aria the Animation, a work that provokes mixed feelings. I was tempted to watch this show after being recommended to it by this site and after reading the reviews. I though I had found a show worth watching, but Aria was more like watching an overly corny reality show. Here\u00b4s my reasoning.\r\nI watch anime in order to enjoy many things, the art, the music, the characters and most importantly, the story. Aria has all the previous, except a well-defined story. Now, slices of life are normal for this, but many use comedy to fill in the holes. Aria just wants to you to feel alwarm and fuzzy, that is unacceptable for me. I want to feel something, be it laughter, sadness, anger or any emotion. Aria just tries to keep me relaxed with its stereotypical characters: the clumsy and kind-hearted protagonist, the equally kind-hearted tomboy and the silent, sweet girl that serves as an observer between these two.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character development I saw none, regardless of what situations they\u00b4re put through, they remained the same throughout the entire show. Now, that is not a bad thing, slices of life tend to be a bit more difficult than your average story, since they try to portray the happenings of everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nI felt no strong feelings towards the music (one of the most important things I note in any audio-visual work), and in this Aria excellls. It doesn't want me to feel any strong emotion, it just wants me to smoke a blunt or drink some coffee and relax.\\n\\n\r\nAria achieves its goal greatly: for you to feel nothing and just watch the everyday life of an unremarkable trio of girls. Perhaps that is one reason why it has such good reviews.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I don\u00b4t watch anime to experience the same kind of morbid reactions most reality viewers enjoy. I watch it for the stories, the scares, the action, (God forbid) even romance, but not for the sake of watching it. That\u00b4s why Aria scores less than average in my book.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to experience reallity anime, this might be the first, or at least the most known of its kind. If that\u00b4s the case, by all means, you might even enjoy it, but if you want to feel something, you are better off going somewhere like I did.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of this review, the reviewer has dropped Aria the Natural at episode 6.",

            "content": "I would say that this show made me feel really good at night...\r\nBut embarrassing remarks aren't allowed ;-;\r\nSo someone told me about an anime series that I had never heard of. He said that it was the greatest \"feel good\" series ever made. He called it the \"Aria\" series. So I looked it up on MyAnimeList and thought to myself, \"Holy crap, this show looks like it's boring as hell.\" The part of me that thought that probably thought that it was due to the apparent lack of relatability that this show held. I mean, it's a slice of life, but it's in a fantasysci-fi world where the planet Mars has been converted into a water planet where humans can inhabit. It follows the lives of freaking boat tour guides. How relatable can this anime get?\\n\\n\r\nAria is beautiful in the way it takes such a ridiculously unimaginable world and still makes the ride relatable. It does this through dynamic and colorful character interactions weaved in with little life lessons that we all can learn from. It's a show about enjoying life to the fullest, and it dives into themes that you have probably bumped into during your life. For example, wanting to be a hero! Or that all good things must come to an end. Or that no matter where you are or who you are, there will always be a place where you belong. Combine these lovely themes with one of the most beautiful and peaceful atmospheres in anime, and you get this serene series about life and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Calming and gorgeous atmosphere. Like said before, this is a prime example of a \"feel good\" series.\\n\r\n- Amazing cast of characters! There were no characters that I actively disliked.\\n\r\n- One of the best soundtracks in anime. It plays a huge role in setting up the atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\n- Simple yet still beautiful art. Neo Venezia just looks so cool!\\n\r\n- Great little life lessons that are executed beautifully! Makes the show incredibly relatable to, even if it's a fantasy.\\n\r\n- Kick back and relax!\\n\r\n- No fanservice! OMG!!!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- A very simple story with no thought required. For people who want a show with even a shred of thinking needed, this one ain't for you.\\n\r\n- Slow and peaceful, with 0 action. Action fans, go away!\\n\r\n- Fairly silly and seemingly pointless. \\n\r\n- This show isn't very laugh out loud and jokes can get repetitive. (It does have its moments though.)\\n\r\n- No fanservice! OH NO!!!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe premise is simple, but also pretty weird to most people. It's about Akari, a young girl and upcoming undine (boat tour guide) who moved from Manhome (Earth) to Aqua (Mars) in order to pursue that career. At first, you may be like... what? Mars? It's now filled with water, hosts a city that looks like Venice, and is actually habitable? The premise makes the setting look like it's completely out of this world, which it is! However, despite this, through the characters interacting with each other, building the world, and living their normal lives, Aria's story and themes are somehow very like our world. People live their lives, chase their dreams, and enjoy life in their own way. In other words, Aria is truly a Slice of Life. It isn't cute girls doing cute things, it's people doing normal things.\\n\\n\r\nSo Aria's story is just slice of life. What's the main overlooking theme of the entire series? That, my friend, is miracles. Aria convinces you that miracles don't just exist, they can be created by hand. Just look at Aqua! A formerly uninhabitable planet was turned into a beautiful and serene place through the power of human willpower. Nothing can get more miraculous than that. Aria's depiction of miracles is truly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAria's art is pretty simple as well! It isn't particularly high quality or anything, but it still captures the tranquil atmosphere of a fantasy world incredibly well! The character designs are also great, and the deformation during comedic moments is also hilarious! There isn't much in this show to animate, since it's a slow pace slice of life, but it can pull of high quality animations when it wants. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nProbably the best aspect of this series is the OST. It's quite literally porn for the ears. Serene, peaceful, and beautiful, the OST consists of extremely nostalgic pieces either on the piano or strings, and it sets up the amazing and easy going mood of the show incredibly well. Also, the OP and ED are some of the best songs I've ever heard. They both give off extremely nostalgic vibes and are definitely songs that I would listen to on repeat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe next best aspect of this series are the characters. The characters aren't particularly special, but they fit their world so well and they definitely carry the story. All of the characters are lovable and have their own unique quirks, and the interactions that they have really pull you in. Also, it's time to talk about their chibi deformations! All of the main undine characters have these incredibly hilarious chibi expressions during comedic scenes, and they each have their own unique one that makes them stand out! Their chibi faces always seem to be screaming out something, such as...\\n\\n\r\nAkari: Hahi, hohe, what the hell is going on???\\n\r\nAika: Hey! Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!\\n\r\nAlice: I'm so done with this bullshit.\\n\r\nAlicia: Ara ara ara ara.\\n\r\nAkira: Dafuq did you just call me?\\n\r\nAthena: Derp.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, President Aria is by far the best pet sidekick character ever conceived. He just has so much personality!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI smiled like a dork the whole way through. This series lives up to its name as the best \"feel good\" series so far, and I still got 3 more cours to watch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nA great and peaceful series that you can just sit back, relax, enjoy some tea, and just turn off your brain while watching. While this type of series definitely isn't for anyone, for those that click with it, it'll be a serene experience that you won't want to end.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \"The world is wonderful in the eyes of wonderful people.\"",

            "content": "Story: it looks like an episodic slice of life on a somewhat fantasy world, but if you rewatch this show or you are a bit smart you may notice the true: this is about a girl who arrives in a fantasy world from a couch, this is a metaphor of the \"Drug's world\". \nSadly, Aria follows our main character, Akari, who is a 15 years old girl inserted in the drug's world (probably powerful narcotics, or LSD)  by a woman called \"Alicia\". It evens gets more dark when Aria wants you to think Akari doesn't know she is affected by these narcotics \" Wheni came to Aqua ( Alice's house) i wanted to be ......( i dont want to make any spoiler) ....... but then i started to see everything of this world was awesome (probably because of the narcotics)\", every time i see it that chapter i have to pause, cry and after 4 hours i continue watching. After 3-4 chapters Akari starts having visions of a big cat (2 times more tall than the girl) and fantasy shit. \\n\\n\nThe art is beautifull and it gets even better while the anime progresses. You may not like the idea about chibi faces but trust me that chibi shit its so fucking great in Aria, I can't understand why the fuck I liked it.\\n\\n\nThe music (ost, opening, ending, what ever) is relaxing and well placed i dont know what well placed means but i am sure Aria did it. The characters' voices are great, someone told me the characters' voices were made by real people. I think if you got surprised as i was for this fact you have another reason to watch Aria.\\n\\n\nThe characters aren't clich\u00e9d and they perform as a normal person, considering they are normal people living in THE BEST FUCKING PLACE IN THE FUCKING UNIVERSE. Maybe two or three characters may dont seem like normal people the first time you watch it but they are unique. \\n\\n\nOverall: This is a weird show about chibi, adorable characters, drugs, rape and racism ( all the characters' name start with A except for the black guy, even the white cat name starts with A).",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: In the city of Neo-Venezia on the planet Aqua, once known as Mars before being terraformed, Mizunashi Akari (Hazuki, Erino) works as an Undine under the Aria Company \u2013 a professional gondolier who ferries the citizens of Neo-Venezia as well as tourists through the city\u2019s many waterways. Though only a fledgling Undine, Akari and her friends Aika (Saito, Chiwa) and Alice (Hirohashi, Ryou) have high aspirations of one day becoming as accomplished as their respective teachers, known as the Three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia. Aria follows Akari and her friend\u2019s progress as Undines and their heartfeltinteractions with the people of Aqua.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nMizunashi Akari, the protagonist of the show, through her characterization sets the tone for Aria quite well. She\u2019s highly optimistic, friendly, and cheerful all of which go closely hand-in-hand with attitude of the show. Her ability to find joy in the mundane speaks most chiefly to one of Aria\u2019s primary messages as well as the show\u2019s laid back, slice of life nature. Akari\u2019s correspondence with her friend Ai back on Manhome, previously known as Earth, serves as a useful framework to deliver thematic sentiments at the beginning and end of each episode as well as allow the show to clue in the viewer to certain jargon and in-world terms such as Sylphs, Gnomes, and Salamanders without addressing them directly, allowing the information to present itself naturally within the dialogue of the show. Akari\u2019s sentimental and caring nature makes her the perfect character with which to explore the world of Aqua as her own personality and thoughts reflect so closely to what the show tries to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nGranzchesta Aika, an Undine employed under the Himeya company and Akari\u2019s close friend, serves a few purposes within the show. Her catchphrases and sharp remarks are the source of a good deal of the show\u2019s comedy as well as Akari\u2019s comical reactions. Additionally, Aika, similar to Alice, is perhaps the more passionate of the three in regards to her job as an Undine \u2013 though they all aspire to one day be like their teachers, Aika vocally strives to be the best Undine possible though her work ethic and overall attitude may not reflect this trait. As opposed to Akari she felt somewhat under-investigated as as character with only a handful of notable traits and so I can only imagine she will be fleshed out in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of the main trio of apprentice Undines is Carroll Alice. Though she starts with a slight complication concerning her attitude I found that it was dismissed incredibly quickly rather than serving as a source of development for her and while I enjoyed Alice is a character more than most others, I felt that this aspect of her character was mishandled. Despite liking the character as much as I did, I felt she too was a little under-explored and while complex characters are not a necessity within a slice of life setting, due to the calm and relaxed nature of Aria, these elements would help keep ones attention all the better.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the important things concerning the characters that I think the show did well was in how it portrayed the relationship between the three apprenticed Undines and their mentors. The three main characters very straightforwardly mirror their seniors however I liked the fact that each characters personality felt influenced in some way by their teacher. This made the relationships feel more genuine and moreover, the fact that they were not perfect copies of each other helped reinforce their individuality as characters.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation felt fairly par for the course and while it was not flashy in its presentation it was not lacking either. The true success within this section stems from the show\u2019s setting which was executed fantastically. The setting of a Venetian city on a distant planet is presented excellently and while the city itself does not feel extensively explored, the colors and serene atmosphere of the city support the tone of the show wonderfully. Furthermore, the countryside settings lined with wind turbines and the intermittent tree-covered mountaintops add diversity to the water-dominant environment but also display a great marriage between the show\u2019s anachronistic setting and its sci-fi premise in an aesthetically pleasing way. The art of the show is certainly a point of triumph for Aria.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nAs Aria The Animation is one of the premiere slice of life shows, the story is both laid back in demeanor and episodic in nature. The events of each episode succeed in presenting a relaxing mood through the interactions between Akari, her friends, and the people of Aqua and while there are the occasional obstacles and problems that arise they are resolved by the end of the episode and punctuated by tooth-achingly sweet, optimistic observation that closes out the theme of what transpired.\\n\\n\r\nAs the characters and the world serve as the two primary points of interest in the show due to its reliance on them rather over a more traditional story I was surprised how little the city felt fleshed out and how underrepresented its populace was. The city setting is portrayed fantastically and the bustling of the crowds and of people nearby is ever present within the background of the show however its main characters only actually interact with a small handful of people throughout the 13 episodes which somewhat contradicts the show\u2019s premise and best interest. The city itself was featured in an aesthetic way on plenty of levels however I feel that the inclusion of more people would have gone a long way in presenting a slightly more  lively and believable atmosphere. For this reason, it felt to me like Aria The Animation is mostly a source of groundwork being laid for future exchanges and interactions while harboring a somewhat wanting number of these things within itself. That being said, the exchanges that do take place are sincere and heartwarming and I think the show has great potential in this regard to both develop its characters and create more meaningful interactions between them.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I think about the music of Aria I am reminded of how the art of the show supported it as I think a very similar thing takes place in this category. The music, while not necessarily iconic, blends together with the aesthetic and tone of the show in amazing ways and while no individual song sticks out in my mind, the effect of the music on the show was one of the more memorable elements of Aria.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nAria The Animation was a show with a decent number of triumphs concerning its overall presentation and attempted tone however a fair number of shortcomings in the form of lack of characterization and a more extensive cast. The show is certainly worth a watch and while the show may not be amazing it certainly lays a good groundwork for what could become an even more interesting setting with a larger and more in-depth cast.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave Aria The Animation a 6 because it was overall a decent show however it was significantly held back in a variety of ways mostly in relation to its entertainment value. Because of the slow and serene tone of the show I will look next to the characters in order to compensate for the slice of life elements of the show in order to keep my attention and make me invested in the events of each episode however as the cast is relatively small and the main characters with the exception of Akari lacking significantly in character depth and traits my attention falters and I am left with a great atmosphere wherein nothing of real note or concern takes place. The pros outweigh the cons here and the atmosphere of the show really is executed beautifully but these lackluster elements hold the show back from climbing any higher.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nAria The Animation is slice of life at its most pure and for this reason I would highly recommend it to any fans of the genre as it does a great job in many regards. At the same time, the show somewhat requires of the viewer very much what it preaches over several episodes \u2013 that one must be capable of finding enjoyment in the mundane. Other slice of life shows will often bolster their content with either comedy or certain other story elements and while these things are present in small doses in Aria it is most primarily concerned with the somewhat trivial events that take place and in this way demand a little extra from the viewer. The comedy of the show is highly reliant on the catchphrase interactions between the main characters however there are a handful of stand alone jokes though I would not recommend Aria as a comedy to someone anything less than enthralled with the other elements of the show to begin with. One final thing I will say is that the world of Aria is an interesting one that speaks to both fantasy and sci-fi simultaneously though, like the comedy of the show, I would not recommend it solely for these reasons as they are not the central point of the show even though their execution is quite great.",

            "content": "I will be straight and honest now in the beginning when writing this review in my heart i would call this a masterpiece in some ways because of all it gives the one who watches it but the problem is if i just gave it a 10 i would feel like that would be too little critical of it so i will try to give it as good and calm as i can. \r\nFirst of all the story. Again this is a part i will have problem with staying objective because if there is a city i love it has to be venice and wheni found an anime that created a perfect new venice i couldnt help but love it. It has parts of being supernatural in it but it stays true to what it is about. Aqua and the beautiful world of new venecia. It gives you a feeling of wanting more no matter how far you get in it and it can bring you to a sleepy state of dreams there you are trapped into the anime and cant help but to float with it and follow the story as they tell you everything there is about this new planet aqua and its city new venecia. Granted if i want to be more objective i will honestly say that this might feel very slow for some who watches it i will be honest there but for those who appreciate a story telling through and anime like this its capturing. \\n\\n\r\nAgain art isnt what im good at but for me it was a nice fit for the anime with a good original feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was another thing that gave the story life of its own. Granted it might make you sleeping and relaxed too much which might be a bad thing but it also throws you into a sleeping feel there you just want to listen to the soundtrack as the anime floats by. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character has something to offer they tell the story of each of the more central characters in its own time. Though Akari will stay a mystery in a way you will still love the characters with their own personal beliefs and stories. Again this anime follow what some might call my pace but that is something i hope those who watch this anime will realise and enjoy to the fullest. '\\n\\n\r\nThere was never a moment that i didnt enjoy this anime but there was always a moment there i just wanted more and more because this world felt so vast eventhough its mostly just in the area of neo venecia. There were times i even shed a tear or two because the feels you get from the characters story and music can wring your heart yet give you a laugh or two. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall i want to call it a masterpiece eventhough an objective side of me is trying to tell me otherwise i cant really help but loving every part of this great anime.  10/10 Because beautiful and calm anime like this is the rarest out there and this captures that.",

            "content": "Aria the Animation is a series of beautifully gentle science fiction tales - some are whimsical, some are strange, some are mystical and none are scary - combined with the most consistently spectacular art I've ever seen; and the music is right behind it. If you are a male under 25 years of age odds are you won't like Aria the Animation. If, on the other hand, you like sitting on a pier on a beautiful day and watching the world go by you'll probably love it.\r\nThe central character is Akari who has come to the water world of Aqua to be an apprenticed gondolierto the Aria Company of New Venice, the planets major city. In each episode she discovers a person, place or a time presented to her and the viewer as a simple treasure on her adopted planet.\\n\\n\r\n(I'm going to reference the Minami sisters if you haven't seen the series, I recommend you do as a warm up before watching Aria.)\\n\\n\r\nIf Akari was a Minami sister she would be between Haruka and Kana. The reason I mention the Minami's is that that the three other major characters are, indeed, the Minami sisters minus most of the gags: Alicia (Haruka) who is the lead gondolier of the Aria Company; the gentle, wise, patient mother figure; Aika (Hana), Akari's best friend, apprenticed to the Hime Company is the broad comic character,she insists that she must the best in everything and keeps telling Akari she should be much more serious; and finally Alice (Chiaki) is the character constantly bemused by the others, apprenticed to Orange Planet Company, she's a prodigy, several years younger than her two friends and serious beyond her years.\\n\\n\r\nOf the 13 episodes about half were wonderful to watch and about half were very good, there was one that was too talky and too static, although still beautiful to look at. Aria the Animation is kind of like a basket of beautiful, delicious fruit - only have a piece or two (maybe three) at time, don't attempt to consume the entire basket at once, take a moment to appreciate each for what it is and savor it.",

            "content": "Hello everyone i want to share with you my feelings about this work.\r\nSTORY: 1/10\r\nI gave it a 1 out of 10. \r\nThere's no story in this anime, so i can't rate something that does not exist.\r\nThe point is that it's intended to be like this, the issue is that i'm not able to tollerate (yet) a concept like this.\r\nART: 7/10\r\nThe art it's fine for modern standards, if you consider this is a work of 2005 you might realize that was something beutifull back then. I watched just recently so can't really refrain from judging with modern standards. \r\nThe animation is quite good it helps youfeel the movement of the scenery, the chibi part is also likeable since every charachter has a different \"face\" that later becomes a further charachterization of them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWell, were to start? The opening...\\n\r\nThe first episodes the opening was just a fine tune, but when i started to \"Understand\" how the anime worked, it became something more, something important.\\n\r\nI would easily say that the best part in the anime is the opening, watching a young lady rowing the boat in the vastness of the sea is just... perfect.\\n\\n\r\nTroughout the show the musics where on point, never stressfull tough (which is the point of the anime, it helps you to relax, not to get stressed).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is quite nice aswell, i usually skip both openings and endings but for this show i had very good reasons to not do so.\\n\\n\r\nIn short the sound is just incredibly good.\\n\\n\r\nCharachters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe charachters are just nice, i would not say that those are good or the core of the anime ( that is the sound ), i would also not say that the charachters were an issue for this anime. They were just, nice... quite credible, but nice. Which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe peace of senses is what this anime is trying to achieve,\\n\r\nthe peace of the anime is the issue i had with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is, since there's no progression due to the story the peace is not \"just slow\"... it's immobile. \\n\r\nThis is a very serious problem for a viewer that tends to become easily bored.\\n\r\nWhat i mean with this, is that it's booring until your peace adapts to the one of the anime, in my case it happened around episodes 4 - 5.\\n\\n\r\nI realized what the anime wanted to show me and i didnt' care anymore about the progression i just watched it for the sake of watching it.\\n\r\nI'm not saying i did enjoy it, it was just... not booring.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode 8 - 9 i evolved a bit more and i actually started to enjoy the little moments of happines of the charachters remembering part of my lifes while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOn episodes 10 i cryied, i felt a deep connection with a charachter and her moment of success become a moment of my success.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 11 - 12 were very enjoyable and i felt a deep emotion every time the opening started.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 6/10 because the firsts episodes were just horrible slow and the moments of deep connection i had barely saves that boredom.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10.\\n\r\nI want to clearly state that in the future i WILL have a different opinion about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just not mature enough to appreciate this kind of shows.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime literally shows that there's no need to search happines in your life, cause it's all around you. You just have to open your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why rating just a 6 out of 10? \\n\r\nLike i said i'm immature, yet, and i don't think it's the best strategy in my life to just enjoy the life i've right now. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that you need to fight for your success in life and the insoddisfaction is a driving factor to change and so be more competent.\\n\\n\r\nI will put this show on hold untill i will be 40 or so years hold with a stable life and a family, i will only then understand how to be truly happy from nothing.\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I'm Italian (Not from Venice tough))\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There is a thin line that Aria walks between being endearingly relaxing or mildly boring. There is little that goes on in this first season besides the odd jobs that the Aria company picks up and the daily adventures that Alice, Aika, and Akari each undines(female gondoliers) in training one day hoping to become a Prima Undine (a professional gondolier) go on. The world of Neo Venezia where they live is a peaceful and wondrous city that shares many similarities to Venice combined with a warm beach front. There isn\u2019t many serious conflicts in the show, and very little progression to speak of, but itdoes fantastic show to unwind, and refresh yourself with. The show easily can put me to sleep (in a good way), with its nice and inviting atmosphere and beautiful music. The OP\u2019s slow and galavanting pace makes the gradual vocal crescendo oh so satisfying, and the ending is just a cheery little number that leaves a smile on any viewer's face without fail. The characters are all hardworking and nice people, though a bit one dimensional so far. The repeated use of  jokes and sayings quite often like: \u201cEmbarrassing remarks are not allowed!\u201d, \u201cmy my\u201d, etc help to establish all the different characters and help to show off their individual personalities, and are cool for a while, and I\u2019m glad that they never really drive any of them into the ground. I wonder why every single female undine\u2019s name starts with an A, it can make it really difficult to remember which name goes to which face. Also the presidents being cats is a bit ridiculous though I\u2019m not sure if they actually have any managerial duties, or are instead just figureheads or mascots for the companies. Neo Venezia is an idealized utopia, explored though these cheerful young Undines in training. If you ever felt like watching the anime realized version of Super Mario 64\u2019s theme Dire Dire Docks on repeat, well\u2026. here you go.",

            "content": "Story- 8\r\nThough jarringly slow in the beginning, the story plays off as a charming stroll in the park with a friend: Pleasant, fun, somewhat exciting, yet also a little anachronistic and forgetable. The story seems to fit in with lighter fare comparable to that of Someday's Dreamers, but it does pick up and adds an interesting sci-fi twist to the world the characters reside. And though the stories have a little trouble flowing from episode to episode, the fluffy narration helps guide the viewer to the themes of both the individual episode and the overall series.\r\nAnimation- 8\r\nThe art style is plain, but crisp, effervescent, andexpressive. The direction very decisively uses wonderful pans and panoramas to give a unique sense of scope to Aqua. The water glitters with radiance, and there is a milky smoothness to the gondaliers' rowing. The animators clearly took time in their attempt to recreate Venice, and successfuly integrated futuristic technology by giving it a more rustic look.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 8\\n\r\nThough some of the characters are standard archetypes in anime, their interactions give them a distinct sense of depth. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nI thnk that this is the strongest component of the show. The score to Aria the Animation has a wonderful authentic Italian feel to it. The opening and ending themes are deliberate and flow easily into and out of the show. The voice actors are very expressive and compliment the gentle tone of the series. Finally the insert songs sung by Athena wonderfully contribute to the Venitian atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nAgain, the inherent charm of the story and visuals captivates the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\nWhile I rather enjoyed watching the series as a whole, this particular show suffered a little bit from having to introduce so many things of such importance to the series that it suffered a little. I was quite jarred by the slow pace of the series initiated in the first episode, but these flaws are also some of its strengths. Its a series like no other and I applaud it for maintaining that choice. Everyone should watch this series if only for Aria the Origination which excelled at nearly everything the series tries to accomplish while having to balance emotional investments in characters. And Alice is one of my favorite characters!",

            "content": "After rewatching the Aria, I've decided it's definately personally my favourite SoL series. I hope this review will help you decide wether Aria will be sometihng for you or not.\r\nStory? Not rated, if you want to see sometihng with a deep and profound story, atleast the first two seasons are probably not what you're after. Reasons why you may be interested though are: a desire relax and lose stress. Seeing little wonders or amazing things. Aria is basically a feel good anime.\r\nAria is mostly about Akari, a girl from Manhome (24th century earth) going by herself to Aqua (terraformed Mars which is now mostly coveredby water). By the first episode she's already been there for almost a year. So there's no \"settling in\" and the \"story\" can start right away without any delay. Akari is training to become an undine (it's not important what an undine is, but it's basically someone rowing a gondola for tourism purposes). You don't see her overcoming all kinds of obstacles because that's not what the anime is about. Instead you see parts of her life and her adventures (with her friends) in the days passing by as she's trying to become a professional.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. There's not much to be said about this. The scenery is gorgeous. Eventhough the anime is (currently) not available in any kind of resolution near HD what you see is still amazing. There is some chibi/exaggerated facial expersions stuff going on in the series (mostly when depicting people their quirks and traits), but if you don't mind it too much it should be fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is absolutely amazing. I like pretty much all voice actors (I don't really like Alice's VA but other than that I have no complaints. The music fits perfectly. I personally think Aria has the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I don't like a cappella for example, but I can't help but appriciate it when it plays. Most of the songs are soothing, calming and cheery fitting the general scenery and mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique within the anime. Every person showing up has a strongly distinct personality. Though sometimes certain traits seem a bit exaggerated, their acts and decisions are all very human. Nothing seems out of place in this aspect. The diverse cast I think can make you appriciate Aria even if you don't absolutely love Akari. Characters other than Akari also get plenty of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI also like the structure of the anime. It usually starts with a short introduction of the episode, which naturally flows into the opening (the OP gets different scenery every episode which has been made to fit the mood/story of the episode). By the time the OP fades out the it has naturally flown into the main body of the episode. It's a bit hard to explain, but if you decide to watch Aria you'll know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe first time I watched Aria, I did it within about 2 weeks. I really enjoyed it a lot. However after hearing multiple people saying that watching it slowly would be better I decided to rewatch the whole series 1 episode a day (before going to sleep). That is when I found out the soundtrack wasn't just very good, it was in fact, amazing. It also made me appriciate every episode more.\\n\\n\r\nI rated everything a 9, because I do think that Aria isn't perfect. But the small imperfections don't really matter to me as it gets compensated by being amazing as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nTo me there's no real difference between in setup or quality within the series. So what I wrote will apply to all 3 (currently finished) seasons.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this there's a good chance you're interested and didn't stop reading after the first few lines. I know I wrote amazing a lot. I did it because it amazes me how much I like Aria. I guess I could have written \"wonderful\" (suteki) instead to make it look more like Akari's point of view. You'll find out what I mean by that if you'll watch the series.\\n",

            "content": "Aria the Animation\r\nLength: 13 Episodes\r\nRating: 7.5/10\r\nGenre: Slice of Life, Comedy\r\nPlot: come and observe the life of Akari, an undine working for the Aria Company in Neo Venezia, on the planet aqua. Aqua is what&rsquo;s formerly known as Mars, after humans managed to pull up water from the surface and make the planet one that of water. Earth, known as Man-Home, has become an almost impossible place to live.\r\nAkari came to Aqua a year and a half ago and started working as an undine, or someone who steers gondolas. Join her as the makes new friends and learns more about Aqua. That&rsquo;s really it. It&rsquo;s theultimate slice of life anime. There&rsquo;s no suspenseful plot, you watch it to observe the lives of those in it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo that you don&rsquo;t get confused by what&rsquo;s going on sometimes, I&rsquo;ll explain a bit about Aqua.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are four key jobs that are essential to Aqua. They are the Undines, Sylphs, Moles, and Salamanders. Undines are responsible for piloting gondolas, and there are three main companies &ndash; Aria Company, Himeya, and Orange Planet. They transport many people from place to place, and also serve a s a major source of tourist income. There are three levels to being an undine &ndash; the two apprentice levels, which are Pair and Single, and Primas, who are the professionals. You can differentiate between the ranks by the gloves on their hands &ndash; a pair has two gloves, a single one, and a prima none. It is the want of all Pairs and Singles to become a Prima, because they can then take around customers on their own and mentor other pairs and singles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSylphs are the package deliverers. While there still is a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; mail system, most of the mail is done through the sylphs, who ride around on hover-bikes transporting the goods.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMoles and Salamanders make Aqua inhabitable however. Moles live underground, and they control the planet&rsquo;s gravity. Its very important to do so, because the strength of gravity is about 1/3 that of earth, which would make things very uncomfortable for humans to live on. Salamanders all live in the sky, in a hovering system known as Wikijima. They are responsible for controlling Aqua&rsquo;s climate, and making it habitable. The reason that they are called salamanders is that Mars&rsquo; nature by default is to be very cold &ndash; therefore, the salamanders main job is to make sure that there is enough heat in the atmosphere to survive. That being said, there are still the four traditional seasons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis- Contrary to what you might think, its actually a good anime. When I first heard of it, I thought &lsquo;this is going to be really stupid. It&rsquo;s a show about gondolas for crying out loud.&rsquo; after being prodded by a friend, I decided to watch it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhats great about this anime is that, as I said before, it truly is a slice of life anime. Its very calming to watch this and become immersed in the characters lives. The characters are instantly lovable, and each have distinct personalities just like many people in the real world have, not just the cookie cutter personalities that you find in many anime and manga. These characters are all real people. I think that that is what make this anime so great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy only downside to it is that it is slow paced. Because theres no plot from episode to episode, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of suspense contained there. Sometimes it was a force of will to watch them when I was bored, when I could have gone for something with a little more action. This anime you probably should watch when you&rsquo;re content with everything and you&rsquo;re not just watching anime because you&rsquo;re bored and have nothing else to do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\\n\r\nAkari: She is a very loving girl, and also very innocent. She takes everything sentimentally, and feels obligated to help others at most chances. However, she is prone to panic if something starts to go wrong. She is a single for the Aria Company.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: Ehh??\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAika: Heir to Himeya she takes everything seriously. She isn't one for touchy-touchy feelings, but if theres someone that she really likes, then she becomes pseudo-obsessive. She treats everything as though it were a contest, and as such mimics her instructor, Akira. She has a crush on Alicia She is a single for Himeya.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: Hazukashi serufu kinshi! [Embarrassing remarks aren't allowed!]\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlice: A prodigy undine at Orange Planet, she is a na&iuml;ve, closed off girl. She treats everything apathetically, and first time that we see her, she doesn't know how to smile. Because she is a prodigy, she was treated differently by the girls in her school class. She is the only pair of the group, yet she is as talented.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: adding Dekkai to everything [which means something along the lines of big, extreme, very]\\n\\n\\n\r\nTheir mentors are the Three Water Fairies, or those who are said to be the greatest undines that are currently working.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlicia: She is a very light natured girl, much like Akari. She loves people, and she never sees the bad side to anyone. She's best at her social skills, and as such is much wanted by the tourists. She is a prima for the Aria Company\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: Ara Ara, *giggle [Ara means My, so she's saying My My]\\n\\n\\n\r\nAkari: Much like her apprentice, she deals with everything seriously. However, beneath it all, she's really nice &ndash; the rough exterior is her way of trying to properly train whoever is underneath her. However, even with that, she still has a mean streak, which is apparent whenever someone insults her, however jokingly she meant it. She's best at controlling the gondola out of anyone. She is a prima for Himeya.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: Unfortunately, I can't find one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAthena: She is a big ditz head. She is clumsy, silent, and prone to making mistakes. However, she is remarkably perceptive, and helps usually from the shadows. She doesn't make much of an appearance, so I can't say much more. Her best skill is that of canzone, or singing [which, is quite frankly, quite amazing]\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: Again, can't find one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\nAi: A little girl from Man-Home, she became friends with Aria in the first episode, after which they became pen pals. Every episode starts off with a conversation between the two, which foreshadows/concludes the episode in some way or another. In the two episodes that she appears in person, I really don't like her. I can't really explain why though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, before you all yell at me for this next part, let me explain. On Aqua, blue eyed cats are considered to be lucky, for they embody the water goddess. Because of that, all gondola companies have a blue eyed cat as their president.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAria: A big, fat, Martian cat, he is my favorite character. He can understand human speech, and loves having fun. He is curious, as all cats are, and he likes to help out other people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTrademark Phrase: Pyun nyan nyan nya! [Ok, its basically the only thing he says. He's a cat. But i love his voice].\\n\\n\\n\r\nHime: A Persian cat [I think], like her name suggests, she has a very regal manner to her [Hime means Princess in Japanese]. She is president of Himeya.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaa: A ... weird ... cat ... who loves to bite Aria's stomach. He is president of Orange Company.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music in this anime is very calm, very relaxing. Something thats unique is that there is no opening sequence - rather, the song is played in the background while we watch the characters do stuff.\\n\\n\r\nreview taken from animeruwelz, check out my profile for more details",

            "content": "Story:  The story is for people who enjoy slower pace and marvelous execution. Like Mushishi, the plot follows a protagonist on a journey, in this case to see Akari's dream of becoming an Prima Undine (gondelier). It's goal is like a treasure hunt designed to introduce us to all the special things about Neo-Venezia and the people who inhabit Aqua (Mars). Everything from the sound and character design to the art style revolves around this world. Meandering from place to place, while giving me a place to explore along with the characters and get to know the neighborhoods and people who live there. \r\nArt:The art for ARIA is quite wonderful. Everything really fits the mood of the story and the music and let's us see the world as the characters do. The art direction, and even some of the angles used were particularly interesting to me (such as the scene in the glass shop - it seemed like the director wanted to say that the couple wasn't seeing the whole picture, or Neo-Venezia for what it was). I was also especially impressed by how well the characters mouths are synched with the sound. Everything from the shouting to the singing is right on track (which you really don't get in many anime). \\n\\n\r\nI think the elements are what are portrayed particularly nicely - the water, the night sky, a sunset, a field... it shows just how important this world is to the people who live there. The water is essential and much of the series is dedicated to honouring it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Definitely a 10! The music MADE this show for me. I had the good fortune to begin watching the show very late at night and it became a kind of nightly ritual for me, because although it is still a wonderful series in the daytime, there is something so soothing and a little sleepy about the music - a very dreamy quality that makes me completely unproductive if I watched for too long. It was like watching a quiet storm from a large window or being lulled by waves. You just felt a little lethargic afterwards. I still hear it as I fall asleep or sing Athena's songs to myself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in the show are great! You really get to know them well and they begin to feel like old friends very quickly. I thought it was interesting seeing the world through the point of view of Akari, a transplanted native, her friends, actual native, and Ai, a visitor from Manhome that Akari befriends. It made for an interesting juxtaposition of perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nMy only (very slight) selfish complaint is we don't learn enough about some of their backgrounds. They are driven by behavior, so we do learn some things, but I'm nosy and love to really get to know my current series' characters well. I am never satisified until I learn what drives their behaviors. In this series, however I found that it wasn't really necessary, so I feel like I was able to know most of them adequately. Would have been nice to learn more about Al though.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment of the series was definitely Outstanding. I didn't expect to get nearly as much depth as I did or care for the characters and AQUA as I do. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that really struck me about ARIA was how much I had learned about its world once I had finished the series. I knew about people's daily lives, their background, its traditions and annual festivals. I got to know the inner workings of how some of the tourism, trades and industry and how people made their livings (including the mail service!). By the end, I even knew some of the locals by name and some of the things that were important or special to them, which is pretty rare and wonderful in a 2-demensional animated world. The world of AQUA and Aria is like a treasure that you keep warm and safe inside you, whether you spend that time alone or share it with others.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated! ^_^",

            "content": "When i first thought about watching the Aria series I was amazed to see how many episodes overall the series has including the 2nd and 3rd season. So this made me wonder was this a series that doesn't want to die or is this show just that good that episode count doesn't matter. Well after having finished the whole series I can say that this is a slice of life series that deserves the time it takes to build the characters and make us never want to leave Neo-Venezia and the planet of Aqua.\r\nA quick description of the series, we are following Akari Mizunashi whodecides to move from Earth to the terraformed planet of Aqua (formerly Mars) where she plans to train on becoming undine in the city of Neo-Venezia, a city of canals modeled after Venice, Italy. She is an apprentice at the Aria company, which is the small 2 person company. As the series progresses we meet many characters and learn about this incredible world of Aqua.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest compliment I can pay to this series is that it makes the viewer to live in this city of canals and experience the little things in life that sometimes are taken for granted since we are moving too fast, this series slows us down and gives a relaxed view of something you've never experienced. Also the animes' director went on location to Venice to get true replicated designs of the canals and historic buildings which are replicated in Neo-Venezia.\\n\\n\r\nAkari of course is our bright-eyed rookie who is happy to be living her dream and growing up as the series moves on. The rest of the characters are good, I won't go into detail because part of the enjoyment for the show is learning each of the characters' personalities and motivations.\\n\\n\r\nAlso important to note, since this is a slice of life series there is no action/battles/super powers/ etc. There is some small magical/mystery elements but that is not related to the main characters and more to do with the city of Neo-Venezia itself. So the adrenaline junkies might want to move on to something else. But this series is pure \"feel good\" from the opening song to the closing song everything is orchestrated perfectly to make you happy and at times sad that you can never go to Aqua yourself.",

            "content": "This is probably the first series I\u2019ve ever watched that seriously sucks all the energy out of you (in a good way, mind you). Aria is just so calm and soothing, that you can\u2019t help but feel relaxed afterwards. Because of this tendency, though, this series also took me very long to complete, mainly because of me struggling against the forces of sleepiness (x.x). The calming atmosphere to this series is truly unique, which is probably why Aria has such a great reputation amongst those who like Kuuki-kei \u201catmosphere\u201d/slice-of-life anime.\r\nThe story takes place on former planet Mars, which is now called Aqua in this series.Aqua is a terraformed Mars, which in itself is quite a unique setting. For those that don\u2019t know what terraforming is, terraforming would be where a normally uninhabitable planet (without water, like Mars) is artificially made habitable by adding plants, water, and other basic necessities. This series is great at portraying the city of Neo Venezia, which is made into a truly charming and diverse setting. The scenery is great, with the all-encompassing presence of water reminiscent of the Italian city of Venice. Perhaps it\u2019s that large presence of water that makes the setting feel so calm and peaceful, and personifies this series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable part to this show is definitely the characters; the characters are so goofy, yet have a nice charm to everything they do. The dialogue between all the characters feels strangely natural, which makes this show both easy to follow, as well as fun to watch. The everyday interactions between all the characters, such as our main character Akari or the company mascot President Aria, are quite innocent yet endearing. The characters\u2019 every day lives aren\u2019t exactly eventful, yet at the same time, are thought provoking and philosophical at times, which sends a often endearing message through it\u2019s characters. Sometimes the characters fit into more generic stereotypes found in anime, but that doesn\u2019t stop the main cast from being fun to watch. The characters are well thought out, and their interactions with their surroundings really produces some genuinely great stories.\\n\\n\r\nAn oddity to this show would be how each episode\u2019s plot is almost completely disconnected with each other. I sometimes found myself clicking ahead one or two episodes by accident, only to realize I actually skipped some episodes later on. Since there is no solid continuing plot, it\u2019s very difficult to get a concrete linear storyline set in mind. I will admit that there are benefits to the disconnected story format, which allows for the introduction of more side characters and some very unique plots, so I guess it all depends on if you feel the format benefits the overall impressions of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, and the sounds of the waves, really helps complement the soothing atmosphere to this show. Production quality wise, the animation is consistent most of the time, but the actual contents of each episode is great to see, with plenty of beautiful scenic panoramic shots throughout the show. There are many who will argue that the plot is too slow and boring, but that\u2019s pretty much all dependent on what you expect from this show. If you\u2019re expecting some sort of action packed, dramatic tear inducing show, Aria is definitely not for you. However, if you don\u2019t mind trying out new types of anime, and could appreciate a more slow paced, well developed yet extremely calming and charming anime, Aria might just be for you.\\n\\n\r\nProduction Quality: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.3/10 (rounded down to a 8 on MAL)\\n\\n\r\nFeedback and comments is always appreciated.",

            "content": "*Actual title is \"Free smiles and heart warmth : the Animation.\" I believe!*\r\nWell this is prolly one of the Best SoL anime out there. But as we all know SoL Show are have their own special time you need to watch them.\r\nI will start with the sounds, which are absolutely magnificent and relaxing ones soul. The lyrics of the songs(Op,Ed,OST) are original and related to the show. Which further invite 'us' the viewers to relate to the show and characters in particular.An amazing job from sounds part! IT was relieving and heart warming. \r\nContinuing to the characters. As more SoL Shows depend on easily relatablecharacters so that the viewer can get easily absorbed. Same goes to Aria. The characters are well introduced each with its own traits and weaknesses and each of them influence the others with their unique actions. All together making a great and relaxing company.\\n\r\nAs far as Story is concerned , its pretty simple. We follow the protagonist in her daily Life and learn via her experiences valuable life lessons. You also can say that the show has some pretty serious teachings to deliver but also most of them are widely knows. (was at least for me)\\n\r\nProbably one of the most Heart warming, relaxing,relatable shows out there. It awakes wide feelings within the viewer. Mostly it tries to appeal to the innocence we all had at some point in our life but we lost it. (Tho it is terribly stupid at some points.)Also the comedy is what i would call mediocre. It is good if you love the characters and its enough to help you maintain a constant grin on your face. But not what you would call hilarious or asphyxiating. Also most of the gags are recycled sadly.Personally I didn't love it much, or laughed.But it did suffice!\\n\r\nThe visuals and animations is oke. Fitting its theme very well but personally but it definitely had some pretty weird CG from time to time. You cannot say it was ugly but you can say not entirely attractive.\\n\r\n----------------------------------Personal opinion and weak points----------------------------------------\\n\r\nIf you don't get absorbed into it, there is no chance to like this and some serious problems are created. Personally i found it lacking proper physics and common logic (but that's one of the minor problems). Also there it has some metaphors that i found out of place and the only reason to be there is to add some deep meaning and confuse the viewer.Example,\"Become one with the wind.\",\"I want to deliver my heart to you\",\"Sky full of lead colored clouds=clouded sky\", \"those silver angels will...=snow\" etc. Another thing, is that it used 'Engrish' as humour... Worst kind of Japanese comedy ever made imo.I also did a mistake... i watched it one go!... Which slowly started to feel completely bored of it at some points. (I gotta blame myself for it) but it also didn't have any certain goal so as to keep me attached. So we can say its not so attractive you must watch it out of your own volution.BUT 1 major thing i found sad. There are Lots of random stuff trying to add something intriguing stagnant into the show and confuse the plot. Also adding depth...wait..what plot?For example,Wind blowing,Shining Sea,Shining Rows,Weoponized Lens Flare Sun angles.There is a Ski-fi tag but there is no explanation to several obscure phenomena ...(time travel). Last but not least,Unless you are autistic or have some sort of serious mental illness reacting to everything with INTERJECTIONS is something bad other than cute,relaxing and comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my salt opinion as long as you get absorbed this is absolutely relaxing and it will offer you a really pleasant feeling.But its really boring if you feel detached no matter how relaxing,calming overwhelming you with happiness, enjoyment it offers.4 hours warm spent.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Anime is quoting about life and it does it good.\\n\r\n-Unique feelings of happiness.\\n\r\n-Only likable characters.",

            "content": "This Anime healed my soul\r\nStory: 9/10  About a girl who went to a water filled Mars to become an undine. A slice of life series, the pacing is rather slow as compared to modern Animes. But hey, sometimes you just have to take it slow and chillax. Just let the Anime teach how to appreciate all the little things in life.\r\nArt: 10/10 Art is amazing, this Anime is made way back in 2005, you cannot expect the same level of standard as of today, but the environment, characters and cats are welly drawn and comfortable to look at. Landmarks are distinguishing, a very warmstyle of art I would say. Feels cozy as I think back.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 The sound is astonishing. It suits the atmosphere of the Anime perfectly. 1 thing they did very well is to have a different opening scene every episode, so I pretty much listened to \"Undine\" (opening of anime) 12 times, the song sorta grew on me. Ending(Rainbow) gives off a very cozy feeling, lyrics fits the Anime really well. The OST in the Anime is marvelous as well, all of them give you a calming feeling, like lullaby. Brings wonders to my ears, they are also superb for studying or when writing a Aria review!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 I do not believe a character has to change to be a good character, in the series there are little character development, however, all the character are distinct from one another and are unique in their own rights. Most importantly, they are lovable. They pretty much remain the same throughout the series, but learning the backstory of some of the characters intrigues me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Did not finish the whole Anime in one sitting like I usually do. Took me a few days, but everyday I find myself wanting to watch 1 or 2 episodes of Aria, the Anime does not bomb rush you with plot, each episode tells a different excellent story, there is no cliffhanger, perhaps that is why I could not finish the Anime in 1 sitting. But unique idea, the characters, the music and the cats gave me a blast. This Anime is certainly one of the kind. An Anime that tells you simple, warm stories. I would not say that the Anime is deep, anyone can pretty much understand what is going on with just one watch. But the simplicity fits the Anime very well, I mean, it is to take us through all the little things in life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 I would say the Anime has outdone itself, I always disliked slow pacing Anime, but miraculously I finished this Anime, I do not think I will watch the sequel due to how long an episode is but I will definitely finish the Manga, which the Anime is based on. However, I would recommend this Anime to anyone, if you like watching Anime as compared to reading the Manga, please do check out the sequel, as I heard they are tear-jerking! However, the Anime got an 9 from me, is because the Orange Planet's cat looks weird. I like cute cats that are nice to other cats.",

            "content": "\"No sappy lines allowed\"\r\nI have one word to say about this: Predictable\r\nI don't get what's with everyone's hype with this anime. It's boring, unoriginal, and saccharine. If you are looking for a fast-paced, entertaining anime, then Aria the Animation is not the best choice to watch. Sure it may have a good idea but the story is boring and very slow-paced, not for those looking for action.\r\nStory:\r\nToo much flashbacks, expositions, and development makes this enjoyable likely for people who enjoy slow-paced slice of life anime. But I was having a hard time sitting through this as it has really bad plot issues and there's nostory anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters' interactions are pretty saccharine. I understand that the writers were trying to go for a more simple, kid-friendly series but there is little for teens to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nAi-chan was a character that overstays her welcome to begin with. The character itself is not extremely annoying but still not my cup of tea. It would've been good for Akari to interact with her for a little while but making her a secondary character who sends her e-mails was surprisingly rushed.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are annoying stereotypes. There are tsunderes and cutesy girls which filled this anime to the point of being unbearable. This could've been done with less development and drama.\\n",

Just think of it as a lullaby. \r\nPlot & Characters:\r\nThere are no major problems in the story like in actions and dramas, and there are no characters to hate. The Characters do develop, but not in a dramatic. Rather, they learn to appreciate more in life. In some ways, it is more about understanding happiness.Characters also learn to accept things as they develop and it will tear you up once in a while.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Soundtracks:\\n\r\nAmazingly, the art is very good.

Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nOh, and this is more of a review for a whole franchise as I can't be bothered to seperate them. So the \"scoring\" of this review is also more of a whole franchise scoring.\r\n\u2726Story\r\nWell, aquatic world, and we get Undines who tour people. Thats basically the premise of this Anime. We got some chraracters who simply live their daily life to achieve the goal of becoming Prima Undine. Its a very positive, cheerful and heartwarming anime, thats how I would entitle this. I'm not usually fond ofsuch anime as I cannot relate most of the time such feelings, thus why sesaon 1 got the lowest score from me, as it took some time to well, enjoy this anime. But as time passed I grew fond of the anime and well, somewhat distante gazed, longed for their positivity or any sorts of such beautiful feelings theyhad. Thus I more felt for them good.\\n\\n\r\nFirst season not much happens, we just learn about characters. Whilst second season offers a bit more progression towards their goal and third season wrapped up everything nicely. Third season also managed to tear me up at few scenes. Watching 3 seasons and simply enjoying their happiness from a distance is a tearful occasion for me.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art&Sound\\n\r\nSimple art, but nice. Also loved the gag reaction faces, those were adorable. Scenery and the world was very nice looking. And absolutely loved the music. Very relaxing and soothing for the most part.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nCharacters consist of trios. Main cast, their senpais and eventually their kohais. Main cast consists of very cheerful and happy girl, with soothing senpai. A quiet and odd girl who was my favorite and her clumsy and weird senpai. And third member is straight-man act serious girl with cute teary girl side and a very serious senpai that isn't the most feminine. Aside there there were bunch of side-kicks and somewhat nice side characters. Nice touch was that since there weren't that many characters it was nicer to grow into them. Also their growth and goals and finally achievements were such soothing things to look at. Very enjoyable characters.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nAnime that took time for time to grow into, but eventually I did quite like it. Very relaxing, enjoyable, emotional and soothing. Type of a \"mediating\" Anime.",

It's same city, old buildings but have spacecraft. its an weird anime, compliance errors facing the laws of physics and chemistry makes Aria a animeinnovative and strange.\\n\\n\r\nHighlights that deserve attention: It is a stationary anime without action scenes, exelente to relax after a stressful day at work, the soundtrack is exelence, as well as the lyrical song that thrills. This is differential anime the soundtrack, tf not for her the anime would be boring, this soundtrack makes holding the attention and we stay anxious to what comes next...\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: Aria is a anime to relax, a simple basic story, may seem confusing, it is a good option for when you have nothing to do.\\n",
