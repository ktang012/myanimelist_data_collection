            "content": "--- INTRODUCTION ---\r\nI decided to watch Yuki Yuna is a Hero after thoroughly enjoying Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, which opened my mind to what the magic girl genre could be and is one of the best series I've seen. In a nutshell, Yuki Yuna spectacularly failed at almost everything that I loved about Madoka Magica, but it had nothing to do with superficial similarities between the two shows, and everything to do with... well, a whole list of things right below:\r\n--- THE BAD ---\r\n(story, world building, characters, battles)\r\n(1) The story is the worst part. It has numerous plot holes towards the climax of the showwhen things are supposed to be revealed. There is also one notable example of a plot twist based on a completely illogical and uncharacteristic decision of one of the characters, which the authors attempted to frame in some kind of emotional reasoning but it really didn't work. It was a new experience for me: trying to watch events unfold that are based on a decision so absurd that it completely threw me out of the narrative. Other than that, the show just tries too hard to create drama and doesn't shy away from throwing all logic out of the window. Most notably the ending was a disaster. It has been pulled out of a hat with no explanation of what exactly happened, why, and how.\\n\\n\r\n(2) There is very little world building, and the universe presented just simply doesn't make any coherent, believable sense. There is no depth to the sides of Good and Evil. The enemies just want to destroy the human world for no good reason and the forces of Good are also very ambiguous and manage to make even less sense than the enemies do. Saying that this universe didn't make an impact on me like some other fictional worlds did would be an understatement -- it would imply that the show at least ATTEMPTED to create some kind of interesting fictional world. But it didn't, rather it used the sci-fi / fantasy setting as a throw-away environment for forced drama which is the focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\n(3) The show focuses heavily on the characters in a slice-of-life fashion, but the trouble is, the characters are very one-dimensional. Their biggest weakness is that the way they are portrayed often times completely ignores what humans are actually like and just shows one quality of their character in isolation over and over. For example, our main character is an overly optimistic \"you're likely to succeed if you try\", \"everything is going to be great because we're the Hero Club and we have each other\" type of character. She doesn't have another side where she behaves more human and shows fear, or anger at the tsundere's blatant rudeness, or can't cope with what's going on because she's just a little girl for crying out loud.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are better than others in execution, but even the better characters are still nothing special. They are unmemorable at best, and at worst they don't make sense and are hard to believe.\\n\\n\r\n(4) The battles are very simplistic and boring. Characters just scream \"Hero Punch!\", \"Girl Power!\", or things even worse, like the Five Tenets of the Hero Club one by one while slaying things left and right. This was supposed to make these scenes emotionally charged, but it didn't work and just annoyed me. Moreover, the viewers have no idea how to tell power difference between heroes and enemies, and seeing our characters arbitrary winning or losing based on what the plot demands is predictable and not engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe fairies did absolutely nothing, had no personalities, were neither cute nor anything else, and are the most bland and unnecessary dare I call them characters I've ever seen. The fact that one becomes a magic girl and a servant to a mysterious tree deity by activating an iPhone app says a lot about the amount of thought put into this show in general.\\n\\n\r\n--- THE OKAY ---\\n\r\n(visuals, dub, the Hero Club, Fu)\\n\\n\r\n(1) The art is fine. The fighting is not very exciting to begin with, but the visuals across the whole show look decent. Nothing you wouldn't come to expect from a 2014 show, but there's really nothing wrong with it either.\\n\\n\r\n(2) The music and songs are meh, but I watched the dub and it was good. I particularly liked the performance of English voice actress of Togo.\\n\\n\r\n(3) Before things went all mahou shoujo, the Hero Club the girls had in the first episode or two was cute. They were trying to help the community in whatever ways they could, and it was nice seeing them taking it seriously and trying to be little adults.\\n\\n\r\n(4) I liked one of the girls, Fu. She's cool and not as plain as the rest of the cast, her motivations are easier to believe. Although that's before I stopped to consider the fact that at the age of 14 Fu has no parents or adult family members. On top, she's living alone with her younger sister acting as her caretaker and legal guardian. And apparently she's been doing that since the age of 12. But don't think too much about it.\\n\\n\r\n--- THANK YOU FOR READING ---\\n\r\nI tried to make this review useful. If you have any feedback please feel free to message me.",

            "content": "**NOTE: This anime is a sequel to the LN 'Washio Sumi wa Yuusha de Aru', it's highly recommended that you do NOT read it before this, don't even look at its synopsis as it contains spoilers, it's recommended however that you read it after finishing this anime as it gives good backstory for some of the characters and works well as a tissue burner.**\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (Yuyuyu henceforth to avoid confusion with the character) was one of the least anticipated tiles for Fall 2014, but as a fan of both the SoL and mahou shoujo genres I figured it'd be a decentwatch but didn't have high expectations for it, the PV hinted at a mundane show about nothing in particular with some magic to mix things up.\\n\r\nUpon looking at the staff list however and seeing names such as Seiji \"Nice Show Would Be a Shame if Something Happened to It\" Kishi (Angel Beats!) and Mr. \"Woah, This Character Is Still Alive? Better Fix That\" a.k.a. Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), I couldn't help but wonder \"what are these monsters doing in a show about cute little girls?\"\\n\r\nYuyuyu's was shaping up to be a massive massacre as Studio Gokumi took the lead in the animation front, and that's exactly what happened, Yuyuyu was indeed a massacre \u2013 of my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a simple play of a hero trying to stop the demon king, a child's play, aimed at such, but helps set the tone for the rest of the show, in multiples ways, this is a simple story, we're not dealing with an over the top sci-fi setting that requires several episodes before you grasp what is going on and these characters are no geniuses or unique souls who appear once in a thousand years to change the world... Or are they?.. Probably not. \\n\r\nIt takes less than 3 minutes for the characters and setting to be introduced, even as the staff credits appear over several still images it's easy to understand that the world our heroines live in is a simple one, there's some city landscape shown but it's mostly countryside, it all screams peaceful, very peacefully.\\n\\n\r\nYuuna, Tougou, Fuu, Itsuki, together they form the Hero Club, a club that focus on helping people, mainly through the form of community work. Shortly after their introductions, we get to see a bit of their daily lives, make no mistake here however, being part of the SLICE OF LIFE\u2122 genre, this anime makes these cute little girls face real adversities as they try to find owners for kittens, update their website or think of what to do when faced with japanese middle schoolers' greatest fear after common cold \u2013 the cultural festival.\\n\\n\r\nEverything stops, however, when they receive a strange message on their phones. \\n\\n\r\n\"We're it\".\\n\\n\r\nThe members of the Hero Club have been selected to because heroes and fight Vertex \u2013 enemies of mankind that wish to destroy the world \u2013 in order protect Shinju-sama (Divine Tree), the foundation of the world.\\n\r\nWho, why, when or how? Questions which are sure to have an answer somewhere but are they really important? These girls have a world to save, those come later!\\n\r\nAt this point one can't help but wonder if this will be the classical \"enemy of the week\", but fear not, or do.\\n\r\nThe mahou shoujo genre is a genre that has it's tropes very well defined and it's very easy to identify them even without much experience with it, however, Yuyuyu uses these tropes for ease of storytelling but doesn't get lost in them, creating a story and characters that stand on their own.\\n\r\nYuyuyu is more on the \"modern\" side of the genre (look at the bottom of the review for a more detailed analysis), it's not just about mindless murder of hopeless, little Vertex.\\n\\n\r\nEventhough this is a SLICE OF LIFE\u2122 anime these girls are more than just kawaii, each with their own traits and personalities \u2013 simple ones, guessable just by looking at their hair color \u2013 they have more to them than it initially appears, as their pasts are revealed and explored, we get to know more about them, sympathize with them, maybe even relate to them. It ever ends up going overboard about how sad and unfortunate these girls are though, it's life, we have all experienced sudden changes at one point or another, for one reason or another, but that hasn't stopped us from living.\\n\\n\r\nHowever simple Yuyuyu might look like on the surface, it does have depth, while most of the cast might look care free enough for little girls tasked with saving the world, underneath all the fun and entertainment this show provides, there's always that lingering feeling of uncertainty, \"who exactly are the Vertex? Why are they after us?\" But the series never spells it out or feels the need to ask it every episode, which can be both a good and bad thing, it's easy to forget these girls are tasked with saving the world, even the characters themselves are aware of this though, which does serve as a reminder without being intrusive. \\n\\n\r\n\"\"Things are gonna be fun\", huh? We're supposed to be heroes saving the world. How silly.\" \\n\\n\r\nJust as much as this show is self-aware it also has an incredible attention to detail and amazing foreshadowing skills, little things like when the group is facing the first Vertex and Yuuna tries to calm Tougou down, while she's the one shaking; it's so subtle however, that it can go by unnoticed as all that we see is her fist, an easy way to make the audience aware of the fact Yuuna is also scared would be to simply expose Yuuna's thoughts and how nervous she is but the show doesn't feel the need to hold your hand.\\n\r\nThis makes rewatching this series an amazing experience, picking up on little things the characters say or do which spell out the outcome of future episodes and events.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's core Yuyuyu is a very well-realized show, it focus on the big picture \u2013 saving the world \u2013 but doesn't ignore the implications, exploring them and quietly builds up to the finale without you even noticing it's happening.\\n\r\nThe whole atmosphere the show builds has a much greater purpose, tense moments that lack tension are not because the show itself can't create it well, it doesn't need them all the time, it knows how to set a mood but doesn't need the mood to be heavy 24/7, it doesn't take every opportunity it gets to try to create something, it knows exactly when to strike. Perhaps Takahiro realized it wasn't the best of ideas to kill off a character every episode, it numbs the audience, after a while you just expect it and you start to care less and less. \\n\r\nHints are left behind with every corner the show turns but it doesn't come back to pick them up again, as said above, incredible self-awareness and attention to detail, enjoyment when rewatching the show is easily doubled, a feat accomplished by very few series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Though there is no other thing that can fascinate humans more than the truth\\n\r\nThere is nothing that is more cruel to humans than the truth.\"\\n\r\n(...)\\n\r\n\"No matter what... No matter how tough it gets... Live on.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Yuyuyu nails however, it's certainly its message, what implies being a hero, the regrets of becoming one, the hopelessness of not being able to change the past or the future but still trying desperately to do so when faced with picking between loneliness and suffering or no future at all.\\n\\n\r\n\"Being a Hero isn't about making sense or bending to the cruelty of the world. It isn't about being a sacrifice for others or defeating villains. Being a Hero isn't even about saving people. \\n\r\nBeing a Hero is about facing everything that is terrible and wrong and refusing to accept it. So when that Hero strides forth against impossible odds other can look towards them as a shining beacon of hope, stand up, and follow in their footsteps.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhich would you pick?\\n\r\nWould you still manage to become a hero even if it meant sacrificing yourself?\\n\r\nEven if it meant having a future filled with nothingess?\\n\r\nOr would you rather have no future at all? Would you leave your friends behind to suffer? Would you take them with you in a selfless act of desperation? Or would you fight alone and take all the burden yourself?\\n\r\nThe sacrifice of few to save the rest is explored a lot in anime but what if there's nothing to save? What if you can't save anyone no matter how much you sacrifice? Would you just give up? Or grab onto the little hope and strength you have left? Could you keep going knowing, no matter what you did, the future wouldn't change? \\n\r\nYuyuyu doesn't directly ask many questions and it answers even less but it doesn't need to do so, everything is made obvious through the characters, their actions and their situation, \"show\" is prioritized over \"tell\" but it doesn't forget to keep the plot coherent, this can also be seen as a flaw as viewers who don't pay much attention might get lost and feel like things happen for no reason, in the end it's also up to how each one of us interprets it.\\n\r\n-insert \"truly the evangelion of the madoka of our generation\" joke here-\\n\\n\r\nEven regarding character backstories Yuyuyu is a rather unique series, they are introduced later than sooner, which usually isn't the case, at least in this sort of series, the first few episodes are usually used to build the characters and then move with the plot, Yuyuyu leaves characterization for when it's necessary and... it works. \\n\r\nInstead of focusing on everyone at the start and overloading the audience with exposition Yuyuyu lets the viewer relax and progresses the plot in a well paced manner as it introduces plot twists and character backstories to maximize the various emotions it invokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe calm before the storm vibe is very much present most of the time, even after the fighting ends, which is when Yuyuyu holds your hand and tells you it'll be daijoubu like the well dressed man in front of a black van giving out candies, you are wary of him at first but then you take the candy and realize he's not a bad guy at all.\\n\\n\r\n\"Our fight is over. We won't lose anymore.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly an anime that takes it's time and perhaps could take even longer was more time allocated \u2013 and being a show that scales really well with how much times passes, it'd only get better \u2013 but it's certainly not a waste of time, it does end up being a hard series to evaluate if you go over it on a episode by episode basis as the start is rather slow and uneventful, but it's all by design. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the main problem with Yuyuyu is that it sets the bar too high towards the end, so high the show itself can't see it and when it tries to jump over it obviously fails.\\n\r\nBut it's really up to the viewer to decide wether it fails or not, Yuyuyu leaves enough hints behind that you can use them to justify just about anything, it's more a question of wether you want to believe or not, like said above, it can be considered a flaw as people who don't catch every little detail might be left behind, and it's asking a lot to catch 'em all.\\n\\n\r\nAfter their lastest work, Escha & Logy no Atelier, learning that Studio Gokumi would be animating this series certainly did not inspire much confidence, so it's with great suprise and joy to see how well Yuyuyu turned out in the visuals department.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs fit well enough, they are the sort of normal designs that you'd expect from a slice of life series, plain, cute, smile-inducing, with the kawaii and moe meters in the red zone.\\n\r\nThe magical costumes the girls use are simple yet stylish, they feel fresh, modern, it avoids the classical fluffy cocktail dresses for most of the girls and replaces them with clothes that resemble actual armor, even if on the light side \u2013 these girls actually look like heroes. \\n\r\nWhen in most other cases less clothes equals more protection, Yuyuyu certainly makes these girls look good as they attempt to save the world with their fists and giant swords and sniper rifles and more swords.\\n\\n\r\nYuyuyu does feature a very good color pallete, especially in the barrier world (Forest) where most of the fighting takes place, the whole place resembles the roots of a tree, with each main root having it's own color and as it branches off it expands on that color, and while the watercolor style works really well it can be a mixed bag when examined up close, sometimes making the characters feel out of place.\\n\r\nWhile the animation in the slice of life moments isn't anything out of this world it certainly does the job well enough, mistakes aren't that obvious and the quality is consistent throughout. When it comes to battles, animation quality does peak but perhaps not really enough to really set it apart, nevertheless, a solid direction goes a long ways and can make or break the scene no matter the animation quality, in Yuyuyu's case it definitely benefits from really good direction, you won't feel it lacks animation or that it has a below average choreography, can't complain much about the latter though, these are little girls, not martial artists, but overall it'll still feel fast paced and intense which is really what is important.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a good amount of character CGI used yet it doesn't feel awkward or out of place, mostly because it's used during jumps when characters have their backs turned, it'll be harder to spot than to avoid. The Vertex are mostly CGI too, they do benefit from the fact that they are mostly immobile or just very slow which doesn't make them stick out as much either.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are rather weak. The OP song isn't that catchy or exciting and takes some getting used to and the animation is nothing worth looking over more than once, the ED shares the same fate, unless you're some creeper who enjoys watching little girls from the bushes as they walk with the sunset in the background you'll probably find yourself skipping over this one too... Is what I'd say had I not watched the show to the end, you'll slowly learn to appreciate them and in retrospect they uphold to the standard set by the series, simply glorious in retrospect.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST and overall sound effects in Yuyuyu, unlike the OP and ED, are amazing from the start, it's the cherry on top of the cake for the series.\\n\r\nBeing a mahou shoujo anime the obligatory transformations scenes before battles are very much present, these are coupled with an amazing track choice that just screams hype, one can't help but feel excited for what's to come next, even if it's not always good, and it keeps going when the battle themes kick in, one stronger than the other it makes the fights feel exciting, a couple tracks even feature chants from worlds unknown to us, making the battles feel alive \u2013 it all culminates together for what is pure audio porn, not even complimenting the battle sequences as much as taking them to a whole nother level.\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life scenes have fairly standard tracks, they don't get in the way and fill in empty space when the little monsters settle down and overall just help move the scenes along not making them feel boring.\\n\r\nSome of the themes that appear during the battles are also present outside of those and it's amazing how it just works.\\n\r\nYuyuyu does feature insert songs, which are easily the high point of the whole category \u2013 for reasons you'll have to find out yourself.\\n\\n\r\nShall something not be perfect with the sound it'd certainly be the seiyuus, not as much as they are bad but as they could be better, criticism being more focused on Yuuna's than anyone else \u2013 eventhough some of them don't speak at all but that's another matter entirely \u2013 Yuuna, while not the leader of the Hero Club, is certainly the main character of the series, if the title wasn't hint enough surely the fact that she has pink hair is a dead giveaway, Yuuna is the character that will push the show forward when it comes to an halt, someone feeling down or angry? There's Yuuna to cheer them up, someone having an identity crisis? There's Yuuna to tell them who they are, someone about to kill themselves? There's Yuuna to tell them to do it. \\n\r\nWhat's that? Haremettes' problems in my mahou shoujos? It's more likely than you think.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a rather new seyuu Terui Haruka's perfomance is excusable and actually fairly decent, her voice fits Yuuna well and she has her moments, however, unlike most of the other cast members those moments come once per episode and, being the MC, Yuuna requires more than that, while those moments are properly timed to fit with the climax of the episodes \"side scenes\" could certainly be greatly improve was Yuuna not as unphasable, but perhaps that comes a bit with the character, emphasis on the perhaps.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a SLICE OF LIFE\u2122, SCHOOL\u2122, HEALING\u2122, CGDCT\u2122 anime enjoying these will help, however, as one would expect at this point, these aren't the main plot points of the show, they probably aren't the reason you are getting into the series either. \\n\r\nWatching these little creatures in their natural habitat is the best way for bonds to be made, to further empathize with these girls and try to get attached to them, enjoying these will only help but being indifferent to them doesn't hurt the enjoyment the show provides.\\n\r\nObviously, if SoL/CGDCT/moe/\"GUYS, I'M NOT DELUSIONAL, THEY ARE HOLDING HANDS AND BLUSHING, YURI!!\"/overall kawaiiness overload murdered your parents then you might want to steer clear. The cute facade the shows puts up has more to it than what it looks, but it's still a facade that you can take at face value and enjoy for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nBig part of the enjoyment factor in Yuyuyu certainly comes from noticing the subtle hints the shows leaves and realizing how they affect and dictate future events, something that was made easier when the show was airing as it left a lot of time to discuss and analyze them (I left some in this review for those who watched the series). Might be harder for people who will watch it now but it's not something required to enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a solid 8.5/10 show \u2013 9/10 on rewatch \u2013 and definitely the surprise of the year, even with a somewhat ambiguous ending, highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nChristmas was saved.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPuella Yuusha no Evangelion; Bokurano Beats!? Nandattebayo? \\n\r\nA story about love, hate, and charisma... and fate, life, death, hope, heartbreaks, lies, deception, delusion, madness, tricks and... a cow that eats other cows... behind a beautiful hero who disappeared in the Seto Inland Sea.\\n\r\nYuyuyu might not be the yuusha we need, it certainly isn't the yuusha we deserve given how underwatched it is in the West but I think it's the yuusha we want, and the yuusha we see off with a smile as it walks into the horizon of uncertainty as this franchise can probably muster the force for more anime entries given how successful it has been thus far.\\n\r\nNow let us hope for a movie adaptation of the prequel light novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime, very much like every other medium, is easily influenced by what's trending, every once in a while it's to no surprise that there'll be an anime that will end up setting new standards in it's genre or even in the whole industry, because of how popular and successful it was, even if said anime doesn't invent those ideas it's what made them popular and obviously it'll become a point of reference even if it wasn't the first one. Puella Magi Madoka Magica (PMMM) is one of such titles, it wasn't an unique-never-seen-before-anime, the themes in PMMM had been explored before, multiple times, but it became so popular that it set standards, more for the viewer than for the creators and as such, titles released after it will have to face the fact that they'll be compared to it, wether they wanted to or not. \\n\r\nAs such, mahou shoujo anime that wishes to use the common tropes \u2013 present in the genre for over 30 years \u2013 be it to lure and trick the audience or just use them for ease of storytelling while trying to spicy things up a bit by not feeling like an anime aimed at little girls will perhaps forever suffer of the \"Madoka rip-off\" syndrome.\\n\r\nWhile drawing parallels between the two works is easy enough thanks to the common tropes they use, both explore different themes and take different paths, and both are masterful in how they do it, at their cores they are completely different.",

            "content": "I did not know what to expect when I began watching Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. The previews teased that it was going to be another slice-of-life series, but looks were deceptive. While it has some SOL elements, at its core it's a magical girl show, and a pretty serious one, too. Here\u2019s my final review of the entire series, as of 12/26/2014. If you just want an overall recommendation without any other details, feel free to skip to the tl;dr section at the very bottom.\r\nThe Plot In a Nutshell:\r\nMiddle school girls in a \"Hero Club\" perform small everyday acts of heroism in the normalworld, but also become heroic magical girls protecting the planet from strange creatures called vertexes.\\n\\n\r\nBackground/Influences:\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna  is an original series created by Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), and it blends elements from three different anime genres. First are its magical girl ancestors, and this one comes from the lineage of adult magical girl shows like Lyrical Nanoha and Madoka Magica. Fans of those series will recognize the influences of both, although Yuuki Yuuna still tells its own story in its own way. Second is slice-of-life, and except for the dark clouds that are almost always lingering under the surface, some of the mellowest scenes wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in a Kyoto Animation series. Third is character drama, and here the series actually shows some surprising Key Visual Arts influence (Kanon/Clannad), along with other influences from Angel Beats and the Persona series (Yuuki Yuuna\u2019s director, Seiji Kishi, also directed both Angel Beats and Persona 4 The Animation, so this shouldn't be a surprise). All three genres are done well enough individually that it could have focused on any one of them and been a decent show, but the blend of all three really elevates it above the sum of its parts.\\n\\n\r\nMoe\u2019s Scale of Female Cuteness:\\n\r\nWhile this isn\u2019t a true moe series, all the girls in the Hero Club can be awfully cute. Most of their club activities are ordinary community service work, like fostering kittens and performing puppet shows for kids. They also hang out together sometimes outside of school, eating udon, singing karaoke, and doing other fun things together. The catch is that none of this SOL stuff is there just to be cute and funny \u2013 while some of it may seem frivolous at first glance, the writers are deliberately giving you time get to know the girls and their personalities and motivations by showing you how they behave and act around each other. All the girls have their own personal demons they\u2019re wrestling with, and most of them did not have happy childhoods. Tensions occasionally flare between them, and even in the most seemingly cheerful moments there are lingering undercurrents of anxiety and doubt about the job they have to do and the risk to their lives and well-being, which all makes these scenes even more effective. One of Yuuki Yuuna's greatest strengths is that there's a genuine chemistry between all the main girls in the cast - while they have their occasional disagreements, you never doubt for a second how much they all care about each other, especially the two sisters (Fuu and Itsuki) and the two best friends (Yuuna and Togo).\\n\r\nMost of the slice-of-life stuff takes place in the first half of the show, and while some (especially non-SOL fans) may find these parts a bit slow, it\u2019s still worth paying attention to it because a lot of it is setting the table for the second half of the series. Along with letting you get to know the characters better, there\u2019s also quite a bit of foreshadowing too; I noticed a lot of hints the second time I watched the series that were easy to miss the first time.\\n\\n\r\nRound One\u2026Fight!:\\n\r\nAs pleasant as the girls try to make everyone's daily lives, when the alarms sound on their phones, it\u2019s time for them to become magical girls and protect the world from the vertex threat. There are several vertex battles throughout the series, varying in length and scope, but some of them can be pretty tense affairs, especially when multiple vertexes (vertices?) appear at once. The girls are skilled combatants with a variety of strong weapons, but they\u2019re not immune to injury and the vertexes are tough opponents who are smart enough to coordinate their attacks and adjust their strategies during battle. It usually takes a total team effort for the Heroes to have any success against them, which leads to some entertaining and occasionally nailbiting fights.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nThe animation is a bit inconsistent - it can be great in some scenes and merely passable in others - but the overall quality is solidly good. The fight scenes take place in a surreal, colorful alternate world, and showcase most of Yuki Yuna\u2019s best animation work. These scenes appear inspired by the artwork of Shigenori Soejima (Persona 3/Persona 4), as well as the twisty, hyper-organic landscapes of Roger Dean\u2019s paintings, and I\u2019m excited to see how they\u2019ll look in Blu-Ray someday. They also use a fair bit of CG though, so be warned if that\u2019s not your thing. The real world scenes, while still generally cheerful and colorful, have occasional touches such as the unnaturally bent and ruined suspension bridge appearing in several background scenes that subtly remind us this world isn\u2019t quite the carefree place it appears on the surface. \\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs (like most) will be hit-or-miss depending on your musical tastes. Personally I liked the opening immediately, but the ending needed time to grow on me. The OST itself, however, is outstanding. Most of the tracks fit their scenes perfectly, and the battle music especially stands out as some of the very best in the show, full of soaring choirs and pulse-pounding orchestration. Even the quieter tracks have a few gems, though, such as a very nice flamenco-styled classical guitar piece that appears a couple of times. There\u2019s also not a lot of repetition either. Only a few tracks are used more than once or twice, and they\u2019re all songs (like the main transformation theme) that you\u2019ll enjoy hearing multiple times anyway.\\n\\n\r\nRating: \\n\r\nIf I rated Yuuki Yuuna on nothing but my personal enjoyment, it would get a 10. I\u2019ve already watched the whole series twice, I know I\u2019ll watch it again in the future, and if Pony Canyon ever gives us a North American release, I'll buy it. To give it a fair review, though, I can\u2019t entirely overlook the uneven pacing in the first half of the series, the occasional inconsistency in animation quality, and a few (not many) awkward transitions between scenes. That said, Yuuki Yuuna is still a gem, even if it\u2019s one that\u2019s not completely polished. The characters are easy to like and they all have wonderful chemistry with each other, the OST is outstanding, the themes of the story (which I wish I could actually talk about here without spoiling everything) are timely and appropriate, and despite a few rough patches, the story threads eventually come together in a very satisfying way. It\u2019s a spirited show that\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but like its characters it has a lot of heart and tries its best. And much of the time, its best is really, really good.\\n\r\nFirst half: 8/10. Second half: 9.5/10. Overall: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr! Should I Watch Yuuki Yuuna or Not?:\\n\r\nYes, if magical girl mixed with some drama and slice-of-life sounds appealing to you. The first half isn\u2019t quite as good as the second half, but if you're able to stick with it, your patience will be rewarded. Just be warned that this isn\u2019t a relaxing series at all. If you\u2019re expecting Aria with a dash of Cardcaptor Sakura, you'll be disappointed. It\u2019s more like Lyrical Nanoha with a dash of Angel Beats.",

            "content": "-Spoilers Ahead-\r\nThe brilliant minds behind Angel Beats and Akame ga Kill joined forces in an attempt to capitalize on their respective \"talents\" and made what some people call \"one of the most underrated masterpieces of the season\" without an ounce of irony. This series is pretty much everything wrong with modern anime, and there are plenty of reasons as to why. It's just so up its own ass pretending to be not a grimdark show in a vain attempt to fake out the audience for so long that it ends up boring, and when it actually gets to the grimdark it was leading up to,it does in the most hilariously incompetent way possible. Many of its other problems include the asinine pacing, lack of character interaction and development, and complete lack of subtlety, which all seem to go under the radar because apparently everyone is too busy crying over ham-fisted drama. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are some positives about this show- Mainly the visuals. Despite some heavy usage of CG in some parts, it really doesn't look that bad at all in motion, and the colors do not make your eyes bleed like NGNL does. Character designs are pretty neat and I do appreciate how they don't look like something out of Precure. Not that Precure designs are necessarily bad, but the designs here make thematic sense and at least don't look generic by its genre standards- Instead they look like something out of Sword Art Online, not that it's a bad thing either. The music is pretty decent- There are two to three tracks that were actually memorable and were reminiscent of something out of Madoka and whatever Akiko Shikata makes, but the overuse of those tracks made them a bit stale. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Madoka, there's a lot of people who compare this show to Madoka and even call it a rip-off. But honestly, it's hard to blame them- Shady magical girl contract with a supernatural being? Check. Enemies that appear in a strange world that do not actually offer actual character interaction due to lack of any dialogue whatsoever? Check. Main title character being over optimistic and the most underdeveloped character out of the main cast? Check. Mentor-like character that later goes nuts after reading the fine lines in the said shady contract? Check. The questionable magical girl system existing to prevent the end of the world? Check. This show's really got everything. But because this show shares so many similarities with Madoka, it also shares the flaws- And those flaws become more evident with poor direction and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nApparently when Takahiro was writing for this show, he thought he'd change it up from Akame ga Kill's pointless gorefest and decided to turn it into a pointless borefest. This wise decision turned the first half of this show incredibly painful to sit through. The main problem is the lack of characters- The villains and even the fairies are absolutely silent. Therefore, there is no character interaction whatsoever with the opposing side aside from fighting and more fighting. This wasn't a problem in Madoka due to the existence of Kyubey, who delivered some form of drama whenever necessary for conflicting character interaction, but that role is severely lacking here. Taishas do little more than send out phone messages whenever they aren't busy catering to the crippled, and the supernatural being that gives magical power is a poorly drawn magical tree always obscured in fog. This narrows down all character interaction whatsoever to the five main characters, and everyone else might as well be a cardboard in the background. This effectively turns the series into a Slice-of-Life type of show, which is actually in the description for this series. But then the problem comes from attempting to mix this element with grimdark setting, which was basically the gimmick with Akame ga Kill. But even then, mixing the two isn't the problem- It's the execution. There needs to be some form of consistent flow in the tone, and this series handles it very poorly by going from one scene to the other with incredibly sudden transition. Having a tea party? Suddenly phone call and everyone's warped to fight the giant floating monster thing. Then lots of yelling and chanting in the background, and suddenly they're in space. And when they're not doing that, they're busy being very angsty about something else introduced later in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes followed the aforementioned formula incredibly precisely, while occasionally increasing the number of enemies to mix it up a little although it didn't really hinder the protagonists in the slightest. After managing to kill twelve of these things, the protagonists conclude that their battles are over because the Taishas said so, which is an obvious fake-out halfway into the series. It's also odd that the protagonists didn't suspect anything strange about Taishas informing them that there were supposedly arbitrary number of these things, which would mean that the Taishas somehow did not manage to defeat any of them at all despite having a detailed sealing process to defeat one. That aside, this formulaic plot progression didn't really serve to develop any of the characters at all. Sure, there was some character interaction between the main cast, but character interaction doesn't necessarily lead to character development. These particular interactions were just wacky hijinx and comedy, so it did absolutely nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAfter halfway into the series, our good director Seiji decides that he needs to start including actual plot, and the grimdark elements start being introduced. Whenever the girls use their magical powers, they occasionally enter this super mode known as Mankai. The show never explains whether these girls enter the state willingly or whether it's done automatically- And even the official website claims that it's half and half. Basically, it's whenever the plot fucking wants it to happen. Why? Because this is the aforementioned grimdark plot element. Whenever the girls enter this state, they lose a certain bodily function and gain a fairy in the process. The series attempts to fake the audience out by claiming it's temporary, and then it spends several episodes that arrive at a not-so shocking conclusion that it's permanent. Yuna loses her taste, Mimori loses hearing on one ear, Fuu goes blind in one eye, and Itsuki loses her voice. What does this all lead to? Forced drama. Apparently Itsuki entered a singing audition, which everyone knew nothing about, and suddenly the whole thing gets dumped at the audience's face in the most convenient way possible when Fuu is trying to deal with the whole permanent body function sacrifice thing. If that wasn't enough, Itsuki goes on a long speech in the recording about how she loves her friends so Fuu can go on a full guilt trip for getting her to tag along on the Hero Club before actually singing for the audition because the judges were too busy looking for their non-existent script, as with every other character in the show. A proper, subtle way to handle this scene would've been to establish the singing audition thing before this happened, and then flash back to it briefly after the realization hit home, instead of just being embarrassingly blatant about it. But I guess subtlety is lost art. \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tougou decides to be dangerous and attempts to test her theory by playing sudoku with a blade, and comes to a horrifying realization that fairies are \"forcibly\" keeping them alive. Apparently it's supposed to be terrifying that these tiny things keep the girls alive while they're on a dangerous duty that they're not being forced to do. Obviously there are huge consequences for not doing magical girl things since it has been established in the first episode that Shinju-sama is protecting the world and these aliens who are for some reason named after zodiac signs are trying to destroy it, but the job itself is still technically optional. They're not being forced to do it at gunpoint or whatever, so the supposed horror factor they were going for is completely invalid. Furthermore, Tougou apparently attempted to play sudoku multiple times because once wasn't enough and goes on about all these different methods she tried to kill herself for almost no reason other than sounding edgy. But then I realized this was Takahiro's specialty- Hammering the exact same point and over and over to arouse some form of emotion. These two brilliant men's talents really do shine in this series. \\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, Tougou gets warped into the cripple gold medalist's room, who was their predecessor and now has over twenty disabilities and the equal amount of fairies. Then the audience is informed during their second meeting about the shocking truth that everything outside Shinju's territory is red vomit with white aliens swarming about. It's been known that Shinju was protecting humanity from getting fucked up by something since the first episode, so what's the shock here? Why does it matter that the villains are aliens or gods who decided humanity sucked? Whatever it was, it drives Tougou insane and makes her come to an ingenious conclusion. Apparently the best way to protect her friends and stop their sacrifices altogether was to blow a hole in the barrier, get the tree killed, and then get everyone sacrificed as a result of her decision. Maybe her ability to form proper reason was taken during one of her Mankai sessions. Would've been better if she actually consulted with her friends first-hand, but clearly that sounded too uninteresting and sensible for the writers. Most of the conflicts in this series also seem self-made, so it's also incredibly difficult to actually relate to any of these characters especially when they make stupid decisions such as Fuu attempting to kill the Taishas after the aforementioned forced drama sequence. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the evil tofus attack, suddenly Yuuna is incapable of transforming because of her distressed emotional state despite Fuu being completely capable of doing so during her rage. Then Karin suddenly wakes up from being unconscious and activates Mankai multiple times in a span of few seconds coupled with too much yelling in an attempt to win the \"most crippled\" award in the show. After that, Yuuna manages to punch some sense into Tougou, destroys the Final Boss Vertex, then decides to become Jesus by taking everyone's disabilities onto herself by becoming a vegetable. Then suddenly the audience is supposed to accept that the enemies just stopped attacking because either they are really gone for good or they just got bored trying to kill a tree. \\n\\n\r\nIt later turns out that every fairy represented a physical function the girls lost, so when the fairies disappear, they regain everything they lost and stop being heroes. This may be because Shinju figured that keeping emotionally unstable girls who almost got it killed as its guardians was a terrible idea. Yuuna stays a vegetable for a while because Takahiro figured he could cram in some more sad scenes near the end, but then she gets better through the power of friendship. As stupid as that sounded, the ending isn't the issue- Even if the ending resulted in everyone becoming a vegetable, this would've been still a very poorly written series. \\n\\n\r\nThe happy ending can at least be explained with how since all threatening Vertices are supposedly gone, assuming the sun-shaped Vertex was the last of its kind for a while, Shinju doesn't need to exert as much energy to keep the barrier up since there's nothing much left to keep out, so it just gave everything it took back. It would explain how nobody is giving a shit about that part of the barrier Tougou blew up earlier.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is, if there is no actual threat left and the Taishas aren't being lying dicks about it this time and Mr. Tree is actually a benevolent god that everyone claims it is, then there really should be no point for it to keep what it took unless it's a dick too, which is probably what most people were guessing. And it's not like it was ever established that it couldn't give back what it took, so all the more reason for it to do what it did. And to the show's credit, it did briefly mention through one SoL segment that it was \"alright to eat the offerings if they were there for a while\" so maybe either it was foreshadowing or maybe I'm giving the show way too much credit. I'm actually surprised Takahiro managed to learn how to make use of mundane segments instead of cramming them in for the sake of just having them as a contrast to his edgy grimdark parts. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of hate for the ending of the show, but most of that hate seems to be misdirected since it mostly involves \"It had a happy ending, so it sucked.\" While it's not that having some plot elements that lead to a depressing ending is inherently bad- It's that when it does happen, it needs to be well-paced and give the audience enough time to feel actually attached to the characters in question. But with the lack of actual villains to provide any form of conflicting character interaction, there's next to no character development, and everything just ends up being a snooze-fest because these characters are just hard to care for outside of them looking cute. Unfortunately, this particular writing style has become quite popular with modern anime (Attack on Titans, AgK, or even Kotoura-san, etc), and for some reason, everyone seems to eat it up. Here's a possibility: People are just so used to badly written happy endings that they'd rather have badly written sad endings, while deluding themselves that sad endings are apparently inherently better than happy endings because they think they are more mature. Something about teaching a moral lesson about heroes not always winning or some shit, I don't know. In that case, the preference is determined not by the actual quality of the writing, but just by the inherent difference of definition. It's like preferring black shit over brown shit. \"They're both shit, but at least it's not brown.\" While this is no longer applicable for this show since it had a happy ending, it doesn't change the fact that it was the direction the series was leading people towards, and it's obviously the main reason behind people eating it up.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is just yet another attempt at the ever-popular modern formula which involves characters going through depression in one way or the other, whether or not the characters were likeable or the depression relatable and the plot behind it well-written. It was practically tailored to the type of people who ate up the likes of AgK and Attack on Titans, and it did just that right before the end. I guess at least their reactions were entertaining.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is part of a multimedia project of LN, VN, videogame, manga and anime. And despite of it, the anime is completely able to stand on its own.\r\nThe story is one of the strongest points, but for you to understand this you need to watch the series from the right point of view. As a Slice of Life the story is about the characters, sure world building is important, but ultimately the story focuses on the 5 main protagonists, it makes you care about them, their lives and it gives a proper conclusion to them.\r\nThe art is pretty good fora studio with low budget like this one, at the start the CGI is noticeable, but after a while you learn to appreciate the backgrounds, the town and all the locations, you can see they put a lot of job on this.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is a solid 10/10, with the composer of NieR is to be expected. From the Slice of Life to the action music every scene has a perfect ambience that lets you get immersed in the story. I doubt it's possible to find flaws about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main motivation to watch the series and also get into the franchise if you're interested in the side material. You learn to appreciate them and you get really attached to them because everything is portrayed and developed around them, the support between the sisters, the romance between Yuuna and Tougou and the character development of the originally lonely tsundere girl is explained at the right pace and given the proper screen time. The fact that this anime (and the whole project) had 2 years of planning is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is really enjoyable by itself, but as someone who started watching it since the first week, I can say it's extremely recommendable to get into all the other material that is also part of this multimedia project, it contains multiple interesting information that makes you see the characters in a whole different light, and as I said the characters are the more important part of this franchise. The best way to do this is:\\n\\n\r\nWatch the first 3 episodes of the anime, read the manga, watch episode 4, read the VN, watch episodes 5, 6, 7 then read the first 7 chapters of the LN, watch episode 8, read chapter 8 of the LN, watch episode 9, 10, 11, read chapter 9 of the LN and then watch the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe videogame is unrelated to the rest and it comes out until February anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series delivers everything you want, good characters, writing, romance, action, interactions and it teaches you exactly what the title says: Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. It teaches what is a Hero and how to be Hero, to you and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, even though I said the characters are the most important part it doesn't mean that the world is not interesting, on the contrary, the issue is that the anime doesn't give a lot of focus to it, only the necessary, that's why the speculation is also one of the best parts of this franchise, and this can be proved because it has been less than 2 days since the anime ended and there's already a lot of theories regarding the ending, and all of them are equally likely since this series is famous for leaving foreshadowing and references in all its media. I recommend you to watch it and join those theorists until those points are properly explained, and I know they will be properly explained because this series hasn't ended yet, it's only the beginning.",

            "content": "Can you hold it in your heart to believe in yourself to be a hero? Can you do that while knowing that while you carry out your promise to protect the world, you have to watch as you feel like you're failing that same promise to your friends? Are you truly capable of being a hero knowing what sacrifices have to be made and what you can lose along the way? Do you have the willpower to be the spark that lights the candle of hope surround by a shroud of despair? \r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu for short) is an anime thatasks five girls of the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club these questions. Can they handle it? Well...I can't spoil things so you'll have to go find that out yourself...If you read the discussions first before watching the episodes..I will go to your house and cave your shins in! No seriously though..YuYuYu is a pretty good show. \\n\\n\r\nTake a slice of life anime with Magic girls add a lot of cute moments and well thought out characters and you get YuYuYu. The show leaves the impression of one of those really cute and action-y shows...basically giving the appeal of something out of Kyoto Animation (like K-ON! or Chuunibyou). \\n\\n\r\nSuddenly, the show takes a turn into a Madoka Magicka atmosphere...The story progresses into a more depressing and seemingly sinister series at the blink of an eye and you begin to worry about the future of these girls. Things worsen, your feels are tested, and more and more monsters are destroyed, but at the end of the day (series) all that was needed was the will to believe in yourself and your friends. \\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): As mentioned, the story seems very light-hearted and cute, but as it progresses...things get real...and quick. While seemingly slow at the beginning, the entire storyline is well thought out and very very detailed. What was impressive was how well the storyline was able to conceal its gloomy and dark parts of it with cute and warming parts. It's ending, however...left a more cliched ending to it....along with its slow start...keeping it from it's 10/10 mark.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10): To me, characters are the most important part of the story. It's what really matters in a scene no matter how you look at it. YuYuYu does it right. Not only does it give a background of each character, it also does a good job at showing how they connect to the other characters (through either relation (Fu and Itsuki) or the Hero Club). What I really liked was the mystery that surrounds Togo's two year gap. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10): Despite having the rather \"generic\" anime style, YuYuYu's amount of color and detail in the animation was well done. From the designs of the characters to even the designs of the monsters and the Taisha world (mainly the heavy amount of color here). \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10): I can't say much about the sound throughout the series. However, the song choice for the opening and closing was well done. Opening remained calm and collected, but at the same time...still a catchy tune. The ending was a completely different story. The use of certain voice actors during the ending really added to some of the \"depressing\" feel that came from the series itself. An example of this is the endings where only the seiyu of Itsuki sung the song during the episodes that were more focused around Itsuki's character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10): It's been a while since I felt anticipation for an anime show. This show's ability to keep me on my toes and always dying for the next episode is something worth noting. During the light-hearted side of the story, I enjoyed the rather comical side of the series itself...what made the show...well...slice of life. The action sequences and the battles were well done. During the darker side of the series, I felt a lot of anxiety as I began to fear the worst would happen in the series. The last time I experienced this was during my time watching Tokyo Ravens (Fall 2013 -> Winter 2014). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. To sum up this series, I would say this is a must watch for fans of shows like Madoka Magicka. This series was well done and I cannot express how much I enjoyed the series overall. Fair warning though...this series will test you feels. \\n\\n\r\nWatch Recommendation? - Yes",

How on Earth will we care?\r\nWhy is this a madoka clone? It's not. First impressions suggest an interesting thing with the fight royale magicka, but it was binned 8.5/10 times and it had to be a Slice Of Life monotony! And, most of the time, the girls are just screwing about as \u201cHeroes\u201d by being girl scouts, but its even stupider considering that theydon't even do there job often since their still mocking around! Where often left with unnecessary, unmoving and uncharitable amounts of comedic scenes like this sardine-adreniline girl who takes jokes about how much she drugs pills, and it has potential like using the Slice Of Life aspect to get some female bonding which results in \u201ccharacter development\u201d in contrary to madoka at least we had a continuing plot avoiding such filler.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, how can we care? The plot progressed upon a snail  pace (even for a 12 episode series) and no one even develops, what a waste of potential! Consequently, how are the \u201cmagical\u201d aspects of the show? Well, the girls ganged screwed with like 5 boss mosters, and oh my! Shonen power up \u2013 sheeeeeeum! Instant Bankai! The bosses die, no one dies, and am I not surprised? The show even fails to make \u201cdecent\u201d tension and considering the biggest flaw, what an ascension! Wait, there are side effects from using Bankai Mankai? Everyone started caring about their side effects right at the end and they made it look like nothing happened to them and Mankai becomes hacks power up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are archetypes. Why am I super surprised? We have the shy one, the energetic one, the vanilla one, the leader one and of course we need more than one vanilla one! This makes everyone two dimensional therefore no even two people give two flap jacks for this decent writing.\\n\\n\r\nI doubt will have sequels or prequels for this, and let this show burn at the pits of Antarctica and fade into space remembered as a semi-ish madoka clone? Why not!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not an Epic floppy train wreck. (compare it to somthing like Aldnoah Zero or Brynhildr and this is gold in comparison)\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nSTORY: 4/10\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\r\nANIMATION: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2.5/10 \u2013 \u201cAlmost sleep material as I yawn 90% of the time....\u201d",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhen it comes to helping others, some do it for the joy it brings to others while some do so to bring happiness to oneself. It doesn't matter the reason; just being there for someone in his or her time of need makes all the difference in the world. It also doesn't matter the scope, either. Whether it's working at a soup kitchen, babysitting the neighbor's kid, or saving an animal from a burning building, it's not the grandness of the act, but the act itself that means everything. And more often than not, these people are bestowedwith the title of \"hero.\" Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is a dark horse capitalizing on this idea, with more to the phrase than at first perceived.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu (what I'll be calling it from here on out) follows the girls of the \"Hero Club:\" Yuuki, Togo, Fuu, and Itsuki. They believe in their five tenets, looking to spread happiness wherever they go.\\n\\n\r\nOn the outset, YuYuYu appears to be just another slice-of-life anime with no redeeming qualities. But past the first half of the first episode, it becomes much, much more. What this anime excels at is establishing and maintaining its vibe from beginning to end. The world is happy-go-lucky, essentially carefree during the more relaxed bits. Simultaneously, though, the show exerts an ominous feeling. That something is off, something is wrong, but one can't quite place his or her finger on what it is. It's not a shocking twist or some roundabout answer, either. The show slowly builds upon itself, reaching a crescendo, allowing for all of the built up emotion and uneasy feeling to spill over. The result is a consistent ride of trepidation that never lets up.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to create such apprehension, YuYuYu attempts to go about its story-telling and world-building in a less-than-direct manner. The rules are set early on, with the girls learning about the true nature of what they are doing through observation, association, and even simply visual confirmation. This allows the anime to explore both the slice-of-life happiness and dark drama more compactly, because the information gained is never entirely presented on a silver-platter. It's always just out of reach, with enough given to move the story along. The truth is morbid and well done, with the actions of the characters involved being believable given the situation. It's not absolutely perfect, but the show more or less covers its bases, providing a fulfilling set of events that culminate in the narrative presented.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest controversy involved comes with the ending. Thematically speaking, the anime's overall premise is that, as long as one's friends are there, anything is possible. It's an almost literal \"the power of friendship\" message. The dichotomy that is created during the anime gives the characters a lot of room to connect and support one another. Birthday parties, beach outings, and regular club activities help to provide examples for just how friendly they are. Even during the hidden side, the story presents many opportunities for Yuuna and the gang to show just how good of friends they've become. So, the question is, does the ending uphold the ideals that the anime set? To an extent, yes, it does. The purpose of the anime is not so much about where all the girls end up, just where Yuuna does. After all, it's her story. The whole season, she proclaims and demonstrates the type of person she is and who she wants to be. And in the end, her friends do so, too; by supporting her and being there when she needed it most. It's a touching story that may not have ended the way everyone wanted, but it follows through with the pretext it set.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, one of the more prominent yet discarded topics within the anime is the religious aspect, or the \"Shinju-sama.\" The girls fight to protect this god, going to extreme lengths to do so. And as the overall message details, it is not the god who saves them, it is ultimately each other. It's a snide remark about the ideas of religion and what it really means to devote one's self to faith. In YuYuYu's circumstance, it argues that religion can be seen as nothing more than self-destructive violence. It isn't the gods above who save the day; it is the people on the ground who heed the call to the challenges in front of them. And blindly believing in something without justifiable, logical reasoning merely leads to death and despair. It's a risky statement that the show is willing to take, and it does so in full stride.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu is quite the beautiful looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style adopted is quite varied, both outside and within the \"forestized\" areas. The real world feels alive, with various locations besides just the club room visited. Lighting effects and other smaller details for the environments can be found, making the pieces themselves feel more alive. As for the \"other\" world, it's an explosion of colors and effects that dazzle about in a wide range of patterns. During these segments, the Vertexes, and at certain moments the girls themselves are done in 3D, but it never feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for Yuuna and the rest are simple in reality and, perhaps obviously, more intricate when it comes to their transformations. Even their final forms are given much detail, combining a mix of 2D and 3D that, once again, is pleasant to look at. Togo's design that includes a wheelchair deserves a special shout-out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, it is stellar, to say the least. Action packed sequences, well-choreographed battles, and good character movements during the slice-of-life segments are the norm. The show never lets up, providing fluent and comprehensible skirmishes that showcase how strong this side of the anime truly is.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of YuYuYu is vibrant, being characterized by not only their own developments, but by how they relate to one another.\\n\\n\r\nBefore talking about any of them, what the show does well is in the character interactions themselves. And not just that they are right, but that they are done better than many other anime. The characters feel like friends. Their jokes and conversations make sense, they play off of one another, and they are not afraid to tease each other when warranted. It simply feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nAs the youngest member, Itsuki is the quiet and kind little girl. She is the sister to Fuu, with the weird hobby of reading tarot cards. Her power, like her singing voice, is able to touch all those around her. More than anything, she wants to convince others that she doesn't need the help of the people around her at all times.\\n\\n\r\nFuu is the leader. Loud and outgoing, her massive broadsword further defines her as a girl unafraid to be as \"unique\" as possible. While she may be the first to console a friend, she harbors heavy guilt, with massive built up frustration. As the captain, she works hard to protect the entire club, but especially Itsuki, from the troubles that are brought upon them.\\n\\n\r\nIntroduced slightly later, Karin is standoffish yet approachable, serious yet playful. Her personality shines through in the armaments she wields: two samurai swords, both sharp and elegant. A \"tsundere\" through and through. For her, proving herself not only as a warrior but as a member is first and foremost on her mind. She doesn't want to bring the team down, because she feels she is the most worthy of the title they have been given.\\n\\n\r\nActually handicapped, Togo is very intelligent and serenely beautiful. She almost always hides her emotions, reflecting the long-range sniping she employs. Even though she is forced to be seated, Togo keeps a watchful eye on the rest of the cast. She works as a website designer, and Yuuna is her best friend. And that's the truth; she would do anything imaginable to save her.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most interesting character, and perhaps rightly so, is Yuuki Yuuna herself. Extremely friendly and way too optimistic, she only wants to help everyone and anyone around her. Doing as much as she can with the two hands given to her, her bare-fist fighting style highlights this. She never gives up and she never gives in. The love she has for all her friends is huge, and she exhibits this time and again.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond making the characters interact naturally, not only do the characters feel diverse, but they experience development that ties in with the anime's themes and overall goal. Itsuki goes from dependent little girl to independent young woman, gaining the confidence she's been lacking (and wanting) all along. Fuu starts off as the stalwart leader but devolves into an emotional wreck due to her inability to handle the suffering that her fellow friends all go through. Karin begins hating the group and not understanding who they are, but ends up defending them ardently and unconditionally. And Togo has her trust completely broken and shaken, despite her believing in both the club and the \"Shinju-sama.\"\\n\\n\r\nThere is just one girl who doesn't waver or change along the way: Yuuna. Why is this? For her, there is no development because there doesn't need to be. She is constantly pushing ahead, never yielding. She is the example, the goal, what the other four girls aspire to be. She exudes confidence, stability, friendliness, and trust, all attributes that the members have always wanted. Because while the story may revolve around all of them, it is ultimately about why Yuuki Yuuna is who she claims to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is good. It starts off mysterious, with the differing vocals, violins, and acoustic guitar. It picks up near the halfway point, becoming more powerful and catchy, with the drums and choir-like singing. The ending vocal bit sends it off on a high-note, lending further to the anime's always-uneasy vibe.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is also quite good. It's soft, giving a calming sensation that is sometimes needed throughout the season. There are numerous versions of it, depending on the episode in question, but it's a simple song, with simple drums and singing that once again still feels as if something is just not quite right.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, in one word, amazing. Quiet pieces, quick tracks, dramatic arrangements, it has it all at all the right places. The best piece usually occurs when the action is reaching a climax, with the vocalist following along to a repeated three-count. The whole OST is great to listen to both within the anime and outside of it, making it a contender for the top spot of the season.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees many well done performances by the entire cast. Emotional scenes, screaming, and varying inflections are performed by all at one point or another. Special shout-out to Yumi Uchiyama for her role as Fuu, Juri Nagatsuma for her role as Karin, and Haruka Terui for her role as Yuna.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nBeing completely honest, I actually was not a fan of the ending. Without spoiling anything, what I wanted most was for it to go in the completely opposite direction that it went.\\n\\n\r\nBut the rest of the package is there: comedy, drama, tragedy, anxiety, expectation, and both large and small scale battle sequences, to name just a few. It's a combination that is balanced well during the limited amount of time they had, making the experience a good one.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru began quite strange but ended very strong. Its smart story, diverse characters, and incredible animation really do prove that Yuuki Yuuna is a hero.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, perfect mood, nice world-building, complete theme, religious undertones\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, nice character designs, 2D/3D mix well, fantastic actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Yuuna, Togo, Karin, Fuu, and Itsuki are characterized, developed, and connected\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP, good ED, amazing soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, has it all except the ending I was hoping for\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna is a Horribly Boring Character. She's relatively one-dimensional, oblivious, airheaded, naive and childish in her ideals, which isn't inherently boring, but the world she lives in RESPECTS that allowing her simple and repetitive nature to prevail against any and all problems to the point where you begin to wonder if there's any point in growing up at all. \r\nI, like many others, stumbled upon the show \"Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero\" after hearing it compared to the illustrious Madoka Magica and were drawn to it by people saying that it was \"better than Madoka\". As a massive fan of Madoka Magica, I wasinitially very excited: someone made a better version of one of my favorite shows of all time? I had even heard people saying that Madoka had been their favorite show until they watched Yuuki Yuuna, and since I realized that was pretty much where I was at I could not have been more thrilled to first learn of this show's existence. I pulled it up immediately, and went into it with high hopes and an open mind. I didn't expect the sort of poignant universal message that Madoka had given, but what I did expect was a damn good deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Compelling characters, enthralling twists, gut-wrenching moments of tragedy, and a genuinely enthralling story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found, however, was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nNothing, Christopher? But that doesn't make sense. You watched 12 episodes of SOMETHING, right? There can't possibly have been NOTHING in those twelve episodes, right?\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, you're right. I did sit in front of a screen for a regrettable four and half hours of my life, and there were words and drawings on that screen, but if I had to really summarize Yuuki Yuuka I would redirect you once more to that word above: nothing. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, Yuuki Yuuna is kind of like a Frankenstein's monster that failed to come to life. It's stitched together from bits and pieces of other things but there's nothing about it that's really its own. There's no voice, no soul. It doesn't use those pieces to create something new, or stand on its own two feet, or say something for itself: essentially, Yuuki Yuuna just IS those pieces, tossed into a bucket together and just sort of sitting there touching each other. And since Yuuki Yuuna is essentially just pieces of other things that are loosely connected, I have no qualms in using the MAL rating system to talk about those pieces. \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nOne could make the argument that the characters in Yuuki Yuuna aren't \"bad characters\". In a sense, you'd be right: they aren't horribly-written people and for the most part they have some semblance of continuity and we can understand where their actions are coming from (though this is not always the case, *ahem* Touga). The problem is, that's essentially ALL that they are: \"not-bad characters\". There's nothing in them. They're just archetypes grabbed from other places that are given mediocre scripts intended to invoke empathy in the audience. That's really all that's expected from them: they're not created to even BE human, their SOLE PURPOSE is to be \"not bad\" enough to the point where the audience cares about them. Not because they have any original ideas in them, not because they carry a piece of the creator, but because they're there, they're cute, and they're not \"badly\" written. There's the older blonde sister who's spunky and cares deeply about her friends, especially her younger sister. There's the younger blonde sister who's shy and cares deeply about her friends, especially her older sister. There's the tsundere girl. There's Yuuki Yuuna herself, who is pretty much the blockheaded hero-of-justice character in a world where the hero of justice never has to actually face the repercussions or naivety of her ideals. There's her best friend Touga who's really just a mess of a character and is used more as a poorly-motivated plot device than a person, but we won't focus on her. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with all these characters, however, is that while they are adequately-written versions of the roles they are meant to fulfill there is an emptiness to them that cannot really be put into the words. No one who wrote these characters cares about them at all. They aren't trying to express anything with them. They're masks, and they're treated as if they were people, and that hollow shallowness prevented me from giving a single shit about what happened to them. When you create characters with the express purpose of making the audience sympathize with them so that you can give them \"feelz\" later on by making them suffer, you haven't really created characters at all. You've just grabbed pieces of people and stuck them together so that they look like a person. It may be cute, but it has no soul. \\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nHere's the part where it was obvious that whoever was writing this was trying really hard to not be accused of plagiarism. While the literal elements of the story may be put together in a new, the structure by which it is built around is nothing that hasn't been seen a thousand times before, and the pieces themselves are unoriginal. Once again, the story feels mostly like pieces stacked together. Rather than have something constant and tight, it pretty much relies on the audience expecting twists and then delivering them often enough to maintain a level of interest. No section of the story can stand on its own as engaging: it RELIES on constant change, because the story possesses no substance of its own to fall back on. In a standstill the audience's eyes begin to adjust to the dull nature of the story, so the story has to be constantly adding new levels. It doesn't really feel like these levels stack cohesively though; it's more like we're just jumping from one platform to the next, and since the platforms are getting crazier the story must be advancing. None of these platforms are compelling in and of themselves though: they're mostly interesting because of the anticipation for the NEXT platform, which creates a bit of a cycle. All these platforms are as hollow as the rest of the show, being in and of themselves bland rehashes of been-done ideas, and the lack of any sort of central voice of the story means that the show fails to connect them in any meaningful way, so what we're left with is almost a pyramid scheme that eventually burns out because it can't create a bigger platform. Temporarily engaging perhaps, but inevitably all the more disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\r\nQ: \"this looks like every other show coming out nowadays, what should we do?\"\\n\r\nA: \"we'll make the magic realm look like a unicorn shat on it, and people will think it's stylistic and original.\"\\n\r\nQ: \"But didn't No Game No Life, Madoka, Shinsekai Yori and Penguindrum already do something like that...? Except with far more creativity, heart, and personal flair?\"\\n\r\nA: \"Shhhh!! These are anime fans, they have the memory of a goldfish. Don't worry about it.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty standard, I don't really have any complaints but once again it doesn't do anything to set the show apart from anything else. It kinda sounds like Fate/Zero's OST with more sugary J-pop crap mixed in. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not much to say. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI had to literally drag myself through the last three episodes of this show. My expectations adjusted pretty consistently throughout. By the episode 5 I wasn't expecting too much, by episode 7 the show became a chore, and by episode 10 I wanted to drop it despite being so close to done, with the only reason I managed to finish it being that I enjoyed taking screenshots of moments that were either downright horrible or were pretty much excerpts from other shows, and because at that point I was actually HOPING it would end with a bullshit \"FIST OF BRAVERY!!\" moment because at least that would be hilariously awful. I wont say whether or not I got my wish though, cuz spoilers I guess. This wasn't funny-bad, it was bland, empty and soul-sucking.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a magical girl deconstruction, see Madoka or Princess Tutu. If you're looking for compelling cute girls doing cute things, see K-On. If you're looking for members of a high-school club having to take on serious issues like death and existentialism, see Angel Beats (it at least has ideas of its own and some passion from the creator). If you're looking for a hero of justice show watch Fate/Staynight, and if you're just looking for a show to watch for the love of god watch pretty much anything else. There is nothing here you can't find in other shows done better. Yuuki Yuuna is nothing: its emotionally-vacant (despite how emotional its characters get) its dry, it's hollow, and its inevitably meaningless. There's no heart from the creators in this piece, there's no passion for storytelling or love for the characters behind it. Yuuki Yuuna is a shameless reaction piece attempting to stitch together the successful elements of other shows in order to appeal to an audience, and as someone with a legitimate passion for writing and storytelling I find this show to be a little angering. Many shows are burdened with flaws, but poor pacing and plot contrivances and annoying characters don't bother me nearly as much as something that refuses to even try to be its own thing. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say it one more time then.\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna is nothing.\\n\r\nUnless you want to watch four and a half hours of nothing, I advise you leave this shiny ambition-less rag buried in obscurity.",

            "content": "In an age where a single idea can be copied, transmuted, inverted, and manipulated in millions of possible ways, the phrase \"That's just a rip-off of ______\" has become increasingly more common. For example, I've heard many arguments that Nagi no Asukara is just a rip-off of From the New World, and while there certainly are similarities between the two, it's quiet a stretch to say that a romance drama is just a rip-off of a dystopian horror series. However, there are times where the degree to which something is copied is so severe that\"rip-off\" really is the only way to describe it. So, when a title gets to that point, is there still enough enjoyment to be gleamed from this newer series to justify its existence?\\n\\n\r\n          I supposed it'd be best to address the elephant in the room first: this is a magical girl series with an incredibly blatant attempt to cash in on the \"little girls suffering\" idea that Madoka Magica had popularized back in 2011 and is continuously called upon again and again within the anime industry because it continues to print money. While in the past I may have suggested that Selector Infected WIXOSS was also riding the Madoka Suffering Train, at least it also had a plethora of new ideas to bring to the table. Y\u016bki Y\u016bna is an absolutely shameless clone of Madoka, from the suffering girls to the horrifying world backdrop. \\n\\n\r\n          There's also the matter of someone getting the bright idea to insert multiple episodes of slice of life-style comedy that served more to pad out the run time than to get us acquainted with the characters, and by the time we had our third slice of life episode in a row, the pacing had slowed to such an unbelievable crawl that I had considered dropping the series and not even doing this review. Additionally, the tonal shift between cutesy fun and heavy action leaning towards horror creates an incredibly unstable and schizophrenic tone for the series overall. With Madoka, the tamer and more relaxed episodes were confined to the first few episodes, but once the rug was pulled out from under us, the pacing grew more and more intense until it threatened to swallow up everything by the end of the series. With Y\u016bki Y\u016bna, the pacing shifts far too much in the first two thirds of the series for us to get a grasp of the true stakes.\\n\\n\r\n          However, despite all that, the payoff that occurs when we hit the final third of the series was really solid; predictable, but solid. It also does take a very slight variance away from Madoka, mostly to avoid plagiarism, and ends up gaining its own level of disturbing horror in terms of the \"little girls suffering\" motif. There is also a very definite exploding point that happens, and once it does, the series really does pick up the pace from there and sprints towards the conclusion. It's just unfortunate that this doesn't happen until the show is almost 70% finished, and at least 40% of that is an annoying slice of life borefest. For that, I'm sure that we can once again thank our head of series composition, Makoto Uezu (Akame ga Kill!, School Days). There were also quite a few gag-worthy moments in the script that were so unbearably cutesy and friendship-loving that I almost wanted to take a break after each episode and switch to Black Lagoon for a few minutes. As for the ending, I won't spoil it, but it certainly didn't deserve the ending that it received, and you can take that for either good or bad.\\n\\n\r\n          The characters aren't really anything new either, yet it's still pretty satisfying to watch their world start to crumble around them. Y\u016bki is our standard heart of gold \"I can do no wrong as long as I believe in the power of friendship\" lead character, aka Madoka Kaname without the indecision, and I was actually surprised by how little screen time she got compared to the others. Mimori is Y\u016bki's best friend who is bound to a wheelchair due to an accident that cost her part of her memory, and her friendship with Y\u016bki ends up being a rather interesting point of development for her. F\u016b is the slightly older, mentor character of the group who has to deal with the fact that she got everyone involved in this situation in the first place, while Itsuki is F\u016b's little sister who honestly just seems to be there to further F\u016b's development. Finally, we have Karin, who could not be more like Kyoko Sakura if she tried; an outsider who is initially put off by how well the group functions together but gradually grows to like them. On a more general note, aside from F\u016b and Mimori, it was rather disappointing to see that everyone else's character development was done in a rather direct and low effort way, whereas F\u016b and Mimori are the only ones that really seem to experience any true sense of psychological terror.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Studio Gokumi (Kiniro Mosaic), and let's not beat about the bush on this one: the animation for this series was incredibly mediocre. While the idea of making the girls cute did get executed well, it was executed almost too well, and some of the girls' expression were so full of sunshine and rainbows that it make me rather uneasy. I do have to praise them for the other emotions that filled the character's faces though, as you really can feel the absolute terror pouring out of them during the final third of this series, especially with F\u016b. Aside from that, most of the animation was pretty bad. The Vertexes were rendered in almost eye-bleeding 3D, the fights scenes weren't that spectacular and the girls were often replaced with 3D models for said fight scenes, and while the set designs in the parallel world were very ominous and intricate, the backgrounds in the real world felt incredibly generic. On a quick side note, I really would like to know why the wheelchair chick got so much of the gratuitous fan service. It seemed horrifically out of place and started giving me Katawa Shoujo flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\n          There is currently no dub for this series yet, and I wouldn't imagine one coming out in the near future.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by the group MONACA, and the soundtrack as a whole ends up being one part Yuki Kajiura imitation and one part generic slice of life background music. However, it's in those imitation Kajiura tracks that we find some really solid and meaty chunks that drove home the intensity of some of the more exhilarating scenes. The opening theme \"Hoshi to Hana\" was performed by the main voice cast and plays us in with a rather subdued pop track, while both ending themes \"Aurora Days\" and \"Inori no Uta\" were also performed by them and end each episode with a soft ballad.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, in regards to a recommendation on Y\u016bki Y\u016bna is a Hero, I'm left asking myself a single question to determine my decision: is there something that this anime brings to the table other than what Madoka Magica has already done and done better? To be honest: no, it really doesn't. Any enjoyment that can be gleamed from this show can just as easily be achieved by rewatching a much better magical girl deconstruction.",

(YuYuYu for short)\r\nStory: 8.5/10\r\nIn post-apocalyptic age where humans are in near of extinction, humans still live each other peacefully.\r\nThe story focused on a group of middle-school girls in a club called Hero Club.\r\nA Club that has a purpose to help other peoplewho need.\\n\r\nThey're living their happy ordinary live until one day they suddenly dragged in different world(?), no I'll say it's a different environment.\\n\r\nBeing the chosen girls by their God, Shinju-sama, they have a duty to fight enemies called Vertex to protect their ordinary life, their world from destruction.\\n\r\nDespite being a magical girl anime, YuYuYu uses term 'Hero' for it which I find that unique.\\n\r\nIt may be started with light-hearted and happy story, but when you walk further.. everything is changed...\\n\r\nEven with only 12 episodes, this anime never felt rushed, or I can say it's well-paced. \\n\r\nThe only thing that I'm disappointed is the ending, but that doesn't change how well written this story is. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best aspects of this anime, I can say it's one of the best in Fall 2014.\\n\r\nOpening scene is very well made, it has a deep meaning that you'll never find out until you watch further episodes.\\n\r\nThe animation and art is improved in every episode, it's carefully made that I find no 'derp-face' when I watched it.\\n\r\nThe background is awesome, it's very artistic with water-paint color.\\n\r\nCharacter design is also great, their transformation outfit is one of my favorite, what can I say, it gives 'ready to fight' feeling from it.\\n\r\nWhat I like is the action scene, it's soooo good, so pumping and so colorful, they even cast flowers in every hit. It matched very well with the background.\\n\r\nThe only flaw is the CGI in 2 first episodes, but after that it's done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is outstanding.\\n\r\nThe OST match very well with every scene in the anime, no flaw, beautiful.\\n\r\nIt'll give you cheering and relaxing feeling in everyday life, and it'll pump you up in action scene.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also great, they fit the character fully. \\n\r\nThey show the character emotion perfectly, especially on character breakdown, impressive work.\\n\r\nYou know, I'm collecting all YuYuYu music, both OST and character song, just how awesome they're.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nYuYuYu only has 5 main and 1 supporting characters, which I find it very pleasant since we can focused on the main girls.\\n\r\nEvery character has a different and unique personality, and they're likable.\\n\r\nUnlike other magical girl anime, YuYuYu treats their characters equally. No one is stronger than the other, this is important.\\n\r\nI like an anime that has a good character development, and this anime has it.\\n\r\nThe character is the most important aspect in this anime. The development is done carefully in every episode.\\n\r\nEach protagonist got a huge development, everyone.\\n\r\nI can guarantee that you'll emotionally attached with one of the main while the story progressing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoy watching this anime, if not, why I bother to rewatched it for 4times?\\n\r\nI smile.\\n\r\nI laugh.\\n\r\nI cry.\\n\r\nI'm fired up.\\n\r\nI'm emotionally driven with this anime, and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is one of other anime that makes me attached to it, and it deserve a spot in my favorite list.\\n\r\nI'll recommend you to watch this anime, you'll not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm not that good at writing, it's hard to choose some right words.\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review. ^^",

            "content": "A show that might be overlooked for its frontal advertisement. Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha (Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero) isn\u2019t your typical \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 type of show. Well, it is for some parts or at least the first 10 or so minutes of the pilot episode. Then, we realize the show is a lot more after a strange message on a cell phone that transports the girls into a world of the unknown. If \u2018magical girl\u2019 is something you\u2019re familiar with and find enjoyable, then this show may be a treat. \r\nTo trace back a bit, the show is an original workanimated by Studio Gokumi. Director Seiji Kishi is in charge of this project while Takahiro (author of Akame ga Kill) does the series planning. What this brings to mind is a strange collective of individuals to craft the series\u2019 story. By all means, this show does sound like what the title suggests but the promotion suggests otherwise. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that the girls\u2019 lives in this series are about to change forever though.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding the series should be simple enough. There are two worlds \u2013 one in the human world that takes place at Sanshu Middle School and another world where strange entities known as Vertex has taken refuge. The first episode quickly introduces the main cast that composes a club known as the \u2018Hero Club\u2019. As the name suggests, it\u2019s made of members who wants to help the helpless; kind of like trying to be heroes. The club also does other activities ranging from arts, craft, music, and literature. Making up the club are Yuna, Fu and her younger sister Itsuki, and Mimori. While their personalities aren\u2019t alike, they connect well as a unit and often enjoy their time in the human world. The show quickly turns the pages towards another side when we see the girls getting transported to another world. As gimmicky as it sounds (complete with the cell phone trope), it may take some people by surprise especially for those who are unfamiliar with the premise or staff. The catch here is that the girls gets to be heroes for real in this other world by combating against the mysterious Vertex.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting concept to note about the show is how the characters\u2019 personalities change or perhaps show their true selves once their circumstances are different. Mimori becomes a prominent an example of this especially after she realizes the true visage of Shinju, the very essence that the Vertex is trying to destroy. Faced with the possibility of losing what she values, Mimori suffers mental breakdowns throughout the show. Another part is the show\u2019s focus on dealing with loss. The first half of the series shows the girls fighting and actually succeeding on most parts in their battle against the Vertex. Unknown to them, there\u2019s a sacrifice (no, not their lives) to be made. The moral of the show suggests that nothing comes without a price and for becoming a hero, there\u2019s also something in exchange to be paid. It brings about a sense of despair that is a solid mixture with the fantasy premise. The show chooses to make this bold choice rather than relying solely on slice of life to craft cleverness. Indeed, this show has its clever moments whether it\u2019s the dark revelations or the character performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a main part of the show as there is only a handful. Each of them stands out in some way although titular character Yuuki is the one that takes most of the spotlight. This is actual primal considering the way each characters\u2019 roles are played throughout the series. They become magical girls, go to this other world, and fight with the future of the universe on the line. What bigger stakes are there? Each character must accept their destiny to overcome a tragic fate. At the same time, the girls\u2019 struggle internally with the truth after realizing that their lives will never go back to the same way before. It\u2019s when you realize that if it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t. The battles against the Vertex is surprisingly not the reason why the girls suffer from despair. In most parts, the girls does fairly well against them but it\u2019s not until they realize what they are fighting for that they break down. Some folks might see this as a ripoff of Madoka or another cheesy gimmick to deconstruct the magical girl trope. However, it\u2019s also important to realize that the show retains its wit and focus. It also has a good momentum and ability to build up events while dropping foreshadowing throughout the story. For anyone who can appreciate a darker side of a magical girl series, then this is something to take notice of. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some of the appealing concepts of the show, the characters does suffer from a bit of stereotypes. In terms of characters, they are still middle school girls so it\u2019s hard for older audience to take seriously at what they say. And because of their age, the girls\u2019 emotional suffering can seem a bit forced with some repetitiveness. The story itself also has some balancing issues where we get a beach episode and introduction of another character (transfer student) to break apart the fantastic four. I don\u2019t mean it literally but rather how the show can create a sense of annoyance as our new character Karin has an ego unlike no other. The series also has a strange direction as the characters seems to be fighting this enemy because it\u2019s just the right thing to do. There\u2019s a lack of a true villain or purpose that makes the series hard to predict. Thankfully, the series does know what it can do with its characters by presenting their desire (through flashbacks) and not steer away from what it has set up. The latter half of the series also has a much better focus without losing balance of the main story. \\n\\n\r\nJudging on artwork and character design, the show is probably is a mixed bag. Let\u2019s face it, the characters look childish. They look like kids with cardboard box designs complete with the magical girl decorations. Although the series has decent production quality, there\u2019s an auto-pilot like expression on the characters\u2019 faces most of the time. That is until the second half, you\u2019ll see how everything changes. Still, the show does deserve some credit for its elaborate design when it ventures into the supernatural realm. The Vertex are designed to look indiscriminately malevolent while their world also has a great degree of otherworldly elements. The magical girls\u2019 designs may look generic but does go through evolution including their weapons and battle gear. And speaking of battles, the show has great choreography and non-stop action when the pace picks up.  \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is surprisingly noticeable throughout the course of the show. The majority of it relies on parts when the series focuses on its battles. Later on in the show, we also get the more emotional aspect where we see characters expresses their desires and fears. I give praise to the actresses with their performances. It\u2019s their ability to convey the suffering of the characters that make them almost seem realistic despite the fantasy gimmicks. To take this further, the series creates a sense of tragedy that seems to be unresolvable with its quiet atmosphere and OST. The OP and ED songs also does well with its well-crafted choreography.\\n\\n\r\nSo what\u2019s the best way to describe this show? Perhaps unorthodox would be a word to use considering the stark contrast of its first and second half with the story. Some people may see this as a Madoka clone when considerations are taken for the usage of tragedy, magical girls, and war against mystery forces. Technical wise, the show does justice in the end with its conventional direction. In retrospect, this show is refreshing for its ability to craft satirical story about heroes. As a kid, I\u2019m sure everyone had his or her own dream but you may wonder the moment when that is shattered. Step into the shoes of these girls and you\u2019ll realize the experience. \\n",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru was another member of the new-age magical girl genre--a collective of teen girls with your basic set of personalities (smart one, shy one, large breasted one, etc.) receive superhuman powers and moe outfits to fight some villain, the new age aspect being that there is some horrible catch to it.\r\nUnfortunately, since Madoka Magica, it has become a nightmare to build hype for any new shows falling into these guidelines. Understandably, it is very hard to compete with a show that got not only its twelve episodes, but its drama CDs and several movies. Yuuki Yuuna just seems something ofa wannabe Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has faults in that the pacing is incredibly uneven; toward the middle of the anime, there are several filler episodes that are hardly worth watching, as it seems like Yuuki Yuuna tried to drop from the magical girl genre to the slice of life genre. I have little problem with slice of life, but I do have a problem with being ripped out of an action-ridden battle to hear about how helpful each girl is to the community. \\n\r\nThe slow realization of the catch to the magical powers is a good cherry on top of the cake, as that is the moment where one gets the most out of the characters. It's almost satisfying to see each of the girls suffer a touch after having one too many episodes of ease. \\n\r\nAdditionally, the realization of demise brings emotion out of the characters that you just don't see early on. \\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna herself acts as a weak link in the cast. While this girl is the supposed main character, she hardly gets as much screen time as a main character should--nor just she get enough character development. Next to her friend Togo, who only gets more and more dynamic with each episode, Yuuna remains a flat, peppy girl who solves all of her problems with willpower and a strong belief in friendship. \\n\r\nThat belief acts as a major cop-out during the series as well, solving every single one of the girls' problems in a very developed tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nIt may sound cruel, but I am almost disappointed these characters didn't suffer more--or rather, I am disappointed their suffering was disgustingly impermanent. \\n\r\nYuuna, as a character, did not deserve to have all of her problems fixed by her one-note personality. She watches as her friends lose hearing, sight and the ability to speak everyone pities her because she can no longer taste snacks. Yuuna takes none of the blunt force of repercussions until the final moment, and even then, the satisfaction of watching something happen to her is pulled away in an instant with the 'friendship conquers all' cliche.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the despicable treatment of the main character, the art and sound were not incredibly notable. The design for the areas where most of the action takes place are interesting, and the choice of watercolor and pastel is a unique juxtaposition coupled with the battle that is taking place in the foreground. \\n\r\nLet a quick warning be given, there is a bit of shameless fanservice involving Togo, the disabled girl in the wheel chair; ask yourselves, is it /really/ necessary to sexualize the girl in the wheel chair of all people?\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna did, however, do a good job of wrapping up the plot in a way that satisfied the anime's needs. The climax pulled through despite some difficulty managing the show's pacing. Someone less critical than me might enjoy the show more even--just don't look for Yuuki Yuuna to be anything other than the one-note courageous hero the title promises her to be.",

They are all about that friendship power, and they really make up a cute and empowering cast of girls (who are really heavy on that girl power. This show is a feminist's dream.)\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, you can't be a Madoka clone without having some sort of twist. YuYuYu has such a twist, which is why it's always considered a Madoka clone, but here is actually where they also differ!\\n\\n\r\nMadoka = Dark as fuck.\\n\r\nYuYuYu = Sad as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu is an incredibly heart wrenching show, combining seemingly unstoppable drama with brilliant voice acting to create a crap ton of source material to cite your tears with. This show joins the small group of shows that actually made me genuinely shed a tear or two, which is really impressive. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- An abnormally good story for a slice of life 12 episode show.\\n\r\n- Great artwork, both background and character design wise.\\n\r\n- A 10/10 tier OST.\\n\r\n- Brilliant voice acting, like damn...\\n\r\n- Great exploration of its themes.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Not-so-great resolving of its themes...\\n\r\n- Pretty generic cast of characters/\\n\r\n- Dat ending though.\\n\r\n- Awkward transition/pacing issues.\\n\r\n- Inconsistent animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nWhy did I give such a fundamentally flawed and plot hole filled story a 9? TO SPITE MY FRIENDS!!\\n\\n\r\nThat, and because despite the many flaws in the story, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru still delivered what it promised, and that is feels. YuYuYu really knows how to smack your face with a giant dildo made of feels. But that's not what it only does! It also warms your heart with moe slice of life shenanigans! Incredibly large amounts of slice of life comedy and melodrama? Yuuki Yuuna really is a Filthy Casual.\\n\\n\r\nThe overlooking theme of this entire show is the meaning of sacrifice. In order to gain the power to protect something, you must give up something as well. Upon learning about the truth, people usually prefer insurance over an uncertain future.\\n\\n\r\nI would talk about the bullshit ending, but honestly, I wasn't THAT triggered by it. (Yeah, that really makes my opinion credible, amirite?)\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru managed to make the stakes seem incredibly high. The drama seemed so unfair and unavoidable, any school girl under those circumstances would completely break down, and that's what they did. Like if you cry everytime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI love the character designs. They aren't special or anything, but they are still good! The designs for their transformed forms are also really cool! Also, them transformation animations! SO CUTE!!\\n\\n\r\nThe background art also has it's moments as well! For one thing, the world of the vertexes is pretty cool! The action scenes were fairly well done, although it can get lazy sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThis would generally make the art an 8 or 7, but what topped the cake off is the fact that the cow fairy looked like President Aria from the Aria series. Stamp. Of. Approval.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI didn't expect this series to have a kickass soundtrack, but guess what? Its soundtrack kicked my ass.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it be through a hype generating soundtrack during the battle scenes with the vectors, the absolutely heart breaking music during the dramatic scenes, or the upbeat and catchy tunes of your everyday moe slice of life, YuYuYu always manages to masterfully support its scenes and moods with its soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, voice acting. This series has some REALLY good voice acting, especially during a select few scenes. I was told about this before I even started watching, but it still managed to impress me thoroughly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOther than the fact that Yuuki Yuuna is self aware of her low IQ, the characters in this series aren't very unique. They do have a decent amount of character, and go through a decent amount of development, they just don't really stand out by themselves. Fuu and Itsuki are your really stereotypical Onee chan and Imouto duo. Yuuki Yuuna is that overly optimistic protagonist who believes in Nakama power. Karin is a tsundere. Togo is the calm one. (She's basically the Mami of the group.) They just absolutely love quoting their Hero Club's tenants, resulting in some pretty cliche WILLPOWER BEATS ALL moments. Despite the fact that they aren't a special cast of characters, they are still respectable and you do care for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI love moe slice of life! I love extreme amounts of melodrama! I like magical girls! Combine them all? Of course I'm gonna love it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nYuYuYu is a show that can really hold it's own as a great and engaging show. While it does have it's fair share of issues, and is the definition of modern anime, it's still an enjoyable watch nonetheless. After all, Yuuki Yuuna is a Filthy Casual.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: #NotAMadokaClone!!!",

            "content": "[SPOILER FREE REVIEW] \r\n(be careful because there are loads of spoilers on the internet, but luckily not here :) )\r\nI am in love with this anime. I must say that it was not what I first expected, but I am a huge fan of it now. I hope my review will be helpful to decide if it is also something for you :) \r\nWhat am I going to discuss in this review?\r\n- Short summary of the anime\r\n- Why watch this anime?\r\n- short list of Pro's & Cons\r\n- Best order to watch the anime series\r\nAnd for fans of Madoka Magica:\r\n- Is it similar to Mahou ShoujoMadoka Magica?\\n\r\n- in what ways are they similar?\\n\\n\r\nShort summary of the anime\\n\r\nYuYuYu (short for Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru, since it is a bit a long name to keep repeating) is about a group of girls that started a hero club to help people with everyday problems, to make the people around them happy.\\n\\n\r\nBut soon they also find themselves chosen to save the world from Vertexes, forces that try to destroy the world they love so much. The hero club has to find a balance between their normal activities and saving the world. \\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be an hero, how do you cope with knowing of evil others can't ever see?\\n\\n\r\nWhy watch this anime?\\n\r\nYuYuYu is a great anime to easily get hooked on. I was not planning to watch the entire season in one day, yet I did. \\n\r\nThe anime gives you a good variety of different emotions through a combination of story, music and visuals.\\n\r\nThe anime does not use too mainstream characters. \\n\r\nOne of the main characters is a girl in a wheelchair. And no one is like: \"Ahw you poor girl, you are bound to this wheelchair, let me help you.\" I think it is amazing how they made this character an actual representation in the series, where a lot of series totally fail at this. \\n\r\nThat being said I don't have a favorite character, nor do I hate one character. The characters are all balanced and realistic, they all have their flaws and go through a development.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing and synchronizes well with the events in the series. It gives you a hint of what is coming, yet the series is full of plot-twists and unexpected events.\\n\\n\r\nPro's\\n\r\n- Good character building.\\n\r\n- Plays with your emotions, but in a good way.\\n\r\n- Semi-unexpected plot-twists and unexpected events.\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack, well balanced and in sync with events.\\n\r\n- Great animation of the \"Vertex forest\". I honestly love this part of the animation.\\n\r\n- One of the main characters is a girl in a wheelchair.\\n\r\n- Characters are equally likeable, balanced and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Vertex animations are robotic, although it does give them an eerie look.\\n\r\n- I think the love/friendship bond might be a little too much sometimes.\\n\r\n- I find that YuYuYu does too much fan-service, like in the transformations in later episodes, you see more and more big boob and under skirt shots. No. Stop it. They are children.\\n\r\n- I have to cry when I hear certain soundtracks. But I like them anyway. Help.\\n\\n\r\nBest order to watch the series\\n\r\nAs this is an anime review I will only give you the order to watch the anime series. If you wish to read the light novels as well, there are plenty of viewing guides on the web, but I only watched the anime (and I am fine with it).\\n\\n\r\n1) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (obviously).\\n\r\n2) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou (choose between the movies or the tv-version, there are minor differences).\\n\r\n3) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou.\\n\\n\r\nI am personally most fan of the second one, Washio Sumi no Shou (again, it doesn't really matter whether you watch the movie or tv-version) since it explains a lot of things that happen in the first and it has the best story. But even though this is a prequel, you won't understand parts of it unless you watch YuYuYu first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs it similar to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?\\n\r\nJust like many others, I found this anime when trying to find something like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Note: I did not want to find something exactly the same, I know many YuYuYu fans hate the comparison with Madoka Magica but I did want to find something that would get me hooked and gave a similar feeling. For me, YuYuYu did that. And more. \\n\\n\r\nSo in what ways are they similar?\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack.\\n\r\n- Plot-twist heavy, something I really love.\\n\r\n- Well played on the emotions: Prepare to be amazed.\\n\r\n- Nice artwork, I loved the mazes in Madoka and though the artwork of the forest is different I think it gives the same feeling. I am not really fan of the Vertexes animation (clearly robotic, digital animation) but they do fit in and give an eerie look.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! And don't forget the Hero Club five tenets!",

            "content": "How far will you push yourself for the sake of others even when you know every step you take may hurt you? Welcome to the world of Yuki Yuna is a Hero where hope is sometimes all that\u2019s left to stand on, but it might just be enough to get you over the line. A story following a school hero club thrust into an unexpected fight, Yuki Yuna starts slow but finishes with a bang to make for a magical girl experience that ranged from frustrating to thrilling.\r\nStory\r\nThis is probably the first show I\u2019ve watched where the enjoyment I got out of it was hamperedby comparing it to another show. I heard the talk before watching about how the anime was a \u2018rip-off\u2019 of the 2011\u2019s massive hit which shook the magical girl genre, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. The answer? Yes and no. Character traits and roles in the Yuki Yuna team do feel somewhat familiar. \\n\\n\r\nCan it still stand on its own accord? Absolutely. There\u2019s an interesting complication plus some reveals that kept me interested. Many also like to claim that the \u2018darker\u2019 themes of the shows fall too close together but I think the two shows take them in different directions. To say how this is achieved is quite the spoiler. Just don\u2019t go in expecting a blanket copy of the story \u2013 I can give it that much credit.\\n\\n\r\nEnough comparing, let\u2019s actually talk about Yuki Yuna as its own work.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Yuna Is A Hero is a story that follows the title character and her classmates during their fight with the mysterious enemy known as the \u2018vertex\u2019. Naturally things aren\u2019t as smooth sailing as they would seem at first glance. The truth behind the enemy and the girls\u2019 purpose for fighting slowly comes to the fore. The real meat of the story is watching how the team cope with the revelations thrown in front of them. It\u2019s a story with nothing you haven\u2019t seen before: \u2018Hope being the strongest weapon\u2019 \u2013 but the delivery is entertaining the later it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening portion of the show felt formulaic and everyone seemed too accepting of the role they\u2019ve been thrown into. While there\u2019s some great looking battles there\u2019s nothing that made me say \u2018wow\u2019 or feel like something I hadn\u2019t seen before. I did like the dynamic between the team members, and although they may fall into some \u2018tropey\u2019 behaviours, I was at least made to care about them from an early point.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s my biggest gripe with the show by a country mile: The middle third.\\n\r\nThis section had the problem that the content and the pace was too drastic of a change-up compared to what came before it. The trouble was that the shift in tone was so out of nowhere that it made it difficult for me to keep taking the show seriously. If an anime wants to spell out its themes, establish the mood it\u2019s going for but then decide to take time out in favour of clear eye-candy moments - that serve almost no purpose to advancing those said themes - then I\u2019m left with a bad taste in my mouth. I do understand that this brief slow-down in the story helps develop the characters a little but it certainly could have been done a different way. Don\u2019t pull me in then in just the space of a few episodes make me start asking \u201cwhen does it end?\u201d You\u2019ve clearly done something wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the final third of the show is a thrilling conclusion and although the ending didn\u2019t rub me right way I was definitely hooked in the lead up to it. One big problem with the said ending was that I didn\u2019t get any sense of closure and it all made me wonder whether the plight of our characters was worthwhile. The second half still saves the show and at least made my personal plight, as viewer sitting through this, feel worth the ride. Knowing there\u2019s challenges and burdens to carry that go beyond just fighting the Vertex is excellent. There\u2019s actually some complexity to the tale and it\u2019s great to see characters having to seriously question what is right and what is wrong when it comes to fighting. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s just such a pity that story is so \u2018fractured\u2019 into these different segments. There\u2019s practically no flow between them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that some characters feel a bit too familiar from another magical girl show. I don\u2019t, for instance, have to tell you who Fuu Inubouzaki reminds you of. Even though part of me wants to go on comparing shows, I\u2019ll stop there because Fuu is one of the stronger characters in Yuki Yuna. As the team leader her role goes beyond just giving the orders but when things go wrong she\u2019s the one that feels the brunt of the problems. And boy does she have to carry some big ones. Watching her trying to maintain her leader\u2019s position and cope with those is one of the more interesting aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHer younger sister Itsuki is part of her personal motivation but Itsuki herself felt a bit forgettable when it comes to being part of the larger picture. She gets her own moment in the spotlight but it was perhaps a little cheesy. While I also found Karin Miyoshi\u2019s character annoying, and also very predictable in her development, she was at least important for the team\u2019s character development as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nMimori Tougou is easily the most interesting character. Bound to a wheelchair she\u2019s instantly at a disadvantage from the get go. She makes up for her lack of physical presence by being resourceful and level-headed \u2013 whether in or out of a fight. She\u2019s the anchor that keeps the group grounded. Her intelligence also sees her feel confident to make some huge decisions at critical times, decisions that have the potential for massive repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there\u2019s our main character. I do love that Yuna is the catalyst for helping everyone else find themselves and overcome their problems. She carries a sense of abundant optimism that no one else in the team shares. She\u2019s the standard \u2018if you believe you can overcome anything\u2019 character but there\u2019s no harm in that. It goes hand in hand with the theme that the show goes for: that hope can overcome despair no matter how great it may seem. Her individual contribution to moving the show\u2019s story forward is actually quite minimal but she\u2019s a decent lead character because you do feel like she\u2019s having an effect on the other members.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciated that fact that all the characters\u2019 motivation made perfect sense. Each of their reasons to be involved and look out for one other were spelt out clearly for the viewer. The troubles that inflict each of them make for some good complication and there\u2019s always that lingering sense of fear that someone is going to push themselves over the edge. Consequences for actions, whether said actions be seemingly right or wrong, feel huge. Reveals about the enemies and their origin did a good job of making me wondering what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nFighting is the core of this show so plenty of work has clearly gone into making the environment unique. It\u2019s a colourful, tangled universe that\u2019s cool to look at. The CG features heavily and it ranges from hilariously out of place to solid. I think the abstract style of the world our characters fight in helps out the CG models a lot as they don\u2019t look horrifyingly out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThe string-laden OST is nice though there\u2019s nothing that stands out. It does its job. Sounds effects in battle give plenty of impact and also goes a long way to giving the Vertex that \u2018otherworldly\u2019 feel.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nWhile copping a flak for being a little too similar to something before it I found Yuki Yuna worth the watch. There\u2019s nothing revolutionary to be seen, and it\u2019s a pity that it takes so long to get to the true complication of the story, but it\u2019s worth it. There\u2019s wonderful chemistry between the characters, the fights are usually entertaining and the problems the team become burdened with keep things engaging. Getting through the lulls in the story is a challenge. It may require you to push yourself through episodes at times but you\u2019re bound to take away something from the show.\\n",

            "content": "Every time I see an anime cover with a cute magical girl/s, I always get the feeling that it's going to be similar to Madoka Magica. I tried the show out just to confirm my curiosity and what do you know, it is similar to Madoka but do not think the show is a Madoka rip-off because it's not. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8.8/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe story takes place in the era of the gods, Year 300. Yuuna Yukki lives an ordinary life as a second year middle school but she's also a member of the \"Hero Club\", where club activities involve dealingwith a mysterious being called \"Vertex\". \\n\\n\r\nThis is now the second Madoka-esque anime that I have seen (First being Selector Infected WIXOSS) and I wasn't even searching for this anime. I just found it on Netflix, I saw the cover and I decided to try the first episode just to see if it was similar to Madoka. My curiosity confirmed, I decided to watch the whole show since it was only 12 episodes. After watching through 12 episodes, I really wanted more. The show turned out to be way better than I expected. \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't take that long to show the viewers what to expect about this show. Halfway through the first episode, it immediately got straight to the point. They're magical girls fighting for the organization called \"Taisha\" and must defeat \"Vertexes\" to keep the world safe. Unfortunately, the organization \"Taisha\" wasn't explained that well. Who exactly is \"Taisha\"? What was their backstory and how did they know about the \"Vertex\"? All we know is they're just an organization choosing middle school girls (what was the reason for not picking boys again?) with high marks to fight for them and protect the world. Anything more about them is left to the viewers interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nIn the second half of the show, the girls find out that there are consequences for being a Magical Girl or what the show calls it \"Hero\". To be more specific, if they keep using their \"Mankai\" powers (special powers), they will permanently lose a body part and it will never heal again. The show used this to their advantage, showing the characters struggling and how they dealt with it. If you have watched Madoka before then the dark plot twist shouldn't be a surprise to you. It wasn't a surprise for me but it was still a great plot twist.  \\n\\n\r\nThere was one effective dramatic moment that occurred in Episode 9 where Fu broke down after she found out that her sister auditioned for a singing program. She made it through the audition but because of the consequences of using Mankai, she lost her voice and will never achieve her dream of being a singer. I did not sign up for the feels. I never expected that dramatic scene. To be honest, the episode broke me down and I almost cried, no lie. I mean, you can feel (I did) what Fu was going through when she heard that file. On top of that, there was a background song playing while the scene was playing and it made that scene even more sad. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to talk about the ending. I wouldn't call it great nor would I say that the ending was downright terrible. The problem with the ending is it threw out everything the show was trying to build in the first 11 episodes. I was expecting the characters to stay that way because........the show claims that it was a permanent damage. Did Shinju-sama heal their permanently damaged bodies after they defeated the \"Vertex\" or was it because of \"friendship\"? Either way, it looked like the show did a complete 180 and went for a happy ending with no explanation whatsoever. To be honest, I wasn't really disappointed with the happy ending but I would have preferred the bad ending since the tone of the second half was pretty dark.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI didn't really like the character design when I first saw it. The biggest problem that I had with the character design was their face. I didn't really like how they look like they were blushing all the time. I got used to it after 2 episodes so it doesn't really matter anymore. The visuals and the animation looks great and I first thought this was a P.A Works anime. Turns out, it was some animation studio under the radar and is not well known.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply amazing. Did Yuki Kajiura do the soundtrack? No?! Sounds like she did. The OST's are amazing, the battle themes are amazing. the theme used for the transformation scenes are amazing, the insert song used in Ep. 9 was amazing..Need I say more?.......She obviously didn't orchestrate the soundtrack which was kinda disappointing. Now the OP and ED theme songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Hoshi to Hana\" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and the ED theme songs are \"Aurora Days\" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and \"Inori No Uta\" by Itsuki. The OP theme song sounds awesome especially when all the 5 singers are singing together. The bass in the background is also another reason why I love the OP theme song. The song is also saved on my phone so if someone will need to get help because I can't stop listening to it. The 1st ED theme song is pretty average and I love...love the 2nd ED theme song. Just like Clannad AS' sad songs, this song also makes me tear up everytime I hear it. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VAs. In my opinion, the sound great. Especially Fuu's voice acting at Episode 9. Her breakdown sounds convincing as hell. There was one slight issue in the voices and I found this to be an issue in both Japanese and English voices. It's Episode 11 and 12's constant shouting. It was annoying in English and It was even more annoying in Japanese. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nMy expectations weren't that high when I first watched the show. In other words, I wasn't expecting the show to be that great because like I said, I just wanted the check the show out to confirm my curiosity. I wasn't expecting the characters of the show to have a great character development and to be this fleshed out because it's only 12 episodes. I can't believe I have to say this but..........the show's characters are simply amazing. Do I dare to say that they're better than Madoka Magica's character? No but they're pretty close. All of the characters are fleshed out and all of the characters are mostly developed throughout the course of the show. Almost everything that they do are believable and the way Y(uuki)Y(una is a)(H)ero shows these girl's friendship and how they help each other out is almost realistic. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting the characters to be similar to Madoka then get rid of that expectation right now. There is now way in hell in hell these characters are similar and that's a good thing. Well, Besides Fuu being similar to Mami (They're both the Senpai and they both lead the group), they're not similar. They didn't copy every element from Madoka and the show did something of their own.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nAs someone who only wanted to watch 2 episodes just to confirm his curiosity (I'm talking about me in case you didn't notice), I did not expect to enjoy this show as much as Madoka. By the 3rd episode, I ended up marathoning the show just like I marathoned Madoka a few months ago. Sad to see the show end, to be honest. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nDespite the amount of Madoka rip-offs in today's anime industry for whatever goddamn reason, \"Yuuki Yunna is a Hero\" is not one of them. It borrowed most of its element from Madoka while at the same time, doing something on its own that makes it a unique show to watch and not a blatant rip-off just so they can try and garner the same amount of popularity as Madoka. If you're a big Madoka fan or you're looking for a great character-driven story then this anime is a must-watch. It is one of the most underrated anime shows that I have ever watched. Just watch out for the ending which might kill the show for you. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Story\\n\r\n+Stunning Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Great Character Designs\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack and OST's\\n\r\n+Great and Believable Characters\\n\r\n+Characters are Fleshed Out and Mostly Developed\\n\r\n+Effective Dramatic Scene in Episode 9\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Ending might kill the show for some people\\n\r\n-Tons of annoying shouting at Ep. 11 and first half of Ep. 12",

            "content": "I'll try not to spoil the story, but certain words might give some important plot elements away. \r\nI'm probably a sucker for cute girls doing cute things. Well, unless it's so iyashi it literally puts me to sleep. So seeing the Hero Club do a puppet show for a preschool turned my brain to pudding in a hurry... and then there was a literal punch line, a \"Hero Punch!\" line if you would. LOL.\r\nSo for the next 15 minutes or so it looks like a slice-of-life show with comedic elements. OK, cool, so why is it called Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero?\r\nAs Yuuna is scoldedfor leaving her smartphone on, time stops. Fu runs to her sister and says, \"We've been selected!\" Reality fades away in a rush of petals.\\n\\n\r\nOh. This could get interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a niche industry in Japan that caters to people who want to cry. Melodramas, beautiful music, that sort of thing. The way YuYuYu does it is... well, think Saishuu Heiki Kanojo, but more of a magical girl show.\\n\\n\r\nI say \"magical girl\", but this ain't no Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. The action scenes are intense, and even though these girls have the ability to save the world, it comes at a terrible price. It's more akin to Uta Kata in this respect. This price will ultimately lead to some of the most emotionally intense scenes I've ever watched in anime (even more so considering the chemistry these characters have), capping it off with an epic finale, both in action and emotional weight. This series does get a bit melodramatic, but then, it is a life-or-death scenario.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a work of art in this show. The battle music combines driving beats on the synthesizer with a soaring choir, employing melodies that evoke traditional Japanese religious ceremonies. Another big battle theme evokes the valor of the Heroes, but is in a minor key, and sometimes the phrase \"lamb to the slaughter\" comes to mind as it plays. The songs play an important role as well-- important episodes for a character usually end in a solo by her voice actress. Other nice touches include an opening animation that changes as each Hero builds up power, and episode titles that are the \"messages of flowers\" (which is a thing in Japan).\\n\\n\r\nThe villains, such as they are, are pretty much really powerful Neuroi but with much better art style and no lasers. Why do I say Neuroi? No one knows how they originated, not even the series creators (or no one really bothers to put it in animation, anyway).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if I may be so bold, whoever is in charge of the soundtrack needs to release the song Mimori sang in the karaoke booth.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru\u00a0is a Studio Gokumi anime from late 2014. Yes, the same studio that brought us the fun\u00a0A-Channel & that piece of garbage, Crime Edge. So, I don't know what to expect from this. But it's the end of hero month and let's hope we can end it like we began it, on a high note. Because, so far, the only good series we've looked at this month has been Boku no Hero Academia.\u00a0\r\nStory:\u00a0\r\nWe open with our titular heroine, Yuuki Yuuna working with members of her middle school's Hero Club to put on a puppet show. Basically, these four girls gettogether to help out in other clubs, finding homes for kittens and other public services. Things change when, one day, everything freezes during class and the four find themselves in an altered landscape. It turns out the hero club has a hidden purpose, to defend the barrier created by the Shinju that preserves their world. They become magical girls, fighting whenever they're called but they quickly learn that there's a secret behind their powers and it may be too much for them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the series, narratively, is that the final climactic turn may be a bit too easy. Basically, the big \"antagonist\" is too easily dissuaded from what she's doing. It kind of makes sense in context but it might work a bit better if it took a little more effort. The ending may also be a bit too predictable once things get going. Though I'd be lying if I said I disliked it.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are a lot of good things about the series. The events leading up to the big climactic clash are very well handled. There are some strong emotional scenes. Two of which definitely may have elicited some tears from me. The series does a good job of subverting some aspects of magical girl shows while embracing others, including the optimistic outlook. Holding on to hope is a big theme in this series and it works really well. Honestly, I appreciate that it can incorporate some elements that are dark for a magical girl series while still keeping things generally optimistic. There are too many works out there that treat dark content as something you have to go all the way with or just can't have at all. It's nice seeing something with a more nuanced take on it. I also appreciate the way the world building is handled. We don't get a bunch of boring exposition, instead they show us throughout the series what the world they're living in is like and what the more unusual elements like Shinju, Taisha and Vertexes actually are. Foreshadowing is pretty well handled as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is mainly composed of five characters. Yuuna, Tougou, Karin, Fuu & Itsuki. On the surface, they're a pretty archetypal magical girl group. However, every single character goes beyond the typical tropes that they start with. Whether it's accomplished through their reactions to tragedy, their interactions with one another or their way of pursuing their own dreams. Which makes the cast quite compelling. The character interactions are quite strong as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nI also do like the way shifting loyalties are handled. There is solid reasoning behind them that makes sense while also revealing information about the characters in question. The only real issue I have is that the vertexes are kind of nothing villains. We know what they're trying to do and we know the basic reason why but that's about all they have. To be fair to the series, they do provide an in universe explanation for why that is.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of positive aspects to the art. The vertexes have interesting designs. The heroines are well designed and their magical girl forms are nicely detailed. The supernatural world where they do their fighting looks pretty interesting. The fights themselves are quite well done. They involve actual weapons too. Fuu has a buster sword. Karin uses a pair of katana. Tougou has guns. Which leads to some interesting action sequences.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some strong actresses for this series. Terui Haruka, Mimori Suzuko, Nagatsuma Juri, Kurosawa Tomoyo & Uchiyama Yumi are all really good in this. The emotions they convey just come across as so genuine and the way they converse with one another has a good level of verisimilitude to it. The music by Okabe Keiichi & Hoashi Keigo is really good as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a general undercurrent among most of the girls. The sisters being the obvious exception. It's clear that they care about each other but it's equally clear that it's familial. The most prominent les-yay is between Yuuna and Tougou. They come across as being deep into their first feelings of romantic love. Once Yuuna figures it out they'll probably start dating.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to go into these without giving too much away.\\n\\n\r\nI'd make that final conversation that leads up to the climactic turn a little more substantial.\u00a0\\n\r\nExtrapolate on the effects change at the end a bit more.\u00a0\\n\r\nHave some anger directed at Fuu. Basically, Fuu knows that they could be called on to act as heroes, but doesn't tell the others. That's not much of a spoiler since it's a part of the first episode. But what bothers me a little bit is that everyone else is immediately okay with it. I'd like to see them take some time to get over the feelings of betrayal over that. I think it would make for some interesting character moments.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Yuuki Yuuna was Yuusha\u00a0has a lot of good elements. It has a lot to recommend its story and its characters. It has great art, great acting and solid music. It could also be improved with more time to flesh things out properly but, for what it is, it's a great series. In the end, I'll give it an 8/10. And I do recommend it for those of you who like magical girl series that do things a bit differently.\u00a0",

            "content": "--- INTRODUCTION ---\r\nI decided to watch Yuki Yuna is a Hero after thoroughly enjoying Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, which opened my mind to what the magic girl genre could be and is one of the best series I've seen. In a nutshell, Yuki Yuna spectacularly failed at almost everything that I loved about Madoka Magica, but it had nothing to do with superficial similarities between the two shows, and everything to do with... well, a whole list of things right below:\r\n--- THE BAD ---\r\n(story, world building, characters, battles)\r\n(1) The story is the worst part. It has numerous plot holes towards the climax of the showwhen things are supposed to be revealed. There is also one notable example of a plot twist based on a completely illogical and uncharacteristic decision of one of the characters, which the authors attempted to frame in some kind of emotional reasoning but it really didn't work. It was a new experience for me: trying to watch events unfold that are based on a decision so absurd that it completely threw me out of the narrative. Other than that, the show just tries too hard to create drama and doesn't shy away from throwing all logic out of the window. Most notably the ending was a disaster. It has been pulled out of a hat with no explanation of what exactly happened, why, and how.\\n\\n\r\n(2) There is very little world building, and the universe presented just simply doesn't make any coherent, believable sense. There is no depth to the sides of Good and Evil. The enemies just want to destroy the human world for no good reason and the forces of Good are also very ambiguous and manage to make even less sense than the enemies do. Saying that this universe didn't make an impact on me like some other fictional worlds did would be an understatement -- it would imply that the show at least ATTEMPTED to create some kind of interesting fictional world. But it didn't, rather it used the sci-fi / fantasy setting as a throw-away environment for forced drama which is the focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\n(3) The show focuses heavily on the characters in a slice-of-life fashion, but the trouble is, the characters are very one-dimensional. Their biggest weakness is that the way they are portrayed often times completely ignores what humans are actually like and just shows one quality of their character in isolation over and over. For example, our main character is an overly optimistic \"you're likely to succeed if you try\", \"everything is going to be great because we're the Hero Club and we have each other\" type of character. She doesn't have another side where she behaves more human and shows fear, or anger at the tsundere's blatant rudeness, or can't cope with what's going on because she's just a little girl for crying out loud.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are better than others in execution, but even the better characters are still nothing special. They are unmemorable at best, and at worst they don't make sense and are hard to believe.\\n\\n\r\n(4) The battles are very simplistic and boring. Characters just scream \"Hero Punch!\", \"Girl Power!\", or things even worse, like the Five Tenets of the Hero Club one by one while slaying things left and right. This was supposed to make these scenes emotionally charged, but it didn't work and just annoyed me. Moreover, the viewers have no idea how to tell power difference between heroes and enemies, and seeing our characters arbitrary winning or losing based on what the plot demands is predictable and not engaging.\\n\\n\r\nThe fairies did absolutely nothing, had no personalities, were neither cute nor anything else, and are the most bland and unnecessary dare I call them characters I've ever seen. The fact that one becomes a magic girl and a servant to a mysterious tree deity by activating an iPhone app says a lot about the amount of thought put into this show in general.\\n\\n\r\n--- THE OKAY ---\\n\r\n(visuals, dub, the Hero Club, Fu)\\n\\n\r\n(1) The art is fine. The fighting is not very exciting to begin with, but the visuals across the whole show look decent. Nothing you wouldn't come to expect from a 2014 show, but there's really nothing wrong with it either.\\n\\n\r\n(2) The music and songs are meh, but I watched the dub and it was good. I particularly liked the performance of English voice actress of Togo.\\n\\n\r\n(3) Before things went all mahou shoujo, the Hero Club the girls had in the first episode or two was cute. They were trying to help the community in whatever ways they could, and it was nice seeing them taking it seriously and trying to be little adults.\\n\\n\r\n(4) I liked one of the girls, Fu. She's cool and not as plain as the rest of the cast, her motivations are easier to believe. Although that's before I stopped to consider the fact that at the age of 14 Fu has no parents or adult family members. On top, she's living alone with her younger sister acting as her caretaker and legal guardian. And apparently she's been doing that since the age of 12. But don't think too much about it.\\n\\n\r\n--- THANK YOU FOR READING ---\\n\r\nI tried to make this review useful. If you have any feedback please feel free to message me.",

            "content": "**NOTE: This anime is a sequel to the LN 'Washio Sumi wa Yuusha de Aru', it's highly recommended that you do NOT read it before this, don't even look at its synopsis as it contains spoilers, it's recommended however that you read it after finishing this anime as it gives good backstory for some of the characters and works well as a tissue burner.**\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (Yuyuyu henceforth to avoid confusion with the character) was one of the least anticipated tiles for Fall 2014, but as a fan of both the SoL and mahou shoujo genres I figured it'd be a decentwatch but didn't have high expectations for it, the PV hinted at a mundane show about nothing in particular with some magic to mix things up.\\n\r\nUpon looking at the staff list however and seeing names such as Seiji \"Nice Show Would Be a Shame if Something Happened to It\" Kishi (Angel Beats!) and Mr. \"Woah, This Character Is Still Alive? Better Fix That\" a.k.a. Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), I couldn't help but wonder \"what are these monsters doing in a show about cute little girls?\"\\n\r\nYuyuyu's was shaping up to be a massive massacre as Studio Gokumi took the lead in the animation front, and that's exactly what happened, Yuyuyu was indeed a massacre \u2013 of my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with a simple play of a hero trying to stop the demon king, a child's play, aimed at such, but helps set the tone for the rest of the show, in multiples ways, this is a simple story, we're not dealing with an over the top sci-fi setting that requires several episodes before you grasp what is going on and these characters are no geniuses or unique souls who appear once in a thousand years to change the world... Or are they?.. Probably not. \\n\r\nIt takes less than 3 minutes for the characters and setting to be introduced, even as the staff credits appear over several still images it's easy to understand that the world our heroines live in is a simple one, there's some city landscape shown but it's mostly countryside, it all screams peaceful, very peacefully.\\n\\n\r\nYuuna, Tougou, Fuu, Itsuki, together they form the Hero Club, a club that focus on helping people, mainly through the form of community work. Shortly after their introductions, we get to see a bit of their daily lives, make no mistake here however, being part of the SLICE OF LIFE\u2122 genre, this anime makes these cute little girls face real adversities as they try to find owners for kittens, update their website or think of what to do when faced with japanese middle schoolers' greatest fear after common cold \u2013 the cultural festival.\\n\\n\r\nEverything stops, however, when they receive a strange message on their phones. \\n\\n\r\n\"We're it\".\\n\\n\r\nThe members of the Hero Club have been selected to because heroes and fight Vertex \u2013 enemies of mankind that wish to destroy the world \u2013 in order protect Shinju-sama (Divine Tree), the foundation of the world.\\n\r\nWho, why, when or how? Questions which are sure to have an answer somewhere but are they really important? These girls have a world to save, those come later!\\n\r\nAt this point one can't help but wonder if this will be the classical \"enemy of the week\", but fear not, or do.\\n\r\nThe mahou shoujo genre is a genre that has it's tropes very well defined and it's very easy to identify them even without much experience with it, however, Yuyuyu uses these tropes for ease of storytelling but doesn't get lost in them, creating a story and characters that stand on their own.\\n\r\nYuyuyu is more on the \"modern\" side of the genre (look at the bottom of the review for a more detailed analysis), it's not just about mindless murder of hopeless, little Vertex.\\n\\n\r\nEventhough this is a SLICE OF LIFE\u2122 anime these girls are more than just kawaii, each with their own traits and personalities \u2013 simple ones, guessable just by looking at their hair color \u2013 they have more to them than it initially appears, as their pasts are revealed and explored, we get to know more about them, sympathize with them, maybe even relate to them. It ever ends up going overboard about how sad and unfortunate these girls are though, it's life, we have all experienced sudden changes at one point or another, for one reason or another, but that hasn't stopped us from living.\\n\\n\r\nHowever simple Yuyuyu might look like on the surface, it does have depth, while most of the cast might look care free enough for little girls tasked with saving the world, underneath all the fun and entertainment this show provides, there's always that lingering feeling of uncertainty, \"who exactly are the Vertex? Why are they after us?\" But the series never spells it out or feels the need to ask it every episode, which can be both a good and bad thing, it's easy to forget these girls are tasked with saving the world, even the characters themselves are aware of this though, which does serve as a reminder without being intrusive. \\n\\n\r\n\"\"Things are gonna be fun\", huh? We're supposed to be heroes saving the world. How silly.\" \\n\\n\r\nJust as much as this show is self-aware it also has an incredible attention to detail and amazing foreshadowing skills, little things like when the group is facing the first Vertex and Yuuna tries to calm Tougou down, while she's the one shaking; it's so subtle however, that it can go by unnoticed as all that we see is her fist, an easy way to make the audience aware of the fact Yuuna is also scared would be to simply expose Yuuna's thoughts and how nervous she is but the show doesn't feel the need to hold your hand.\\n\r\nThis makes rewatching this series an amazing experience, picking up on little things the characters say or do which spell out the outcome of future episodes and events.\\n\\n\r\nAt it's core Yuyuyu is a very well-realized show, it focus on the big picture \u2013 saving the world \u2013 but doesn't ignore the implications, exploring them and quietly builds up to the finale without you even noticing it's happening.\\n\r\nThe whole atmosphere the show builds has a much greater purpose, tense moments that lack tension are not because the show itself can't create it well, it doesn't need them all the time, it knows how to set a mood but doesn't need the mood to be heavy 24/7, it doesn't take every opportunity it gets to try to create something, it knows exactly when to strike. Perhaps Takahiro realized it wasn't the best of ideas to kill off a character every episode, it numbs the audience, after a while you just expect it and you start to care less and less. \\n\r\nHints are left behind with every corner the show turns but it doesn't come back to pick them up again, as said above, incredible self-awareness and attention to detail, enjoyment when rewatching the show is easily doubled, a feat accomplished by very few series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Though there is no other thing that can fascinate humans more than the truth\\n\r\nThere is nothing that is more cruel to humans than the truth.\"\\n\r\n(...)\\n\r\n\"No matter what... No matter how tough it gets... Live on.\"\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Yuyuyu nails however, it's certainly its message, what implies being a hero, the regrets of becoming one, the hopelessness of not being able to change the past or the future but still trying desperately to do so when faced with picking between loneliness and suffering or no future at all.\\n\\n\r\n\"Being a Hero isn't about making sense or bending to the cruelty of the world. It isn't about being a sacrifice for others or defeating villains. Being a Hero isn't even about saving people. \\n\r\nBeing a Hero is about facing everything that is terrible and wrong and refusing to accept it. So when that Hero strides forth against impossible odds other can look towards them as a shining beacon of hope, stand up, and follow in their footsteps.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhich would you pick?\\n\r\nWould you still manage to become a hero even if it meant sacrificing yourself?\\n\r\nEven if it meant having a future filled with nothingess?\\n\r\nOr would you rather have no future at all? Would you leave your friends behind to suffer? Would you take them with you in a selfless act of desperation? Or would you fight alone and take all the burden yourself?\\n\r\nThe sacrifice of few to save the rest is explored a lot in anime but what if there's nothing to save? What if you can't save anyone no matter how much you sacrifice? Would you just give up? Or grab onto the little hope and strength you have left? Could you keep going knowing, no matter what you did, the future wouldn't change? \\n\r\nYuyuyu doesn't directly ask many questions and it answers even less but it doesn't need to do so, everything is made obvious through the characters, their actions and their situation, \"show\" is prioritized over \"tell\" but it doesn't forget to keep the plot coherent, this can also be seen as a flaw as viewers who don't pay much attention might get lost and feel like things happen for no reason, in the end it's also up to how each one of us interprets it.\\n\r\n-insert \"truly the evangelion of the madoka of our generation\" joke here-\\n\\n\r\nEven regarding character backstories Yuyuyu is a rather unique series, they are introduced later than sooner, which usually isn't the case, at least in this sort of series, the first few episodes are usually used to build the characters and then move with the plot, Yuyuyu leaves characterization for when it's necessary and... it works. \\n\r\nInstead of focusing on everyone at the start and overloading the audience with exposition Yuyuyu lets the viewer relax and progresses the plot in a well paced manner as it introduces plot twists and character backstories to maximize the various emotions it invokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe calm before the storm vibe is very much present most of the time, even after the fighting ends, which is when Yuyuyu holds your hand and tells you it'll be daijoubu like the well dressed man in front of a black van giving out candies, you are wary of him at first but then you take the candy and realize he's not a bad guy at all.\\n\\n\r\n\"Our fight is over. We won't lose anymore.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly an anime that takes it's time and perhaps could take even longer was more time allocated \u2013 and being a show that scales really well with how much times passes, it'd only get better \u2013 but it's certainly not a waste of time, it does end up being a hard series to evaluate if you go over it on a episode by episode basis as the start is rather slow and uneventful, but it's all by design. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the main problem with Yuyuyu is that it sets the bar too high towards the end, so high the show itself can't see it and when it tries to jump over it obviously fails.\\n\r\nBut it's really up to the viewer to decide wether it fails or not, Yuyuyu leaves enough hints behind that you can use them to justify just about anything, it's more a question of wether you want to believe or not, like said above, it can be considered a flaw as people who don't catch every little detail might be left behind, and it's asking a lot to catch 'em all.\\n\\n\r\nAfter their lastest work, Escha & Logy no Atelier, learning that Studio Gokumi would be animating this series certainly did not inspire much confidence, so it's with great suprise and joy to see how well Yuyuyu turned out in the visuals department.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs fit well enough, they are the sort of normal designs that you'd expect from a slice of life series, plain, cute, smile-inducing, with the kawaii and moe meters in the red zone.\\n\r\nThe magical costumes the girls use are simple yet stylish, they feel fresh, modern, it avoids the classical fluffy cocktail dresses for most of the girls and replaces them with clothes that resemble actual armor, even if on the light side \u2013 these girls actually look like heroes. \\n\r\nWhen in most other cases less clothes equals more protection, Yuyuyu certainly makes these girls look good as they attempt to save the world with their fists and giant swords and sniper rifles and more swords.\\n\\n\r\nYuyuyu does feature a very good color pallete, especially in the barrier world (Forest) where most of the fighting takes place, the whole place resembles the roots of a tree, with each main root having it's own color and as it branches off it expands on that color, and while the watercolor style works really well it can be a mixed bag when examined up close, sometimes making the characters feel out of place.\\n\r\nWhile the animation in the slice of life moments isn't anything out of this world it certainly does the job well enough, mistakes aren't that obvious and the quality is consistent throughout. When it comes to battles, animation quality does peak but perhaps not really enough to really set it apart, nevertheless, a solid direction goes a long ways and can make or break the scene no matter the animation quality, in Yuyuyu's case it definitely benefits from really good direction, you won't feel it lacks animation or that it has a below average choreography, can't complain much about the latter though, these are little girls, not martial artists, but overall it'll still feel fast paced and intense which is really what is important.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a good amount of character CGI used yet it doesn't feel awkward or out of place, mostly because it's used during jumps when characters have their backs turned, it'll be harder to spot than to avoid. The Vertex are mostly CGI too, they do benefit from the fact that they are mostly immobile or just very slow which doesn't make them stick out as much either.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are rather weak. The OP song isn't that catchy or exciting and takes some getting used to and the animation is nothing worth looking over more than once, the ED shares the same fate, unless you're some creeper who enjoys watching little girls from the bushes as they walk with the sunset in the background you'll probably find yourself skipping over this one too... Is what I'd say had I not watched the show to the end, you'll slowly learn to appreciate them and in retrospect they uphold to the standard set by the series, simply glorious in retrospect.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST and overall sound effects in Yuyuyu, unlike the OP and ED, are amazing from the start, it's the cherry on top of the cake for the series.\\n\r\nBeing a mahou shoujo anime the obligatory transformations scenes before battles are very much present, these are coupled with an amazing track choice that just screams hype, one can't help but feel excited for what's to come next, even if it's not always good, and it keeps going when the battle themes kick in, one stronger than the other it makes the fights feel exciting, a couple tracks even feature chants from worlds unknown to us, making the battles feel alive \u2013 it all culminates together for what is pure audio porn, not even complimenting the battle sequences as much as taking them to a whole nother level.\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life scenes have fairly standard tracks, they don't get in the way and fill in empty space when the little monsters settle down and overall just help move the scenes along not making them feel boring.\\n\r\nSome of the themes that appear during the battles are also present outside of those and it's amazing how it just works.\\n\r\nYuyuyu does feature insert songs, which are easily the high point of the whole category \u2013 for reasons you'll have to find out yourself.\\n\\n\r\nShall something not be perfect with the sound it'd certainly be the seiyuus, not as much as they are bad but as they could be better, criticism being more focused on Yuuna's than anyone else \u2013 eventhough some of them don't speak at all but that's another matter entirely \u2013 Yuuna, while not the leader of the Hero Club, is certainly the main character of the series, if the title wasn't hint enough surely the fact that she has pink hair is a dead giveaway, Yuuna is the character that will push the show forward when it comes to an halt, someone feeling down or angry? There's Yuuna to cheer them up, someone having an identity crisis? There's Yuuna to tell them who they are, someone about to kill themselves? There's Yuuna to tell them to do it. \\n\r\nWhat's that? Haremettes' problems in my mahou shoujos? It's more likely than you think.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a rather new seyuu Terui Haruka's perfomance is excusable and actually fairly decent, her voice fits Yuuna well and she has her moments, however, unlike most of the other cast members those moments come once per episode and, being the MC, Yuuna requires more than that, while those moments are properly timed to fit with the climax of the episodes \"side scenes\" could certainly be greatly improve was Yuuna not as unphasable, but perhaps that comes a bit with the character, emphasis on the perhaps.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a SLICE OF LIFE\u2122, SCHOOL\u2122, HEALING\u2122, CGDCT\u2122 anime enjoying these will help, however, as one would expect at this point, these aren't the main plot points of the show, they probably aren't the reason you are getting into the series either. \\n\r\nWatching these little creatures in their natural habitat is the best way for bonds to be made, to further empathize with these girls and try to get attached to them, enjoying these will only help but being indifferent to them doesn't hurt the enjoyment the show provides.\\n\r\nObviously, if SoL/CGDCT/moe/\"GUYS, I'M NOT DELUSIONAL, THEY ARE HOLDING HANDS AND BLUSHING, YURI!!\"/overall kawaiiness overload murdered your parents then you might want to steer clear. The cute facade the shows puts up has more to it than what it looks, but it's still a facade that you can take at face value and enjoy for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nBig part of the enjoyment factor in Yuyuyu certainly comes from noticing the subtle hints the shows leaves and realizing how they affect and dictate future events, something that was made easier when the show was airing as it left a lot of time to discuss and analyze them (I left some in this review for those who watched the series). Might be harder for people who will watch it now but it's not something required to enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a solid 8.5/10 show \u2013 9/10 on rewatch \u2013 and definitely the surprise of the year, even with a somewhat ambiguous ending, highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nChristmas was saved.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPuella Yuusha no Evangelion; Bokurano Beats!? Nandattebayo? \\n\r\nA story about love, hate, and charisma... and fate, life, death, hope, heartbreaks, lies, deception, delusion, madness, tricks and... a cow that eats other cows... behind a beautiful hero who disappeared in the Seto Inland Sea.\\n\r\nYuyuyu might not be the yuusha we need, it certainly isn't the yuusha we deserve given how underwatched it is in the West but I think it's the yuusha we want, and the yuusha we see off with a smile as it walks into the horizon of uncertainty as this franchise can probably muster the force for more anime entries given how successful it has been thus far.\\n\r\nNow let us hope for a movie adaptation of the prequel light novel.\\n\\n\\n\r\n**\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime, very much like every other medium, is easily influenced by what's trending, every once in a while it's to no surprise that there'll be an anime that will end up setting new standards in it's genre or even in the whole industry, because of how popular and successful it was, even if said anime doesn't invent those ideas it's what made them popular and obviously it'll become a point of reference even if it wasn't the first one. Puella Magi Madoka Magica (PMMM) is one of such titles, it wasn't an unique-never-seen-before-anime, the themes in PMMM had been explored before, multiple times, but it became so popular that it set standards, more for the viewer than for the creators and as such, titles released after it will have to face the fact that they'll be compared to it, wether they wanted to or not. \\n\r\nAs such, mahou shoujo anime that wishes to use the common tropes \u2013 present in the genre for over 30 years \u2013 be it to lure and trick the audience or just use them for ease of storytelling while trying to spicy things up a bit by not feeling like an anime aimed at little girls will perhaps forever suffer of the \"Madoka rip-off\" syndrome.\\n\r\nWhile drawing parallels between the two works is easy enough thanks to the common tropes they use, both explore different themes and take different paths, and both are masterful in how they do it, at their cores they are completely different.",

            "content": "I did not know what to expect when I began watching Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. The previews teased that it was going to be another slice-of-life series, but looks were deceptive. While it has some SOL elements, at its core it's a magical girl show, and a pretty serious one, too. Here\u2019s my final review of the entire series, as of 12/26/2014. If you just want an overall recommendation without any other details, feel free to skip to the tl;dr section at the very bottom.\r\nThe Plot In a Nutshell:\r\nMiddle school girls in a \"Hero Club\" perform small everyday acts of heroism in the normalworld, but also become heroic magical girls protecting the planet from strange creatures called vertexes.\\n\\n\r\nBackground/Influences:\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna  is an original series created by Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), and it blends elements from three different anime genres. First are its magical girl ancestors, and this one comes from the lineage of adult magical girl shows like Lyrical Nanoha and Madoka Magica. Fans of those series will recognize the influences of both, although Yuuki Yuuna still tells its own story in its own way. Second is slice-of-life, and except for the dark clouds that are almost always lingering under the surface, some of the mellowest scenes wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in a Kyoto Animation series. Third is character drama, and here the series actually shows some surprising Key Visual Arts influence (Kanon/Clannad), along with other influences from Angel Beats and the Persona series (Yuuki Yuuna\u2019s director, Seiji Kishi, also directed both Angel Beats and Persona 4 The Animation, so this shouldn't be a surprise). All three genres are done well enough individually that it could have focused on any one of them and been a decent show, but the blend of all three really elevates it above the sum of its parts.\\n\\n\r\nMoe\u2019s Scale of Female Cuteness:\\n\r\nWhile this isn\u2019t a true moe series, all the girls in the Hero Club can be awfully cute. Most of their club activities are ordinary community service work, like fostering kittens and performing puppet shows for kids. They also hang out together sometimes outside of school, eating udon, singing karaoke, and doing other fun things together. The catch is that none of this SOL stuff is there just to be cute and funny \u2013 while some of it may seem frivolous at first glance, the writers are deliberately giving you time get to know the girls and their personalities and motivations by showing you how they behave and act around each other. All the girls have their own personal demons they\u2019re wrestling with, and most of them did not have happy childhoods. Tensions occasionally flare between them, and even in the most seemingly cheerful moments there are lingering undercurrents of anxiety and doubt about the job they have to do and the risk to their lives and well-being, which all makes these scenes even more effective. One of Yuuki Yuuna's greatest strengths is that there's a genuine chemistry between all the main girls in the cast - while they have their occasional disagreements, you never doubt for a second how much they all care about each other, especially the two sisters (Fuu and Itsuki) and the two best friends (Yuuna and Togo).\\n\r\nMost of the slice-of-life stuff takes place in the first half of the show, and while some (especially non-SOL fans) may find these parts a bit slow, it\u2019s still worth paying attention to it because a lot of it is setting the table for the second half of the series. Along with letting you get to know the characters better, there\u2019s also quite a bit of foreshadowing too; I noticed a lot of hints the second time I watched the series that were easy to miss the first time.\\n\\n\r\nRound One\u2026Fight!:\\n\r\nAs pleasant as the girls try to make everyone's daily lives, when the alarms sound on their phones, it\u2019s time for them to become magical girls and protect the world from the vertex threat. There are several vertex battles throughout the series, varying in length and scope, but some of them can be pretty tense affairs, especially when multiple vertexes (vertices?) appear at once. The girls are skilled combatants with a variety of strong weapons, but they\u2019re not immune to injury and the vertexes are tough opponents who are smart enough to coordinate their attacks and adjust their strategies during battle. It usually takes a total team effort for the Heroes to have any success against them, which leads to some entertaining and occasionally nailbiting fights.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nThe animation is a bit inconsistent - it can be great in some scenes and merely passable in others - but the overall quality is solidly good. The fight scenes take place in a surreal, colorful alternate world, and showcase most of Yuki Yuna\u2019s best animation work. These scenes appear inspired by the artwork of Shigenori Soejima (Persona 3/Persona 4), as well as the twisty, hyper-organic landscapes of Roger Dean\u2019s paintings, and I\u2019m excited to see how they\u2019ll look in Blu-Ray someday. They also use a fair bit of CG though, so be warned if that\u2019s not your thing. The real world scenes, while still generally cheerful and colorful, have occasional touches such as the unnaturally bent and ruined suspension bridge appearing in several background scenes that subtly remind us this world isn\u2019t quite the carefree place it appears on the surface. \\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs (like most) will be hit-or-miss depending on your musical tastes. Personally I liked the opening immediately, but the ending needed time to grow on me. The OST itself, however, is outstanding. Most of the tracks fit their scenes perfectly, and the battle music especially stands out as some of the very best in the show, full of soaring choirs and pulse-pounding orchestration. Even the quieter tracks have a few gems, though, such as a very nice flamenco-styled classical guitar piece that appears a couple of times. There\u2019s also not a lot of repetition either. Only a few tracks are used more than once or twice, and they\u2019re all songs (like the main transformation theme) that you\u2019ll enjoy hearing multiple times anyway.\\n\\n\r\nRating: \\n\r\nIf I rated Yuuki Yuuna on nothing but my personal enjoyment, it would get a 10. I\u2019ve already watched the whole series twice, I know I\u2019ll watch it again in the future, and if Pony Canyon ever gives us a North American release, I'll buy it. To give it a fair review, though, I can\u2019t entirely overlook the uneven pacing in the first half of the series, the occasional inconsistency in animation quality, and a few (not many) awkward transitions between scenes. That said, Yuuki Yuuna is still a gem, even if it\u2019s one that\u2019s not completely polished. The characters are easy to like and they all have wonderful chemistry with each other, the OST is outstanding, the themes of the story (which I wish I could actually talk about here without spoiling everything) are timely and appropriate, and despite a few rough patches, the story threads eventually come together in a very satisfying way. It\u2019s a spirited show that\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but like its characters it has a lot of heart and tries its best. And much of the time, its best is really, really good.\\n\r\nFirst half: 8/10. Second half: 9.5/10. Overall: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr! Should I Watch Yuuki Yuuna or Not?:\\n\r\nYes, if magical girl mixed with some drama and slice-of-life sounds appealing to you. The first half isn\u2019t quite as good as the second half, but if you're able to stick with it, your patience will be rewarded. Just be warned that this isn\u2019t a relaxing series at all. If you\u2019re expecting Aria with a dash of Cardcaptor Sakura, you'll be disappointed. It\u2019s more like Lyrical Nanoha with a dash of Angel Beats.",

            "content": "-Spoilers Ahead-\r\nThe brilliant minds behind Angel Beats and Akame ga Kill joined forces in an attempt to capitalize on their respective \"talents\" and made what some people call \"one of the most underrated masterpieces of the season\" without an ounce of irony. This series is pretty much everything wrong with modern anime, and there are plenty of reasons as to why. It's just so up its own ass pretending to be not a grimdark show in a vain attempt to fake out the audience for so long that it ends up boring, and when it actually gets to the grimdark it was leading up to,it does in the most hilariously incompetent way possible. Many of its other problems include the asinine pacing, lack of character interaction and development, and complete lack of subtlety, which all seem to go under the radar because apparently everyone is too busy crying over ham-fisted drama. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are some positives about this show- Mainly the visuals. Despite some heavy usage of CG in some parts, it really doesn't look that bad at all in motion, and the colors do not make your eyes bleed like NGNL does. Character designs are pretty neat and I do appreciate how they don't look like something out of Precure. Not that Precure designs are necessarily bad, but the designs here make thematic sense and at least don't look generic by its genre standards- Instead they look like something out of Sword Art Online, not that it's a bad thing either. The music is pretty decent- There are two to three tracks that were actually memorable and were reminiscent of something out of Madoka and whatever Akiko Shikata makes, but the overuse of those tracks made them a bit stale. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Madoka, there's a lot of people who compare this show to Madoka and even call it a rip-off. But honestly, it's hard to blame them- Shady magical girl contract with a supernatural being? Check. Enemies that appear in a strange world that do not actually offer actual character interaction due to lack of any dialogue whatsoever? Check. Main title character being over optimistic and the most underdeveloped character out of the main cast? Check. Mentor-like character that later goes nuts after reading the fine lines in the said shady contract? Check. The questionable magical girl system existing to prevent the end of the world? Check. This show's really got everything. But because this show shares so many similarities with Madoka, it also shares the flaws- And those flaws become more evident with poor direction and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nApparently when Takahiro was writing for this show, he thought he'd change it up from Akame ga Kill's pointless gorefest and decided to turn it into a pointless borefest. This wise decision turned the first half of this show incredibly painful to sit through. The main problem is the lack of characters- The villains and even the fairies are absolutely silent. Therefore, there is no character interaction whatsoever with the opposing side aside from fighting and more fighting. This wasn't a problem in Madoka due to the existence of Kyubey, who delivered some form of drama whenever necessary for conflicting character interaction, but that role is severely lacking here. Taishas do little more than send out phone messages whenever they aren't busy catering to the crippled, and the supernatural being that gives magical power is a poorly drawn magical tree always obscured in fog. This narrows down all character interaction whatsoever to the five main characters, and everyone else might as well be a cardboard in the background. This effectively turns the series into a Slice-of-Life type of show, which is actually in the description for this series. But then the problem comes from attempting to mix this element with grimdark setting, which was basically the gimmick with Akame ga Kill. But even then, mixing the two isn't the problem- It's the execution. There needs to be some form of consistent flow in the tone, and this series handles it very poorly by going from one scene to the other with incredibly sudden transition. Having a tea party? Suddenly phone call and everyone's warped to fight the giant floating monster thing. Then lots of yelling and chanting in the background, and suddenly they're in space. And when they're not doing that, they're busy being very angsty about something else introduced later in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes followed the aforementioned formula incredibly precisely, while occasionally increasing the number of enemies to mix it up a little although it didn't really hinder the protagonists in the slightest. After managing to kill twelve of these things, the protagonists conclude that their battles are over because the Taishas said so, which is an obvious fake-out halfway into the series. It's also odd that the protagonists didn't suspect anything strange about Taishas informing them that there were supposedly arbitrary number of these things, which would mean that the Taishas somehow did not manage to defeat any of them at all despite having a detailed sealing process to defeat one. That aside, this formulaic plot progression didn't really serve to develop any of the characters at all. Sure, there was some character interaction between the main cast, but character interaction doesn't necessarily lead to character development. These particular interactions were just wacky hijinx and comedy, so it did absolutely nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAfter halfway into the series, our good director Seiji decides that he needs to start including actual plot, and the grimdark elements start being introduced. Whenever the girls use their magical powers, they occasionally enter this super mode known as Mankai. The show never explains whether these girls enter the state willingly or whether it's done automatically- And even the official website claims that it's half and half. Basically, it's whenever the plot fucking wants it to happen. Why? Because this is the aforementioned grimdark plot element. Whenever the girls enter this state, they lose a certain bodily function and gain a fairy in the process. The series attempts to fake the audience out by claiming it's temporary, and then it spends several episodes that arrive at a not-so shocking conclusion that it's permanent. Yuna loses her taste, Mimori loses hearing on one ear, Fuu goes blind in one eye, and Itsuki loses her voice. What does this all lead to? Forced drama. Apparently Itsuki entered a singing audition, which everyone knew nothing about, and suddenly the whole thing gets dumped at the audience's face in the most convenient way possible when Fuu is trying to deal with the whole permanent body function sacrifice thing. If that wasn't enough, Itsuki goes on a long speech in the recording about how she loves her friends so Fuu can go on a full guilt trip for getting her to tag along on the Hero Club before actually singing for the audition because the judges were too busy looking for their non-existent script, as with every other character in the show. A proper, subtle way to handle this scene would've been to establish the singing audition thing before this happened, and then flash back to it briefly after the realization hit home, instead of just being embarrassingly blatant about it. But I guess subtlety is lost art. \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tougou decides to be dangerous and attempts to test her theory by playing sudoku with a blade, and comes to a horrifying realization that fairies are \"forcibly\" keeping them alive. Apparently it's supposed to be terrifying that these tiny things keep the girls alive while they're on a dangerous duty that they're not being forced to do. Obviously there are huge consequences for not doing magical girl things since it has been established in the first episode that Shinju-sama is protecting the world and these aliens who are for some reason named after zodiac signs are trying to destroy it, but the job itself is still technically optional. They're not being forced to do it at gunpoint or whatever, so the supposed horror factor they were going for is completely invalid. Furthermore, Tougou apparently attempted to play sudoku multiple times because once wasn't enough and goes on about all these different methods she tried to kill herself for almost no reason other than sounding edgy. But then I realized this was Takahiro's specialty- Hammering the exact same point and over and over to arouse some form of emotion. These two brilliant men's talents really do shine in this series. \\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, Tougou gets warped into the cripple gold medalist's room, who was their predecessor and now has over twenty disabilities and the equal amount of fairies. Then the audience is informed during their second meeting about the shocking truth that everything outside Shinju's territory is red vomit with white aliens swarming about. It's been known that Shinju was protecting humanity from getting fucked up by something since the first episode, so what's the shock here? Why does it matter that the villains are aliens or gods who decided humanity sucked? Whatever it was, it drives Tougou insane and makes her come to an ingenious conclusion. Apparently the best way to protect her friends and stop their sacrifices altogether was to blow a hole in the barrier, get the tree killed, and then get everyone sacrificed as a result of her decision. Maybe her ability to form proper reason was taken during one of her Mankai sessions. Would've been better if she actually consulted with her friends first-hand, but clearly that sounded too uninteresting and sensible for the writers. Most of the conflicts in this series also seem self-made, so it's also incredibly difficult to actually relate to any of these characters especially when they make stupid decisions such as Fuu attempting to kill the Taishas after the aforementioned forced drama sequence. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the evil tofus attack, suddenly Yuuna is incapable of transforming because of her distressed emotional state despite Fuu being completely capable of doing so during her rage. Then Karin suddenly wakes up from being unconscious and activates Mankai multiple times in a span of few seconds coupled with too much yelling in an attempt to win the \"most crippled\" award in the show. After that, Yuuna manages to punch some sense into Tougou, destroys the Final Boss Vertex, then decides to become Jesus by taking everyone's disabilities onto herself by becoming a vegetable. Then suddenly the audience is supposed to accept that the enemies just stopped attacking because either they are really gone for good or they just got bored trying to kill a tree. \\n\\n\r\nIt later turns out that every fairy represented a physical function the girls lost, so when the fairies disappear, they regain everything they lost and stop being heroes. This may be because Shinju figured that keeping emotionally unstable girls who almost got it killed as its guardians was a terrible idea. Yuuna stays a vegetable for a while because Takahiro figured he could cram in some more sad scenes near the end, but then she gets better through the power of friendship. As stupid as that sounded, the ending isn't the issue- Even if the ending resulted in everyone becoming a vegetable, this would've been still a very poorly written series. \\n\\n\r\nThe happy ending can at least be explained with how since all threatening Vertices are supposedly gone, assuming the sun-shaped Vertex was the last of its kind for a while, Shinju doesn't need to exert as much energy to keep the barrier up since there's nothing much left to keep out, so it just gave everything it took back. It would explain how nobody is giving a shit about that part of the barrier Tougou blew up earlier.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is, if there is no actual threat left and the Taishas aren't being lying dicks about it this time and Mr. Tree is actually a benevolent god that everyone claims it is, then there really should be no point for it to keep what it took unless it's a dick too, which is probably what most people were guessing. And it's not like it was ever established that it couldn't give back what it took, so all the more reason for it to do what it did. And to the show's credit, it did briefly mention through one SoL segment that it was \"alright to eat the offerings if they were there for a while\" so maybe either it was foreshadowing or maybe I'm giving the show way too much credit. I'm actually surprised Takahiro managed to learn how to make use of mundane segments instead of cramming them in for the sake of just having them as a contrast to his edgy grimdark parts. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of hate for the ending of the show, but most of that hate seems to be misdirected since it mostly involves \"It had a happy ending, so it sucked.\" While it's not that having some plot elements that lead to a depressing ending is inherently bad- It's that when it does happen, it needs to be well-paced and give the audience enough time to feel actually attached to the characters in question. But with the lack of actual villains to provide any form of conflicting character interaction, there's next to no character development, and everything just ends up being a snooze-fest because these characters are just hard to care for outside of them looking cute. Unfortunately, this particular writing style has become quite popular with modern anime (Attack on Titans, AgK, or even Kotoura-san, etc), and for some reason, everyone seems to eat it up. Here's a possibility: People are just so used to badly written happy endings that they'd rather have badly written sad endings, while deluding themselves that sad endings are apparently inherently better than happy endings because they think they are more mature. Something about teaching a moral lesson about heroes not always winning or some shit, I don't know. In that case, the preference is determined not by the actual quality of the writing, but just by the inherent difference of definition. It's like preferring black shit over brown shit. \"They're both shit, but at least it's not brown.\" While this is no longer applicable for this show since it had a happy ending, it doesn't change the fact that it was the direction the series was leading people towards, and it's obviously the main reason behind people eating it up.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is just yet another attempt at the ever-popular modern formula which involves characters going through depression in one way or the other, whether or not the characters were likeable or the depression relatable and the plot behind it well-written. It was practically tailored to the type of people who ate up the likes of AgK and Attack on Titans, and it did just that right before the end. I guess at least their reactions were entertaining.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is part of a multimedia project of LN, VN, videogame, manga and anime. And despite of it, the anime is completely able to stand on its own.\r\nThe story is one of the strongest points, but for you to understand this you need to watch the series from the right point of view. As a Slice of Life the story is about the characters, sure world building is important, but ultimately the story focuses on the 5 main protagonists, it makes you care about them, their lives and it gives a proper conclusion to them.\r\nThe art is pretty good fora studio with low budget like this one, at the start the CGI is noticeable, but after a while you learn to appreciate the backgrounds, the town and all the locations, you can see they put a lot of job on this.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is a solid 10/10, with the composer of NieR is to be expected. From the Slice of Life to the action music every scene has a perfect ambience that lets you get immersed in the story. I doubt it's possible to find flaws about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main motivation to watch the series and also get into the franchise if you're interested in the side material. You learn to appreciate them and you get really attached to them because everything is portrayed and developed around them, the support between the sisters, the romance between Yuuna and Tougou and the character development of the originally lonely tsundere girl is explained at the right pace and given the proper screen time. The fact that this anime (and the whole project) had 2 years of planning is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is really enjoyable by itself, but as someone who started watching it since the first week, I can say it's extremely recommendable to get into all the other material that is also part of this multimedia project, it contains multiple interesting information that makes you see the characters in a whole different light, and as I said the characters are the more important part of this franchise. The best way to do this is:\\n\\n\r\nWatch the first 3 episodes of the anime, read the manga, watch episode 4, read the VN, watch episodes 5, 6, 7 then read the first 7 chapters of the LN, watch episode 8, read chapter 8 of the LN, watch episode 9, 10, 11, read chapter 9 of the LN and then watch the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe videogame is unrelated to the rest and it comes out until February anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series delivers everything you want, good characters, writing, romance, action, interactions and it teaches you exactly what the title says: Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. It teaches what is a Hero and how to be Hero, to you and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, even though I said the characters are the most important part it doesn't mean that the world is not interesting, on the contrary, the issue is that the anime doesn't give a lot of focus to it, only the necessary, that's why the speculation is also one of the best parts of this franchise, and this can be proved because it has been less than 2 days since the anime ended and there's already a lot of theories regarding the ending, and all of them are equally likely since this series is famous for leaving foreshadowing and references in all its media. I recommend you to watch it and join those theorists until those points are properly explained, and I know they will be properly explained because this series hasn't ended yet, it's only the beginning.",

            "content": "Can you hold it in your heart to believe in yourself to be a hero? Can you do that while knowing that while you carry out your promise to protect the world, you have to watch as you feel like you're failing that same promise to your friends? Are you truly capable of being a hero knowing what sacrifices have to be made and what you can lose along the way? Do you have the willpower to be the spark that lights the candle of hope surround by a shroud of despair? \r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu for short) is an anime thatasks five girls of the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club these questions. Can they handle it? Well...I can't spoil things so you'll have to go find that out yourself...If you read the discussions first before watching the episodes..I will go to your house and cave your shins in! No seriously though..YuYuYu is a pretty good show. \\n\\n\r\nTake a slice of life anime with Magic girls add a lot of cute moments and well thought out characters and you get YuYuYu. The show leaves the impression of one of those really cute and action-y shows...basically giving the appeal of something out of Kyoto Animation (like K-ON! or Chuunibyou). \\n\\n\r\nSuddenly, the show takes a turn into a Madoka Magicka atmosphere...The story progresses into a more depressing and seemingly sinister series at the blink of an eye and you begin to worry about the future of these girls. Things worsen, your feels are tested, and more and more monsters are destroyed, but at the end of the day (series) all that was needed was the will to believe in yourself and your friends. \\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): As mentioned, the story seems very light-hearted and cute, but as it progresses...things get real...and quick. While seemingly slow at the beginning, the entire storyline is well thought out and very very detailed. What was impressive was how well the storyline was able to conceal its gloomy and dark parts of it with cute and warming parts. It's ending, however...left a more cliched ending to it....along with its slow start...keeping it from it's 10/10 mark.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10): To me, characters are the most important part of the story. It's what really matters in a scene no matter how you look at it. YuYuYu does it right. Not only does it give a background of each character, it also does a good job at showing how they connect to the other characters (through either relation (Fu and Itsuki) or the Hero Club). What I really liked was the mystery that surrounds Togo's two year gap. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10): Despite having the rather \"generic\" anime style, YuYuYu's amount of color and detail in the animation was well done. From the designs of the characters to even the designs of the monsters and the Taisha world (mainly the heavy amount of color here). \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10): I can't say much about the sound throughout the series. However, the song choice for the opening and closing was well done. Opening remained calm and collected, but at the same time...still a catchy tune. The ending was a completely different story. The use of certain voice actors during the ending really added to some of the \"depressing\" feel that came from the series itself. An example of this is the endings where only the seiyu of Itsuki sung the song during the episodes that were more focused around Itsuki's character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10): It's been a while since I felt anticipation for an anime show. This show's ability to keep me on my toes and always dying for the next episode is something worth noting. During the light-hearted side of the story, I enjoyed the rather comical side of the series itself...what made the show...well...slice of life. The action sequences and the battles were well done. During the darker side of the series, I felt a lot of anxiety as I began to fear the worst would happen in the series. The last time I experienced this was during my time watching Tokyo Ravens (Fall 2013 -> Winter 2014). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. To sum up this series, I would say this is a must watch for fans of shows like Madoka Magicka. This series was well done and I cannot express how much I enjoyed the series overall. Fair warning though...this series will test you feels. \\n\\n\r\nWatch Recommendation? - Yes",

How on Earth will we care?\r\nWhy is this a madoka clone? It's not. First impressions suggest an interesting thing with the fight royale magicka, but it was binned 8.5/10 times and it had to be a Slice Of Life monotony! And, most of the time, the girls are just screwing about as \u201cHeroes\u201d by being girl scouts, but its even stupider considering that theydon't even do there job often since their still mocking around! Where often left with unnecessary, unmoving and uncharitable amounts of comedic scenes like this sardine-adreniline girl who takes jokes about how much she drugs pills, and it has potential like using the Slice Of Life aspect to get some female bonding which results in \u201ccharacter development\u201d in contrary to madoka at least we had a continuing plot avoiding such filler.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, how can we care? The plot progressed upon a snail  pace (even for a 12 episode series) and no one even develops, what a waste of potential! Consequently, how are the \u201cmagical\u201d aspects of the show? Well, the girls ganged screwed with like 5 boss mosters, and oh my! Shonen power up \u2013 sheeeeeeum! Instant Bankai! The bosses die, no one dies, and am I not surprised? The show even fails to make \u201cdecent\u201d tension and considering the biggest flaw, what an ascension! Wait, there are side effects from using Bankai Mankai? Everyone started caring about their side effects right at the end and they made it look like nothing happened to them and Mankai becomes hacks power up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are archetypes. Why am I super surprised? We have the shy one, the energetic one, the vanilla one, the leader one and of course we need more than one vanilla one! This makes everyone two dimensional therefore no even two people give two flap jacks for this decent writing.\\n\\n\r\nI doubt will have sequels or prequels for this, and let this show burn at the pits of Antarctica and fade into space remembered as a semi-ish madoka clone? Why not!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not an Epic floppy train wreck.

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhen it comes to helping others, some do it for the joy it brings to others while some do so to bring happiness to oneself. It doesn't matter the reason; just being there for someone in his or her time of need makes all the difference in the world. It also doesn't matter the scope, either. Whether it's working at a soup kitchen, babysitting the neighbor's kid, or saving an animal from a burning building, it's not the grandness of the act, but the act itself that means everything. And more often than not, these people are bestowedwith the title of \"hero.\" Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is a dark horse capitalizing on this idea, with more to the phrase than at first perceived.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu (what I'll be calling it from here on out) follows the girls of the \"Hero Club:\" Yuuki, Togo, Fuu, and Itsuki. They believe in their five tenets, looking to spread happiness wherever they go.\\n\\n\r\nOn the outset, YuYuYu appears to be just another slice-of-life anime with no redeeming qualities. But past the first half of the first episode, it becomes much, much more. What this anime excels at is establishing and maintaining its vibe from beginning to end. The world is happy-go-lucky, essentially carefree during the more relaxed bits. Simultaneously, though, the show exerts an ominous feeling. That something is off, something is wrong, but one can't quite place his or her finger on what it is. It's not a shocking twist or some roundabout answer, either. The show slowly builds upon itself, reaching a crescendo, allowing for all of the built up emotion and uneasy feeling to spill over. The result is a consistent ride of trepidation that never lets up.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to create such apprehension, YuYuYu attempts to go about its story-telling and world-building in a less-than-direct manner. The rules are set early on, with the girls learning about the true nature of what they are doing through observation, association, and even simply visual confirmation. This allows the anime to explore both the slice-of-life happiness and dark drama more compactly, because the information gained is never entirely presented on a silver-platter. It's always just out of reach, with enough given to move the story along. The truth is morbid and well done, with the actions of the characters involved being believable given the situation. It's not absolutely perfect, but the show more or less covers its bases, providing a fulfilling set of events that culminate in the narrative presented.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest controversy involved comes with the ending. Thematically speaking, the anime's overall premise is that, as long as one's friends are there, anything is possible. It's an almost literal \"the power of friendship\" message. The dichotomy that is created during the anime gives the characters a lot of room to connect and support one another. Birthday parties, beach outings, and regular club activities help to provide examples for just how friendly they are. Even during the hidden side, the story presents many opportunities for Yuuna and the gang to show just how good of friends they've become. So, the question is, does the ending uphold the ideals that the anime set? To an extent, yes, it does. The purpose of the anime is not so much about where all the girls end up, just where Yuuna does. After all, it's her story. The whole season, she proclaims and demonstrates the type of person she is and who she wants to be. And in the end, her friends do so, too; by supporting her and being there when she needed it most. It's a touching story that may not have ended the way everyone wanted, but it follows through with the pretext it set.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, one of the more prominent yet discarded topics within the anime is the religious aspect, or the \"Shinju-sama.\" The girls fight to protect this god, going to extreme lengths to do so. And as the overall message details, it is not the god who saves them, it is ultimately each other. It's a snide remark about the ideas of religion and what it really means to devote one's self to faith. In YuYuYu's circumstance, it argues that religion can be seen as nothing more than self-destructive violence. It isn't the gods above who save the day; it is the people on the ground who heed the call to the challenges in front of them. And blindly believing in something without justifiable, logical reasoning merely leads to death and despair. It's a risky statement that the show is willing to take, and it does so in full stride.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu is quite the beautiful looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style adopted is quite varied, both outside and within the \"forestized\" areas. The real world feels alive, with various locations besides just the club room visited. Lighting effects and other smaller details for the environments can be found, making the pieces themselves feel more alive. As for the \"other\" world, it's an explosion of colors and effects that dazzle about in a wide range of patterns. During these segments, the Vertexes, and at certain moments the girls themselves are done in 3D, but it never feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for Yuuna and the rest are simple in reality and, perhaps obviously, more intricate when it comes to their transformations. Even their final forms are given much detail, combining a mix of 2D and 3D that, once again, is pleasant to look at. Togo's design that includes a wheelchair deserves a special shout-out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, it is stellar, to say the least. Action packed sequences, well-choreographed battles, and good character movements during the slice-of-life segments are the norm. The show never lets up, providing fluent and comprehensible skirmishes that showcase how strong this side of the anime truly is.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of YuYuYu is vibrant, being characterized by not only their own developments, but by how they relate to one another.\\n\\n\r\nBefore talking about any of them, what the show does well is in the character interactions themselves. And not just that they are right, but that they are done better than many other anime. The characters feel like friends. Their jokes and conversations make sense, they play off of one another, and they are not afraid to tease each other when warranted. It simply feels natural.\\n\\n\r\nAs the youngest member, Itsuki is the quiet and kind little girl. She is the sister to Fuu, with the weird hobby of reading tarot cards. Her power, like her singing voice, is able to touch all those around her. More than anything, she wants to convince others that she doesn't need the help of the people around her at all times.\\n\\n\r\nFuu is the leader. Loud and outgoing, her massive broadsword further defines her as a girl unafraid to be as \"unique\" as possible. While she may be the first to console a friend, she harbors heavy guilt, with massive built up frustration. As the captain, she works hard to protect the entire club, but especially Itsuki, from the troubles that are brought upon them.\\n\\n\r\nIntroduced slightly later, Karin is standoffish yet approachable, serious yet playful. Her personality shines through in the armaments she wields: two samurai swords, both sharp and elegant. A \"tsundere\" through and through. For her, proving herself not only as a warrior but as a member is first and foremost on her mind. She doesn't want to bring the team down, because she feels she is the most worthy of the title they have been given.\\n\\n\r\nActually handicapped, Togo is very intelligent and serenely beautiful. She almost always hides her emotions, reflecting the long-range sniping she employs. Even though she is forced to be seated, Togo keeps a watchful eye on the rest of the cast. She works as a website designer, and Yuuna is her best friend. And that's the truth; she would do anything imaginable to save her.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most interesting character, and perhaps rightly so, is Yuuki Yuuna herself. Extremely friendly and way too optimistic, she only wants to help everyone and anyone around her. Doing as much as she can with the two hands given to her, her bare-fist fighting style highlights this. She never gives up and she never gives in. The love she has for all her friends is huge, and she exhibits this time and again.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond making the characters interact naturally, not only do the characters feel diverse, but they experience development that ties in with the anime's themes and overall goal. Itsuki goes from dependent little girl to independent young woman, gaining the confidence she's been lacking (and wanting) all along. Fuu starts off as the stalwart leader but devolves into an emotional wreck due to her inability to handle the suffering that her fellow friends all go through. Karin begins hating the group and not understanding who they are, but ends up defending them ardently and unconditionally. And Togo has her trust completely broken and shaken, despite her believing in both the club and the \"Shinju-sama.\"\\n\\n\r\nThere is just one girl who doesn't waver or change along the way: Yuuna. Why is this? For her, there is no development because there doesn't need to be. She is constantly pushing ahead, never yielding. She is the example, the goal, what the other four girls aspire to be. She exudes confidence, stability, friendliness, and trust, all attributes that the members have always wanted. Because while the story may revolve around all of them, it is ultimately about why Yuuki Yuuna is who she claims to be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is good. It starts off mysterious, with the differing vocals, violins, and acoustic guitar. It picks up near the halfway point, becoming more powerful and catchy, with the drums and choir-like singing. The ending vocal bit sends it off on a high-note, lending further to the anime's always-uneasy vibe.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is also quite good. It's soft, giving a calming sensation that is sometimes needed throughout the season. There are numerous versions of it, depending on the episode in question, but it's a simple song, with simple drums and singing that once again still feels as if something is just not quite right.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, in one word, amazing. Quiet pieces, quick tracks, dramatic arrangements, it has it all at all the right places. The best piece usually occurs when the action is reaching a climax, with the vocalist following along to a repeated three-count. The whole OST is great to listen to both within the anime and outside of it, making it a contender for the top spot of the season.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-acting sees many well done performances by the entire cast. Emotional scenes, screaming, and varying inflections are performed by all at one point or another. Special shout-out to Yumi Uchiyama for her role as Fuu, Juri Nagatsuma for her role as Karin, and Haruka Terui for her role as Yuna.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nBeing completely honest, I actually was not a fan of the ending. Without spoiling anything, what I wanted most was for it to go in the completely opposite direction that it went.\\n\\n\r\nBut the rest of the package is there: comedy, drama, tragedy, anxiety, expectation, and both large and small scale battle sequences, to name just a few. It's a combination that is balanced well during the limited amount of time they had, making the experience a good one.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru began quite strange but ended very strong. Its smart story, diverse characters, and incredible animation really do prove that Yuuki Yuuna is a hero.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, perfect mood, nice world-building, complete theme, religious undertones\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful art, nice character designs, 2D/3D mix well, fantastic actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Yuuna, Togo, Karin, Fuu, and Itsuki are characterized, developed, and connected\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OP, good ED, amazing soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, has it all except the ending I was hoping for\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna is a Horribly Boring Character. She's relatively one-dimensional, oblivious, airheaded, naive and childish in her ideals, which isn't inherently boring, but the world she lives in RESPECTS that allowing her simple and repetitive nature to prevail against any and all problems to the point where you begin to wonder if there's any point in growing up at all. \r\nI, like many others, stumbled upon the show \"Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero\" after hearing it compared to the illustrious Madoka Magica and were drawn to it by people saying that it was \"better than Madoka\". As a massive fan of Madoka Magica, I wasinitially very excited: someone made a better version of one of my favorite shows of all time? I had even heard people saying that Madoka had been their favorite show until they watched Yuuki Yuuna, and since I realized that was pretty much where I was at I could not have been more thrilled to first learn of this show's existence. I pulled it up immediately, and went into it with high hopes and an open mind. I didn't expect the sort of poignant universal message that Madoka had given, but what I did expect was a damn good deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Compelling characters, enthralling twists, gut-wrenching moments of tragedy, and a genuinely enthralling story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found, however, was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nNothing, Christopher? But that doesn't make sense. You watched 12 episodes of SOMETHING, right? There can't possibly have been NOTHING in those twelve episodes, right?\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, you're right. I did sit in front of a screen for a regrettable four and half hours of my life, and there were words and drawings on that screen, but if I had to really summarize Yuuki Yuuka I would redirect you once more to that word above: nothing. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, Yuuki Yuuna is kind of like a Frankenstein's monster that failed to come to life. It's stitched together from bits and pieces of other things but there's nothing about it that's really its own. There's no voice, no soul. It doesn't use those pieces to create something new, or stand on its own two feet, or say something for itself: essentially, Yuuki Yuuna just IS those pieces, tossed into a bucket together and just sort of sitting there touching each other. And since Yuuki Yuuna is essentially just pieces of other things that are loosely connected, I have no qualms in using the MAL rating system to talk about those pieces. \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nOne could make the argument that the characters in Yuuki Yuuna aren't \"bad characters\". In a sense, you'd be right: they aren't horribly-written people and for the most part they have some semblance of continuity and we can understand where their actions are coming from (though this is not always the case, *ahem* Touga). The problem is, that's essentially ALL that they are: \"not-bad characters\". There's nothing in them. They're just archetypes grabbed from other places that are given mediocre scripts intended to invoke empathy in the audience. That's really all that's expected from them: they're not created to even BE human, their SOLE PURPOSE is to be \"not bad\" enough to the point where the audience cares about them. Not because they have any original ideas in them, not because they carry a piece of the creator, but because they're there, they're cute, and they're not \"badly\" written. There's the older blonde sister who's spunky and cares deeply about her friends, especially her younger sister. There's the younger blonde sister who's shy and cares deeply about her friends, especially her older sister. There's the tsundere girl. There's Yuuki Yuuna herself, who is pretty much the blockheaded hero-of-justice character in a world where the hero of justice never has to actually face the repercussions or naivety of her ideals. There's her best friend Touga who's really just a mess of a character and is used more as a poorly-motivated plot device than a person, but we won't focus on her. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with all these characters, however, is that while they are adequately-written versions of the roles they are meant to fulfill there is an emptiness to them that cannot really be put into the words. No one who wrote these characters cares about them at all. They aren't trying to express anything with them. They're masks, and they're treated as if they were people, and that hollow shallowness prevented me from giving a single shit about what happened to them. When you create characters with the express purpose of making the audience sympathize with them so that you can give them \"feelz\" later on by making them suffer, you haven't really created characters at all. You've just grabbed pieces of people and stuck them together so that they look like a person. It may be cute, but it has no soul. \\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY\\n\r\nHere's the part where it was obvious that whoever was writing this was trying really hard to not be accused of plagiarism. While the literal elements of the story may be put together in a new, the structure by which it is built around is nothing that hasn't been seen a thousand times before, and the pieces themselves are unoriginal. Once again, the story feels mostly like pieces stacked together. Rather than have something constant and tight, it pretty much relies on the audience expecting twists and then delivering them often enough to maintain a level of interest. No section of the story can stand on its own as engaging: it RELIES on constant change, because the story possesses no substance of its own to fall back on. In a standstill the audience's eyes begin to adjust to the dull nature of the story, so the story has to be constantly adding new levels. It doesn't really feel like these levels stack cohesively though; it's more like we're just jumping from one platform to the next, and since the platforms are getting crazier the story must be advancing. None of these platforms are compelling in and of themselves though: they're mostly interesting because of the anticipation for the NEXT platform, which creates a bit of a cycle. All these platforms are as hollow as the rest of the show, being in and of themselves bland rehashes of been-done ideas, and the lack of any sort of central voice of the story means that the show fails to connect them in any meaningful way, so what we're left with is almost a pyramid scheme that eventually burns out because it can't create a bigger platform. Temporarily engaging perhaps, but inevitably all the more disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\r\nQ: \"this looks like every other show coming out nowadays, what should we do?\"\\n\r\nA: \"we'll make the magic realm look like a unicorn shat on it, and people will think it's stylistic and original.\"\\n\r\nQ: \"But didn't No Game No Life, Madoka, Shinsekai Yori and Penguindrum already do something like that...? Except with far more creativity, heart, and personal flair?\"\\n\r\nA: \"Shhhh!! These are anime fans, they have the memory of a goldfish. Don't worry about it.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty standard, I don't really have any complaints but once again it doesn't do anything to set the show apart from anything else. It kinda sounds like Fate/Zero's OST with more sugary J-pop crap mixed in. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not much to say. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI had to literally drag myself through the last three episodes of this show. My expectations adjusted pretty consistently throughout. By the episode 5 I wasn't expecting too much, by episode 7 the show became a chore, and by episode 10 I wanted to drop it despite being so close to done, with the only reason I managed to finish it being that I enjoyed taking screenshots of moments that were either downright horrible or were pretty much excerpts from other shows, and because at that point I was actually HOPING it would end with a bullshit \"FIST OF BRAVERY!!\" moment because at least that would be hilariously awful. I wont say whether or not I got my wish though, cuz spoilers I guess. This wasn't funny-bad, it was bland, empty and soul-sucking.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a magical girl deconstruction, see Madoka or Princess Tutu. If you're looking for compelling cute girls doing cute things, see K-On. If you're looking for members of a high-school club having to take on serious issues like death and existentialism, see Angel Beats (it at least has ideas of its own and some passion from the creator). If you're looking for a hero of justice show watch Fate/Staynight, and if you're just looking for a show to watch for the love of god watch pretty much anything else. There is nothing here you can't find in other shows done better. Yuuki Yuuna is nothing: its emotionally-vacant (despite how emotional its characters get) its dry, it's hollow, and its inevitably meaningless. There's no heart from the creators in this piece, there's no passion for storytelling or love for the characters behind it. Yuuki Yuuna is a shameless reaction piece attempting to stitch together the successful elements of other shows in order to appeal to an audience, and as someone with a legitimate passion for writing and storytelling I find this show to be a little angering. Many shows are burdened with flaws, but poor pacing and plot contrivances and annoying characters don't bother me nearly as much as something that refuses to even try to be its own thing. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say it one more time then.\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna is nothing.\\n\r\nUnless you want to watch four and a half hours of nothing, I advise you leave this shiny ambition-less rag buried in obscurity.",

            "content": "In an age where a single idea can be copied, transmuted, inverted, and manipulated in millions of possible ways, the phrase \"That's just a rip-off of ______\" has become increasingly more common. For example, I've heard many arguments that Nagi no Asukara is just a rip-off of From the New World, and while there certainly are similarities between the two, it's quiet a stretch to say that a romance drama is just a rip-off of a dystopian horror series. However, there are times where the degree to which something is copied is so severe that\"rip-off\" really is the only way to describe it. So, when a title gets to that point, is there still enough enjoyment to be gleamed from this newer series to justify its existence?\\n\\n\r\n          I supposed it'd be best to address the elephant in the room first: this is a magical girl series with an incredibly blatant attempt to cash in on the \"little girls suffering\" idea that Madoka Magica had popularized back in 2011 and is continuously called upon again and again within the anime industry because it continues to print money. While in the past I may have suggested that Selector Infected WIXOSS was also riding the Madoka Suffering Train, at least it also had a plethora of new ideas to bring to the table. Y\u016bki Y\u016bna is an absolutely shameless clone of Madoka, from the suffering girls to the horrifying world backdrop. \\n\\n\r\n          There's also the matter of someone getting the bright idea to insert multiple episodes of slice of life-style comedy that served more to pad out the run time than to get us acquainted with the characters, and by the time we had our third slice of life episode in a row, the pacing had slowed to such an unbelievable crawl that I had considered dropping the series and not even doing this review. Additionally, the tonal shift between cutesy fun and heavy action leaning towards horror creates an incredibly unstable and schizophrenic tone for the series overall. With Madoka, the tamer and more relaxed episodes were confined to the first few episodes, but once the rug was pulled out from under us, the pacing grew more and more intense until it threatened to swallow up everything by the end of the series. With Y\u016bki Y\u016bna, the pacing shifts far too much in the first two thirds of the series for us to get a grasp of the true stakes.\\n\\n\r\n          However, despite all that, the payoff that occurs when we hit the final third of the series was really solid; predictable, but solid. It also does take a very slight variance away from Madoka, mostly to avoid plagiarism, and ends up gaining its own level of disturbing horror in terms of the \"little girls suffering\" motif. There is also a very definite exploding point that happens, and once it does, the series really does pick up the pace from there and sprints towards the conclusion. It's just unfortunate that this doesn't happen until the show is almost 70% finished, and at least 40% of that is an annoying slice of life borefest. For that, I'm sure that we can once again thank our head of series composition, Makoto Uezu (Akame ga Kill!, School Days). There were also quite a few gag-worthy moments in the script that were so unbearably cutesy and friendship-loving that I almost wanted to take a break after each episode and switch to Black Lagoon for a few minutes. As for the ending, I won't spoil it, but it certainly didn't deserve the ending that it received, and you can take that for either good or bad.\\n\\n\r\n          The characters aren't really anything new either, yet it's still pretty satisfying to watch their world start to crumble around them. Y\u016bki is our standard heart of gold \"I can do no wrong as long as I believe in the power of friendship\" lead character, aka Madoka Kaname without the indecision, and I was actually surprised by how little screen time she got compared to the others. Mimori is Y\u016bki's best friend who is bound to a wheelchair due to an accident that cost her part of her memory, and her friendship with Y\u016bki ends up being a rather interesting point of development for her. F\u016b is the slightly older, mentor character of the group who has to deal with the fact that she got everyone involved in this situation in the first place, while Itsuki is F\u016b's little sister who honestly just seems to be there to further F\u016b's development. Finally, we have Karin, who could not be more like Kyoko Sakura if she tried; an outsider who is initially put off by how well the group functions together but gradually grows to like them. On a more general note, aside from F\u016b and Mimori, it was rather disappointing to see that everyone else's character development was done in a rather direct and low effort way, whereas F\u016b and Mimori are the only ones that really seem to experience any true sense of psychological terror.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Studio Gokumi (Kiniro Mosaic), and let's not beat about the bush on this one: the animation for this series was incredibly mediocre. While the idea of making the girls cute did get executed well, it was executed almost too well, and some of the girls' expression were so full of sunshine and rainbows that it make me rather uneasy. I do have to praise them for the other emotions that filled the character's faces though, as you really can feel the absolute terror pouring out of them during the final third of this series, especially with F\u016b. Aside from that, most of the animation was pretty bad. The Vertexes were rendered in almost eye-bleeding 3D, the fights scenes weren't that spectacular and the girls were often replaced with 3D models for said fight scenes, and while the set designs in the parallel world were very ominous and intricate, the backgrounds in the real world felt incredibly generic. On a quick side note, I really would like to know why the wheelchair chick got so much of the gratuitous fan service. It seemed horrifically out of place and started giving me Katawa Shoujo flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\n          There is currently no dub for this series yet, and I wouldn't imagine one coming out in the near future.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by the group MONACA, and the soundtrack as a whole ends up being one part Yuki Kajiura imitation and one part generic slice of life background music. However, it's in those imitation Kajiura tracks that we find some really solid and meaty chunks that drove home the intensity of some of the more exhilarating scenes. The opening theme \"Hoshi to Hana\" was performed by the main voice cast and plays us in with a rather subdued pop track, while both ending themes \"Aurora Days\" and \"Inori no Uta\" were also performed by them and end each episode with a soft ballad.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, in regards to a recommendation on Y\u016bki Y\u016bna is a Hero, I'm left asking myself a single question to determine my decision: is there something that this anime brings to the table other than what Madoka Magica has already done and done better? To be honest: no, it really doesn't. Any enjoyment that can be gleamed from this show can just as easily be achieved by rewatching a much better magical girl deconstruction.",

(YuYuYu for short)\r\nStory: 8.5/10\r\nIn post-apocalyptic age where humans are in near of extinction, humans still live each other peacefully.\r\nThe story focused on a group of middle-school girls in a club called Hero Club.\r\nA Club that has a purpose to help other peoplewho need.\\n\r\nThey're living their happy ordinary live until one day they suddenly dragged in different world(?), no I'll say it's a different environment.\\n\r\nBeing the chosen girls by their God, Shinju-sama, they have a duty to fight enemies called Vertex to protect their ordinary life, their world from destruction.\\n\r\nDespite being a magical girl anime, YuYuYu uses term 'Hero' for it which I find that unique.\\n\r\nIt may be started with light-hearted and happy story, but when you walk further.. everything is changed...\\n\r\nEven with only 12 episodes, this anime never felt rushed, or I can say it's well-paced. \\n\r\nThe only thing that I'm disappointed is the ending, but that doesn't change how well written this story is. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best aspects of this anime, I can say it's one of the best in Fall 2014.\\n\r\nOpening scene is very well made, it has a deep meaning that you'll never find out until you watch further episodes.\\n\r\nThe animation and art is improved in every episode, it's carefully made that I find no 'derp-face' when I watched it.\\n\r\nThe background is awesome, it's very artistic with water-paint color.\\n\r\nCharacter design is also great, their transformation outfit is one of my favorite, what can I say, it gives 'ready to fight' feeling from it.\\n\r\nWhat I like is the action scene, it's soooo good, so pumping and so colorful, they even cast flowers in every hit. It matched very well with the background.\\n\r\nThe only flaw is the CGI in 2 first episodes, but after that it's done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is outstanding.\\n\r\nThe OST match very well with every scene in the anime, no flaw, beautiful.\\n\r\nIt'll give you cheering and relaxing feeling in everyday life, and it'll pump you up in action scene.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also great, they fit the character fully. \\n\r\nThey show the character emotion perfectly, especially on character breakdown, impressive work.\\n\r\nYou know, I'm collecting all YuYuYu music, both OST and character song, just how awesome they're.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nYuYuYu only has 5 main and 1 supporting characters, which I find it very pleasant since we can focused on the main girls.\\n\r\nEvery character has a different and unique personality, and they're likable.\\n\r\nUnlike other magical girl anime, YuYuYu treats their characters equally. No one is stronger than the other, this is important.\\n\r\nI like an anime that has a good character development, and this anime has it.\\n\r\nThe character is the most important aspect in this anime. The development is done carefully in every episode.\\n\r\nEach protagonist got a huge development, everyone.\\n\r\nI can guarantee that you'll emotionally attached with one of the main while the story progressing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoy watching this anime, if not, why I bother to rewatched it for 4times?\\n\r\nI smile.\\n\r\nI laugh.\\n\r\nI cry.\\n\r\nI'm fired up.\\n\r\nI'm emotionally driven with this anime, and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is one of other anime that makes me attached to it, and it deserve a spot in my favorite list.\\n\r\nI'll recommend you to watch this anime, you'll not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry if I'm not that good at writing, it's hard to choose some right words.\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review. ^^",

            "content": "A show that might be overlooked for its frontal advertisement. Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha (Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero) isn\u2019t your typical \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 type of show. Well, it is for some parts or at least the first 10 or so minutes of the pilot episode. Then, we realize the show is a lot more after a strange message on a cell phone that transports the girls into a world of the unknown. If \u2018magical girl\u2019 is something you\u2019re familiar with and find enjoyable, then this show may be a treat. \r\nTo trace back a bit, the show is an original workanimated by Studio Gokumi. Director Seiji Kishi is in charge of this project while Takahiro (author of Akame ga Kill) does the series planning. What this brings to mind is a strange collective of individuals to craft the series\u2019 story. By all means, this show does sound like what the title suggests but the promotion suggests otherwise. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that the girls\u2019 lives in this series are about to change forever though.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding the series should be simple enough. There are two worlds \u2013 one in the human world that takes place at Sanshu Middle School and another world where strange entities known as Vertex has taken refuge. The first episode quickly introduces the main cast that composes a club known as the \u2018Hero Club\u2019. As the name suggests, it\u2019s made of members who wants to help the helpless; kind of like trying to be heroes. The club also does other activities ranging from arts, craft, music, and literature. Making up the club are Yuna, Fu and her younger sister Itsuki, and Mimori. While their personalities aren\u2019t alike, they connect well as a unit and often enjoy their time in the human world. The show quickly turns the pages towards another side when we see the girls getting transported to another world. As gimmicky as it sounds (complete with the cell phone trope), it may take some people by surprise especially for those who are unfamiliar with the premise or staff. The catch here is that the girls gets to be heroes for real in this other world by combating against the mysterious Vertex.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting concept to note about the show is how the characters\u2019 personalities change or perhaps show their true selves once their circumstances are different. Mimori becomes a prominent an example of this especially after she realizes the true visage of Shinju, the very essence that the Vertex is trying to destroy. Faced with the possibility of losing what she values, Mimori suffers mental breakdowns throughout the show. Another part is the show\u2019s focus on dealing with loss. The first half of the series shows the girls fighting and actually succeeding on most parts in their battle against the Vertex. Unknown to them, there\u2019s a sacrifice (no, not their lives) to be made. The moral of the show suggests that nothing comes without a price and for becoming a hero, there\u2019s also something in exchange to be paid. It brings about a sense of despair that is a solid mixture with the fantasy premise. The show chooses to make this bold choice rather than relying solely on slice of life to craft cleverness. Indeed, this show has its clever moments whether it\u2019s the dark revelations or the character performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a main part of the show as there is only a handful. Each of them stands out in some way although titular character Yuuki is the one that takes most of the spotlight. This is actual primal considering the way each characters\u2019 roles are played throughout the series. They become magical girls, go to this other world, and fight with the future of the universe on the line. What bigger stakes are there? Each character must accept their destiny to overcome a tragic fate. At the same time, the girls\u2019 struggle internally with the truth after realizing that their lives will never go back to the same way before. It\u2019s when you realize that if it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t. The battles against the Vertex is surprisingly not the reason why the girls suffer from despair. In most parts, the girls does fairly well against them but it\u2019s not until they realize what they are fighting for that they break down. Some folks might see this as a ripoff of Madoka or another cheesy gimmick to deconstruct the magical girl trope. However, it\u2019s also important to realize that the show retains its wit and focus. It also has a good momentum and ability to build up events while dropping foreshadowing throughout the story. For anyone who can appreciate a darker side of a magical girl series, then this is something to take notice of. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some of the appealing concepts of the show, the characters does suffer from a bit of stereotypes. In terms of characters, they are still middle school girls so it\u2019s hard for older audience to take seriously at what they say. And because of their age, the girls\u2019 emotional suffering can seem a bit forced with some repetitiveness. The story itself also has some balancing issues where we get a beach episode and introduction of another character (transfer student) to break apart the fantastic four. I don\u2019t mean it literally but rather how the show can create a sense of annoyance as our new character Karin has an ego unlike no other. The series also has a strange direction as the characters seems to be fighting this enemy because it\u2019s just the right thing to do. There\u2019s a lack of a true villain or purpose that makes the series hard to predict. Thankfully, the series does know what it can do with its characters by presenting their desire (through flashbacks) and not steer away from what it has set up. The latter half of the series also has a much better focus without losing balance of the main story. \\n\\n\r\nJudging on artwork and character design, the show is probably is a mixed bag. Let\u2019s face it, the characters look childish. They look like kids with cardboard box designs complete with the magical girl decorations. Although the series has decent production quality, there\u2019s an auto-pilot like expression on the characters\u2019 faces most of the time. That is until the second half, you\u2019ll see how everything changes. Still, the show does deserve some credit for its elaborate design when it ventures into the supernatural realm. The Vertex are designed to look indiscriminately malevolent while their world also has a great degree of otherworldly elements. The magical girls\u2019 designs may look generic but does go through evolution including their weapons and battle gear. And speaking of battles, the show has great choreography and non-stop action when the pace picks up.  \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is surprisingly noticeable throughout the course of the show. The majority of it relies on parts when the series focuses on its battles. Later on in the show, we also get the more emotional aspect where we see characters expresses their desires and fears. I give praise to the actresses with their performances. It\u2019s their ability to convey the suffering of the characters that make them almost seem realistic despite the fantasy gimmicks. To take this further, the series creates a sense of tragedy that seems to be unresolvable with its quiet atmosphere and OST. The OP and ED songs also does well with its well-crafted choreography.\\n\\n\r\nSo what\u2019s the best way to describe this show? Perhaps unorthodox would be a word to use considering the stark contrast of its first and second half with the story. Some people may see this as a Madoka clone when considerations are taken for the usage of tragedy, magical girls, and war against mystery forces. Technical wise, the show does justice in the end with its conventional direction. In retrospect, this show is refreshing for its ability to craft satirical story about heroes. As a kid, I\u2019m sure everyone had his or her own dream but you may wonder the moment when that is shattered. Step into the shoes of these girls and you\u2019ll realize the experience. \\n",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru was another member of the new-age magical girl genre--a collective of teen girls with your basic set of personalities (smart one, shy one, large breasted one, etc.) receive superhuman powers and moe outfits to fight some villain, the new age aspect being that there is some horrible catch to it.\r\nUnfortunately, since Madoka Magica, it has become a nightmare to build hype for any new shows falling into these guidelines. Understandably, it is very hard to compete with a show that got not only its twelve episodes, but its drama CDs and several movies. Yuuki Yuuna just seems something ofa wannabe Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has faults in that the pacing is incredibly uneven; toward the middle of the anime, there are several filler episodes that are hardly worth watching, as it seems like Yuuki Yuuna tried to drop from the magical girl genre to the slice of life genre. I have little problem with slice of life, but I do have a problem with being ripped out of an action-ridden battle to hear about how helpful each girl is to the community. \\n\r\nThe slow realization of the catch to the magical powers is a good cherry on top of the cake, as that is the moment where one gets the most out of the characters. It's almost satisfying to see each of the girls suffer a touch after having one too many episodes of ease. \\n\r\nAdditionally, the realization of demise brings emotion out of the characters that you just don't see early on. \\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna herself acts as a weak link in the cast. While this girl is the supposed main character, she hardly gets as much screen time as a main character should--nor just she get enough character development. Next to her friend Togo, who only gets more and more dynamic with each episode, Yuuna remains a flat, peppy girl who solves all of her problems with willpower and a strong belief in friendship. \\n\r\nThat belief acts as a major cop-out during the series as well, solving every single one of the girls' problems in a very developed tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nIt may sound cruel, but I am almost disappointed these characters didn't suffer more--or rather, I am disappointed their suffering was disgustingly impermanent. \\n\r\nYuuna, as a character, did not deserve to have all of her problems fixed by her one-note personality. She watches as her friends lose hearing, sight and the ability to speak everyone pities her because she can no longer taste snacks. Yuuna takes none of the blunt force of repercussions until the final moment, and even then, the satisfaction of watching something happen to her is pulled away in an instant with the 'friendship conquers all' cliche.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the despicable treatment of the main character, the art and sound were not incredibly notable. The design for the areas where most of the action takes place are interesting, and the choice of watercolor and pastel is a unique juxtaposition coupled with the battle that is taking place in the foreground. \\n\r\nLet a quick warning be given, there is a bit of shameless fanservice involving Togo, the disabled girl in the wheel chair; ask yourselves, is it /really/ necessary to sexualize the girl in the wheel chair of all people?\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna did, however, do a good job of wrapping up the plot in a way that satisfied the anime's needs. The climax pulled through despite some difficulty managing the show's pacing. Someone less critical than me might enjoy the show more even--just don't look for Yuuki Yuuna to be anything other than the one-note courageous hero the title promises her to be.",

            "content": "YuYuYu is a Madoka Clone!!!!!!\r\nJust kidding.\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is but another magical girl anime, a genre that has a huge soft spot right here in my kokoro. I'm a man, a manly man at that. BELIEVE ME!\r\nBut the cute transformations, pet sidekicks, and flashy dresses always get to me, ya know? I'm sure you understand. I'm not a weaboo, I promise...\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is an adorable magical girls anime. And I'm not even kidding! Well, I'm only half kidding...\r\nThis show uses a lot of moe slice of life! Being the moefag and slice of life fan that I am,Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru was really fun to watch! The girl's are just adorable, and their daily interactions are heartwrenchingly cute. They are all about that friendship power, and they really make up a cute and empowering cast of girls (who are really heavy on that girl power. This show is a feminist's dream.)\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, you can't be a Madoka clone without having some sort of twist. YuYuYu has such a twist, which is why it's always considered a Madoka clone, but here is actually where they also differ!\\n\\n\r\nMadoka = Dark as fuck.\\n\r\nYuYuYu = Sad as fuck.\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu is an incredibly heart wrenching show, combining seemingly unstoppable drama with brilliant voice acting to create a crap ton of source material to cite your tears with. This show joins the small group of shows that actually made me genuinely shed a tear or two, which is really impressive. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- An abnormally good story for a slice of life 12 episode show.\\n\r\n- Great artwork, both background and character design wise.\\n\r\n- A 10/10 tier OST.\\n\r\n- Brilliant voice acting, like damn...\\n\r\n- Great exploration of its themes.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Not-so-great resolving of its themes...\\n\r\n- Pretty generic cast of characters/\\n\r\n- Dat ending though.\\n\r\n- Awkward transition/pacing issues.\\n\r\n- Inconsistent animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nWhy did I give such a fundamentally flawed and plot hole filled story a 9? TO SPITE MY FRIENDS!!\\n\\n\r\nThat, and because despite the many flaws in the story, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru still delivered what it promised, and that is feels. YuYuYu really knows how to smack your face with a giant dildo made of feels. But that's not what it only does! It also warms your heart with moe slice of life shenanigans! Incredibly large amounts of slice of life comedy and melodrama? Yuuki Yuuna really is a Filthy Casual.\\n\\n\r\nThe overlooking theme of this entire show is the meaning of sacrifice. In order to gain the power to protect something, you must give up something as well. Upon learning about the truth, people usually prefer insurance over an uncertain future.\\n\\n\r\nI would talk about the bullshit ending, but honestly, I wasn't THAT triggered by it. (Yeah, that really makes my opinion credible, amirite?)\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru managed to make the stakes seem incredibly high. The drama seemed so unfair and unavoidable, any school girl under those circumstances would completely break down, and that's what they did. Like if you cry everytime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI love the character designs. They aren't special or anything, but they are still good! The designs for their transformed forms are also really cool! Also, them transformation animations! SO CUTE!!\\n\\n\r\nThe background art also has it's moments as well! For one thing, the world of the vertexes is pretty cool! The action scenes were fairly well done, although it can get lazy sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThis would generally make the art an 8 or 7, but what topped the cake off is the fact that the cow fairy looked like President Aria from the Aria series. Stamp. Of. Approval.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI didn't expect this series to have a kickass soundtrack, but guess what? Its soundtrack kicked my ass.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it be through a hype generating soundtrack during the battle scenes with the vectors, the absolutely heart breaking music during the dramatic scenes, or the upbeat and catchy tunes of your everyday moe slice of life, YuYuYu always manages to masterfully support its scenes and moods with its soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, voice acting. This series has some REALLY good voice acting, especially during a select few scenes. I was told about this before I even started watching, but it still managed to impress me thoroughly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOther than the fact that Yuuki Yuuna is self aware of her low IQ, the characters in this series aren't very unique. They do have a decent amount of character, and go through a decent amount of development, they just don't really stand out by themselves. Fuu and Itsuki are your really stereotypical Onee chan and Imouto duo. Yuuki Yuuna is that overly optimistic protagonist who believes in Nakama power. Karin is a tsundere. Togo is the calm one. (She's basically the Mami of the group.) They just absolutely love quoting their Hero Club's tenants, resulting in some pretty cliche WILLPOWER BEATS ALL moments. Despite the fact that they aren't a special cast of characters, they are still respectable and you do care for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI love moe slice of life! I love extreme amounts of melodrama! I like magical girls! Combine them all? Of course I'm gonna love it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nYuYuYu is a show that can really hold it's own as a great and engaging show. While it does have it's fair share of issues, and is the definition of modern anime, it's still an enjoyable watch nonetheless. After all, Yuuki Yuuna is a Filthy Casual.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: #NotAMadokaClone!!!",

I must say that it was not what I first expected, but I am a huge fan of it now. I hope my review will be helpful to decide if it is also something for you :) \r\nWhat am I going to discuss in this review?\r\n- Short summary of the anime\r\n- Why watch this anime?\r\n- short list of Pro's & Cons\r\n- Best order to watch the anime series\r\nAnd for fans of Madoka Magica:\r\n- Is it similar to Mahou ShoujoMadoka Magica?\\n\r\n- in what ways are they similar?\\n\\n\r\nShort summary of the anime\\n\r\nYuYuYu (short for Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru, since it is a bit a long name to keep repeating) is about a group of girls that started a hero club to help people with everyday problems, to make the people around them happy.\\n\\n\r\nBut soon they also find themselves chosen to save the world from Vertexes, forces that try to destroy the world they love so much. The hero club has to find a balance between their normal activities and saving the world. \\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be an hero, how do you cope with knowing of evil others can't ever see?\\n\\n\r\nWhy watch this anime?\\n\r\nYuYuYu is a great anime to easily get hooked on. I was not planning to watch the entire season in one day, yet I did. \\n\r\nThe anime gives you a good variety of different emotions through a combination of story, music and visuals.\\n\r\nThe anime does not use too mainstream characters. \\n\r\nOne of the main characters is a girl in a wheelchair. And no one is like: \"Ahw you poor girl, you are bound to this wheelchair, let me help you.\" I think it is amazing how they made this character an actual representation in the series, where a lot of series totally fail at this. \\n\r\nThat being said I don't have a favorite character, nor do I hate one character. The characters are all balanced and realistic, they all have their flaws and go through a development.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing and synchronizes well with the events in the series. It gives you a hint of what is coming, yet the series is full of plot-twists and unexpected events.\\n\\n\r\nPro's\\n\r\n- Good character building.\\n\r\n- Plays with your emotions, but in a good way.\\n\r\n- Semi-unexpected plot-twists and unexpected events.\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack, well balanced and in sync with events.\\n\r\n- Great animation of the \"Vertex forest\". I honestly love this part of the animation.\\n\r\n- One of the main characters is a girl in a wheelchair.\\n\r\n- Characters are equally likeable, balanced and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Vertex animations are robotic, although it does give them an eerie look.\\n\r\n- I think the love/friendship bond might be a little too much sometimes.\\n\r\n- I find that YuYuYu does too much fan-service, like in the transformations in later episodes, you see more and more big boob and under skirt shots. No. Stop it. They are children.\\n\r\n- I have to cry when I hear certain soundtracks. But I like them anyway. Help.\\n\\n\r\nBest order to watch the series\\n\r\nAs this is an anime review I will only give you the order to watch the anime series. If you wish to read the light novels as well, there are plenty of viewing guides on the web, but I only watched the anime (and I am fine with it).\\n\\n\r\n1) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (obviously).\\n\r\n2) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou (choose between the movies or the tv-version, there are minor differences).\\n\r\n3) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou.\\n\\n\r\nI am personally most fan of the second one, Washio Sumi no Shou (again, it doesn't really matter whether you watch the movie or tv-version) since it explains a lot of things that happen in the first and it has the best story. But even though this is a prequel, you won't understand parts of it unless you watch YuYuYu first.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs it similar to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?\\n\r\nJust like many others, I found this anime when trying to find something like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Note: I did not want to find something exactly the same, I know many YuYuYu fans hate the comparison with Madoka Magica but I did want to find something that would get me hooked and gave a similar feeling. For me, YuYuYu did that. And more. \\n\\n\r\nSo in what ways are they similar?\\n\r\n- Great soundtrack.\\n\r\n- Plot-twist heavy, something I really love.\\n\r\n- Well played on the emotions: Prepare to be amazed.\\n\r\n- Nice artwork, I loved the mazes in Madoka and though the artwork of the forest is different I think it gives the same feeling. I am not really fan of the Vertexes animation (clearly robotic, digital animation) but they do fit in and give an eerie look.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! And don't forget the Hero Club five tenets!",

            "content": "How far will you push yourself for the sake of others even when you know every step you take may hurt you? Welcome to the world of Yuki Yuna is a Hero where hope is sometimes all that\u2019s left to stand on, but it might just be enough to get you over the line. A story following a school hero club thrust into an unexpected fight, Yuki Yuna starts slow but finishes with a bang to make for a magical girl experience that ranged from frustrating to thrilling.\r\nStory\r\nThis is probably the first show I\u2019ve watched where the enjoyment I got out of it was hamperedby comparing it to another show. I heard the talk before watching about how the anime was a \u2018rip-off\u2019 of the 2011\u2019s massive hit which shook the magical girl genre, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. The answer? Yes and no. Character traits and roles in the Yuki Yuna team do feel somewhat familiar. \\n\\n\r\nCan it still stand on its own accord? Absolutely. There\u2019s an interesting complication plus some reveals that kept me interested. Many also like to claim that the \u2018darker\u2019 themes of the shows fall too close together but I think the two shows take them in different directions. To say how this is achieved is quite the spoiler. Just don\u2019t go in expecting a blanket copy of the story \u2013 I can give it that much credit.\\n\\n\r\nEnough comparing, let\u2019s actually talk about Yuki Yuna as its own work.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Yuna Is A Hero is a story that follows the title character and her classmates during their fight with the mysterious enemy known as the \u2018vertex\u2019. Naturally things aren\u2019t as smooth sailing as they would seem at first glance. The truth behind the enemy and the girls\u2019 purpose for fighting slowly comes to the fore. The real meat of the story is watching how the team cope with the revelations thrown in front of them. It\u2019s a story with nothing you haven\u2019t seen before: \u2018Hope being the strongest weapon\u2019 \u2013 but the delivery is entertaining the later it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening portion of the show felt formulaic and everyone seemed too accepting of the role they\u2019ve been thrown into. While there\u2019s some great looking battles there\u2019s nothing that made me say \u2018wow\u2019 or feel like something I hadn\u2019t seen before. I did like the dynamic between the team members, and although they may fall into some \u2018tropey\u2019 behaviours, I was at least made to care about them from an early point.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s my biggest gripe with the show by a country mile: The middle third.\\n\r\nThis section had the problem that the content and the pace was too drastic of a change-up compared to what came before it. The trouble was that the shift in tone was so out of nowhere that it made it difficult for me to keep taking the show seriously. If an anime wants to spell out its themes, establish the mood it\u2019s going for but then decide to take time out in favour of clear eye-candy moments - that serve almost no purpose to advancing those said themes - then I\u2019m left with a bad taste in my mouth. I do understand that this brief slow-down in the story helps develop the characters a little but it certainly could have been done a different way. Don\u2019t pull me in then in just the space of a few episodes make me start asking \u201cwhen does it end?\u201d You\u2019ve clearly done something wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the final third of the show is a thrilling conclusion and although the ending didn\u2019t rub me right way I was definitely hooked in the lead up to it. One big problem with the said ending was that I didn\u2019t get any sense of closure and it all made me wonder whether the plight of our characters was worthwhile. The second half still saves the show and at least made my personal plight, as viewer sitting through this, feel worth the ride. Knowing there\u2019s challenges and burdens to carry that go beyond just fighting the Vertex is excellent. There\u2019s actually some complexity to the tale and it\u2019s great to see characters having to seriously question what is right and what is wrong when it comes to fighting. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s just such a pity that story is so \u2018fractured\u2019 into these different segments. There\u2019s practically no flow between them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that some characters feel a bit too familiar from another magical girl show. I don\u2019t, for instance, have to tell you who Fuu Inubouzaki reminds you of. Even though part of me wants to go on comparing shows, I\u2019ll stop there because Fuu is one of the stronger characters in Yuki Yuna. As the team leader her role goes beyond just giving the orders but when things go wrong she\u2019s the one that feels the brunt of the problems. And boy does she have to carry some big ones. Watching her trying to maintain her leader\u2019s position and cope with those is one of the more interesting aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHer younger sister Itsuki is part of her personal motivation but Itsuki herself felt a bit forgettable when it comes to being part of the larger picture. She gets her own moment in the spotlight but it was perhaps a little cheesy. While I also found Karin Miyoshi\u2019s character annoying, and also very predictable in her development, she was at least important for the team\u2019s character development as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nMimori Tougou is easily the most interesting character. Bound to a wheelchair she\u2019s instantly at a disadvantage from the get go. She makes up for her lack of physical presence by being resourceful and level-headed \u2013 whether in or out of a fight. She\u2019s the anchor that keeps the group grounded. Her intelligence also sees her feel confident to make some huge decisions at critical times, decisions that have the potential for massive repercussions.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there\u2019s our main character. I do love that Yuna is the catalyst for helping everyone else find themselves and overcome their problems. She carries a sense of abundant optimism that no one else in the team shares. She\u2019s the standard \u2018if you believe you can overcome anything\u2019 character but there\u2019s no harm in that. It goes hand in hand with the theme that the show goes for: that hope can overcome despair no matter how great it may seem. Her individual contribution to moving the show\u2019s story forward is actually quite minimal but she\u2019s a decent lead character because you do feel like she\u2019s having an effect on the other members.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciated that fact that all the characters\u2019 motivation made perfect sense. Each of their reasons to be involved and look out for one other were spelt out clearly for the viewer. The troubles that inflict each of them make for some good complication and there\u2019s always that lingering sense of fear that someone is going to push themselves over the edge. Consequences for actions, whether said actions be seemingly right or wrong, feel huge. Reveals about the enemies and their origin did a good job of making me wondering what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nFighting is the core of this show so plenty of work has clearly gone into making the environment unique. It\u2019s a colourful, tangled universe that\u2019s cool to look at. The CG features heavily and it ranges from hilariously out of place to solid. I think the abstract style of the world our characters fight in helps out the CG models a lot as they don\u2019t look horrifyingly out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThe string-laden OST is nice though there\u2019s nothing that stands out. It does its job. Sounds effects in battle give plenty of impact and also goes a long way to giving the Vertex that \u2018otherworldly\u2019 feel.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nWhile copping a flak for being a little too similar to something before it I found Yuki Yuna worth the watch. There\u2019s nothing revolutionary to be seen, and it\u2019s a pity that it takes so long to get to the true complication of the story, but it\u2019s worth it. There\u2019s wonderful chemistry between the characters, the fights are usually entertaining and the problems the team become burdened with keep things engaging. Getting through the lulls in the story is a challenge. It may require you to push yourself through episodes at times but you\u2019re bound to take away something from the show.\\n",

            "content": "Every time I see an anime cover with a cute magical girl/s, I always get the feeling that it's going to be similar to Madoka Magica. I tried the show out just to confirm my curiosity and what do you know, it is similar to Madoka but do not think the show is a Madoka rip-off because it's not. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8.8/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nThe story takes place in the era of the gods, Year 300. Yuuna Yukki lives an ordinary life as a second year middle school but she's also a member of the \"Hero Club\", where club activities involve dealingwith a mysterious being called \"Vertex\". \\n\\n\r\nThis is now the second Madoka-esque anime that I have seen (First being Selector Infected WIXOSS) and I wasn't even searching for this anime. I just found it on Netflix, I saw the cover and I decided to try the first episode just to see if it was similar to Madoka. My curiosity confirmed, I decided to watch the whole show since it was only 12 episodes. After watching through 12 episodes, I really wanted more. The show turned out to be way better than I expected. \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't take that long to show the viewers what to expect about this show. Halfway through the first episode, it immediately got straight to the point. They're magical girls fighting for the organization called \"Taisha\" and must defeat \"Vertexes\" to keep the world safe. Unfortunately, the organization \"Taisha\" wasn't explained that well. Who exactly is \"Taisha\"? What was their backstory and how did they know about the \"Vertex\"? All we know is they're just an organization choosing middle school girls (what was the reason for not picking boys again?) with high marks to fight for them and protect the world. Anything more about them is left to the viewers interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nIn the second half of the show, the girls find out that there are consequences for being a Magical Girl or what the show calls it \"Hero\". To be more specific, if they keep using their \"Mankai\" powers (special powers), they will permanently lose a body part and it will never heal again. The show used this to their advantage, showing the characters struggling and how they dealt with it. If you have watched Madoka before then the dark plot twist shouldn't be a surprise to you. It wasn't a surprise for me but it was still a great plot twist.  \\n\\n\r\nThere was one effective dramatic moment that occurred in Episode 9 where Fu broke down after she found out that her sister auditioned for a singing program. She made it through the audition but because of the consequences of using Mankai, she lost her voice and will never achieve her dream of being a singer. I did not sign up for the feels. I never expected that dramatic scene. To be honest, the episode broke me down and I almost cried, no lie. I mean, you can feel (I did) what Fu was going through when she heard that file. On top of that, there was a background song playing while the scene was playing and it made that scene even more sad. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to talk about the ending. I wouldn't call it great nor would I say that the ending was downright terrible. The problem with the ending is it threw out everything the show was trying to build in the first 11 episodes. I was expecting the characters to stay that way because........the show claims that it was a permanent damage. Did Shinju-sama heal their permanently damaged bodies after they defeated the \"Vertex\" or was it because of \"friendship\"? Either way, it looked like the show did a complete 180 and went for a happy ending with no explanation whatsoever. To be honest, I wasn't really disappointed with the happy ending but I would have preferred the bad ending since the tone of the second half was pretty dark.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI didn't really like the character design when I first saw it. The biggest problem that I had with the character design was their face. I didn't really like how they look like they were blushing all the time. I got used to it after 2 episodes so it doesn't really matter anymore. The visuals and the animation looks great and I first thought this was a P.A Works anime. Turns out, it was some animation studio under the radar and is not well known.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply amazing. Did Yuki Kajiura do the soundtrack? No?! Sounds like she did. The OST's are amazing, the battle themes are amazing. the theme used for the transformation scenes are amazing, the insert song used in Ep. 9 was amazing..Need I say more?.......She obviously didn't orchestrate the soundtrack which was kinda disappointing. Now the OP and ED theme songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Hoshi to Hana\" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and the ED theme songs are \"Aurora Days\" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and \"Inori No Uta\" by Itsuki. The OP theme song sounds awesome especially when all the 5 singers are singing together. The bass in the background is also another reason why I love the OP theme song. The song is also saved on my phone so if someone will need to get help because I can't stop listening to it. The 1st ED theme song is pretty average and I love...love the 2nd ED theme song. Just like Clannad AS' sad songs, this song also makes me tear up everytime I hear it. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VAs. In my opinion, the sound great. Especially Fuu's voice acting at Episode 9. Her breakdown sounds convincing as hell. There was one slight issue in the voices and I found this to be an issue in both Japanese and English voices. It's Episode 11 and 12's constant shouting. It was annoying in English and It was even more annoying in Japanese. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nMy expectations weren't that high when I first watched the show. In other words, I wasn't expecting the show to be that great because like I said, I just wanted the check the show out to confirm my curiosity. I wasn't expecting the characters of the show to have a great character development and to be this fleshed out because it's only 12 episodes. I can't believe I have to say this but..........the show's characters are simply amazing. Do I dare to say that they're better than Madoka Magica's character? No but they're pretty close. All of the characters are fleshed out and all of the characters are mostly developed throughout the course of the show. Almost everything that they do are believable and the way Y(uuki)Y(una is a)(H)ero shows these girl's friendship and how they help each other out is almost realistic. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting the characters to be similar to Madoka then get rid of that expectation right now. There is now way in hell in hell these characters are similar and that's a good thing. Well, Besides Fuu being similar to Mami (They're both the Senpai and they both lead the group), they're not similar. They didn't copy every element from Madoka and the show did something of their own.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nAs someone who only wanted to watch 2 episodes just to confirm his curiosity (I'm talking about me in case you didn't notice), I did not expect to enjoy this show as much as Madoka. By the 3rd episode, I ended up marathoning the show just like I marathoned Madoka a few months ago. Sad to see the show end, to be honest. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nDespite the amount of Madoka rip-offs in today's anime industry for whatever goddamn reason, \"Yuuki Yunna is a Hero\" is not one of them. It borrowed most of its element from Madoka while at the same time, doing something on its own that makes it a unique show to watch and not a blatant rip-off just so they can try and garner the same amount of popularity as Madoka. If you're a big Madoka fan or you're looking for a great character-driven story then this anime is a must-watch. It is one of the most underrated anime shows that I have ever watched. Just watch out for the ending which might kill the show for you. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Story\\n\r\n+Stunning Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Great Character Designs\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack and OST's\\n\r\n+Great and Believable Characters\\n\r\n+Characters are Fleshed Out and Mostly Developed\\n\r\n+Effective Dramatic Scene in Episode 9\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Ending might kill the show for some people\\n\r\n-Tons of annoying shouting at Ep. 11 and first half of Ep. 12",

The way YuYuYu does it is... well, think Saishuu Heiki Kanojo, but more of a magical girl show.\\n\\n\r\nI say \"magical girl\", but this ain't no Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. The action scenes are intense, and even though these girls have the ability to save the world, it comes at a terrible price. It's more akin to Uta Kata in this respect. This price will ultimately lead to some of the most emotionally intense scenes I've ever watched in anime (even more so considering the chemistry these characters have), capping it off with an epic finale, both in action and emotional weight. This series does get a bit melodramatic, but then, it is a life-or-death scenario.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a work of art in this show. The battle music combines driving beats on the synthesizer with a soaring choir, employing melodies that evoke traditional Japanese religious ceremonies. Another big battle theme evokes the valor of the Heroes, but is in a minor key, and sometimes the phrase \"lamb to the slaughter\" comes to mind as it plays. The songs play an important role as well-- important episodes for a character usually end in a solo by her voice actress. Other nice touches include an opening animation that changes as each Hero builds up power, and episode titles that are the \"messages of flowers\" (which is a thing in Japan).\\n\\n\r\nThe villains, such as they are, are pretty much really powerful Neuroi but with much better art style and no lasers. Why do I say Neuroi? No one knows how they originated, not even the series creators (or no one really bothers to put it in animation, anyway).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if I may be so bold, whoever is in charge of the soundtrack needs to release the song Mimori sang in the karaoke booth.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru\u00a0is a Studio Gokumi anime from late 2014. Yes, the same studio that brought us the fun\u00a0A-Channel & that piece of garbage, Crime Edge. So, I don't know what to expect from this. But it's the end of hero month and let's hope we can end it like we began it, on a high note. Because, so far, the only good series we've looked at this month has been Boku no Hero Academia.\u00a0\r\nStory:\u00a0\r\nWe open with our titular heroine, Yuuki Yuuna working with members of her middle school's Hero Club to put on a puppet show. Basically, these four girls gettogether to help out in other clubs, finding homes for kittens and other public services. Things change when, one day, everything freezes during class and the four find themselves in an altered landscape. It turns out the hero club has a hidden purpose, to defend the barrier created by the Shinju that preserves their world. They become magical girls, fighting whenever they're called but they quickly learn that there's a secret behind their powers and it may be too much for them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the series, narratively, is that the final climactic turn may be a bit too easy. Basically, the big \"antagonist\" is too easily dissuaded from what she's doing. It kind of makes sense in context but it might work a bit better if it took a little more effort. The ending may also be a bit too predictable once things get going. Though I'd be lying if I said I disliked it.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are a lot of good things about the series. The events leading up to the big climactic clash are very well handled. There are some strong emotional scenes. Two of which definitely may have elicited some tears from me. The series does a good job of subverting some aspects of magical girl shows while embracing others, including the optimistic outlook. Holding on to hope is a big theme in this series and it works really well. Honestly, I appreciate that it can incorporate some elements that are dark for a magical girl series while still keeping things generally optimistic. There are too many works out there that treat dark content as something you have to go all the way with or just can't have at all. It's nice seeing something with a more nuanced take on it. I also appreciate the way the world building is handled. We don't get a bunch of boring exposition, instead they show us throughout the series what the world they're living in is like and what the more unusual elements like Shinju, Taisha and Vertexes actually are. Foreshadowing is pretty well handled as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is mainly composed of five characters. Yuuna, Tougou, Karin, Fuu & Itsuki. On the surface, they're a pretty archetypal magical girl group. However, every single character goes beyond the typical tropes that they start with. Whether it's accomplished through their reactions to tragedy, their interactions with one another or their way of pursuing their own dreams. Which makes the cast quite compelling. The character interactions are quite strong as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nI also do like the way shifting loyalties are handled. There is solid reasoning behind them that makes sense while also revealing information about the characters in question. The only real issue I have is that the vertexes are kind of nothing villains. We know what they're trying to do and we know the basic reason why but that's about all they have. To be fair to the series, they do provide an in universe explanation for why that is.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of positive aspects to the art. The vertexes have interesting designs. The heroines are well designed and their magical girl forms are nicely detailed. The supernatural world where they do their fighting looks pretty interesting. The fights themselves are quite well done. They involve actual weapons too. Fuu has a buster sword. Karin uses a pair of katana. Tougou has guns. Which leads to some interesting action sequences.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some strong actresses for this series. Terui Haruka, Mimori Suzuko, Nagatsuma Juri, Kurosawa Tomoyo & Uchiyama Yumi are all really good in this. The emotions they convey just come across as so genuine and the way they converse with one another has a good level of verisimilitude to it. The music by Okabe Keiichi & Hoashi Keigo is really good as well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a general undercurrent among most of the girls. The sisters being the obvious exception. It's clear that they care about each other but it's equally clear that it's familial. The most prominent les-yay is between Yuuna and Tougou. They come across as being deep into their first feelings of romantic love. Once Yuuna figures it out they'll probably start dating.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to go into these without giving too much away.\\n\\n\r\nI'd make that final conversation that leads up to the climactic turn a little more substantial.\u00a0\\n\r\nExtrapolate on the effects change at the end a bit more.\u00a0\\n\r\nHave some anger directed at Fuu. Basically, Fuu knows that they could be called on to act as heroes, but doesn't tell the others. That's not much of a spoiler since it's a part of the first episode. But what bothers me a little bit is that everyone else is immediately okay with it. I'd like to see them take some time to get over the feelings of betrayal over that. I think it would make for some interesting character moments.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Yuuki Yuuna was Yuusha\u00a0has a lot of good elements. It has a lot to recommend its story and its characters. It has great art, great acting and solid music. It could also be improved with more time to flesh things out properly but, for what it is, it's a great series. In the end, I'll give it an 8/10. And I do recommend it for those of you who like magical girl series that do things a bit differently.\u00a0",

            "content": "Hello! This is my first review (most overused excuse ever, right?). English is not my native language, so I'm sorry for mistakes.\r\n*I'll do my best not to contain any spoilers.*\r\n*Also, this review will be long because I love to write!*\r\nWhen I first started to watch Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu) back in July 2015, I really expected it to be lighter Madoka Magica. I had heard many people talk about it and refer it as ''the most underrated anime of 2014''. When I finally got to see the first episode, I was pretty surprised to see Slice of Life-elements - I thought thiswas sad anime!\\n\\n\\n\r\nHero Club's Five Tenets:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Give a good greeting.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Try not to give up.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Sleep well, eat well.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"If you're troubled, talk to someone!\" \\n\\n\r\n\"You're likely to succeed if you try.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuYuYu tells a story of four girls (and later fifth) and their Hero Club, which does things like picking up trash, looking for new owners for cats, making summer festivals - you get the idea. One day, however, things change when time freezes and mysterious ''Forestize Warning'' message appears on girls' phones. Fuu (Hero Club's founder) informs the other girls about their job as real heroes which defend the world. \\n\r\nThe story is really well-made and much thought is used in creation. It gives little hints from the really beginning if you pay attention. This is a series you could watch again. I would give story 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\\n\r\nFantastic. 2D animation is absolutely stunning and detailed and character designs are beautiful. YuYuYu uses 3D mainly for the enemies known as ''Vertex'', so it might look jarring to someone. I have seen worse 3D in anime before, but this time it was actually pretty good. As for the 2D, animation is really smooth and beautiful. Not really much off-model shots - I would give it 10, but 3D looks sometimes quite jarring - not too bad, however. So 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuuna Yuuki - Main girl, which the series is named after. She is happy and energetic girl who loves eating and making friends. When Yuuna gets determined, nothing can stop her. She is that kind of a person that you can talk to about everything, from sad things to happy ones.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMimori Togo - Yuuna's best friend, but still asks to be called by her last name. She is really patriotic girl who doesn't use English loan words in Japanese. She is also very smart and skilled with computers, and thus is the one maintaining Hero Club's website. Togo also uses a wheelchair so she has Yuuna pushing her around. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFuu Inubouzaki - Founder of Hero Club and thus the one who runs the things. She loves eating even more than Yuuna and has a lots of ''Girl Power'', as she herself puts it. At the beginning of the series she was the only person who knew about the real purpose of the Hero Club. Fuu is also very protective of her friends, as she is their senior. \\n\\n\\n\r\nItsuki Inubouzaki - Fuu's little sister, who is really shy and sweet. She likes to look at Tarot cards and tell others' fortune. She is also a really good singer. Itsuki is usually hiding behind her protective sister, but as the time goes on, she herself becomes stronger. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKarin Miyoshi - Fifth girl who transferred to main characters' school. She is a hero of Taisha who doesn't really want friends. As tsundere character of the show, she has a lots of pride and a cold heart at the beginning, but eventually evolves into a likable character with a good heart. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall the cast is pretty amazing and their relationship with one another is really well portrayed in only twelve episodes. I give it 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice actresses did a really good job in both acting and singing theme songs. My personal favorite is the opening song, ''Hoshi to Hana''/''Stars and Flowers'', which is really beautiful and well-made song with meaningful lyrics. Ending theme, ''Aurora Days'' really portrays the calm side of the series while the aforementioned ''Hoshi to Hana'' has a more serious and mysterious vibe to it. Itsuki's song, ''Inori no Uta'' is also really good and fits her gentle character. \\n\\n\r\nBackground music in YuYuYu really fits the mood, was the scene intense or just pure Slice of Life. Battle themes have powerful strings or acoustic guitars, while mysterious Jukai has just a piano and vibraphone-ish sounds, symbolising the emptiness of colorful but out-of-this-world nature of the forest. I give overall sound 9. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI admit it - when I saw the first minute of the first episodes, I was so surprised that I thought YuYuYu would be average Slice of Life-Comedy at best. By the time I watched the end of episode and the second one, I thought it was pretty good, but maybe not Madoka's level. At the end of the series, I first gave it 8 because I had trouble with some things, but after analyzing it and watching some episodes again, I thought ''This is amazing, so why did I give just 8?''\\n\r\nThus I give it 9. I will watch it again later, all twelve episodes, but I doubt that it will rise to 10.\\n\\n\r\n*Edit: After watching it again, I find it really hard to not give it a 10. So, even if it may not be perfect, I give it a 10!*\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nLots of 9s, huh? I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys magical battles, well-made characters and stunning animation. Even if you do not regularly watch this kind of shows, at least give it a try. First few episodes might turn someone off, but in the end this is closer to a masterpiece than garbage. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time! If you liked my review, I might do this kind of thing again!",

            "content": "Yuki Yuna is a Hero, for now on being called Yuyu, is a magical girl series that surprised me. Being a seemly dark magical girl anime released after Madoka, and with another show making that a negative thing, (Daybreak Illusion), I really didn't go into the show with much expectation. Though Yuki Yuna is a Hero is a title worthy of being a stand alone anime that shouldn't be seen as a madoka rip off. \r\n   In a world ruled by a being named, Shinju-sama, Yuki Yuna and the Hero club help out the community. The Hero Club is chose bythe Shinju-sama to fight off 12 monsters called vertexs. And so, the Hero Club ensembles with the power of cellphones and friendship and protect their everyday life. Though as their lives go on they learn of the truth of their duties. The brutal truth that make them question the world around them, and ask the most important question of all, why are they even fighting. \\n\r\n   Yuyu is centered around a concept that is rather overused in the media, known as the power of friendship. While I do enjoy the concept; usually I find media to handle that concept horribly, due to fact that many shows don't exploit the actual friendship in question. Yuki Yuna does the exact opposite of that. Yuyu gets that friendship is about sticking up for your friends, but that what makes them so strong is being with them. Yuyu understands character interaction. The way the characters interact feels like how my group of friends act together, we just be ourselves. The conversations the characters feel like they do strengthen the bond between the Hero Club. It's because of those silly moments in the show that the serious moments have real impact. You feel the tension and the risk of their everyday lives, and their moments of happiness fading away. \\n\r\n  The show is very character driven, and it\u2019s a refreshing break from the plot and world driven show that is Madoka. The characters for the most part are likable and I really don\u2019t think any of them are badly written. While I wouldn't call any of them complex; their simplicity is really what sells them to me. Everything about them is clear cut and simple. Even with huge explosions and fighting going on, their conflicts are understandable. Though admittedly I am a bit disappointed by the lack of inner conflicts. Yes, while I could understand what a character is going through, none of the conflicts in the characters are really personal. In short, a lot of the characters are missing the big flaw. The thing that makes them a bit more relatable. With the exception of a few, I feel that the cast is really lacking a human element. Even so, they are likable enough and I do care when something happens to one of them. By the end I felt that all of them went through some kind of character arc, and that they have grown as a person at the end. \\n\r\n   Though...except for one... Yuki Yuna herself...Yuki Yuna is admittedly a very undeveloped character. She really doesn't have a character arc no matter how much I think about it. Yuna is kind of the same person she is at the end. She's heroic and selfless from beginning to end. So she kind of just exists for the sake of the plot and Togo as a character...Though she's not a complete Mary Sue, almost but she does have those moments when she's weak. She's not a perfect little flower, almost but no. Though despite all of that, I still cared for her at the end. For awhile I couldn't think of why I would like such an undeveloped character. Though it kind of just hit me when Yuna was fighting in the last episode. She was really similar to Hikaru Shidou, a childhood hero of mine. While Hikaru is a much better character, their personalities are similar; their outgoing and positive attitude and their I will never give up frame of mind. Yes, a bit of a shallow reason even for me, but yes I don't find Yuna to be a negative factor even though she should. \\n\r\n   So I was pretty satisfied with the character work, even if it was nothing too complex, and it did disappointed me in some aspects.  \\n\r\n   The show\u2019s biggest weak point is no doubt is the dialogue. I don\u2019t think any of the dialogue is too bad, but it\u2019s just that..some of it was bordering on cheesy due to the way the characters delivered their lines. (Both Languages)  I mean someone times it worked, because it fitted some of the characters. Example, whenever Yuki screams shit about the Hero Club\u2019s rules during battle, it fits because Yuna is a huge fan of those rules and it fits her outgoing and positive personality. Though in a case where things don\u2019t work is when Togo screams her heart out. Yes while those lines are okay and aren\u2019t something to complain about, what I mean is that Suzuko Mimori, while a great actress I felt like the direction given was basically: \u201cUhhh try to sound like you\u2019re suffering, but...keep it cool some how...\u201d.  \\n\r\nThe ending was a bit disappointing, I was hoping the show could go out with a bang and end with a bittersweet end, but I felt like it was a cop out. Though after re-watching the show, I have to say it fitted. The writers wanted to give the girls a happy ending, and they did it in the best way possible. While I'm disappointed, I can't say that it came out of nowhere. \\n\\n\r\n Yuyu is a great treat, it's story is a spin on what is now a Madoka inspired landscape. The script and the lore is interesting enough for me even though it's simple and grabs things from Madoka. Though it really is the simpler things that make the story and characters so likable. No matter no messed up a situation is, I could always understand, emotionally what is going on. Since the show sets up its characters to be endearing and relatable.\\n\\n\r\n   Technically, Yuyu is quite impressive and performs well. Which is unexpected from a relatively young, Studio Gokumi. The color palate is light and fluffy, which gives the show a nice light hearted tone, but because of impressive lighting effects. The show got what it wanted across.\\n\r\n   Directed by Seiji Kishi, Yuyu is what I'd like to say is his directing skills in one show. Yuyu has his dramatic and emotional direction tactics as well as his comedic ones. Ala Angel Beats and Carnival Phantasm. The show's comedic scenes have the familiar quick editing and goofy shots. It strangely works, despite the type of comedy this show works with is different than something like Carnival Phantasm or Persona 4. Whole those shows have comedy that relies on anime tropes greatly, Yuyu uses the familiarly of the characters and certain situations to get across it's comedy. I still found it strange that his comedic direction still works well, even though I think the style is more suited to silly anime comedy. \\n\r\n   Kishi's dramatic directing also exists, pulling off a lot of emotion through character expressions, and dramatic shots. Though to be honest, I could have used more subtly. For example, in Togo's emotional climax, the shot is positioned right at her face. Yes, while it's okay for her to cry and scream, I felt like the scene could have been more effective if they just kept a back shot and the background being quiet. The expression while didn't bother me too much, I feel like it's a tad over the top. So I feel like the scene should have let the admittedly great acting shine through by itself. Though the scenes still come off as emotional and it still hit me. It's just my wishful thinking. The lighting is also a great factor. I noticed that in the most emotional scenes Kishi uses the darkest variations on the already existing colors. Which is nice since it shows how straining and heart breaking a scene is. \\n\r\n   On to the music aspect, the music is composed by KEIICHI OKABE, the man responsible for my favorite video game osts. I\u2019m was honestly surprised when I saw him on the staff list. Didn\u2019t know he did anime osts. I found this sound track of his in particular to be a rather interesting work of his..Throughout the show I always had a lingering feeling that the music was at least inspired by Okabe, as the arrangement of instruments and vocals were similar (and actually is) his style. So when I found out that he was the composer I was kinda surprised. Surprised that it wasn\u2019t inspired, I began to see the OST in a different manner since it was composed by someone who has impressed me before. \\n\r\n   I began to listen and compare my impressions to his past work. After listening to the OST a few times in it\u2019s entirety. I feel that with a lot of his work, this soundtrack, was different. That\u2019s why I like Okabe, with each soundtrack he does for a piece of work, he does something different. Even with his style being prominent, I always felt that the music he composed was fresh each time. That is the same for the score here. Since Yuki Yuna is a show very different in terms of tone compared to Nier and Drakengard 3, the soundtrack reflects this. There are a lot of calm and more simple pieces, but there are pieces with more intensity because this is an anime. Because it is an anime, the pieces can be short and not have a loop, unlike Nier and Drakengard 3, which are video games.     \\n\r\n   And really, that's the reason why Yuki Yuna's soundtrack is my favorite anime OST of all time. It's refreshing. It's style of music is refreshing from the bombastic and SUPER DRAMATIC osts from Madoka. (Still love the Madoka OST to death tho) The action pieces uses a combo of the violins and choir, but the way the drums were used made the scenes have more of an impact on me. The emotional pieces, with the exception of one are simple and contain the right amount of punch to get emotion across. You don't have to have an arsenal of violins to make a piece emotional. All it takes is one vocal and a guitar, then maybe a bit of violin. While this isn't Okabe's best work critically, it's an OST that I honestly liked because of the context I had while listening to it.\\n\r\n   In terms of voice acting, the cast consist of mostly new people. Which is something I adore the producers deciding, since the acting also felt fresh and different than the usual Kana Hanazawa performance. (She's in the show too by the way, she does the job like always). Though the cast do have their fair moments where they mess up. While I do think the acting is solid for the most part, there are few times where I felt like some lines could have been delivered better. Sometimes I felt like it was the director's fault (the Togo scene previously mentioned), and sometimes I just felt like the actress could have put more into it. (Yuna mostly) Still, those moments when the acting falters, they are few and far between. Plus when I was watching the show without a critical eye, I was sucked in enough to not care about the acting. \\n\r\n   In terms of the dub, which currently only has 4 episodes out at the time of this review. I like the fact the the dub also opted for newer voice actresses. They perform well, and is about the same level of the Japanese performances, for now. Though the script is mostly faithful, I do feel like the script does changes how a few characters feel. For example, Itsuki is less reserved, calling out on her sister's crap a bit more harshly. Fu is a bit more soft, with her tone of voice slightly less...Senpai like. I actually like these slight changes. Fu comes off a bit more relatable and Itsuki is quite nice as well. Though these changes don't make the two different characters. They still are the same Fu and Itsuki we know. \\n\r\n   Overall even with the minor hiccups, Yuki Yuna performs amazingly. Certainly one of the better shows of the 2014 fall season. Yuki Yuna is a Hero was an enjoyable experience that is everything I wanted in a show. It reminded me of the times I had as a child as well as the special moments of friendship I have now. So even if it's flawed I'll always remember it as something more than a Madoka rip off.",

            "content": "Good emotional payoff but not worth suffering through its mind-numbingly boring plotting.\r\n\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\r\nSpoilers from here on, because this is less of a review and more analysis.\r\n- SPOILERS -\r\nI was told this show was going to be like Madoka Magica, and they were partially right. Except Madoka was great all 12 episodes, even the first three slow ones have replay value once you understand the full context. Madoka Magica is pitched as a magical girl show with dark tones and little cute girls suffering. Yuki Yuna attempts the same except I\u2019m the one that\u2019s suffering because it\u2019s so boring. The emotional payoff\u2014while fantastic\u2014is NOT worth it.\r\nLook, there\u2019sonly so much time and energy we all have. We work, we go home, and our free time is precious. I can work through my Steam library of 300 games, I can finish reading The Hunger Games, I can catch up on Breaking Bad, or I can watch some anime. Point is, there\u2019s a million alternatives I can do which are far more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that these girls are chosen to defend the world. They can transform to have magical powers, and they fight off monsters. Turns out there\u2019s a cost. Who knew? I do not recommend this show to anyone. It drags on far too much, and it\u2019s so boring you\u2019re left numb. I was begging for something interesting to happen. The emotional payoff is good I\u2019ll admit, but it\u2019s not worth it. Furthermore, the girls can go into a second more powerful transformation to defeat the increasingly stronger monsters, but they suffer permanent damage to their bodies like going deaf, mute, blind or even losing limbs.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s this sacrifice that carries the dark undertone of the show, and it\u2019s a fantastic story element. I\u2019m sick of power ups with no cost. Oh, there\u2019s a new stronger enemy? Lemme get in my hyperbolic time chamber and train and go Super Saiyan 4. This is how you get power creep. But the fact that the girls literally sacrifice life and limb for their powers makes the battles a lot more engaging. Unfortunately, there\u2019s very little action until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThese sacrifices are hidden from the girls until they find out which drives the emotional payoff. For example, one girl wants to be a singer but later (after using her secondary power up) she goes mute. Everyone thought their injuries would heal, but they soon realize that it's permanent. There\u2019s a great scene where the older sister realizes this and breaks down. Before, there was a heartbreaking moment where the sisters were eating dinner in silence after earlier episodes showed them eating, talking, and laughing. It's a subtle but excellent scene with set up and payoff. One of my favorites from the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe character and enemy designs are so generic and bland. Not that Madoka\u2019s character designs were much better, but they had enough style to make them distinct. Here the characters look like anyone else. The enemies aren\u2019t threatening looking in the least. They\u2019re masses of bland parts thrown together. Madoka\u2019s witches had that surreal, nightmarish quality to them.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't watch this constantly comparing it to Madoka Magica. The similarities are shallow at best. I let Yuki Yuna stand on it own. I WANTED to like this, but Yuki Yuna is just...\\n\\n\r\nSo. Fucking. Boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves aren\u2019t actually interesting at all. They\u2019re just as boring as they look. The reason the emotional payoff near the end is so great is because of the story\u2019s set up and not the actual characters. The elements and the plot details are there so when they click together it\u2019s great.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, in the third episode there\u2019s a new girl. She\u2019s the tough, \u201cI don\u2019t need friends\u201d kind of character. The other girls eventually throw a birthday party for her and she realizes the value of friendship. Shit like that. Later there\u2019s a big battle in the middle of the show where she doesn\u2019t use her secondary power up. This was before they realized the bodily costs of the second power up. This was early in the show and good set up.\\n\\n\r\nLater, during final battle she goes all out and uses her second power up over and over. She fights the monsters while yelling about protecting her friends. After it\u2019s done, she\u2019s left blind and deaf. This was the payoff, and was very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is awful. It drags and drags. It doesn\u2019t help the characters are boring, but the actual events in the show are dull slice-of-life. They eat udon, they hang out at karaoke, they go to the beach\u2014it\u2019s all so mundane. There\u2019s nothing else happening. It\u2019s all very linear. There are no subplots to keep it exciting. And this is most of the show. I constantly felt numb at how boring it was. I kept asking \u201cWhen is this going to get better?\u201d A good show should never make you feel numb.\\n\\n\r\nI kept track of how each episode left me feeling and 7 out of the 12 episodes I\u2019ve watched were terrible. Fucking seven. That\u2019s 58% of the show that\u2019s shit.\\n\\n\r\n- Would you watch a movie where half of it was boring?\\n\r\n- Would you read a book where half of it was a chore?\\n\r\n- Would you watch a TV series where it doesn\u2019t get good until halfway through the season?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely not. Worse, you can\u2019t skip the episodes either because through the boredom they sprinkle in details as set up for the later payoff. The boring episodes develop the characters and sets everything up for later, but this doesn't mean the development itself was good. You still have to make the actual, minute-by-minute screen time of the characters exciting. Just showing them off and setting up by itself isn't interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the worst part. After any investment you had in these boring characters, guess what? It's all ripped away by the final episode. All their sacrifices, all the damage to their bodies, the entire emotional drive of the show is made worthless. The mute girl talks again, the crippled girl can walk now, any blindness is gone\u2014the emotional payoff that you waited for is given and taken away by a happy ending that wasn't earned.\\n\\n\r\nSo was there anything I liked about the show? Little details here and there. I liked the crippled girl in the wheelchair. She was my favorite because it was a novelty.\\n\\n\r\nThey use smartphones to transform so it makes it feel modern.\\n\\n\r\nI was so bored I actually enjoyed the fan service, and I almost never do.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough. There's some nice jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s actually a lot of subtle foreshadowing which I really appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nThere were moments that showed character emotions and intentions instead of using cheap monologue.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t recommend this show at all. The emotional payoff is fantastic and satisfying, but it\u2019s not worth it. I\u2019d say because I was so bored that the payoff probably felt better than it should have. The show has hints of good writing when they set things up, but most of the plotting is so fucking boring and mundane you\u2019re left feeling numb and exhausted. This should\u2019ve been a movie instead.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Who else watches pretty much anything that comes out at least ep 1 or ep 2 to see if they like it? I'm also one of those person who watches series at least 1 or 2 ep to see if I'll drop it or watch it, at first no doubt about it, the characters were so CUTE and that really helped me to watch it...then I didn't care about how cute they were now, the plot caught my eyes, and I was pretty much getting really close really really close to dropping this series, but then....oh boy I'm glad I did not drop it\r\nYuuki Yunnais prob one of the highly underrated series of fall 2014(by my guess from views on kissanime.com crunchyroll, wao, sites that I use). I somewhat had a gut feeling that I would like this series and as each ep. came out weekly ratings 6.50ish and now look where it's at, slowly, but surely, this series got better as it went on.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Enjoyment/Art\\n\r\nI'm not going to review the series into details of the plot, but the plot was what made me really change my mind of this series(watch the series yourself for full detail of-course :D)\\n\r\nThe series starts of with a club know as the hero club, witch does a lot of community services in a way, after being \"it\" the hero club(4 members at start) are randomly taken  into another dimension where they fight these \"vertex\" where they have to defect 12 vertex and their battle would be over, so they thought...the series starts of really light and simple, and as I was watching my enjoyment was slowly dropping down on it until a bit more into the series their was a lot of hints of a different factor in the plot, the dark areas of the plot. Honestly it has been a while when I last saw a series that has brought some tears to my eyes. I would have to say this series felt really really close mahou shoujo because of the slow start and from the plot just giving hints and hints and here it is.... a twist, but I wouldn't say that this is another mahou shoujo despite the fact both series girls transform and fight, they do have their differences. The artwork of the other dimension is also really similar to mahou shoujo. And the ending is one of the difference, but just because it ended this way, that did not mean it was over(or so i thought).\\n\\n\r\nGenres: Slice of Life, Fantasy, Magic\\n\r\nBeing in a part of a club pretty much that will lead to the slice of life event\\n\r\nthe dimension world that they are taken to brings out the fantasy genre to the series\\n\r\nI'm not fully sure if I would be able to consider this as magic, it felt more like it was super power/action, but also there wasn't much action at all, the hero club members didn't really use magic, but they did got their powers from something else may have consider it as magic \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nYES, these characters were so.....CUTE, when they transformed to their hero form.... EVEN CUTER, but...it's not just their cuteness, their development as a character went really well, even tho as you might be able to tell, the plot will be around Yuuki Yuuna because of the title, but the plot did have room for development of other main characters which was really good, even a character that came in later had development, because this is a 12 ep series don't be expecting one whole ep. about one character, their developments were quick and simple and may even bring some tears to your eyes or heart warming at the very least?\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound was not really well I can honestly say from my view, the opening itself felt a bit dark to it, and then the ending it felt a bit more light? happy? it was a bit weird for me, but it didn't effect my enjoyment of the series. I would say the OST is a bit balanced with some dark theme, sad theme, light theme OSTs.\\n\\n\r\nLast Ep on Christmas \\n\r\nwhat can I say? after eating lunch with the family and opening presents and then finally getting to watch anime, I can really say, I enjoyed my afternoon a lot more then I thought. If you were one of those person who has only watched ep 1-6 or so, sit on your chair, turn on that comp, watch in HD, and enjoy your Christmas/your day. Entirely a worth watching series if you ask me. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re likely to succeed if you try\u201d Many have claimed it is just a  \tMadoka copy, and yes the character designs are Madoka based. That I can\u2019t refute when Yuuki  \tlooks exactly like Madoka and Fuu looks very much like Mami. But once you start to watch  \tthe story and understand what is going on, Yuuki Yuuna is its own story, with its own characters, \tand its own beauty.\r\nStory \u2013 8/10 \r\nIn an alternate world everyone worships a divine being known as the Shinju. The Hero Club is a small group of four girls whodo random tasks to help others, when suddenly they get transported to another world in which they have now been tasked with protecting the Shinju from twelve \u201cVertexes\u201d that will try and destroy it.\\n\r\nAs we follow them through their struggles the story, despite all the problems they are dealing with, always feels happy. As the girls fight Vertex after Vertex they do it with a smile. We also constantly look onto the lives the girls live each day when they are not battling. At times it can even fool us into thinking it\u2019s just a normal slice of life and that everything will be ok. However the writers played it perfectly, lulling us into a sense of safety as we believed these girls would finish their tasks and we would see them succeed without consequence. An epic battle of the last remaining Vertexes at once and when they defeated they were done, they had done their task and succeeded. And then it happened. A dark turn into which no one saw coming, the heroes injured, each losing something vital in exchange for using the great power that come with using their \u201cMankai\u201d and without a way to take back what was lost. The story grows ever darker as they try to discover why this is happening to them and to even discover the truth of the world.\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\r\nHappy and upbeat is something that can describe the first four members of the Hero Club. Yuuki Yuuna is the eternally happy girl always looking out for her friends. She\u2019s the one girl who even everything is against them will always smile. Because of the love of her friends she also tends to be the one more willingly to sacrifice herself in order to protect them. Mimori Togo has always been Yuuki\u2019s best friend but she has always felt ashamed of herself for being a burden due to her confinement in a wheelchair. Her story is one of pain and resentment which is slightly lightened when she discovers that she too can fight beside her friends. After defeating the twelve Vertexes she is the first to research why the injuries cannot heal which ultimately will lead her to discovering the truth of the world. The Inubozaki sisters are always together, yet could hardly be any more different. The elder, Fuu, is the strong willed senior of the group and constantly watches over everyone most notably her sister. She is quick to anger and even when upon hearing that their injuries even tries to attack the Shinju is vengeance for her sister. Itsuki was the quite girl of the group, yet no less helpful than all the others. Her constant helpfulness and eagerness was always shown so brightly. Even when she **Spoiler** lost her voice she never stopped helping others and wishing others to get well themselves. **Spoiler over** The late comer to the group was Karin, self-described as the superior version to the current girls she was trained by the Taisha to combat the vertexes at all costs. She can be considered a tsundere as she slowly yet surely becomes dear friends with all the girls. She is the one girl who after the final battle of the twelve vertexes was uninjured as she was unable to find the opportunity to use her \u201cMankai\u201d. This actually helps lead her to become closer to the girls as she feels great guilt in not helping more.\\n\r\nArt/Animation \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nThe main target of much of the controversy that this was just a Madoka copy. The art is entirely different when in the real world looking very beautiful and serene, but once inside the plains around the Shinju where they fight the world is entirely different with strange vines and roots everywhere and strange looking Vertexes to fight. The character design, which two are based off Madoka and Mami are very different and beautiful. \\n\r\nSound \u2013 9.5/10\t\\n\r\nOh the music was memorizing. Almost hypnotic tracks of beautiful sounding music. However strangely enough the music except at times was never overly positive or overly negative. It remained neutral throughout almost serving as a reminder of the situation that during peak times that not everything is as it seems, yet also when everyone was in anguish and denial that it would soon become better. A rather memorable moment was actually the ending credits of episode 10 in which they forewent the instrumental background in favour of pure vocals, it sent chills down my spine and was so sad without the music in order to prepare us for the final episodes.\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10\\n\r\nFew anime this year have moved me in the way that Yuuki Yuuna has. A perfect combination of happiness and sadness. A story showing both times of joy, and times of anguish. Characters being ever proud, and ever doubting. It balances every aspect on such a fine thread, yet never slips. And in that perfect harmony of light and dark, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru shows its true beauty. \\n\r\nTotal Score \u2013 9.14/10\\n",

            "content": "Ever since Madoka Magica's popularity skyrocketed, many people have tried to emulate it and imitate it's success. Some have succeeded whereas others failed, Daybreak Illusion being one such failure. It focused too much on shock value and being dark without properly developing its characters and giving us reasons to care about them. The most important thing in making a form of media is making it stand out from the rest. If it's too much like another work, people won't be interested in it. A form of media needs to stand on its own two feet and give us something other forms of media haven't Thankfully,Yuuki Yuuna Is A Hero isn't yet another Madoka Magica rip-off, and succeeded where Daybreak Illusion failed. It even did some things better than Madoka!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about four girls, soon to be five, who form a club at school called the Hero Club (why they don't call it the Magical Girl Club since it's about magical girls is beyond me) who go around doing good things for people, such as putting on puppet shows for kids, giving abandoned pets permanent homes, and just doing community service for their town. Every day, they pray to a divine tree that protects them. But one day, out of the blue, they're forced into another world, fighting monsters called Vertexes that threaten the peace of the world. They become magical girls to protect their precious world because it's the right thing to do. But...there are many secrets about the Vertexes and the concept of Heroes, and what happens when they find out the truth?\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has a bright, soft color palette during the slice-of-life scenes, but the battle scenes are bombastic, epic, and extremely colorful, going from light to dark in a matter of seconds depending on the situation, complete with flashy lights, fiery punches, and explosions. The character designs are relatively decent, and the transformation scenes are very well animated...though I'd prefer it if they didn't close in so much on Togo's chest and sexualize the girls so much. But for the most part, there's pretty much no ecchiness at all, even though it's a magical girl anime aimed at adults, so for the most part, it's okay. The soundtrack isn't really anything special, and some of the battle tracks with vocals sound too much like bad imitations of Madoka Magica's soundtrack. But I do love the opening and ending themes. They're soft, well sung, and know when to be subtle and when to hit hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit hard to talk about. They're all amalgamations of typical magical girl cliches at first glance: the cheerful pink girl, the smart and reliable older girl, the polite blue girl, the shy cutie, and the arrogant snob. I do admit they're a bit bland and could have used more development and fleshing out, but for the most part they're relatively decent, and do have their fair shares of hobbies and interests, so they're not entirely bland. I think a few more filler episodes dedicated to them just having fun and doing what they like could have benefitted the show a lot. But they do have a decent amount of character and personality, so we have more reasons to care about them. My favorite out of all of them is Itsuki. She's the most well developed out of all of them. She wants to be strong, has a dream she wants to fulfill, is trying to overcome her flaws in whatever ways possible, and loves her friends dearly, and she isn't the cute pure girl who doesn't know anything about the situation either, no matter how much her sister tries to hide it from her. She wants to throw herself into danger, be brave, and help her friends. To me, that's a character worth respecting.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is one character I seriously cannot stand: Karin. God, I can't stand her! She's a typical tsundere, she's arrogant and has a superiority complex, acts like she's better than everyone else because she's supposedly an artificial human, her annoying voice makes my ears bleed, and she does nothing throughout the entire show until too late in the series. Really, you could cut her out of the show entirely and nothing would be lost! Plus, she claims she's an artificial human, but we see absolutely no evidence of this. She could easily pass for a normal human with the way she acts. Worst of all, the characters actually approve of her bad attitude and don't make a big deal out of it. I'm seeing this a LOT in most anime, and it's bugging me. I know it's probably shoehorning in the moral \"Be nice to someone in the hopes that they'll reciprocate, see the errors of their ways, and change for the better,\" but wouldn't it be more believable if SOMEBODY got angry at her or called her out for being such an annoying, whiny little brat?\\n\\n\r\nBut this isn't the only flaw the show has. Since the series is only 12 episodes long, there isn't time to really develop the characters and explain some very crucial plot related issues. There's also the ending. I won't give anything away, but I feel it's just too happy and convenient for it's own good, and with some things not being permanent raises a lot of unfortunate implications. But I won't let those kill my enjoyment of the show. It has its problems, some minor some major, but I really enjoyed it for what it was, and it's very inspiring. I also praise it for managing to keep a good balance of both lightheartedness and seriousness without going overboard with both, complete with subtle hints and a general sense of unease throughout the series, keeping us on our toes. Daybreak Illusion tried too hard to be grimdark, and it failed in its presentation with its bland characters and no usage of basic characterization and storytelling techniques to make itself better. Yuuki Yuuna knows what it wants, but knows it has to make us care about the characters and restrain itself in getting there in order to be effective, and for the most part, it did very well.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the best magical girl show out there, but I found it enjoyable. Feel free to check it out if you have the chance.",

I liked the plot twist in the middle of the series where the heroes find out that the effects of going Mankai is permanent, and not temporary. I thought it would create an interesting balance between duty and self preservation. I also understood why Tougou and Fuu wanted to destroy the tree of life or whatever. If they managed to go through with it, I would've probably given the show a 9 or a 10 just for havingthe balls to be unique and say 'fuck you' to the formula.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, something or other happens, after the show spends like 10 episodes telling you actions have consequences, actions no longer have consequences because of reasons. Everybody gets better, the end. Probably the only show that has managed to make me sad that the ending is happy. Probably because of all the squandered potential.",

Moving on, may I present to you the second (and hopefully the last) anime that made me cry.\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nI think I already pointed out the story but for those that have yet to watch neither of the anime that I stated earlier, read on.\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is not just a fluffy show where \"cute girls do cute things\" orin short moe, yes there are moe in this series but there's more than that. The series just shows you what happens if you give out powers to young girls that are undergoing puberty. There will be one point when you'll feel like the character in the series and just understand their feelings, you'll get painfully attached (I hope i'm not the only one.)\\n\r\nI just felt that the authors tried their best not to make a rip off out of Madoka Magica, I would like to say they did a great job but there are still similarities but aren't all stories 'almost' the same these days?\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10); Sound (10/10)\\n\r\nThey are just amazing considering this a modern anime.\\n\r\nThe sound and the art will not bother you one bit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nI will not enumerate each and every one of them but i'll summarize them in one.\\n\r\nEvery character has their perks, good and bad. We have this set of friends in one club that helps other people, thus the Hero Club. The club says it all they are heroes helping the weak.\\n\r\nEach character grew in every episode, as you progress through the series the characters realize that what they're doing are no fun and games. You'll just feel every pain that these characters have gone through.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI love this series so much (still being selfish hoping that they'll milk the franchise) but the story's ending was good enough so i'll just leave it there, i'll just be wishing for an OVA or special.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to mention this series is overlooked a lot because they thought that they'll just be seeing a copy of Madoka Magica I would like to tell you that you are wrong my good friend, give this show a chance and if you hated the series be feel free to hunt me down.",

But as the story progresses, it becomes pretty clear that the producers've intentionally made it similar just to play with audience expectations. The result is a well-paced, high-tension anime that somehow manages to balance super serious action mahou shoujo and blissful slice-of-life.\r\nAnd that kind of hybrid actually works really well together! When the show gets dark, the characters keep their heads up by being there for each other. That's good stuff, and the perfect anchor for when the show gets really emotionally demanding into the latter half of its run.\r\nYuki Yuna isn't about how these girls solveplot problems, but rather how they react and cope with being given such a heavy responsibility. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does backfire a few times, as the-power-of-friendship and doing-my-best can lead to cheesy resolutions - Yuki Yuna isn't afraid to take plot shortcuts in order to focus on the characters' relationships. This gambit has definitely polarized reviews, but I like the direction the producers took with it.\\n\\n\r\n9/10, this show is terribly underrated! (On a final note, the animation and music are shockingly good for such an obscure show.)",

            "content": "My thoughts after the first few episodes: \u201cThe OP and music is great, the art is clean and colorful, but it seems like a standard Magical Girl anime\u201d.\r\nMy thoughts after the last few episodes: \u201dWow, that was a rollercoaster of emotions!  And it actually turned out to be more like a contemporary Magical girl anime\u201d.\r\nAs of late, the Magical Girl genre has given us anime like \u201cMahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica\u201d and the \u201cSelector WIXOSS\u201d series.  Joining their ranks is \u201cYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru\u201d, an anime that shares many themes with the aforementioned ones.  The primary theme, of course, is the powercreated by friendship.  Here, our heroine is Yuuna, a junior high girl whose devotion to Tougou, her paraplegic best friend, is praiseworthy.  The two of them are part of the \u201cHero Club\u201d, members of which also include their senpai and club originator, Fuu, and Fuu\u2019s younger sister, Itsuki.\\n\\n\r\nThe Hero Club is a supportive group in Sanshu Middle School \u2013 Their duties generally include volunteer work and providing assistance to the other clubs.  When everyone first joined the club, Fuu had them download a special app that contains hidden features which are activated when they\u2019re summoned to a surreal forest by the Divine Tree.  Unbeknownst to everyone except Fuu, the members of the Hero Club are the next in line to protect the Divine Tree against monsters called \u201cVertexes\u201d.  Should the Vertexes (Vertices?) reach the Divine Tree, the world as they know it will be destroyed.  And if they\u2019re up to the challenge, they\u2019re able to use the app to transform into heroes who are aided by Pok\u00e9mon-like fairies.  However, any damage that results from battling Vertexes is reflected as collateral damage in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like a conventional good-VS-evil story, right?  That\u2019s how it starts out, but there are several revelations unloaded in the second half that\u2019s more reminiscent of Madoka.  What has basically been subtext in similar anime is the main focus here.  There\u2019s a heavy emphasis on what it means to be a hero and what one is willing to sacrifice to that end.  Heroes aren\u2019t perfect \u2013 they go through trials and tribulations like any normal person.  With that in mind, several of the girls experience doubt and begin to question whether or not their efforts are in vain.  That kind of exploration is the real appeal of contemporary Magical Girl anime, and it\u2019s also all you need to know from a plot standpoint.  And even though comparing this to Madoka might be a spoiler in and of itself, it works better going in with the knowledge that this isn\u2019t a sugary, saccharine Magical Girl anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs I alluded to, the second half provides startling answers to any questions you may have about the characters\u2019 purpose.  But the first half sets the rules, characterizes the girls, and establishes what\u2019s at stake should they fail.  You know, aside from the obvious end-of-the-world setup \u2013 namely, their personal goals and keeping everyone together.  Seeing the interaction amongst the girls gives you a warm feeling in your heart.  The feeling manifests even more when you see how they welcome a lone wolf-type into their group.  Their bond in the real world is strong and it never wavers once the battles get underway.  Most of the time, they wins battles through support and sheer determination.  As for the battles themselves, outside of \u201cFate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works\u201d, \u201cRage of Bahamut\u201d, and \u201cGaro\u201d, Yuuna has some of the best choreographed battles of late 2014.  The colors are clean and bright, the characters move gracefully, and the Vertexes have that otherworldly look that Madoka captured so well.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the transformations are stylish and gorgeously animated, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice how slyly the anime tries to insert gratuitous fanservice.  The fanservice is not restricted to their transformations either, as on occasion, the director shoots the girls from suggestive angles.  The anime wants to portray these girls as paragons of purity, yet conversely takes time out to say, \u201cThis girl has a tight body\u201d or, \u201cThis girl has huge boobs\u201d.  I don\u2019t know for whom this level of fanservice is directed, but there\u2019s not enough to satiate those who crave it and it\u2019s distracting to those who actively avoid it.  However, from what I hear, the fanservice is toned down from other Yuuki Yuna properties, so I can somewhat accept it as a compromise that leans more towards my sensibilities.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru\u201d is an anime with an unassuming beginning that artfully raises the stakes as the series progresses.  Despite the homogenous character design, the entire anime is exceptionally drawn and animated.  The music is at times delightful, energetic, and ominous.  And as a final note: The character of Yuuna is one of the kindest, most dedicated female characters in recent memory.  I mean, she\u2019s stubbornly dedicated to \u2013 not only her friends \u2013 but her ideals.  Characters like her can come off as cloying, but in the second half, her hopeful nature is very reassuring.  Even when the situation is at its bleakest, you can count on Yuuna to display true heroism.  Those who like Magical Girl Anime with a tinge of darkness to it should give this a try.  After all, you\u2019re likely to succeed (finding a good anime) if you try.",

            "content": "Halfway through I took the snarky adage when dealing with Modern Japanese Literature to heart: \"All Literature after WW2 is about the Atomic Bomb\". I'm sure somewhere out there, some extremely bored Lit student is spinning something like that out of Yuuki Yuuna.\r\nI'm not going to go into anything weird like that though. I'm aiming for fairness, and giving what is due, its due.\r\nThere is a premise you have to accept, even if you deny the characters, the narrative, and the whole concept as a rehash of a lot of things (I can think of analogues from Eva - with the 12 Aliens, to MuvLuv Alternative). You have to accept that if you like Madoka, then you must like Yuuki Yuuna, because Yuuki Yuuna is fairer in its narrative.\\n\\n\r\n(At least until the ending, but both Madoka and Yuuki Yuuna suffer equally in this regard)\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, the under-reliance on dark twists (well, comparatively, to Madoka at least), and focus on Slice-of-Life, is actually a boon. One of the weaknesses of Madoka was simply that lack of care to have sustained characterization, in that I couldn't see clearly, for example, why Homura was so fixated on Madoka in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nPeople don't give Tougou her due. She has everything you would label as the 'dark brooding character', and she is one, but she also has a sense of humor, and a personality (even if half of it is made out of a mix of running gags about Nationalism). That's a complete slap in the face to Homura as a character. She's probably the best character of the show because she shows a greater and more human diversity of emotions and reactions to the events around her.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else can fall under quite a number of stereotypes. Cool Big Sister. Shy Little Sister who wants to gain the strength to protect the one she loves. The Shounen Archetype. The Recklessly Anti-social girl. I wasn't expecting much from the characterization here, but what it actually did with the stereotypes surprised me, because it made them more than stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing is that, if Madoka is beautiful, and experimental, and avant-garde, Yuuki Yuuna has focus. Although none of the scenes really reaches the titanic psychological framing of Hideaki Anno, for example, there are some great subtle touches in various places. Usage of Silence, especially with some parts involving the sisters. Subverting Karin's growth as a character by adding further awkwardness in her development arc. Scenery fleshes out the town. Sometimes repetition of scenery, beyond just cutting costs, is used to frame a sense of monotony. A few bits here and there show, at the very least, a adequate control of direction, though not overwhelmingly so.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I came into Yuuki Yuuna expecting Entertainment and Emotions. I wasn't expecting a grandiose masterpiece. At the end it delivers wonderfully on this aspect. The battles here are simply more tense than Madoka's are. There are multiple curves and bends tracking ups and downs, with the adequate punctuation and reveal when things 'ramp up a notch'. You feel the sense of danger, and the sense of rebound, and the sense of getting higher and pushing through, which fits the whole main theme of the show to a T. Madoka fight scenes are like Giallo scenes - stupidly lush and intricate, although more for the aesthetic. Yuuki Yuuna has those full Indiana Jones or Mad Max Fury Road fights with tension and thickness.\\n\\n\r\nNeither is the story straightforwardly a 'darkness for darknesses' sake' story. This is where I call it fair. There are dark reveals. But the conflicts come from purely, and purely, character's reactions to these reveals. Madoka only has one developed 'be careful what you wish for' type deal, stemming from a character's actions, while the rest is purely plot-flow (wow Sakura had this weird religion-related plot backstory. Does that aspect of sin or Christianity even play in her whole character? Nowhere in sight). Yet Yuuki Yuuna manages to explore the effect on all its characters. In the ending, at least until the last part, everyone reacts within the frame of what was set for them. All of their motivations led them to fight on their own terms, and this is something that many action shows lack, giving no discernible foundation for characters to act the way they do. The tragic backstory is really only abused twice, and, even then, it fits at key moments, while the characters already had enough to stand on their own, such that it became complementary to their motives, rather than supplementing them entirely for a cheap knock-off. (I'm looking at you too Jun Maeda)\\n\\n\r\n(You also cannot criticize Yuuki herself for having Shounen Hero-Blood, since she has it from the start, and acts upon it at every turn, and never shuns away from this premise, as opposed to Madoka, who literally has her Will come out of nowhere.)\\n\\n\r\nEven the weakest characters, the sisters, have their primary struggle arise from a set-up that was established quite early (episode 4). I'm really aiming at quite a number of people who somehow have Madoka on their list as higher than this, when Yuuki Yuuna is foundationally stronger, and then proceed to try and attack characterizations without much else than saying \"they're stereotypes\". Yea, they are, and the director was obviously working with full knowledge of that, and how he makes a fuller statement is noteworthy of itself. (Think, for example, of how many death flags he purposely triggered)\\n\\n\r\nEven then, Madoka is still unshakeable in my heart for the level of pure spectacle and pushing formal boundaries animation-wise. Yet I'm not really laudatory of its other aspects. Logic, people, is what Yuuki Yuuna has in spades more than Madoka. Logic to push through a premise for the most part, in a fair (notwithstanding the ending) way that gives credence to what it set out to be, and Yuuki Yuuna set out to be Entertaining Fun Emotional.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if, somehow, you're a person that hates a fully Entertaining Fun and Emotional slice-of-life-action-comedy-drama, then you need more Yuuki blood in you.",

            "content": "I wonder if Yuki Yuna is a hero, the title of this anime is so ambiguous.\r\nStory:\r\nOne thing that I keep hearing over and over again is that Yuki Yuna is a Madoka Magica rip-off. I think that is not true. There is no denying that this show is inspired by Madoka, but despite some similarities (which have more to do with both anime being magical girl shows than anything), Yuki Yuna goes its own way. The heroines get deceived and becoming a magical gi\u2026I mean hero has a big downside. But that is about it. The character dynamics are different, there is no personified antagonistand most of all, the development and pacing is completely different. But let\u2019s stop comparing it and take a look at what Yuki Yuna actually does. In its core, it is a slice of life-driven magical girl story, not unlike others that came before. Halfway through however, it evolves into a more serious story. I found the development of the story to be interesting and well made, but the writing is all over the place. You don\u2019t need to explain everything in a story, but some things were left unexplained that needed to be addressed. Like, who the hell is that Shinju-sama? Why is the world like it is right now? And what the fuck was up with that ending?\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS FOLLOW, SKIP THE REST OF THIS SECTION TO AVOID THEM)\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t mind a happy ending. In fact, I really wanted the girls to somehow recover and be normal again. However, you can\u2019t just give them back everything for no reason whatsoever. So, the Shinju just realized that the hero system is shit and changed it, because\u2026why? What did these girls do that others before them didn\u2019t? And if it\u2019s that easy to just change the system, then why the fuck didn\u2019t they do so from the very start? What was the fucking point? Just to give us a happy ending? Happy my ass, that\u2019s bullshit. I absolutely HATE when anime do that. I hated it when Future Diary pulled something out of its ass, I hated when Izetta decided to have the main character survive something unsurviveable and I am extremely pissed at what Yuki Yuna did. You see, if the anime was shit, I wouldn\u2019t give a flying fuck, but Yuki Yuna is a GOOD anime. Why did you have to take a huge shit on it with such a dumb ending?\\n\r\n7/10 (withouth ending)\\n\r\n3/10 (with ending)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the art (I\u2019m gonna do it anyway). Yuki Yuna looks very good for a slice of life anime. During their fights in the\u2026whatever that kinda dimension is supposed to be, this anime looks amazing. So many shapes and colors and they are all done well. The action sequences are really, really, REALLY good. The character design isn\u2019t that outstanding, but Fu looked pretty cool with her eyepatch.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIf you desperately want to find something to put your finger on and call Yuki Yuna a Madoka clone, it would be the soundtrack. And why not? Madoka had one of the best soundtracks of all time and this show does a very good job at using music in a similar way. Opening and ending were well done, though not really all that memorable. Itsukis song (used as ending for episode 9) hit right in the feels. The voice acting was great, all the emotions were believable all throughout the cast.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYuki Yuna is NOT a Madoka clone. She is very upbeat, determined, never loses hope and is clumsy in everyday life. Basically, she is a stereotypical main character. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves me with very few possibilities to comment on her. Togo is the more level-headed, more mature and more scrutinizing character (no, she is NOT a Homura clone). She\u2019s actually a very interesting person (compared to the rest of the cast), especially in the latter half of the show. Fu is a terrible, but exerted leader, who completely fails being a leader (redundancy ftw). I liked that, a teenage girl is rarely a born leader and commitment is no replacement for expertise. Itsuki was cute, but not much more. She was basically just there to make us sad. Karin is a tsundere that opens up to the others over the course of the series. It\u2019s no secret that I am anything but a fan of tsunderes, but I can accept them if they are either a) well written or b) played for laughs. Karin falls into the second category, so I am fine with her. As you can see, the cast isn\u2019t that exiting, but I kinda liked the girls, which made the story work better.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nYuki Yuna is a good anime, that takes ideas from other magical girl animes and does something else with it. It doesn\u2019t play the genre entirely straight, but it also refrains from copying what other anime have already done. For some, this may appear as a half-hearted attempt to cash in on the \u201cnew era\u201d of magical girls, but to me, it was a unique little show that didn\u2019t do everything right, but a lot. Only the terribly written ending spoils my enjoyment greatly, what a shame.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.0/10",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka Magica is my favorite anime, and I\u2019ve seen Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru compared to it a lot (usually in a negative way). While it\u2019s certainly nowhere near as good as its spiritual predecessor, YuYuYu isn\u2019t a ripoff. It\u2019s clear that Madoka\u2019s greatness inspired it, but the show forges its own path. I enjoyed this series, and liked its prequel more, and would definitely recommend it.\r\nStory - 7\r\nI went into the show knowing that there were twists and that the heroes would be sad, plus the basic plot stuff with the hero system and Shinju-sama, but enjoyed the plot enough. Ireally didn\u2019t understand the Taisha and what they are - the recent continuations have clarified some things, but I\u2019m still confused. Although I won\u2019t spoil it, I didn\u2019t understand the ending at all - the why, the how, the what, basically everything. Despite the sorrow the characters experience in the final few episodes, I never cried, though there was that one scene where Fuu hears a recording for a vocal audition that Itsuki did, which did tug at my heartstrings. The story of Yuuki Yuuna is unique and interesting enough, though I have some big questions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7\\n\\n\r\nThis cast comes nowhere near Madoka in terms of nuance and development, but you can find so many worse characters. Although they are a bit trope-y, the heroes are all distinct and some, Mimori in particular, get some great growth. The lead, Yuuna, embodies the do-good, sweet anime protagonist archetype, but she executes it well. I felt the most for Itsuki; she lost her dreams to this system, and she\u2019s like 12 and loves her onee-chan so much. I want to hug her. Although the characters aren\u2019t groundbreaking, they are still sympathetic and have decent arcs. I did enjoy these five.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 10\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is gorgeous. I adore the character designs, and the tree world is equally well-crafted. It\u2019s so pretty!!! I feel the same way about the soundtrack. 10 Stars, 5 Flowers is my personal favorite. As usual, I always skipped the ending song, but the opening, Hoshi to Hana, is one of my personal favorites. This anime truly shines in the production department.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nIt took me a bit to really get into it, but by the halfway point, I was hooked. Although some things were very confusing, that didn\u2019t hurt the entertainment value too much. The show definitely wasn\u2019t as sad as Madoka, and doesn\u2019t have a hundredth of its greatness when it comes to the ending, but it stands on its own with its themes, and leans toward the more friendship-filled atmosphere of other mahou shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nYuuki Yuuna is worth your time. I enjoyed both the prequel and sequel more than the original series, but hey, 12 episodes isn\u2019t much to ask. Madoka Magica is the clearly superior show, but if you like both that and other, lighter magical girl shows, this is a perfect hybrid, and did I mention that it\u2019s a feast for the senses? Some people strongly dislike this anime, and others clearly liked it way more than I did, but it\u2019s a good show that deserves more appreciation.",

            "content": "I am assuming that you are here because someone somewhere told you this show is like Madoka Magica and you like that show. If this is the case you are unfortunately going to have a bad time with this show because it is NOT like Madoka Magica and you will be expecting it to be. While the show does offer some interesting parallels to serving in armed forces and PTSD it ultimately falls flat and neuters itself with a very bad ending. This review will have very generalized story descriptions with minimal spoilers. Still, if you would prefer to go into it with you eyesclosed.... skip to the end of the review for an overall section. \\n\\n\r\nSo lets get to it: On the surface Yuuki Yuuna is a pretty standard magical girls show about middle school girls doing middle school things. The girls are part of the Hero club, and become magical girls that fight evil for the guardian spirit of the Earth. The show has a tremendously long wind up (for a 12 episoder) as episodes 1-6 are basic monster of the week/ cute girls doing cute things style of anime. Again if you watched Madoka Magica and someone told you to make sure to watch to episode 3, I guess in this show it would be watch to episode 7, more than halfway through the show.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7 is where \"$hit gets real\" and the real themes of the show come out. For what it's worth, episodes 7-10 are quite good and deal very interestingly with PTSD, regret, shell-shock, and survivor guilt. As the story unfold you learn about the less nice aspect of the girls' powers and the toll it takes on them. As with many anime, Yuuki Yuuna focuses heavily on the theme of indomitable fighting spirit and power of friendship, which begins to ring hollow. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is where the story completely falls apart. Instead of sticking with a strong and poignant story that episodes 7 onward set up, the show throws up its arms, calls on the power of friendship and undoes all of the difficult decisions and character moments leading up to it. The ending is ABSURD especially considering what is said by one of the plot relevant characters as a part of the \"oh shit\" moments. But everyone loves a happy ending right? /s. The outcome of the ending is also inconsistent in terms of the world of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show range anywhere from MAIN CHARACTER WITH HEART to moderate chuunibyou to \"I'm too good for this shit anyways\" fighter character. While the character tropes are pretty standard, they're well fleshed out, each one filling a niche. Again here the comparison to armed forces service comes in very well. You have the guy who joined to serve his country, the guy who was in who recruited the others, the younger brother who follows his big bro in, the guy who thinks he can't hack it but does it for his comrades, the guy who's been training his whole life for this moment, etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is quite good with beautiful visuals during fights, and solid animation otherwise. Each of the girls has a good design and a somewhat memorable look. The sound is solid with good music, a good dub and nice sound effects. During the end quarter of the show, theres a good bit more yelling, but it's done decently.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of the show is crippled by a very long lead-up before any interesting thing happens. For 6 episodes this show is the most mediocre magical girl show I can think of. For 3-4 episodes it is a fascimile of Madoka Magica. And for the last 1-2 episodes its Dragonball Z with the power of friendship, blissfully undoing any parts of Madoka Magica that may have been lingering around. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a chore to reach an interesting and watchable point in the show, and it was over too soon. The ending left a horrible taste in my mouth and I wouldn't recommend it. I would suggest reading a plot synopsis on a per episode basis to get some of the thematic elements if you're into that. Skip the ending altogether unless you enjoy hackneyed bullshit.",

            "content": "For this review, it is maybe better to separate the anime in two half (episodes 1-6 and 7-12). \r\nI like to see the experience of watching Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu) as a roller coaster. In the \u201cdark magical girls\u201d type, Yuyuyu gives the impression, on the firsts episodes, of an obvious show who couldn't stand for his own: cute schoolgirls becoming magical girls to fight monsters... Meh. We saw that a ton of times, didn't we? Really, everything seemed bland. One word can described the first part: boring. But then again, the roller coaster's comparison. While everything was slowly building up,the few last episodes took me right in the feels. The \u201csecond part\u201d was far from being perfect, but definitely catch up the mistakes of the \u201cfirst part\u201d by playing with the feels of the viewers and, of course, the plot twist.\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10) - \u201cMediocre\u201d: I think that my impressions back up are good explanation of why I give it a 5/10. Like I said, nothing is really new with the story or out standing. As long as I'm concerned, the plot twist saved the story. Let's not forget I had the sensation the anime didn't even took itself seriously sometimes... In example, one of the episodes is mostly a beach's one. Granted it was funny and didn't kill the anime. But how can you expected to take seriously a \u201cdark twisted story\u201d with that short of story line?\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) - \u201cGood\u201d: For some reasons, the art repulsed me at first. But while watching the anime, I really felt in love with it! Vivid color and really fluid. Without saying they are originals, the transformation scenes of the girls are appreciated and well done. Sadly, the character design didn't impress me and the same goes for their weapons/evolution's.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) - \u201cGreat\u201d: Ah, the musics! First, the opening: a lighthearted song, easy to \u201csing\u201d (well, to try to imitate ha ha!), which give a good feeling about the anime... It is not the best opening of the year, but it works perfectly fine! But what really made me open-mouthed was the combat's musics. It submerged you in them and from time to time, I felt they helped to understand the characters struggles. Really good choices of music. The transformation scenes music was on point too, it really got me into it!  As for the sounds, I don't recall anything bad or disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) (5/10) - \u201cMediocre\u201d: Take Madoka Magica's characters, mix them with a little of Gakkourashi!'s characters and you have Yuyuyu's ones. First, the main protagonist Yuuki Yuuna. She is your average always happy and smiling protagonist at an unbearable extend. It is clear that the viewers are supposed to see her as THE magical girl with a lot of strength and a good heart, but she is as useless as a shell when it comes to story development. \\n\r\nI won't talk about all the main characters because they're all in the same \u201cclich\u00e9 and boring\u201d line. But one that took my attention is Inubouzaki Fuu. Fuu IS a character worth to follow. I won't say anything else to prevent spoiling, but she is really great. To be fair, Togo Mimori also brings something to the anime plot. Still, most of the characters didn't stand out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) - \u201cGood\u201d: The \u201cfirst part\u201d was hard to enjoy. To be honest, I was on the verge to drop the anime. It is when the \u201csecond part\u201d began that I stick with it and, in all honesty, I don't really regret it. Some moments in the three last episodes made me cry. For me, the enjoyment rises like hell at the end, saving the rating for my review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) - \u201cFair\u201d: Yes, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is, overall, a good anime. Of course, if you saw PMMM you'll see similarities. Most of the characters are clich\u00e9s and can be annoying. The art is not something revolutionary, but the music saves the day. Nothing new of fantastic, but nothing really to hate about. It's your average slice of life/magical girls anime.\\n\r\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nI recommend to watch Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru a Sunday when you have nothing to do with your life. Even if it began as slow paced, the 12 episodes can be all watched without noticing it. Let's say it's a good anime to rush. If you have time, go for it! But I don't think you're missing a masterpiece if you decide to pass that one.\\n",

            "content": "Oversized weapons, magical sparkles, Eldritch abomination enemies, cute and colorful middleschool age girls, brooding undertones. Sound familiar? Come on\u2026 it starts with an M\u2026\r\nThis is an assimilation of every popular trope in today\u2019s anime, made to profit off of the success of series before it. Same \u201cdere\u201d characters, same overall plot structure, overwhelmingly similar art style to its obvious \u201cinspiration\u201d (more like rip-off) Madoka Magica\u2026 it\u2019s even got the Sailor Moon transformation scenes down to a T. \r\nThis series can seemingly do nothing right but tussle with its own severe identity crisis. It borrows so much from so many other things, but offers nothing newor original in return whatsoever. What adds insult to injury is that it isn\u2019t even adapted from anything\u2014it\u2019s an original work. This means not an artist, but a group of writers sat down and thought to themselves, \u201clet\u2019s take everything relevant and hip and mishmash it into a product of the generation! Fans will eat it up.\u201d And, for some reason, they got whatever funding they needed to make it happen. Let that sink in. Just let it sit in your mind; let it ruminate for a while. \\n\\n\r\nYeah. Hurts, doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\nWell, what is the story actually about?\\n\\n\r\nBunch o\u2019 cute little girlies get to become magical heroes (with their own signature Pokemon, no less) and fight beings threatening out existence, and afterwards go back to everyday life, taking part in things like hunting for their dreams, helping out their community, and going to the beach.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character (Our own Yuki Yuna) suffers from Shiro Emiya disease and believes in putting others before herself for the sake of what\u2019s right. From this we can conclude that she\u2019s severely retarded. There is no expansion on this archetype of her\u2019s, there is no more depth or exploration into what makes her a living, breathing, human being, she\u2019s just a pink piece of paper.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Little Ms. Blue, Togo\u2019s. I mean To-Go.\\n\r\nI mean Tougo.\\n\r\nShe\u2019s a cripple. Yeah. There\u2019s her defining characteristic. She can\u2019t walk. And she has huge tits. Other than that all we really know is that she\u2019s the sweethearty type of girl that\u2019s total waifubait, an embodiment of what many male watchers want to see in their brushing bride to be. \\n\r\nAnd around the corner we have Little Miss Yellow, Fuu Inubouzaki. She\u2019s the endearing, motherly type, the one who will cheer you on no matter what happens. She and her sister Itsuki, (Little Miss Green, and a Dandere to the max) both have the absolute token \u201cdeceased family, now survive by each other\u201d backstory that is typical in anything ever created ever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the bane of my existence, as both an anime fan, and a person altogether. The classic Tsundere, Karin Miyoshi. Just guess what her color is. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the biggest problem with these characters is that I had to look up their names. There is nothing about them notable in the slightest except for their color and matching archetype, so their names totally fly over the viewer\u2019s head because they just do not care. That is the worst mistake you can ever do when designing characters, is to make them forgettable. They are nothing but paper-thin cut-outs. Here, let me say what I\u2019m thinking and what I\u2019m going to do two seconds before I fucking do it. I think that adds depth to my character, does it not?\\n\\n\r\nAnd seeing these characters using cell phones in the middle of a sparkle-sparkle rainbow battle (its how they \u201ctransform\u201d) just takes you right out of the moment. What else are they trying to rip off with those floating HUD\u2019s, Log Horizon?  .Hack? Sword Art Online? Shit, the soundtrack is similar enough for the latter. If I didn\u2019t know any better I\u2019d think Yuki Kaijura did the music. It\u2019s an almost exact note-by-note copy of her entire lineup. Just another box ticked off.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and then, the already uneventful plot has the gall to take a grimdark turn. It delves into the darkness that its main inspiration did\u2014but because the characters are defined by nothing but empty archetypes, one could care less about what happens to the cast, making the overall tone of the latter third to the show now completely juvenile and pointless. Sprinkle in some existential \u201cwtf\u201d on top of the depression and wallah! \u201cMaturity.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is Madoka Magica all over again, the animation is nothing special, and every single character has the same face. The only difference in character design is the hair color and eye fill. Not to mention that these girls are actually the only characters in the show. You get tired of looking at CG monsters and the same five designs for twelve episodes in a row. \\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tCute girls? I don\u2019t know they all kinda look the same\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tFuck if I know\\n\r\nCONS\\n\r\n-\tPlagiarism.\\n\r\n-\tUnoriginality upped to the umpteenth degree, times ten, plus the amount of times people on this website have reviewed Attack On Titan\\n\r\n-      Boring animation\\n\r\n-\tBoring as a show altogether\\n\r\n-\tInfuriatingly predictable\\n\r\n-      Dull soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nSo here we\u2019ve come to the afterthought, and you know what I have to say?\\n\r\nThis show was over when it started. It had no life or identity to begin with. It is a product to appease the masses of today. Avoid it like the plague. \\n",

            "content": "**Will contain slight spoilers for the overall series and major spoilers for the ending**\r\nYuuki Yuuna tried to be something it is not. It makes promises it can't keep and that's one of the biggest problems I have with this anime.\r\nIn the beginning I was sure that it would break my heart, because it started really well. After watching Madoka I had a lot of hopes for this magical girl anime, but it just didn't get there.\r\nIt tries really hard to go places, but isn't able to succeed with what it's offering. We get teasers for really emotional storylines, but they remain teasers. There are momentswhen I really felt for the characters and wanted to hug them, but not as much as I felt the anime wanted me to.\\n\r\nYou will find a lot of the typical magical girl tropes in this anime, which isn't inherently bad, but paired with a semi-consistent story, it just feels lacking. Yuuki Yunna had a lot of potential, but it just goes downhill, after the seventh/eighth episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are setting the mood for a bad end or at least a bittersweet one, but that's not what you get, because Yuuki Yuuna just didn't go there. While you have the friendship factor and a few happy cute girls in the beginning, everything takes on a dark tone pretty soon. Still the girls are optimistic and so are you, until they fall prey to the effects of their powers.\\n\r\nThat part is something I liked. Magic \u2013 at least for me \u2013 should always come with a price, so it is fine with me, that they have to pay for the powers they're using. But that is where the problems start. The organization is lying to the girls, the girls are lying to each other (all in the sake of not afflicting the others), while one of them goes down a really dark path, but no one really cares about it.\\n\r\nAnd this is the part where Yuuki Yuuna lost me for a bit. Their whole club is about talking to each other, but none of them does that. The episodes are dragging along now, you get a lot of slice of life (which would be fine, if it wasn't trying so hard to add something to the story and failing) and it isn't until near the end you get back into feeling something for the characters. You learn that they can enter another form of their transformation, but it is never explained how that works (are they controlling it?). There are a lot of things that aren't explained well, but especially how their powers work was something I would've been really interested in.\\n\r\nThen you get the end and it is just a wild mess. When you think about it, it doesn't make a lot of sense:\\n\r\nThey fight for Shinju, offering parts of their body/senses in exchange for the powers that are granted by Shinju, only to get them back, when he decides that they did enough fighting? When the vertexes stopped attacking? I didn't quite catch the initial part on the \"why\" he decided he could give them back all the costs that they paid, just because they exhausted themselves. (Also: Did all of the heroes get healed or just the main five? What about the girl in the hospital bed?) Like I said the ending is a wild mess.\\n\r\nYou get a happy ending, where the power of friendship makes everything alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall writing was okay, but sometimes really cheap. There where a lot of sad scenes that wanted to force you to feel something and a lot of subplots that felt abandoned halfway through. I felt like I got promised something very different than what I got in the end, which makes it very hard for me to rate this anime.\\n\r\nThe end felt really rushed and I just have to compare it to Madoka, because there are a lot of identical pictures, so it just feels like it wanted to try a different approach to the ending of Madoka, but fails miserably, because that's what caused the whole ending to be illogical within the universe of the series. We were shown a lot of hard stuff, like the girl in the hospital bed, the memories of Tougou and the fairies, but in the end Yuuki Yuuna wasn't able to keep the consistency of its world to deliver a great ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that really ticked me off was how they handled Tougous disability. When I started watching Yuuki Yuuna I was so happy about a character in a wheelchair, I was even more happy when it wasn't really addressed, but just accepted. The scene when Yuuna and Tougou meet was so sweet to watch and it made me really happy that Yuuna just didn't care about the wheelchair, she talked to Tougou without even mentioning the disability.\\n\r\nEven happier was I when Tougou got over her initial doubts and transformed as well and even in her magical form still had her disability. I squealed when I saw that they even took the time to design her suit of armor so it would counter her disability. I was so so happy, just until the end, when they decided to magically cure her and take away all of the good things they build before. In a group with five girls, is it too much to ask, that one of them could be disabled before Shinju chose her? Is it too much to ask, just not to heal her and have her be a good representation for the disabled community? Tougous character and her disability where handled really well, until the last episode. (Yes, I know, you will tell me that it makes sense, because Shinju healed everything they gave up for the sake of their powers, but that doesn't make it okay, to handle a disability with a magical cure.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I can't recommend this anime, because the poor storytelling and the all-over-the-place-plot, combined with the really illogical happy ending made it hard for me to enjoy it. The first few episodes where really good and I thought I would like this anime a lot, but I was wrong. The change of direction near the middle just didn't work for me, even though I really liked the dark themes and how bittersweet some things were, the ending just didn't work for me at all.",

            "content": "Yuna Yuki is a Hero is often referred to as a show like Puella Magi Madoka Magica. I went into this with an open mind and left disappointed.\r\nIt's a missed opportunity. I'd like to address that the ending is almost as bad and cliche as \"but I woke up and it was all a dream.\" The audience is robbed of any pathos. There are consequences in this show, but they don't matter at all because at the end of the day they're all hand waved away. Moreover, I think it needed at least a 26 episode run to fully explore what it was. This wouldhave helped the plot in a couple places with a \"show don't tell\" approach. Unfortunately, with the breakneck speed that the narrative has to take the audience is denied that as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also problems with the dialogue. There are several places where the characters refer to a \"level up\" for their magical girl powers. This is not one of those trapped in the virtual reality game shows either. That should have been edited to say a different thing as it's incredibly clumsy to say that in a magical girl show that has leanings towards slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also another caveat I have with magical girl shows. The battles aren't that interesting. The girls literally engage in curb stomping the poor things that want to destroy their world. I would take less battles in a show if they were better animated and the girls had to outwit their opponents or something of the sort. The stakes never seem high enough.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several plot twists in the show, and I think if it had a few changes and a longer run to really establish the setting, and characters, then this show would have been legendary.",

            "content": "This is my first review, just saying.\r\nAfter Madoka Magica, I tried watching more magical girl anime, similar or not, like SM crystal, Fate/Kaleid, and Magical girl raising project. Then, I heard about this one, so I gave it a try.\r\n At first, I wasn't impressed, but then I started to like it.\r\nThe story is good IMO. The \"dark\" element of being a magical girl (in this case, a Hero) is different from its (obvious) inspiration, Madoka Magica. The slice of life part wasn't bad, although it's like, 49% of the show. The pacing is not so great tho IMO. Their fight with the Vertexes felttoo short, and it focused a little but too much on slice of life, sometimes I just forgot it's a magical girl anime. The humor is not funny, but it's not really that much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, but nothing original. The animation is fine, although I didn't like the CGI for the Heroes in the first few episodes. Glad they got rid of it .The Vertexes being in CGI is not a problem for me tho. \\n\r\nAlso, why on Earth would you include fan service in a dark magical girl show with 14 years old girls ?! I liked all the transformation scenes, with the exception of Togo's, because during hers, the camera focused on her enormous chest, which was then grabbed by tentac- I mean ribbons I guess. We get it, Togo has a big chest. Why ?If it had nothing dark and focused mainly on comedy, I wouldn't mind it, but it is the worst idea they had when making this show.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes were boring. There was nothing exciting. And that's not because it's a magical girl show that the battles are not interesting. You have Madoka (Homura vs Mami ? Purely amazing), Magical girl rasing project, and Lyrical Nanoha who have great fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good, but it's not something really memorable IMO.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters, the bad part of the show. They are all uninspired and don't act like a human being at all, aside from Fu (I won't spoil anything but you're gonna know what I'm talking about). \\n\r\nYuuna is unrealistically always positive, her childish side is just annoying, and at times she is outright dumb. \\n\r\nTogo is literally the Homura of the show. Her motives, her personality, her main color (I'm aware that it's blue, but at some point it was violet), her haircut, guns, the fact that she discovers the truth and is one the MC's best friend, an episode focused on her and her backstory. And to add onto that, she is the closest character to being a Mary-sue (rich, pretty, smart)\\n\r\nItsuki is just that one sweet and innocent girl stereotype, although I don't really mind her.\\n\r\nFu is a nice girl tho. While the fact that she keeps talking about girl power is annoying, she is quite likable. Not to mention, [SPOILER ALERT] she is the only one who had a reason to go Mankai. [END OF SPOILER] \\n\r\nAnd of course, there HAD to be a tsundere. Twintails, red colored girl, and her attitude overall. Aside from that, I enjoyed the moments where Karin did not act like one.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the bad stuff, I enjoyed the show. This is not as good as most of the people say it is(better than PMMM ? It's your opinion, but YuYuYu is not even near as good as this), and not as horrible as some of the guys here say.\\n",

            "content": "So first thing; if you like the look of this show and you\u2019ve somehow managed to get this far without seeing any other information or reviews, stop reading this right now and go watch the first couple of episodes. If you like what you see, watch the rest.\r\n\u2026honestly that\u2019s my recommendation for pretty much any show (\u2026why do I write these again?), but in the case of Yuuki Yuuna, I\u2019d say it\u2019s all but mandatory to fully enjoy the experience. It\u2019s not so much that there are huge, earth-shattering twists or specific spoilers you\u2019d want to watch out for; it\u2019s more that the best thingabout the show in general is the way it builds atmosphere and tension episode-to-episode, engages in really well-executed shifts in tone and keeps you guessing right up to the end. I strongly suspect that having more of an idea of how things were going to turn out from the start would have poked some nasty holes in that for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe second reason not to read this review, is that it\u2019s virtually impossible to talk about Yuuki Yuuna without talking about the ending. Now I\u2019m not going to get into specifics and I\u2019ll go as spoiler-lite as possible, but for the reasons I\u2019ve already gone into regarding atmosphere and tension building, I really don\u2019t recommend knowing anything about the ending before you\u2019ve actually seen it. \\n\\n\r\n\u2026sure you don\u2019t want to go watch the show first? \\n\\n\r\nOkay.\\n\\n\r\nSo first of all, I enjoyed Yuki Yuuna a lot. As I mentioned in my disclaimer above, I think the way the series builds, maintains and manages tension throughout all twelve episodes is seriously impressive. It also juggles tone brilliantly; anime in general does a lot of genre hopping and personally I find that this can result in a kind of tonal whiplash that really pulls me out of the experience. YY is able to shift really smoothly from feather light Slice of Life comedy to surprisingly dark drama in a way that doesn\u2019t grind any narrative gears. \\n\\n\r\nI think one of the highlights of the show for me in that respect was episode 7 \u2018Idyllic Happiness\u2019. On the surface, it\u2019s a really stereotypical \u2018beach episode\u2019 with all the cliches that entails, but the whole thing is undercut with a subtle but ominous sense of melancholy and impending doom. Even though it\u2019s uneventful as far as flashy life-or-death battles are concerned, I was on the edge of my seat for the whole thing waiting for the other shoe to drop.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m also a real sucker for \u2018in medias res\u2019 starts and subtle world-building (\u00e0 la Dark Souls, to use a non-anime example), and I loved the way that was done here. We start off with what looks like modern day Japan, but through all twelve episodes we\u2019re provided with bits and pieces of background information that doesn\u2019t seem to add up. I imagine some people found the use of strange and unexplained, alien terminology by the characters frustrating, but I really enjoyed the gradually unfolding mystery of the setting. It culminates in a reveal of the true nature of that \u2018Earth\u2019 in the last couple of episodes that I found really quite shocking.\\n\\n\r\nSo what wasn\u2019t so good? Well, visually it\u2019s extremely derivative. Throughout the first few episodes, I was experiencing some serious deja vu; there\u2019s a LOT of Puella Magi Madoka Magica in YY\u2019s DNA, and about halfway through episode 2 I was seriously wondering if the whole thing was just going to be a bland pastiche. The transformations, the costumes, the unearthly beings the cast battle and the surreal alternate landscape that the battles take place on all feel a lot like a less abstract version of the equivalent scenes in Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nNow I don\u2019t actually think there\u2019s anything wrong with being derivative in principle, and I don\u2019t expect every bit of new media to be stunningly original, but Madoka WAS stunningly original and just\u2026well, stunning, and as such is not a show you want to invite visual comparisons to. \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly I had thought the plot was going to go the same way, but while there are certain parallels to be made, I think you could probably make a more direct comparison between Yuki Yuuna and Neon Genesis Evangelion than you could with Madoka, in spite of the superficial similarities. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the ending. If you\u2019ve been involved in any previous discussion of the show, you\u2019ll know that the ending is very much the elephant in the room, and is a bit of a make-or-break, love-or-hate moment for a lot of people. I\u2019m kind of in the middle, in that I really don\u2019t think the ending works, but it didn\u2019t kill the show in general for me. It\u2019s certainly the reason this is sitting at a 7 instead of a 9 though.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I\u2019m aiming to avoid specific spoilers wherever possible so I\u2019ll avoid specifics, but in general terms, YY has a happy ending and I don\u2019t like it. Or more accurately, I don\u2019t like the way that the happy ending is arrived at. \\n\\n\r\nThe show closes with a very literal Deus Ex Machina. Around episode 5, the ultimate, \u2018limit break\u2019 style powers wielded by the central cast are established as having an immediate and permanent physical consequence for each use. Consequence and sacrifice, both in the personal and religious sense are both major themes of the show, but these both seem to get thrown out the window in the last ten minutes of episode 12, and you\u2019re just left with a vague idea that the power of friendship/willpower has prevailed. Those seemingly permanent consequences for the main cast are removed in a way that violates the established rules of the fictional universe without adequate explanation as to how and why. Why were the sacrifices required in the first place if they could be so easily disregarded in the end? What, when you get right down to it, was the point of it all?\\n\\n\r\nIf you search for \u2018Yuki Yuuna ending theory\u2019 on google you\u2019ll find a number of reddit and blog posts that contain some quite interesting speculation that the ending might not be quite what it seems. Honestly, I think the possibility that those theories might be right actually annoys me more than the ending just being the cop-out it appears to be at face value, because if it\u2019s true then there was absolutely no reason to be that damned cryptic about it. I\u2019m not against open endings with a bit of mystery about them in general. Without going into any spoilers whatsoever, Code Geass has an ending that fans have been debating since the show ended - the key difference there is that the question raised at the very end of Code Geass doesn\u2019t actually have any impact in how the ending played out. The answer to that question doesn\u2019t make Code Geass a better or worse show or really change the meaning of the ending in any way whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nFor YY however, the possibility of the fan theory ending really turns the whole thing on its head, and would radically change the way that the themes and events of the preceding 12 episodes are framed. \u2026but there\u2019s just not enough information provided by the script itself to say one way or the other. I see extremely convincing fan theories backed up by all sorts of evidence torpedoed by the original author or later sequels all the time, so for now I\u2019m forced to take the ending of Yuki Yuuna at face value; a kind of disappointing and tepid finale to an otherwise very enjoyable show\\n\\n\r\n(As a quick aside; although the Mahou Shoujo elements of YY are now all over pretty much every piece of promotional material and preview that might draw you into watching this, it looks very much like this originally aired as a complete bait and switch, presenting itself as a run-of-the-mill \u2018Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\u2019 after-school club based slice of life. I\u2019m not sure if this was intentional on the part of the creators or if it was just a matter of the preview stuff being poorly translated for the english-speaking audience, but either way I think that\u2019s fantastic, and I wish I saw this first time around to experience that.)",

            "content": "Warning: spoilers ahead\r\nWhen I was first introduced to Yuuki Yuuna, I went in expecting darkness. I went in expecting tragedy. I went in expecting suffering little school girls. So I was therefore unsurprised when horrible things started happening to the characters. \u201cOkay\u201d, I thought, \u201cI can enjoy this\u201d. And I did, very much. However, there were flaws that I noticed and simply can\u2019t ignore. \r\nPlot: 6.5/10\r\nAs great as this anime is, there are things it definitely got wrong, and one of those was pacing. I don\u2019t mind slice of life elements mixed in with my tragic story lines of suffering little girls. Gakkou Gurashi isa perfect example of an anime that balances both slice of life elements and horror/tragedy elements without killing the pacing. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about this anime. There are times when the slice of life just shows up seemingly out of nowhere, such as episode 5 when they go to find a home for a cat. It just kills the pacing. The twists in this story are great, with things slowly being revealed over time rather than all at once. You don\u2019t learn everything about the world and about the hero system until the very end of the anime, which is something I like a lot. And let\u2019s just talk for a moment about the mankai. The idea that magical girls suffer and pay for their actions is nothing new. We\u2019ve seen it before. But this anime takes it to a whole new level, with heroes gaining disabilities every time they go mankai, eventually losing all functions of their body and turning into logs. It\u2019s an idea I haven\u2019t seen before and it\u2019s so great. The author is so cruel to his characters though. I can imagine him sitting in front of his computer planning out the story and saying \u201chmmm should they die or turn into vertexes when they use their powers. No, I have a better idea. Let\u2019s give them disabilities instead lol.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNow you may be asking \u201cif you loved the plot so much, why does it only get a 6.5/10?\u201d The answer is the ending. Rarely do you come across an anime with an ending as lazy as Yuuki Yuuna\u2019s. Basically, they all get better in the end. Now, this is not horrible in and of itself. I\u2019ve had happy endings to tragic stories before that I loved. Higurashi is a fine example of a happy ending done right. However, this anime\u2019s happy ending comes out of nowhere, makes no sense, and contradicts everything that has been said thus far. All the drama, all the urgency, all the pain and suffering these characters went through in order to save the world, all of it meant nothing at all. Suffering and sacrificing for the sake of the world is fantastic. It\u2019s a great idea. Here are these heroes at the end of episode 4, helpless, having lost everything, but knowing it was for the sake of saving the world and the people in it. But then the writers were like lolnope. This is borderline Angel Beats levels of bad, with events taking place that had no impact on the plot whatsoever. There\u2019s so many problems with this ending I don\u2019t know where to begin. First of all, why did they get better? Like, why them? There were countless heroes before them, based on what I heard. Why did none of them get better? And don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because none of them tried to rebel against the system before. If there really were a ton of heroes before them, wouldn\u2019t at least one of them have the same idea Togo did? Second, why did only Yuuna not get better? She was in a magic coma for a while. That was another thing I had an issue with. What the hell is up with this coma. I mean, ignoring the question of why the hell she\u2019s even allowed out of the hospital, since it\u2019s against hospital regulations for her to be allowed out, why does she come back? She just all of a sudden comes back from the coma grave and says \u201cTogo\u2026 I heard your voice\u2026\u201d Um, excuse me, what? That isn\u2019t how a coma works. You cannot hear people. You cannot see. You cannot do literally anything. But apparently this is like some kind of magic coma where you can hear people and can come back to life because you heard your friend\u2019s voice. I\u2019m beginning to think they hired guest writer Jun Maeda to write this ending for them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nI know I say this a lot in my reviews, but I really want to give this a higher score. I wish I could give the characters a 9/10, but I can\u2019t for a few reasons. First of all, they don\u2019t really develop that much. I mean, if you asked me to name everything I knew about Fuu, I\u2019d tell you she was a leader and she loved her younger sister. But that\u2019s true at the beginning of the series and that\u2019s true at the end of the series. Yuuna also doesn\u2019t change or develop. She\u2019s the Genki Girl who fights for love and justice to protect her precious friends. Itsuki is pretty much a prop from start to finish with nothing interesting about her other than she likes to sing, used to develop Fuu. However, despite these flaws, the way the characters interacted was beautiful as well as their reactions to the others\u2019 problems. Episode 9 illustrates this very well with Fuu\u2019s reaction to her sister\u2019s inability to sing for the music group she wanted to. She completely breaks down, drowning in grief and guilt at the knowledge that it\u2019s her fault her sister had this happen to her. I mean ffs, the episode is literally titled\u201cThose Who Know Grief\u201d. Every interaction between the characters feels meaningful, even if the scenes they are in don\u2019t. They establish relationships and reinforce bonds, especially with Karen. She is far and away the most developed character in the show. The person she started out as and the person she became between episodes 3 and 11 are almost as different as pre-mercy kill Homura and post-mercy kill Homura. She goes from being an introverted tsundere with no friends to being comfortable with these girls and seeing them as friends, people she\u2019s willing to sacrifice parts of her body for. Seriously episode 11 was one of the most emotional episodes for me, since I love Karen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nThe character designs were gorgeous and the surreal look of the dimension where they fight the vertexes looks great, although there may be people who argue with me on that. The mix between traditional animation and CG was noticeable but not distractingly so. It was pleasant to look at, and that\u2019s really all I look for when it comes to art in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music in this show is amazing, reminding me a lot of Madoka music. The exciting parts are made even more hype by the bad ass choir in the background. The sad parts are made even sadder by the music. It\u2019s one of those soundtracks that I can just put on and listen to all day. It\u2019s music that I can hear and be like \u201cOh, that\u2019s Yuuki Yuuna music\u201d. Also worth a mention is the series\u2019s opening song. Seriously, I could listen to that shit all day long. So relaxing. It reminds me a lot of the second opening to Higurashi. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime had the potential to be great. It had fantastic ideas. It had a good opening, lulling us into that false sense of security. However, the characters are underdeveloped and the pacing is broken by the slice of life that\u2019s put into the middle of it seemingly for no reason. Like, honestly, what did that cat scene accomplish? The real killer, however, was the ending. It was a lazy cop out that served no purpose than to give us a happy ending. There was a comment I read about it once that sums is up perfectly: \u201cbehold, the hardest, most cynical downer ending ever written, ruined by Deus Ex Machina.\u201d You know with the underdeveloped characters and poor ending, you\u2019d almost think this was written by the same writer as school days\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOh wait\u2026",

            "content": "Time and time again, I have heard this anime compared to the amazing Madoka Magica. I wasn't expecting much from this anime, but even then I was disappointed. This is my first review, and it will be spoiler free!\r\nSTORY: 7/10. Good. Basically your average magical girl plot formula, so don't expect much there. The first 6 episodes are basically just filler, and nothing happens until the last few episodes, where the show decides it wants to be all grimdark like Madoka.\r\nART: 7/10. Good. The areas are colorful and the character designs are cute, but they don't stand out much.\r\nSOUND: 6/10. Fine. There was one songthat stuck out. The opening and ending are nothing special. The music, however, fits the show pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 3/10. Poor. This is the area I was most disappointed. Before watching, I had heard that this show was character driven rather than plot driven, and I hoped that I would see great character development and growth. However, the characters are not only cliche and typical, but they are complete rip-offs of Madoka Magica characters, right down to the color scheme. Fu is obviously a rip-off of Mami, Togo is exactly like Homura, and Yuna is a carbon copy of Madoka. Even Karin took some inspiration from Kyouko. The only character that didn't feel like a PMMM clone was Itsuki, but she isn't anything special herself. The only saving grace are the decent interactions between the characters during the last few episodes, but they don't do the show much, because they are quite cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 5/10. There is a beach and hot springs episode, and there is enough fanservice for those who are into that. Like I said earlier, half of the anime is filler so if you like that then you may like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4/10. Sorry, but everything about this anime is average, even for a magical girl anime. Nothing really stands out, it's all been done before, and the entire time I watched this, I was plagued by the fact that it clearly rips off PMMM.",

            "content": "I overlooked Yuuki Yuuna, henceforth referred to as Yuyuyu for the sake of typing speed, while it was airing. That's a standard cutesy looking show, I thought as I clicked past in favour of something with more substance. All magical girls and fluff with no real meaning. Not what I'm looking for in a show. \r\nI'm glad I came back to it. And now, a warning. To those of you looking for cute girls doing cute things with magic, turn away now. Close this tab, this window, and continue living your normal life as if you had never seen these words I am currently typing.ABORT. ABANDON SHIP. THIS IS NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN OR THE FAINT OF HEART. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE PUNCHED REPEATEDLY IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU FEEL PAIN BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING, LEAVE NOW. LEAVE WHILE YOU STILL CAN.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou're still there? Okay.\\n\r\nSo on the level of the technical things, the art is very nice, use of thematic motifs throughout, some really nice watercolours; sound is unobtrusive (in other words, I didn't pay attention to it).\\n\\n\r\nNarrative. The thing I do pay attention to.\\n\r\nOn a character level, everyone is very fleshed out, there is depth beyond the surface-level trope personalities applied to each girl. You learn more about them as the series progresses, as you would expect to. \\n\r\nThe pacing is very purposeful, I thought. The slow episodes, the fast paced fights, the gripping-tightly-to-the-edge-of-your-chair-moments, they all felt like pieces of a larger and well-thought out puzzle that made use of your expectations and played with them in ways you might not expect. The narrative is not your standard Saturday-morning-shoujo fare. \"That throw-away line halfway through that ended up having a deeper meaning at the end? I meant to do that,\" it says with a wink as it walks away into the sunset with a confident swagger in its step.\\n\r\nThe thematic material explored isn't something I've seen before, either. I was pleasantly surprised at the direction it decided to take.\\n\\n\r\nTo make a long story short, I really enjoyed Yuyuyu. It is a show about heroes, yes, but also what happens to those heroes when the fighting is over. It is quite the show, Yuyuyu. Not the show I was expecting, but better because of it. If you enjoyed Madoka, you will enjoy this. I suppose that is as good a recommendation as any. You will enjoy the time you spend in this little world, at this short fragment of time, with these small people. It will be time well spent.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru, also known as Yuki Yuna is a Hero, and also known as YuYuYu, truly is the Neon Genesis Evangelion of the Madoka genre. As we all know, magical girl anime were all very fun and cute happy sunshine and rainbows until one man called Gen Urobuchi changed the whole game and our perspective of the world as we know it with his innovative masterpiece, Princess Madoka the Revolutionary Girl, a magical girl show that came along and showed us that magical girls can actually suffer and have psychological problems, something that was absolutely unheard of in all the historyof the world until that point. Unfortunately, for every flawless work of art such as Madoka, there's always those crappy ripoffs that try to cash in on the success, and Mahou Shoujo Yuuna Magica right here is one of these disgusting Walmart copies of Hugo Butch's masterwork, from none other than Takahiro (Akame ga Kill) and Seiji Kishi (Angel Beats) of all people. The shame! How dare they rip off Madoka like that? No matter how hard you try, you will never ever make a dark magical girl show as good as Madoka because Madolka was the show that INVENTED dark magical girls, you bastards!\\n\\n\r\nNow that I said what people wanted to read, it's time to actually start talking about Yuuki Yuuna is a Brave Man. To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect from this series at first, I originally ignored it because people were going on about how it's basically a Madoka ripoff that's nowhere near as good as the original, and I already think Madoka was disappointing on its own, so I sure as hell wouldn't watch a show people seemed to agree it's supposedly an inferior version. That is until I watched Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, another show people labeled as a shitty Madoka ripoff for being a \"mahou shoujo\" series with a dark twist, and to my own surprise, I actually enjoyed that one quite a bit, so I figured I should give YuYuYu a fair chance to prove itself to me the same way Ikusei Keikaku did. YuYuYu is a little beefier as a franchise, though, it has a bunch of Light Novels I'll probably never read because I'm a lazy bastard like that, but in the matter of anime it's divided between the first season, which is the one I'm reviewing right here, a prequel called Washio Sumi's Chapter, and the second season, Hero's Chapter, both of them released last year. Why the hell did I choose YuYuYu to write my first review on MAL about? Well, I finished watched its prequel and sequel recently, and it's a series I find interesting enough to write a text about.\\n\\n\r\nOur heroes (yeah, they're literally called heroes here instead of magical girls) are middle school girls who live in the japanese island of Shikoku, the island has a semi-theocratic society ruled by the Taisha, an organization of people who worship a divine tree called Shinju-sama, who basically acts like the Shinto gods in this world and has been protecting and ensuring the prosperity of Shikoku for centuries. However, Shinju has some enemies who want it dead, so it has chosen a bunch of girls to bestow them its power through some weird-ass mobile app, that way they can turn into heroes and fight off the mysterious creatures who want to destroy Shinju, the Vertex, in order to keep the world from ending. The titular character and protagonist, Yuuki Yuuna, along with her friends who are all members of the school's Hero Club, have all sorts of fun times during their daily lives, but they also have to fight as heroes in order to keep this daily life protected at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nMiddle school girls who become mahou shoujo to fight evil creatures in some alternate dimension thing is nothing we haven't already seen before, but YuYuYu does have a handful of quirks to help this tired concept feel somewhat special. There's a religious undertone to this series, but it's based on actual japanese religion instead of taking Christianity and turning it into some fancy magical stuff like anime is usually known for doing, but you don't really need to have knowledge about shinto to understand how things work here because most of it is explained quite decently on the series itself, there's even a perfectly acceptable explanation as to why Shinju only chooses underaged girls to fight for it, and it's not because their god a lolicon or anything like that. As for the actual fights against the Vertex, they happen in an alternate layer of reality where Shinju resides, and one cool thing about it is that the damage they deal to Shinju's outlines in this dimension causes disasters to happen in the real world, so it's on their best interests to not allow the Vertex to wreck too much shit up while trying to defeat them. Anything else I could say about this setting and its system would be entering into spoiler territory, and you wouldn't want spoilers for YuYuYu, as the plot twists that happen through the second half of the series as it starts to get darker are by far the most memorable moments here.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's talk about the characters for a bit here. Yuuna herself is basically the very definition of an energetic anime middle scool girl: Optimistic, playful, loves to eat snacks and hang out with her friends from the Hero Club. Unfortunately, as far as this season goes, Yuuna's character doesn't really get much more depth than this, so she may come off as bland to some people, even though this show has its fair share of episodes dedicated to slice of life and developing the girls, Yuuna is the character who seems to change the least here. I don't think she's a bad character, in fact I find her to be quite likeable in spite of being a little one-dimensional. The president of the Hero Club, Inubozaki Fuu, and her little sister Itsuki, are respectively the goofy-ish leader and the shy moeblob of the group, the wheelchair-bound Togo Mimori is the \"rational\" one, and at last but not least, they get joined later by Miyoshi Karin, who is obviously a tsundere. These descriptions of the main characters might give you the impression that YuYuYu is a very tropey show with girls who are nothing more than cookie-cutter archetypes, but the slice of life episodes really help the relationship between all of them to develop significantly, they all have interesting dynamics. Even Karin, the goddamn tsundere character I usually hate in these shows, was entertaining to watch because she isn't taken very seriously by the other girls while she's initially a self-absorbed bitch, and she develops quite well to the point of becoming my third favorite character from this show. During the first half, we see Karin and Itsuki getting some character arcs based on difficulties they have in their daily lives, Itsuki doesn't want to stay behind her big sis and live in her shadow, instead she wants to be Fuu's equal and has to get over her shyness as a first step to do that, while Karin, being a girl who was pretty much raised for the sole purpose of fighting as a hero, was never very good at interacting with other people and forming bonds, although I wish her background was more explored, the way she changes through the course of the series is really heartwarming. Fuu and Togo start to get more development in the second half of the series, after things have gotten darker, but they don't disappoint on that front either.\\n\\n\r\nThat makes the slice of life episodes just as important as the ones where the girls fight the Vertex, we see them growing up as people and fighting to not let that growth be in vain. Although you could argue some of their development is predictable, it still feels quite natural because of how believable and well-written the bond between these characters is, this show does a fantastic job at making me care about Yuuna and her friends, which in turn makes the darker half of the series feel a lot heavier to me compared to Madoka treating most of its characters as glorified plot devices and hoping that I feel sorry for them because they're cute-looking girls. Granted, YuYuYu doesn't do that flawlessly, episode 7 in particular could have been removed and it would make little difference in the grand scheme of things, it's a little fanservicey and doesn't really advance the story all that much, although I compliment them for succeeding at presenting an ominous tone even though the episode is mostly about Yuuna and her friends having fun. I also think this show is severely lacking in the side character department, there's barely any here, and that makes the world they live in and fight to protect feel slightly boring. But hey, at least there aren't any annoying side characters either, so it could have been worse. There's the ending, which everyone has already complained about and I agree with most of the complaints, but since this has a sequel, and said sequel pretty much fixes the underwhelming ending the first season had, then I don't think I have too much to complain about this anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, YuYuYu is very good, if a bit inconsistent. Some of the fights are fuild and well animated, while others not so much and they have to use some 3D CGI models that look a bit jarring in transition, but for the most part it's perfectly fine, the art and character designs are solid and Shinju's dimension is just beautiful to look at with its vibrant colors. The music is composed by the MONACA team, known for their work on NieR, and it really shows, YuYuYu's soundtrack is nothing short of brilliant, especially the music accompanying the action scenes, which would not sound out of place at all in a NieR boss fight or something. Some of the music is forgettable, but I think the hits more than make up for the stock music, and the voice acting is also top-notch. Few people know it, but YuYuYu was Tomoyo Kurosawa's breakthrough as a voice actress, her performance as Itsuki here is what ultimately led her to becoming well-known in Japan and getting cast for roles such as Oumae Kumiko (Hibike Euphonium) and Akagi Miria (The Idolm@ster) to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show I picked up with extremely low expectations, YuYuYu turned out to be very enjoyable with its great main characters, unique setting, stellar soundtrack and well-executed plot twists. Its story may stumble on some areas, but the highlights definitely make up for those missteps, and most importantly, it does its own thing with the \"dark twist\" it injects into the magical girl formula, this series does not actually try to be Madoka like some people claim. Was it inspired by Madoka? Possibly, but that still doesn't warrant the \"ripoff\" label when it does things so differently and has a message that's arguably the opposite of what Madoka goes for. Regardless of that, YuYuYu is a good show that could have been actually great if it handled certain story elements better, but I felt satisfied with how it turned out anyway, you can't go wrong with this if you enjoy slice of life and darker mahou shoujo.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero combines the \u201ctragical girls\u201d approach that became popular in Madoka\u2019s wake with traditional slice-of-life elements, resulting in a mix that feels too mismatched to be great but shines at times and is entertaining enough to watch again.\r\nThe title \u201cYuuki Yuuna Is a Hero\u201d is at once appropriate, since this is most of what constitutes Yuuna\u2019s personality, and misleading, since it suggests that Yuuna is the driving force of the show.  I can see the intent to make her the chief protagonist among these five Heroes, but in practice, she does not possess the means to carry the narrative.I don\u2019t dislike Yuuna by any means \u2013 she\u2019s chipper and sweet and unflaggingly positive in that special anime way \u2013 but she never seems to change.  You can predict how she will act in every scene and react to every event.  All of the substantive developments come from Togo, Fuu, Nogi, or some inanimate factor, leaving Yuuna herself as a bystander or companion whose primary point of interest is her friendship with Togo.\\n\\n\r\nThe true protagonist of this show is Fuu.  Fuu brings with her credible motivations, emotional turmoil, and a more interesting character altogether, from her design to her portrayal to her role in the story.  I do love the title Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru because of the assonance and the fact that it can be abbreviated as YuYuYu, but this show really should have been called Fuu Inubouzaki Is a Hero.  Fuu displays identifiable flaws and has a compelling arc behind her, making her perfect subject material.  Togo is an easy runner-up for the same reasons, and even Itsuki would have made for a more believable and relatable lead.  Fuu and Togo are functionally the main characters; the only reason this is even worth debating is that the name of the series insists on showcasing Yuuki Yuuna for reasons that aren\u2019t clear.  It would be like if the main character of Harry Potter were Ron Weasley.\\n\\n\r\nThe twist is suitably dark, even leading to some genuinely distressing scenes later on, and the unexpectedly mythic spin lingers powerfully after the conclusion; YuYuYu could capitalize on these elements, having the thematic and visual framework to become a much more stylized show, but it chooses not to pursue this path to its jarring end.  YuYuYu is a much calmer, brighter show than that; despite its sinister undercurrent, this is still half slice-of-life, and the upbeat, comical, and easygoing personalities and plot points often serve to pull the show away from its morbid fascinations.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s bright face serves it well sometimes and other times undercuts the larger narrative.  Some amount of normality is necessary in order to give weight to the tragedy, but the darker side of the show could function much more effectively without this level of contrast.  Coupled with the ham-fisted delivery of certain scenes, the show can feel a bit shallow.  In a lot of areas, YuYuYu doesn\u2019t commit itself fully, whether it\u2019s fostering emotional depth or crafting a unique aesthetic.  The visuals and soundtrack both have strong creative elements, but interspersed with long stretches of blandness that prevent the show from reaching a personal, recognizable look and feel.  What makes YuYuYu disappointing is that it could go the extra mile to be dedicated wholly to one strange aesthetic and could be a deeper, more challenging story, but it shies away from this.  If YuYuYu were entirely a shallow show watchable only at face value, I\u2019d still probably enjoy it and maybe even score it about the same, but there are hints that it could be more.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s ending is a gentle contrivance, forgivable because it basically suits the tone of the show and by that time asking for anything more would be an unnecessary risk.  As the delicate, airy OP indicates, YuYuYu has an innocent charm that often powers through the show\u2019s failings.  It\u2019s nothing groundbreaking, nothing especially exciting, but I felt justified in watching it a second time and enjoyed it to a similar degree as the first time around, so I would consider it worth the expenditure.\\n",

A group of girls are chosen by some powerful force to save their world from otherworldly monsters. On the way they are met with problems outside of their magical girl lives and inside them. In the end they face some form of big bad and the stakes are high. \r\n   The execution of this story is pretty great. You get to know the characters pretty well. There are somethings you don't get to know but, these are things that should be left ominous. Characters gothrough there conflict and for the most part is done well, a little rushed but that's expected for 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\n   It's cutesy moe girl art for the characters. Nothing much to say about that. You either like the way the characters are drawn or not.\\n\r\n  The monsters if you want to call them that are a different story. They are most certainly interesting. I don't know if I'm down... but they are done well.\\n\r\n  Backgrounds are another story. Beautiful colors. Beautiful scenery. \\n\r\n  There is also some CG. Most people have mixed feelings towards CG. You can see it here. Is it bad? I don't know. It's not the worst.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n   I'm not a music guy. I liked it. It got the job done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\r\n   I like these girls. We got our star Yuki Yuna the kind hero who will do whats right for not only her but for everyone. Itsuki our shy worm on a hook who lives in the shadow of our older sister Fuu, the leader of the group. Tougou our militaristic and hesitant to do as the big leader says. Finally, Karin our hot headed hero who is ready for a fight.\\n\r\n  The characters do a bit of growing. It's pretty generic but it's done well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n   I was glued to my seat whenever I watched this. It looks good, it sounds good, and its fun. I'm not the biggest magical girl guy but I say give it a watch.",

My favorite anime of all time?\"\r\n\"No, I'm referring to \"Yuki Yuna\".\"\r\n\"Hmmm....HMMMMMM....HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...\"\r\nOk, all joking aside, I'm not going to cast my eyes away and ignore the similarities between \"Madoka Magica\" and \"Yuki Yuna\". I'm also not going to be the one who wipes Cheetodust on my jeans and says that \"Yuki Yuna\" is a rip-off of \"Madoka Magica\". Despite the similarities, \"Yuki Yuna\" is still able to be its own thing. \\n\\n\r\nYeah, I liked this show. I was into it. I really loved the animation and I legitimately felt the friendships between the girls in the Hero Club. I also thought the voice acting was well done, including the English dub. The slice of life elements were there, but the drama moments were excellent. It hit its notes just right.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show lost some points for one aspect: nothing is lost.\\n\\n\r\nThis might get a bit spoiler-ish, but I'll do my best to not outright say what happens. In \"Madoka Magica\", the characters gain things by losing. And while the ending was very bittersweet but leaning more towards the happier side, sacrifices were still made. \\n\\n\r\nIn \"Yuki Yuna\", sacrifices are made, but they don't really matter. Things return to how they were, and it almost seems pointless to have them lose anything if things return to how they were before, and they don't really gain anything, either. \\n\\n\r\nNo matter, because I did enjoy the show. It had its hiccups, but I could look past most of them. I really hope this a series that gets continued into spin-offs or sequels and whatnot.",

            "content": "What happens when you take Madoka and replace the story with SOL moe~? The creators of Yuuki Yuuna felt the need to let us know. Let me get one thing straight: This isn't really a bad show. If SOL and cute girls but weak plot is your thing, you might actually enjoy Yuuki Yuuna. Hell if you think shows like Non Non Biyori deserve a golden statue in the anime hall of fame, and you like magical girls, you might even absolutely love this show. If that kind of anime isn't your thing, then this review is here to warn you that you probably wonthave fun here. \\n\\n\r\n Yuuki Yuuna does actually have a story and some decent character interactions, the problem is a lot of it just honestly isn't very good. Just not quite enough to escape the \"plotless moe\" label. A lot of the lines are your typical \"I will protect the ones important to me!\" MAMORUUUUUUUU!!! The sort of contrived deal that has become more and more stale over the years. Some of the conversations the girls have with each other are also amazingly boring. The writing just doesn't give you enough to care. The suffering feels thrown in to be there for the sake of making the show appear to have more depth than it actually has.\\n\\n\r\nA big problem that makes Yuuki Yuuna so meh-tier is for most of the story the bad guys appear as nothing more than evil monsters with zero personality out to destroy the world for the sake of being evil monsters. This part of the plot is eventually redeemed and the shows story does eventually become better. But by eventually I mean the very last couple of episodes. If I were to break this review down by episode, the initial episodes are a 2/10 and the last two are 8/10. I came very very close to dropping Yuuki Yuuna many times. I'm somewhat glad that I didn't, but the problem still lies there. A good anime should get its story rolling by the third episode, not the last minute. \\n\\n\r\nSo this then brings up the question: Does a decent end justify the other 80% of a show being a mediocre ripoff ? Not enough to justify giving it higher than an average rating. This has been repeated many times, but I will say it again because it's the simple reality: Yuuki Yuuna really is just a mediocre Madoka clone. It isn't good. It isn't bad. It just is. \\n\\n",

            "content": "YUKI YUNA IS A HERO is kind of a low-rent madoka magica. this isn't completely a bad thing, because there's a few things this show does better and even things that madoka straight up just doesn't do, but that inspiration echoes throughout the entirety of this show in a way that made it hard to take seriously. \r\nYUKI YUNA is a similar \"deconstruction\" (using the term very. very. very loosely. VERY loose) of mahou shoujo wherein girls pay a steep price for their magical status. in this show, that exploration of genre is used as the center for larger themes of SACRIFICE and FATE, butit feels borderline.... exploitative. manipulative, even. don't get me wrong, i like plot twists, i love tone shifts, but here, it feels as if the theme wasn't thought through, wasn't properly threaded throughout the story. where madoka kicks itself into gear pretty quickly, leaving a lot more room to develop and extrapolate, yuki yuna seems to wander for a bit before KNEEJERKING into nihilism and \"edgy territory\" around episode 8. \\n\\n\r\nthis is where most of my problems come in, because. the first two episodes have a dark cloud looming over them, with some nice foreshadowing, but then i was really pleased to see it NOT go all the way overboard. instead it really slows down and stretches itself out. there aren't even vertex fights for a lot of the show's run, in fact a lot of it is bordering on slice of life. and, i REALLY like this cast. yuna is the glue that holds everything together and she's extremely likeable as the hyperoptimist, but togo and karin steal the show for me - karin as being (for a while) a fun take on a mami tomoe/kyouko sakura-type role (extremely athletic, health food nut) and togo as being really great disabled rep in a genre that more or less uses disability as a central character conflict and not just an attribute. but of COURSE when the show takes the nosedive it (not so subtley) wants to, it feels like character is hurled out the window. sure, yuna is still yuna, but everyone else just loses all their personality to become \"crying girl\". and not only this, but the show gets very bleak. EXTREMELY bleak. HEAVILY nihilistic. it's. very frustrating. sure, there's some more twists and things work themselves out by the last episode but it's hard to ignore or forget all the weird, almost unwarranted amounts of suffering this show pushes you through.\\n\\n\r\nand for this reason it's really hard to recommend it. the show wants you to go in blind but i can't envision someone coming out the other end excited about what they just watched. to sit through 5 episodes of a pretty upbeat slice of life anime and suddenly watch characters be horribly injured, depressed, suicidal, and worse, to have the tone just SUDDENLY CHANGE LIKE A LIGHTSWITCH, it just. hmmm. i don't know. this probably won't be a madoka for a new generation. \\n\\n\r\nthat all being said, it isn't that bad. like i said, all the characters are likeable. the mythology of it all is interesting. the themes, even though they only rear their head in the LAST SECOND, they do a few pretty neat things with them. but, eeeeeeehhhhh. i think i'm tired of MAHOU SHOUJO BUT F*CKED UP. and i do really feel bad for anyone looking for just a cute magical girl show having to sift through piles and piles of \"girls crying\" shows. i don't know.\\n\\n\r\noverall, all i gotta say is.... men ruined magical girl shows. thank you. no, you don't have to respond",

            "content": "This magical girl anime is yet another dark magical girl anime that has been influenced by Madoka Magica. There are some similarities between this anime and Madoka, but to me that wasn't a bad thing. It was because I liked Madoka Magica and magical girl anime in genre that I decided to watch this.\r\nThe first aspect of this anime that I enjoyed was the animation. It is like Hayao Miyazaki meets the watercolor artwork of Syu (who did the artwork for Nujabes album Metaphorical Music). It is beautiful and there were times I wanted certain images as my laptop wallpaper.\r\nThe next aspect of this animeI enjoyed were the magical girl transformations and abilities. This is one of the things that reminded me of Madoka, but I actually like some of these girls abilities better than the Madoka ones. One girl has super-powered fists that can do \"Falcon Punches\", one girl has a large sword, one girl has vines, one girl has a pair of katanas, and one girl has a sniping rifle. Each girl has a basic form and then a \"Mankai\" form that is like a leveled up version of their original powers. The Mankai forms are basically run by \"nakama power\", but one girl gets her Mankai form in such a touching and kick-ass way that makes this less cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the third thing I enjoyed. While three of them are reminiscent of Madoka Magica characters, all of them have genuinely care for each other as friends and get development that makes them sympathetic. My favorites included the siblings Fu and Itsuki, Togo, and Karin. Togo in particular, was enjoyable because she was a less crazy version of Homura from Madoka Magica. I also liked that even though she is a wheelchair and can't walk, she could still be a magical girl without having her disability magicked away. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the fourth and fifth things, they are the soundtrack and the plot. The soundtrack is nice, particularly during the girls' transformation sequences and certain battles. The plot  has some nice symbolism involving flowers, a dark and interesting take on gods and sacrifices to them,  nice behind-the-scenes commentary through \"a hero's play\", and a happier ending than that of Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nWith all the good aspects, you'd think I'd consider this a masterpiece. However, I feel like there is one small loose end involving a certain secondary character that prevents it from being so. Nontheless, this might be the best post-Madoka Magica magical girl anime out there and I may rewatch it (and Madoka) again sometime. \\n\\n",

This is thrown out as some kind of fact, but actually nobody questions why she would try and kill herself. What's her personal motivation? If she was doing it solely as an experiment, does she value her life so little? Why do none of the other heroes who she informs of this seemingly not care, at all? Her suicide attempt is NEVER MENTIONED as an \"Oh no, Mimori, why would you do that? Please don't do that, we care about you.\" WHY?This is a massive plot hole.\\n\\n\r\n2. Mimori breaks the barrier. This in itself is fine, but the fact she does a complete 180 and nobody gives her a hard time for it? She essentially betrayed the entire world to save her friends, yet she so easily flicks back to wanting to protect it again? This is the same character that attempted suicide 10 different ways to test a thesis. Is she so feeble-minded that she would not try to convince her allies she is right, and not even really fight against their goal?\\n\\n\r\nThose are the two huge issues I see with the plot of this show. Additionally, the Taichi and the Shinju-Sama are never really explained. There's a little bit of explanation thrown in about them right at the end of the show but the world-building is cruelly lacking, especially when you have a character there (Mimori) who is obsessed with history and was seemingly placed solely to give exposition. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show but I didn't think it was particularly strong.",

            "content": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu) is a show that clearly was born in the shadow of a fairly famous and acclaimed work, Madoka Magica.  The real question is if it manages to move out of that shadow and if so, how.  Personally, I think it does manage to at least find a niche, even if it never truly stands on its own, but I suspect that other viewers will have differing opinions on the matter.\r\nStory\r\nThe story of YuYuYu is fairly simple; it has two movements to it, basically held together by some admittedly good slice of life.  While the showdoes hesitatingly approach some complex issues, it never quite owns up to the difficult questions it raises and takes a stand, or even requests the viewer to do so.  Watchmen, \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\", and YuYuYu all ask a similar core question, but while Alan Moore and Ursula LeGuin do leave it to interpretation what is the right course of action, YuYuYu decides to cast the idea aside and not force anyone to choose.  It takes a safe route throughout its story, approaching topics that could be great if addressed well and then waving at those themes as they pass by.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we do get is pleasant and dramatic in the right places, but it never quite reaches greatness; in the end, it's average and best\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nYuYuYu looks nice, I grant it that, but it's never really ambitious or creative.  The character designs seem fairly standard, and while the Shinju-sama's barrier is a fairly gorgeous battleground with a distinctive style, it's also very static.  This is a show that invites constant comparisons to Madoka, and... here it really doesn't live up.  Every Witch and Labyrinth had its own style, a unique phantasmagorical wonderland teeming with symbolism and weirdly surreal and abstract artistry.  The Shinju-sama provides a floral world of twining roots in pastel watercolor, that has a strong theme for wide shots but isn't quite as great with closeups.\\n\\n\r\nThe enemies, the Vertex, are a little more creative, but they rely heavily on very angular, geometric designs with just a few organic elements.  There wasn't no effort put into them, but they don't move a whole lot nor do they, despite having unique appearances, really have much character to them.  Again, I have to compare YuYuYu to Madoka, and YuYuYu falls short: while neither Witches nor Vertex really communicate nor function as characters rather than monsters, the Witches had looks and themes that reflected something, and their movements (or lack thereof) supported them being independently memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the art is solid on its own, and if I'm not comparing it to anything it's not without flaws, but it's good.  The 'real world' environments are especially nice, and I do like how the show keeps a warm, pale palette for its entire world.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis is where YuYuYu actually trips up.  The music is good, and the opening (for me at least) weirdly catchy, but the voice acting is... OK.  And that's about all I can say about it.  The show is at its strongest when the characters are just talking, potentially in an emotionally charged manner, and weakest when they're screaming, shouting, or crying.  The problem with that is they scream, shout, or cry a lot.  I don't exactly blame the voice actresses for this; as much as I actually enjoyed the fairly cheesy scenes where a character shouts some (or all) of the Hero Club Five Tenets in battle, it can't be easy to deliver those lines with conviction.  And like I said, I liked the theme, I just wish that we had more moments at a 7-8/10 intensity rather than jumping so quickly to 10/10 where things start to break down a little.  On another minor note, some of the sound effects get a little repetitive.  Again, it's got to be hard to do the mixing here, because there are only so many \"slash\" and \"shine\" effects in your library, but I feel like they could have been a little stronger if they were a little more dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOne of the places where YuYuYu shines is the character  To be clear, it doesn't shine that brightly, but it does work out.  Fuu, and to a lesser extent Togo, are very dimensional characters with strong goals who we get to see both at their high points and their low points, letting us get a solid feel for their range.  Togo's arc could have been handled a little better if more time was devoted to it, but I actually think I enjoyed the slice of life more than I enjoyed the Vertex battles so I can't really begrudge what the time was spent on instead.  Karin is alright, but we only really get to see her reach the culmination of her personal story at the very end; she comes in late and peaks after Fuu and Togo so I'm not sure she gets the focus she needs.  Yuuna and Itsuki, by contrast, are fairly flat and static characters.  Yuuna is a the one for whom this really could have been addressed.  Now, there is something nice about the fact that she's a static character.  I feel like the degree to which she's unchanged from the very beginning of episode 1 to the very beginning of episode 12 is a deliberate choice: she refuses to be moved in the face of the journey she goes on, and acts as an anchor for the other characters.  Still, she could have had more depth while still being the stable beacon of hope she needs to be.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, I actually liked the characters; Fu and Togo have good arcs, Yuuna and Itsuki are really pleasant to have around and make for good positive scenes, and Karin does a little bit of both, having development and being a very watchable character (not that Fuu and Togo aren't).  There are just times I really wish I was watching \"Fuu Inubouzaki is a Hero\", because I was more interested in her as a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is where I find YuYuYu actually comes out from under Madoka's shadow, because in the end it's not trying to be the same show as Madoka.  Madoka hooks you and pulls you along by being dark, twisted, and sometimes profound.  It's a vast, bleak shadow in which there is a single guiding light, and you have to fight through twelve episodes of that dark to reach for it.  It's moving and powerful.  In YuYuYu... that shadow is a passing thing.  Even the darkness must always pass.  I appreciate that we get episodes like 7 (the beach episode) where these characters can laugh and smile, and come to terms with the hardships they've faced and continue to face, that they get a chance to breathe between the battles and psychological blows that try to beat them down.  It's not as powerful as Madoka, but I don't think it wants to be.  It's inviting, and I feel that's exactly what's wanted out of the show's structure.  The fact that you weave a post-Madoka Magical Girl show in with Slice of Life, or Cute Girls doing Cute Things, has a charm to it that's hard to deny and earns the fact that there is so much more light in this story.  In fact, I think my favorite episodes overall are the ones where the characters don't transform at all, but instead live their lives against the backdrop of the action that has happened and the action that is still to come.  And that's something unique, and different, and worth having.  That's why YuYuYu is worth watching, even if you've already seen Madoka; it's not the same story, and as much as it does share themes, it has a fundamentally different take on those themes compared to its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall Total Score: 7 (6.8)",

            "content": "The first anime which I've marathoned in a day cos Toji no Miko X Yuuku Yuuna collab so I gotta know both animes right? It's surprisingly quite good, better than BGHS by a mile in terms of character development and animation. However, I gotta say, this is one of the most messed up animes I've seen so far, due to the lore. The story is good, but the lore.... seriously messed up. Like, you become a hero only to lose your body afterwards? No way am I becoming a hero. \r\nStory: The story follows 5 girls, Yuuna, Togo, Itsuki, Karin and Fuu as heroes toprotect the earth from Vertexes, mysterious creatures from the real world(cos the world they're living in is fake :v. Messed up right?) I find the story concept similar to BGHS and to an extent TnM, a bunch of schoolgirls battling evil creatures and eventually winning. But, Yuuki Yuuna just takes the after-battle to a whole new level because after the main characters fight in their Mankai form, they function of a body part, which is messed up like, why would you fight to protect the earth and kill creatures if you know that you're gonna be incapacitated for life? And the feels bois. I cried at episode 9 poor Itsuki losing her beautiful voice. Yuuna losing her sense of taste, Togo losing her sense of hearing in her left ear, Fuu losing her sense of sight in her left eye and Karin losing.... pretty much everything when she went mankai 4 times. RIP. But luckily, the anime has a happy ending, but not before another feels ride in episode 12 with Yuuna in a coma. Apart from the messed up lore, the story is actually well executed and interesting. \\n\r\nRating: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Love the animation of the Vertexes, the battle scenes and character design. And the explosions.\\n\r\nRating: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: Pretty nice opening ending i just skip cos there's no point hearing the ending when you're marathoning an anime. And the sad ost, leaves an impact and makes you cry. \\n\r\nRating: 7.9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I've got nothing much to say about the characters, because this anime is mainly about the story that's the main focus. My fav character is Itsuki cos she's cute and has a beautiful voice. And, I can't help but lay the connections between some of the characters in this anime and Toji no Miko. Yuuna=Kanami cos happy-go-lucky. Togo=Mai cos she cares for Yuuna just like how Mai cares for Kanami. Fuu= crossover between Mai and Ellen? Cos she cares for her sister Itsuki and is quite serious when it comes to battle. Karin=Maki cos she's the no nonsense type but is tsundere(to an extent). Itsuki=Sayaka cos she's under the care of Fuu like how Mai cares for Sayaka. And that's it for characters. \\n\r\nRating: 8.0/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall a pretty good anime quite surprised I actually enjoyed watching this. Cos I don't really watch this type of genre. The feels really gives the final rating a boost but then again, the messed up lore cancels that out. Would I recommend this anime? Yes absolutely it's enjoyable and feels reeeeeeeeeeeee. Now that this anime is done, time to watch the sequel and prequel of this. \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8.1/10",

Four girls to begin with as members of Sanshu Middle School Hero Club are the chosen girls to protect the world from the destruction of\u2014something like\u2014monsters from another dimensional space. Once this unrecognized\u2014weird\u2014creatures enter the world, then the world will be annihilated in an instant, in order to protect the world, Shinju-sama chose these girls from Hero Club as the next successors to look after the world with the magical power they obtain from being \"Hero\".Honestly this series got me interested after watching the 1st ep for the first 20 mins. Within this time, I declared that this one will be on the top of my download list. The first impression the series gave was so thrilling, when the enemy appeared to attack their world, then the transformation, and fight, and everyday school life\u2014all of it. The art changes when they enter another dimension to fight the Vertex\u2014name of those enemies. As the pic above, the colour and graphic is nice, it is really illustrate smooth aura of elementary students. My favorite parts, yeah, the battle scenes, another world illustration, they are so breathtaking. And I don't think the series is similar like Puella Madoka Magica (and I don't really want to compare these two).\\n\\n\r\n    The characters improvement is revolving step-by-step, along with the troubles they need to bear. I can say the series unify the sorrow, the happiness, struggles, emotions into a well-made story. Despite of emotional plot\u2014sad problems\u2014don't worry you will always find yourself cheered up by the comical and generous of heroines act.\\n\\n\r\n    For the music aspect, OP theme \"Hoshi to Hana (\u30db\u30b7\u30c8\u30cf\u30ca)\" by Sanshuu Chuugaku Yuusha-bu is heart-warming and I love it in a blink of an eye. The ED theme is \"Aurora Days\" also by Sanshuu Chuugaku Yuusha-bu is so mellow, well, to say it clearly, I'm not into this one. For special occasion~ep 4 & 9~the ED theme is Inori no Uta (\u7948\u308a\u306e\u6b4c), well-composed I like this one! In addition, I like the instrument for few scenes of the series, such as when it's a sad scene, battle scene, and trouble rises.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the series rate for 8.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nThe art, colours, graphics. So eye-catching!\\n\r\nThe plot and its progress\\n\r\nThe characters and moe-ness!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nThe theme songs might be more than the series could offer\\n\r\nSomehow I think 'the Shinju-sama' concept is.... eeerr..\\n\\n\\n\r\n*) Shinju-sama refers to (something) like a god. This anime takes place in the era of gods\\n\r\n*) \"Hero\" refers to the girls state, after chosen by Shinju-sama to protect the world and get magical power for being a Hero.\\n",

In it's own right, it was a thought provoking dark turn, and more traditional in a sense of Mahou Shojou.\r\nI fear this show loses a lot of people while it's pretending to be sailor moon, when they read reviews that told themit was dark in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the anime is that \"god\" and his allies constructed a wall, and constantly keeps a team of girls on watch, to repel evil creatures called Vectors.\\n\\n\r\nAs the girls continue to transform, they get more power. In turn, each time they use this power, they lose something precious. What exactly that is, isn't apparent till later, but its a pretty genuine feeling of sacrifice as these girls do what they can against an enemy they can't hope to defeat.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nPretty polished. There are some moments of derp face from a distance and some minor proportion distortion, but it's regularly good stuff and well animated.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle track is good and the voice acting is good too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I really got to know these girls, One of the girls, Kirin, who is presented as the \"expert fighter\" of the group.. she's awesome. She has a super freakout that compares to Asuka's meltdown in Evangelion.\\n\\n\r\nFu, the team leader, expresses a great range of emotions, both in voice and in art. Yuna is kind of boring, sort of a non-factor in her own story, until the end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nLoved the series. \\n\\n\r\nI'm learning that there's a lot out there in anime to enjoy besides genre staples. It's also an interesting look at Japanese culture to see the themes prevalent in each group. \\n\\n\r\nIt's sadly always going to be compared to Madoka, and I think that's unfortunate. I enjoyed this series on it's own two feet, really. There are scenes here as strong as any in Madoka, with thought out conflict and resolution that really make you wonder how much these girls can take. The writers failed however,  to engage the same long-term plot investment that Madoka had. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: SPOILERS! This review just has too many spoilers.\r\nThis could be known as a \"Madoka Magica\" ripoff. It's all about the dark magical girl genre. Even if that is quite true, I think that Yuuki Yuuna surpasses Madoka Magica in many ways.\r\nStory: The story isn't much to brag about. A bunch of girls need to protect the world from the \"Vectors\" and they fight them. Blah Blah. After the first couple of episodes, it starts to get pretty good. The foreshadowing was very subtle, unlike Madoka. I like to think that if foreshadowing is subtle then that makes the plot twist more dramatic.\r\nArt/Animation: Not asgood as Madoka. But you should be able to get used to it. It's pretty fluid and very colorful. The 3D animation is very noticeable but isn't as bad as others.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack seemed Madoka-Esque. With Latin or some other language in it. The Opening was catchy with some subtle changes in it and the ending was forgetful. I enjoyed the Voice Acting. The screams were very realistic. The girl's screams weren't perfect and beautiful. The screams were cracked, high pitched and realistic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character's had their very own reactions to the crisis they were in. Some of them broke down, some couldn't believe it and some tried to make it positive. They all had their episodes and they had their defining personalities. The character design was pretty weak though. Just looked like some fancy Madoka characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: To me, this series was a lot more tragic and darker than Madoka. That the girls couldn't die with their unmoving bodies. That they would forget all their memories. I felt that the friendship theme in Yuuki Yuuna was a lot more stronger than the other mahou shoujo shows. How the girls dealt with their broken friendship and how they tried to mend and fix it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would certainly pick this over Madoka. How subtle it was and how the girl's friendships were portrayed. It has a pretty slow and boring start but it's all worth it in the end. One of the many madoka alternatives.",

            "content": "Did Puella Magi Madoka Magica make you sad? Well, worry not, my friend! There's a new superpowered monster-fighting 13-year-old pink girl in town and she has a fist with your name on it! Her name is Yuuki Yuuna and she is going to PUNCH your sadness RIGHT IN ITS STUPID FACE. The most succinct explanation of why you should watch this show is as follows - if Madoka Magica is \"Magical Girl Evangelion,\" then YuYuYu is Magical Girl Gurren Lagann.\r\nWhat are you still doing reading this? Go. Go watch it. That should've been all the convincing you need. Like, the first episode ends with herpunching a cannonball out of the air and then punching a giant flying death monster so hard that half the thing explodes. Holy Christ, it's amazing. Just go already.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you stragglers, let's start from the bare bones. Comparing this show to Madoka is honestly unfair and cheap (but the same could be said of EVA and TTGL, so the comparison still stands) because YuYuYu is absolutely brilliant of its own merit in very nearly every capacity. The art is gorgeous, the music is epic, and the plot is a fantastic showcase of everything that appeals people to the Magical Girl genre, both modern and classic. When our heroes are hit with despair, you feel it, and when they triumph, you will be cheering on the edge of your seat. The \"power of friendship\" has never felt so tangible - you're gonna believe.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's story is masterful at preying on your expectations of what's to come. As little as it deserves the comparison, this show WANTS you to think that you're watching Madoka. It wants you to keep your eyes constantly peeled for foreshadowing and eagerly wait for that \"dark twist.\" When the final act sets in, you've forgotten all the little things that made up who these characters are and why they're doing what they're doing. Then, it reminds you. The small things - the bonds that are gained between people (reminder: this guy also directed the Persona 4 anime) - are what save the day. The main point of this show is that suffering and hard emotions aren't what makes a person strong; strength comes from standing together with people who believe in you and having the determination to push through those obstacles.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, what sets this show apart from a storytelling perspective is its use of \"filler\" as a tool instead of a gimmick. The overall plot to this show is streamlined, with only a single third act dedicated to the actual twists and turns of the story itself. A large chunk of the show is goofy, comedic slice-of-life with little connection to the action and the drama from later. Unlike most filler segments, these moments are used to enhance the subsequent drama instead of stall for its coming. You understand the livelihoods that these kids are fighting for. You understand how close they are to each other, so that when a big speech about \"the power of friendship\" is delivered in true Magical Girl form, you understand exactly what they're talking about. You get to see what is at stake - and what is already lost - when they are put in dangerous situations. As mentioned before, the bonds between people are what makes them strong in this show's moral, and so any time it can take to show you these bonds is a wonderfully calculated build-up to the final climax.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a roller-coaster of clashing emotions. It's a comedy, and a serious drama, and a straight action series all wrapped up into one. What's most important, though, is that at the end of the day, all of these elements come together to a satisfying conclusion. It shows what can really be accomplished if a show is allowed to be fun in an industry that applauds angsty brooding. Get ready to cry and cheer and laugh and, overall, have fun.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention that the main character punches things really, really hard? 'Cause she does. It's awesome.",

This anime tests the characters itself if they want to continue to be a hero or not. Can they sacrifice their own life, happiness, social life, goals to save the world?\r\nEvery time they use their powerful modes (Sorry. I don't remember their term.), one of their physical abilities will be disabled. But In the end, before they lose their powers and bodies, they finally saved theworld.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - I like the art itself. It's simple, clean and well-developed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 - The OP and ED are good and easy to understand. The background music is very good which makes my heart melt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - Every characters has their own personalities. I like the way they help each other both on life and battle.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 - Simply the best!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 - No matter how many times I rewatch it, it's still great.

Even I did, and decided to skip it a few times.\r\nFor those who are asking \"Am I going to find some Madoka elements here?\", the answer will most likely be \"Surely\", and If you don't, you can still enjoy itas a whole, cause believe me, I did, and I was not expecting any quality at all, unless you're one of those who watches an anime to specifically point out every mistake.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the biggest factor in my opinion. The develop might seem slow (yeah, with 12 episodes), or so straight it's easy to foresee, but take my word when I tell you its not something you have seen in many other magical girls anime. It takes a turn, and then it takes another, and then it takes another, and so on. Sadly talking too much about it would be too much of a spoiler, but take my word, it's amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot that it's bad, it's...\"Sufficient\" to watch. You can't complain about it, neither pray it. Whilst some people enjoy the colorful art it has, it might be misfit here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to be honest here, the background music overall was pretty much......bad. A more epic battle theme would've been better, or at least using the opening theme. Overall the music inside the anime was pretty crummy.\\n\r\nThat being said, the opening and the ending theme were awesome. And the voice acting fitted perfectly every character, especially Yuuna. I'd give sound a 4/10 if it wasn't because of these last points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10\\n\\n\r\nThey're all basically a piece of sweet from a cake. They all have that superhero idealism protagonists should have, added to the Friend Complex, where you'd rather be shattered by a truck carrying fans than leaving your friends behind.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most personal score, and by that I mean that maybe not you, but the anime just got me in the edge every episode, surprising me more and more with the passing of the episodes. It's a total shame that it's only twelve episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\\n\r\nI dind't start it with too much expectations, but it just left me astounded. The feeling I got from finish it was something like \"Oh my god, I want more\", something like I really haven't watched that many animes, but this one's gonna take the big crown for a long.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEspa\u00f1ol:\\n\\n\r\nEn pocas palabras:\\n\r\n\u00bfDeber\u00edas verlo?:Seh, quita algo de tu lista y dale algo de prioridad\\n\r\nHistoria:9/10\\n\r\nArte/Dibujo:7/10\\n\r\nM\u00fasica/Otros:7/10\\n\r\nPersonajes:8/10\\n\r\n\"Disfrutabilidad\":10/10\\n\r\nSatisfacci\u00f3n m\u00eda al terminar de verlo:11/10\\n\r\nSatisfacci\u00f3n que probablemente tendr\u00e1s al terminar de verlo:8/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, habiendo dicho todo eso.\\n\r\nAhhh, Yuuki Yuuna Wa Yuusha Dearu, uno de los animes que m\u00e1s que seguramente encontrar\u00e1s en una lista de \"Animes parecidos a Madoka Magica\". De hecho as\u00ed lo encontr\u00e9, y varias veces lo pospuse. Cosa que fue un gran error.\\n\r\nPara esos que se preguntan \"Voy a encontrar algo parecido a Madoka en el anime?\", la respuesta seguramente sea \"Seguramente\", y si no, puedes disfrutarlo como su propio anime en lugar de un reemplazo de Madoka, porque cr\u00e9eme, yo lo disfrut\u00e9 bastante, y ten\u00eda bajas expectativas cuando lo empec\u00e9 a ver. Amenos que seas uno de esos perfeccionistas que se quejan y explotan cada error en los animes.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria:9/10\\n\\n\r\nLa historia es la cereza del pastel en mi opini\u00f3n. El desarrollo puede parecer un poco lento (Si, a\u00fan teniendo solo 12 episodios), o tan lineal que puede parecer f\u00e1cil de predecir, pero cre\u00e9me cuando te digo que no es parecido a nada que hayas visto en otro anime de Mahou Shoujos. Da un giro, y luego otro, y luego otro, y as\u00ed. Lamentablemente hablar mucho de la historia conllevar\u00eda a dar spoilers, pero en serio, es incre\u00edble.\\n\\n\r\nArte/Dibujo:7/10\\n\\n\r\nNo es que sea malo, es.....\"Suficiente\" para verlo sin quejarse. No es algo de lo que te puedas quejar, pero tampoco es la gran cosa. Aunque algunos disfruten \u00e9ste arte colorido, puede que no sea el indicado para un anime as\u00ed.\\n\\n\r\nM\u00fasica/Otros:7/10\\n\\n\r\nSiendo honesto, la m\u00fasica de fondo era bastante......despreciable. Una canci\u00f3n de batalla m\u00e1s epica hubiera estado mucho mejor, o almenos haber usado el opening. Dentro de todo la m\u00fasica dentro del anime fue bastante mala.\\n\r\nDicho eso, el opening y el ending son incre\u00edblemente excelentes. Y las actrices vocales (O Voice actors, o seiyuus) eran perfectas para cada personaje, sobre todo para Yuuna. Le dar\u00eda un 4/10 si no fuera por \u00e9stas \u00faltimas cosas.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes:8/10\\n\\n\r\nSon todas un algod\u00f3n de azucar metido en otro algod\u00f3n de azucar. Todas tienen ese idealismo de superhero\u00edna que todos conocemos, sumado al Complejo de Amistad, donde todas preferir\u00edan ser despedazas por un cami\u00f3n lleno de ventiladores antes de abandonar a sus amigas.\\n\\n\r\nDisfrute:10/10\\n\\n\r\n\u00c9sta puntuaci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s bien un poco personal, puesto que quiz\u00e1 a ti no tanto, pero a mi el anime me tuvo pendiente de ver el siguiente episodio a cada rato. Es una l\u00e1stima que solo dure doce episodios.\\n\\n\r\nTotal:8/10\\n\\n\r\nNo empec\u00e9 Yuuki Yuuna Wa Yusha De Aru con muchas expectativas, pero me dej\u00f3 completamente impaktado. Ese sentimiento que tuve al terminarlo fue algo como \"No me jodas, \u00bfYa termin\u00f3? D:\", algo como que no he visto un millar de animes, pero \u00e9ste se llev\u00f3 uno de los primeros puestos, y se quedar\u00e1 por un largo tiempo\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I adore development and progression, and I didn't expect Yuki Yuna to have it due to the small episode amount, but I was wrong and you do see the characters progress and grow, as well as their friendships changings. I know it is a follow on of Washio Sumi Is A Hero, but you don't need to have read it to enjoy the show. I personally haven't read it yet, and I LOVED the show.It has good soundtracks and singing, and the characters are diverse and relatable.

I really wanted to like this anime but it was very much slice of life up to about episode 8. The girls spent a lot of time going about their daily lives and binging on sweets without gaining weight. If you dislike chirpy or bickering girls it's hard, boring, and despite their cute appearances, irritating to get through. I did shed some tears for Fu in episode 9, so I'll admit, it did give me some feels. It's great that the show includeda disabled girl named Togo, but the \"bondage\" fanservice with her magical girl transformation made me cringe. The last few episodes intrigued me but I felt like I wasted my time overall.\\n",
