They may try to go after a new life and start again but the fact that they messed up before will haunt them forever.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nPrepare yourselves as you will be taken into a world full of violence, betrayal, deceit, and madness. You will be in the edge of your seats as every episode is an action packed episode. Everyone has the ability to kill or will kill when they think that their survival is being threatened. The protagonist chose a path that will change his life drastically. Not likehe wanted to go to that path, more like they forced him to. Love is also portrayed because both of the protagonist know that they have feelings for each other but their status makes it hard for them. Also, time skips made this series more interesting as it will suprise the viewers since everything and everyone had change after it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was great. They were some animation errors but you will forget them as you will be satisfied with the great and magnificent sceneries. The fighting and the shooting scenes were great too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was very nice. You'll be feeling like you're inside an opera room. Those falcetto notes during fights and dramatic events really helped. It deepened the impact on the viewers which makes it more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nWhen interraction is made, relationship starts to form. As our main assassins work together since they are partners in crime, they realize that they have feelings for each other. Add another girl, in which you wouldn't expect what would happen to her,and you get a love triangle. The organization, Inferno, also plays an important rolw because they are the ones who control and manipulate the strings of everyone. Organization so big that everyone in the underworld fears them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSuperb. It was very exciting. After seeing an episode, you'll just keep longing for more and more because every episode leaves you hanging. There are also a lot of sudden turn of events, ohh the irony. I really enjoyed it more after the time skip. The settings and the roles changed drastically that it'll make you be like \"OHH YEAA .\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat series, I recommend it to everyone. You will not feel regret.",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a prime example of a show that is too overrated by fans, who easily overlook some gaping plot holes, and downgraded into oblivion by haters, who cannot see anything but those plot holes. I think this show sits somewhere in between: it is a fine show to watch, nothing exeptionally great, but not bad either. If you're trying to decide on watching this, let this be your decision after 1/2 episodes: do you like the character relationship of Ein and Zwei? Go on. If you do not, don't bother with the show. I will try to provide my argumentswith as few spoilers as possible, but I cannot completely guarantee a spoiler-free review. Here goes.\\n\\n\r\n== Story == 7\\n\r\nThere are essentially two layers to this anime. On the superficial level, you have your standard mafia-esque corporations trying to gain more power, with the main corperation being Inferno. The distributions in power are a little vague in the beginning, but as the show goes on, one can see that higher-ups in the corperation are allowed a great deal of freedom when it comes to handling problems. Bosses will frequently go behind each other's back to solve personal problems. This would make for quite an interesting story of intrigue, but is a little dulled by the second layer of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe second layers revolves around our two main protagonists, Ein and Zwei. The complex relationship that these two characters have makes for quite an interesting main character cast, but I felt its relationship overshadows the story of Inferno and its attempt at gaining more power in the underworld. \\n\\n\r\nI found myself a little disappointed when the show shifted from the intriguing development of the main characters to highlight the structure and plans of Inferno. I understand that this is necessary for the plot to advance and therefore for the characters to even develop, but hope you also get what I mean by this. The story also suffers from an insanely large plothole, which I could not overlook and I will talk about in the Characters section. \\n\\n\r\n== Characters == 7\\n\r\nThe main characters is where the show truly shines, but is also a big downfall. Ein, being completely brainwashed now has to work together with Zwei, who is in the process of being completely brainwashed, but deep down is heavily conflicted. I loved how their relationship was set up, being purely platonic and bland at first, but slowly turning into something deeper that I will not explain to avoid spoilers. There were times that I completely loathed the decisions they made, which was proof for me that I was quite heavily invested in the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs with the story, the main characters overshadow the supporting characters, who are in this case mostly Inferno members. This ties into the more 'boring' superficial layer of the story. It was also nice to see that the show pulls off quite a few risky plot-twists, some of which work out greatly, while others fail horribly. \\n\r\nThis leads me to a plot hole, so gapingly large that it almost swallows the entire show. This is also why many people are so put off by this show. About 75% in, there is a time skip of two years. Some characters haven't aged a day, while another turned from a child to an adolescent in a mere two years. Not only is this completely illogical, it was also not even necessary to keep the story going. The story and characters suffer immensely from this. Until the end of the show, I could not get over this. Your opinion on the show will most likely hinge on this specific time skip. I was really put off by this, but continued to watch anyway. The opening and ending also change after this time skip, which made this plot hole even more terribly obvious. Judge this how you will, but you cannot deny the irregularities that this time skip brought. \\n\\n\r\n== Animation == 7\\n\r\nThe animation is good. There is nothing wrong with it, but it isn't amazing either. Some characters, often ladies, are sometimes irregularly shaped (scenes with weirdly long legs or unevenly sized breasts), but the rest looks good. Characters look great, are nicely animated and some painting-like scenery fleshes them out well, while giving you that artsy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing bothered me though, and that has to do with the fan service. In the first minute of the first episode you will see a half-naked lady lying on the beach. BAM! Two tits in your face. While there is nothing wrong with that, I immediately thought: 'Oh it's going to be like that, huh?' But it wasn't. During the rest of the show, the animators went out of their way to not fully show nudity, to the point of unrealistic, nippleless, naked girls, which makes me wonder what the use of that very first scene was to begin with. You have the R+ rating already, so just show nudity when it is appropriate, or fully go out of your way to show nudity, and avoid naked ladies without nipples altogether. \\n\\n\r\n== Sound == 8\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The opening song sets the mood nicely, while tracks in the anime always fit the scenes. Some soundtracks are so great or are so obviously made to make you feel a particular emotion, that it can even feel out-of-place in some scenes. It is just too present and obvious sometimes, but most of the time augments the show perfectly. The second opening and ending songs are used after the time skip for the last few episodes, which made me feel weird, almost insulted. For me there was no reason why they should change the songs to make the time skip even more obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment == 7\\n\r\nThere were times when I was heavily invested in the main characters, only to be pulled out again by a dull side-story or hateful decisions some characters make. I still cannot fathom some of the plot twist inducing decisions that were being made and can ultimately also not say that I always enjoyed this show. A few times I just sat there, looking at my screen and asking: 'Why the fuck did you have to do that?' Sometimes the show dragged on for a bit too long on a specific subject or side-story, making me wonder if it had been better for the show if it had a few less episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPeople have been comparing this show to Black Lagoon a lot, but I must warn you that apart from the mafia groups and the conflicts of the main protagonist, the mood, setting and goal of the shows are completely different. Black Lagoon is much more action-oriented, while Phantom focuses more on character development.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this is not a bad show. It is not amazing either. It's just decent. You will probably like it if you like the relationship of the main characters, but do not try to sell this as the greatest anime ever made, as its flaws are too obvious to ignore. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Phantom is simply a mess. It's a mesh of fine ideas that ultimately is not executed well and ends up with a lot of wasted potential. Let's dive down deeper to see how Phantom ended up. \r\nThis review contains minor spoilers after the \"Read More\" mark.\r\nPhantom consists of 3 main arcs, each separated by a recap episode, and each focusing on 3 different characters, Ein, Zwei and Drei, although with Zwei being an important character throughout. The story starts of with an interesting premise of an amnesiac man being manipulated by a shady organization.\r\nHowever this thread is very quickly resolved when he learns of hisidentity 3 episodes in. And Zwei, oh Zwei isn't known for making rational or even normal decisions. I mean, how else did he get himself stuck in this situation am I right? Several times in the series I really question his true motivations or even reasons for carrying out certain actions, not because of some mysterious plot thread or engaging character behavior, but because of shoddy character writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters aren't any better in this regard. Ein is your standard emotionless girl who finds emotion through main protagonist stereotype and is absolutely dependent on someone else, be it Zwei or Evil Doctor person to live. Her character development is cliche as all hell, and ultimately she isn't much likable as a result. \\n\\n\r\nDrei on the other hand is more entertaining. She is a lot more enjoyable than the other 2 characters when it comes to her scenes, although her character motivations are just terrible. I won't go much into her reasons for being in the plot, but it feels so shoved in and terribly written that I couldn't garner any sympathy for her plight.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side characters are pretty forgettable. The main antagonist is an evil doctor whose name I forgot and is always one step ahead of the protagonists but has nothing substantial about him. He's evil and depraved and that pretty much sums up his entire character. Near the end he becomes a lot more theatrical and a lot more entertaining but that still doesn't redeem any of the previous moments involving his character.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the issue of the overall plot. The plot is competent enough, but the characters and the pacing drag it down significantly. The pacing in particular ratchets up so quickly near each arc's end that the audience would be left confused and tired by it's conclusion. The third arc manages it all best, where Zwei and Ein are more likable/less dumb and Drei always makes for interesting encounters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has very bad problems managing its themes/messages. One of the main themes the series attempts to showcase is that a name isn't everything and one should live to be oneself. This theme is delivered in the first arc when Zwei told Ein to ditch her old name and live anew, saying that she shouldn't be retrained by a name. Ironically afterwards he starts calling her Eren and expects her to abide by and live by that arbitrary name he gave her. Ein even calls him out on this but the show just ignores this and thinks it has written something profound or meaningful or something. It's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the ending which is just terrible. It differs from the original visual novel by purposely altering it slightly to make it a bad ending but doing so completely defeats the purpose of the protagonists' journey and is also inconsistent with the previous parts of the anime where they could eat up bullets without needing too much medical attention. It's just bad.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot more I could go on about but I should just stop here. Phantom isn't worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "I can imagine many people bashing their heads against the wall trying to write a review for this anime without revealing spoilers; so I'm going to do this as best as possible... \r\nPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom. One thing for sure is that this is one masterfully written and awesomely portrayed bit of story telling. In the twenty six episodes you'll find that you keep saying to yourself: \"just one more episode\", since it is almost impossible to watch just one episode at a time. (I gave the story a solid 10/10).\r\nThe art and sound department did a superb job (the opening theme \"Karma\" inparticular is amazing, I'm ordering the OST that's for sure). English Dub fans will recognize most voices too. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are like none other. Character development is amazing, all are brilliantly depicted and each has their own unique 'aura'. The relationships between characters, the twists & turns; it's all is part of this awesome bit of story telling. Character design was without a doubt engineered towards stirring emotions, you will unknowingly become immersed in their world(s) and be eager to find out what happens next (going back to what I said earlier).\\n\\n\r\nThe way it throws you around with plot twists, action, betrayals and emotions... it truly is one awesome roller coaster... to carry on with that analogy: just imagine this superb roller coaster, a few aches and pains from the ride, you're left feeling euphoric, only to realise it's still not quite over.\\n\r\nI'll leave it at that. sorry, but that's just one of the ways this anime really does it's magic.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to nit-pick but there are a few minor things here & there, but they're all easily forgotten. For example it's fairly evident who the real 'baddy' is early on (it would involve spoilers too so please excuse if I don't elaborate). loose ends are definitely my only main grievance with this anime. Believe me you will say: \"did I just hear that!?\" at one point... \\n\r\nSo if you're a fan of action, hit-man/criminal syndicate, psychological thrillers; or if you just needed convincing, you will not regret picking up this anime.",

            "content": "This show is a classic case of: Good Idea, Bad Execution\r\nIt starts off simply enough with an intriguing (if all-too-common) storyline and interesting, shadowy characters. The first few episodes are pretty strong, focusing mainly on the development of the main protagonist and his interactions with his new employers and colleagues. I was eager to find out what would happen next, and in my eagerness, I ignored all the signs of what would come. \r\nVery quickly the story takes a very cliched turn, and the characters become little more than billboards of irrationality. The motivations of the protagonists, antagonists, and pretty much everyone in the show,suddenly become contradictory to their earlier actions, thoughts, and reactions. The plot develops, rather quickly, from a biting psychological-thriller, into a predictable and unrealistic drama. \\n\\n\r\nNot to spoil anything, but the hardened and brutal criminals of the first few episodes suddenly become weak and ineffectual, the anonymous, silent killers suddenly become flashy and all-too-eager to shout their names and identities from the rooftops. And of course, the calculating villains seem utterly incapable of understanding even the simplest of human motivations. It becomes all too easy to predict what will happen by simply having watched a multitude of bad television and feature films. If it's a cliche, it's probably used. If it makes little sense considering the setting, it probably occurs. Some people may think I'm being too harsh here, but the unrealized potential of the story makes the decisions of the writers and directors all the more questionable. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story begins to reach it's climax, one is forced to question the relevance of some major characters and earlier plot-developments. Little attention is payed to developing the rationale behind the decisions that the characters make; villain and \"hero\" (there are no real heroes here) alike simply act so that the plot can be advanced. Unfortunately, the plot advances in the least interesting and most predictable ways, and is itself full of holes. For example, a time-skip of two years leaves us with some people who look like they've not grown either physically or emotionally, and other characters who don't even closely resemble their earlier selves.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of the bad decisions made by the writing and directing teams is that some viewers lose interest in the outcome of the story, or the fate of the characters. Indeed, it is difficult in some ways to find the energy to care about the development of the plot and characters, when 90% of the time, your first guess is the right one. Actions are taken that seem to have no inner meaning or relevance to the actual story. Motivations which seemed ludicrous are revealed to be just that: ludicrous. Any hints that this may all be the design of some mastermind are left forgotten and we come to find out that the villains and \"heroes\" are all just that dumb. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I find it difficult to rate this series as anything above mediocre. The art and music are all perfectly fine, though one particular theme is overplayed. The story is intriguing, if one is not looking for complexity or depth, and is not expecting something \"new\" or very creative. The characters are often interesting on the surface, but upon closer inspection, they become one-dimensional and sometimes, very contradictory. The drama is contrived and the plot-holes begin to weigh down any emotional value the events may be trying to convey. The ending was, in my opinion, fitting for such a series: cliche and not very well-executed. What started off great was, sadly, doomed to failure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 5/10. In some ways this is too harsh, but in others it is far too lenient. Stories that don't take risks are usually boring and not enjoyable, but stories that take risks have to deliver. In my humble opinion, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom took plenty of risks, but almost none of them payed off in the end. The higher one flies, the harder one falls. \\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I will put a quote from my brother about the show that I think summarizes it perfectly:\\n\\n\r\n\"It was like someone wanted to make a hard, biting, psychological show about assassins, but wanted to make it for an audience of fifteen year old girls.\" \\n\\n\r\n((((After Edit: Upon further reflection, I have decided that this is perhaps the worst anime ever made, and have appropriately given it a 1 score. I have left the original review intact however.))))",

            "content": "Personally the idea of a secret organization hidden in the underground has always sent a small chill down the spine.  One of thrill and a small yearn of wanting to join in on the fun.   Grunge, guns, passion, hate, emptiness, lust, power, suits, death, and fancy cars; these are some of things that is offered in this forbidden and hidden world.  At first glance it looks like a life worth trying out, but the void that can be created within one\u2019s mind can become the very undoing of their life.  Zwei is one of the most detailedcharacters I have experienced thus far that exhibits this trait.\\n\r\n    What happens when you take a person, someone of a certain \"innocence\", chase them down, try to kill them and then brain wash them into doing the bidding of this underground world, with the reward of just their life?  I for one have never experienced anything like that from the external or an internal source of the material world, so my input on a realistic level is incorrect.  Although, one thing that I can speculate on is the psychological formula of one's thought process and emotional response, thus understanding the turn that could occur and stir inside the heart of this character. \\n\r\n   This one minute characteristic of the show was the selling point that instant.  Being a sucker for cute boys is a weakness of mine, but the devoid Zwei captivated the \"poor lost soul\" gap within me. The artist nature of his hollow eyes, blank expression, and puppet like movements coincide with the response that would be fitting for the overall effect in the story.  The choice of when to have Zwei react in an emotional ran state or \u201cphantom\u201d state was right on the mark.  There has never been a point in time that the \u201cinternal drama\u201d lingered for too long, another winning aspect of Phantom.  \\n\r\nThe amount of conflict, emotional response and actions taken all fit together perfectly with no leftovers.  The feelings of dissatisfaction, confusion, bewilderment, or boredom have not occurred yet while watching this animation.  Waiting for the main climax to take shape tickles with excitement as the story unfolds and the characters become enveloped in the mix.  Seeing all of this from a non living organism makes me want to experience it even more, maybe not personally, but from a third person perspective.  To see this type of behavior develop in a real person would be something that someone faint of heart would not be able to accomplish; the absolute demise of a once innocent and \u201cliving\u201d person.  Do you want to see what happens when someone lives so close to death?\\n\\n",

            "content": "My thirst for gun action animes had grown after watching Hellsing Ultimate and Black Lagoon, and somehow, this particular anime showed up in my recommendations quite frequently. So I gave it a try.\r\nPLOT\r\nIt started off with a Japanese young man where he founds himself in a room. Having completely no idea about his reasons for being there and his identity, he tried to explore where he was. It was only then he was \"attacked\" by a girl named Ein. It was then shown that he was experimented in an abandoned outlet in the States to test his abilities and skills. Next, he realized that hismemories were lost and he was ultimately forced to work for a large mafia company known as Inferno. He was also given a new name called Zwei. Throughout his jobs, psychological thoughts were tested, manipulated and toyed. I liked how it deals with the mind, about how life feels being abandoned and trapped but you're still urging for an escape. That was how the plot goes. Slowly as the plot progressed, we could see Inferno's goals, the aristocrats' battle for power in the group, the struggle for freedom and of course, betrayal. Ein and Zwei also got closer in their relationship to fight for an escape but was hesitated by doubt and premonitions. I really liked how they played with your mind honestly speaking. But that was how it all started. There were risky but nicely planned plot twists albeit some parts were blurry in terms of where the plot wanted to go. It started off slow, but managed to pick up. The first part was a bumpy ride of despair and hope basically speaking. The second part was the separating point between Ein and Zwei. After Zwei acknowledged his true identity, a tragic incident transpired that caused him to switch paths which ultimately he met a young girl by a chance encounter. A new hope was revived and a new progress was revealed. Although there were more depth relating to power, escape and evil, the psychology was dealt greatly. But after another turning point of a tragic misunderstanding, everything that continued right after that was underwhelming. The third part of the plot became unclear due to a huge gap of time. The psychological aspects were suddenly forgotten, and everything was solely for the sake of a longer, useless plot that felt silly. It's an anime that progressed simply when something hopeful comes up, it's ultimately thrown away by another stupid tragedy only to be compensated by another flicker of hope that's fated to be destroyed once more. The reason for that? I'm guessing it's for masochism. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind multiple tragedies to prolong the story, but when you run out of fresh ideas, it's better not to add another twist that doesn't seem like a fine deal, I don't buy it. With the plot getting unsteady towards the end, the authors perhaps decided to add some more bitter icing to their distasteful cake that not only made it taste worse, but it became inedible. The aforementioned ending obliterated the plot's whole progression, the characters' motives and basically makes you feel horrible. Not only that, it served up as an obviously huge plot hole. I won't tell what but you could probably tell how bad it was coming from me. It was messed up so bad that ultimately, it only tells you this: Nothing in this show, including goals and dignity and essence, actually matters. There's no reason why you need to accomplish something. Which is why the plot was, as I said, wrecked terribly.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nThis anime was made in 2009, but it wouldn't mean that I'll give it some leniency for this. I do have reasons. First off, this anime had considerable amounts of fanservice, even at the second minute of the first episode you already get two \"you know what\" right in your face. However, nudity was, thankfully, not exaggeratedly conspicuous, but still, I can't seem to find reasons for these occurrences, which means that they were unnecessary. The character designs were pretty much bland and lackluster and not consistent all of the time but the backgrounds of the show were brilliant. Action scenes were great though. However, it was awkward seeing different contrasts that didn't compliment each other which felt somewhat incomplete. On the other hand, this anime had two opening and ending animations. As for the first opening and ending, I'll admit it was pretty damn good. It portrayed the mood of the songs perfectly and it was one of the few animes that seem really artistic. Truly, very well done. But, as for the second opening and ending, it burned my eyes. The second opening looked as if it came from a regular slice-of-life show which absolutely couldn't click with the pessimistic song that was playing along with it. The second ending was very lacking in animation compared to the first one and wasn't much to see. In conclusion, the animation is noticeably inconsistent and occasionally lackadaisical.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was actually really good in my opinion. Every track that played in a particular scenario fitted well. Some were good while others were actually really great. I did notice that there were two or more tracks that were remixed in terms of genre to fit the mood of a scene which I have to admit it was pretty ingenious. Repetitiveness may be an issue but the tracks still complimented every scene, and that's more important. The singular genres were diverse ranging from chant, violin, progressive rock, folk, orchestral and even music box while the fusion ones were pretty unique like techno chant, ambient folk with contemporary piano concerto and happy trance mixed with music box and drum 'n' bass. I'm loving the fusion ones more than the singular ones actually, but there's still room for the soundtrack to reach a top-tier level. As for the two opening and ending themes, they were all fantastic. Ali Project and Kokia done a beautiful job in conveying the anime's theme with neoclassical genres to give it an authentic feel to it. The soundtrack's great, but it's such a shame that the animation couldn't keep up with some of the intense or chaotic tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the anime's strongest point, but it was also its greatest downfall. The development for the main characters were great and thorough as the plot progressed slowly -- showing the bonding between them as they attempt to escape from the relentless struggle of acquiring freedom. Psychological standpoints from the characters (normally the mains) were dealt in a way that seemed realistic enough to be almost ingenious when it comes to decision making. But secondary characters were a bit lacking and unclear in character development. There were glimpses of their past, probably it gave them the drive of persistence, but it was still insufficient enough to determine their motives, which sometimes made their decisions seemed unappeasable towards me despite the actual plot had a major impact on it. But I felt that some characters were probably, no offense, dumb in making decisions. Most of the time during the last five episodes I was saying: \"Why the heck do you do that?!\" or \"How in the world could you even have that sort of mentality?!\" Basically, the characters' decisions and motives were disappointingly shallow which gave off to cliche, silly and predictable drama. But at least the anime gave us an advice: Always check your building even if it's blown up.\\n\\n\r\nPROGRESSION\\n\r\nIt started off slow, but managed to pick up its pace just fine in which the show was narrated in an initially unclear form to a clear and transparent understanding of every party striving for their own goal. My only problem with the progression was the third part, and it's always that! It felt tedious and long-winded because it's predictable and not suspenseful. Because of that, the final battle of the show was rushed and didn't seemed to give off a sense of finality that it felt somewhat illogical for it to be rushed due to the plot holes. Even when the main villain was defeated, it didn't feel decisive at all, as if something was lacking. Some major plot holes were obvious enough to be seen with the naked eye that it felt unsatisfactory when it ended, because it wasn't complete. No, it didn't even receive closure. It stopped right before the closure and credits just rolled and that was it. The finale was never shown because something bad was added that was never explained -- which created the biggest plot hole ever.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nI had been criticising lots of points of Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom, mainly it was because of the third part of the plot that messed up its original brilliance, which I felt biased already. It was initially enjoyable, I'll admit that. I really enjoyed the music as well. But what creates satisfaction is not how it started, but how it ended. It's the show's ending that's more important than its beginning. And since there isn't a sequel, the plot holes will forever remain in your interpretation. Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom started off strongly and interestingly, but gradually loses its grounds and topples.\\n\\n\r\nAnd deliberating over the ten traits of the anime: plot, characters, music, animation, artwork, progression, voice acting, setting, opening/ending and my personal enjoyment, my verdict for this is a 6.3/10.",

            "content": "Reading through the reviews on here I'm left wondering if i downloaded the wrong show, i went into this show with high levels of optimism, low popularity, but highly rated, definitely a potential gem.\r\nI liked 'Similar shows' such as Gungrave and Black Lagoon, and this show is not on the same level as those shows.\r\nThe premise is solid, and potentially very interesting, people being emotionally scrubbed and programmed as assassins, and the relationships that develop under these circumstances, almost certainly going to be dark and tragic, should be great.\r\nThe art and sound are both solid, i liked the character models, they were well realised andthe sound seemed to better convey emotion than the actual content of the show at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter and enjoyment are what destroyed this show for me, i stuck this show out for 13 episodes, before i finally decided it was not going to turn the corner.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as mentioned before are emotionally scrubbed, and now while this often works well when done with a single cast member, basing a show on the developing relationship between two emotionally scrubbed characters is a long tedious and drawn out process. \\n\\n\r\nLong Tedious and drawn out really does go a long way to summarising my feelings towards the whole show, there are constant glimpses of potential as the protagonist slowly descends further into the murky criminal underworld, but it all seemed ultimately hollow and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe 10 or so episodes prior to the time skip would have seemed more appropriate in a 15 minute flash back in some sort of back story episode, not the content for the first half of a series.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this show has low popularity for a reason, it's a niche show, and that niche seems to involve rock solid patients and very low expectations. If your not into and loving this show after the early episodes, drop it, because that's as good as it's going to get, it doesn't turn the corner and will continue as more of the same.",

            "content": "What's our reason for existence? We all have one, but often, those reasons were given to us before we were even born. Most of us have the luxury of being surrounded by friends, family, siblings, etc. But what happens when we're completely stripped of all of those, and are thrown out to find a new existence on our own? \r\nStory - 9:\r\nThe core plot of Requiem for the Phantom centers around one's pursuit of one's reason to exist. To find one's place in the world. And as the viewer quickly discovers, successfully accomplishing this is quite an ambitious task. This is due to the factthat the environment itself forbids such concepts. In the dark, chaotic underworld, assassins are trained to be ghosts, empty beings that only do, never question. Deviation from this is frowned upon, and only guilt and regret awaits those who even try to stray from this rule. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot therefore quickly spirals into a tug of war between the will of the characters, and the environment they're in. As such, the events themselves revolve much around a single decision. Which is better? Being a ghost of non existence doing only as ordered so, but as a result feeling no guilt or sin, or having an existence, but feeling the regret of all the sins one has committed? \\n\\n\r\nHow the plot progresses, is through changes in each character's perspective on the above question. As each episode goes by, you'll feel as if they're \"growing\", gaining new intuition through their interactions with each other. They begin to see new beauty in the world that they've never seen before, eventually, reach their own respective decisions to \"the question\". The anime's definition of \"at least at peace.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe brilliance of the plot itself lies in how well weaved together everything is. Each action has an implication, and each implication has an effect. Each effect creates an emotion, and each emotion affects how the characters perceive the world, and themselves. Nothing is wasted. Every minute of each episode had a reason for being there, and taking any of them away would harm the overall experience. In fact, you'll be surprised how many times you'll ask yourself \"what would I have done?\". \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as sentimental and philosophical as the plot is, it isn't perfect. Along the path of ambition that the creators have taken, there are definitely a few hiccups. There are two points within the plot that suffer from what I call, \"time lapse syndrome\". A point in the story of which a character has a certain personality and attitude/behaviour, and then after a screen caption of \"x months later...\", their personality completely changes. Because we're not shown the events inbetween, only the before and afters, it makes the viewer feel as if the creators simply ran out of time, and decided to leave the rest up to our imaginations. Nothing wrong with using the imagination of the viewer to develop the plot of course, but the fact that we're not shown the complete picture does hurt the progression of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I think the L.A. skyscrapers looked better in this anime than in real life. The artistic style used not only compliments incredibly well with the dark atmosphere of the anime, but also in bring out L.A's \"true colours\" if you will. All in all, it's evident that the creators took the time in creating a world that was thoroughly believable visually. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, like with the art, the OSTs compliment the anime quite well. The falsettos compound the experience during dramatic situations, and the epic beats make those fights seem even more badass. Both the opening and the ending songs are quite catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, each character in the series existed to provide different perspectives on the same environment. They also act as the messengers that pass on the morals and consequences of events of the anime onto the viewer. It is also because of this diversity of personalities represented through each character that makes the series so compelling and enjoyable. It's consistently interesting to see how each character addresses their own issues based upon their own morals and goals, and how their different decisions bring upon them different consequences later on. For example, the behaviour of one character might show that too much ambition eventually backfires, while another may show that intense love could quickly turn into intense hate. \\n\\n\r\nThe choice for the two main characters were also excellent. The personalities of Zwei and Ein compliment each other perfectly. While Zwei eventually develops his own will, Ein remains trapped, without her own will, and therefore unable to act on her own unless ordered to. The journey that the two take together to reclaim Ein's past is so emotional because you understand very early on, that both of them, were just innocent bystanders tossed into a world that doesn't make sense. Yet it is because of this, that each of their achievements feel so much more worthy. And it is also the reason why this series does so well in delivering the emotion of losing oneself completely, and then slowly reclaiming what you have lost. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series does also trip slightly over it's own ambition. The large character base meant that some characters didn't get the development that they deserved, while others didn't even get to contribute to the plot because they were introduced so late. But in light of everything that's going on, these were very small errors that will hardly be noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nRequiem for the Phantom is one of those animes that will suck you in from episode one, and take you on a journey of deception, deceit and a slight hint of hope, of which you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat until the very end. It's one of those animes that will make you think and relate to the characters, and perhaps even change your own perspective on life...for better or for worse. \\n\\n\r\nBut above all, it's an anime that shows that even the darkest of worlds aren't completely devoid of light, and after you've finished watching it, it'll have left an impact that you'll never forget. \\n",

            "content": "This anime is disgustingly underrated. Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is an adaption of the visual novel, Phantom of the Inferno by Gen Urobuchi. The show contains much of Gen\u2019s dark and twisted depiction of reality. Characters are subjected to cruel fates, true despair, and most importantly the anime shows that \"hope\" is merely an elusive and fleeting illusion in our (in)humane world. The main focus of the anime is the idea of the perfect assassin. It is about crafting the mindset an assassin needs; how assassins are mere inhumane tools for psychopathic people. Requiem for the Phantom crafts a palpable sense of despair andanguish in people. \\n\\n\r\nIn our world, there are a plethora of gangs, mafias, and terrorist organizations. At the center of the story, the mysterious uprising organization, Inferno assassinates targets mercilessly with their invincible secret weapon, \"Phantom\". Inferno's goal? Bring forth a new era. What does that even mean?\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Reiji Azuma (though it's never revealed if that's even his true name) wakes up in an unknown building in the middle of nowhere with absolutely no memory of anything, and out of nowhere gets attacked by an assassin. That's when his killer survival instinct kicks in, and he flashes potential as a legendary assassin. The mysterious assassin who's later revealed as \"Ein\", a emotionless teenage girl, and her mad scientist master, \"Master Scythe\", decide to brainwash and train Reiji into an assassin for their organization, Inferno. Given the name \"Zwei,\" this once peaceful boy is now a puppet of Inferno. Drawn into a world of darkness, lies, deceit, and violence, Zwei must fight to survive, hopefully to one day regain his memories and escape from this world where he is constantly on the brink of death. As the plot thickens and darkens, Zwei and Ein seem to build a bond of love/friendship as they yearn for the truth of reality. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime started with unlimited potential, but later it became rather barren. At first, the shadows behind Inferno were interesting to look out for. What is their motif for murder? What's this \"new era\" that they envision? Then our main characters, Zwei and Ein... They are 2 of the greatest, ambiguous characters in all anime. What's their identity? Nobody remembers who they are, so do they truly exist? If they are killing others in order to survive, doesn't that make them evil? Throughout the entire anime, the dilemma presented here for Zwei and Ein, was intriguing and deep. They have absolutely no attachments to anything in the world but their own lives. If they do not comply with Inferno\u2019s orders, they will be killed. If they fail at their duty, they will be killed. Their own survival instincts prevent them even from attempting suicide. So, it truly becomes a struggle for maintaining one\u2019s humanity in the face of impossible odds. Unfortunately, not all characters got the development they should of gotten, and some VERY stupid \"character\" things happened. Lizzie (Reiji's boss) and Claudia, two members of Inferno, show up quite frequently in the anime, playing a role in Reiji's decisions on how to live. But, the anime never shows us their motif, what they personally want, and how they became who they are. In fact, Lizzie was completely dropped after a few episodes, she just disappears... Scythe Master shows up at the beginning of the anime as the main psychopathic antagonist of the anime. He is behind the creation of phantoms, and plotting of the ruthless murders other people. But, why is he doing this? We don't know. That is the biggest flaw. The main antagonist should have a back story and a motif, but nope; completely random. Another flaw that I really was upset about was the coming of age for Cal Devins, the 3rd main character in the anime. Cal was a little girl (looks like 8) that tried to hire Zwei thinking he was a killer for justice, by using money she had unknowingly stolen from Inferno. When Inferno tried to kill Cal, Zwei hid and protected her (humanistic side), but through tragic events, they were separated. Then there was a 3 year time-skip and suddenly Cal, who was a little innocent girl turned into a super smoking hot 18-year old chick that is the new Phantom of Inferno, after Zwei and Ein run away from the organization to live in peace and find their real identity. Furthermore, Cal got no background development, such a disappointment. Really in general, until the last about third of the anime, the main characters really didn't get much development at all, they could have done MUCH better.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime was mediocre, BUT it fit the anime perfectly. All the soundtracks were sinister, and mysterious fitting in perfectly with the overall dark mood of the anime. Unfortunately for the lack of a variety of soundtracks, the anime seems to repeat the same soundtracks over and over... and over again, so it gets kind of repetitive and it loses it's suspense. I think in one episode, Canzone of Death (best soundtrack in anime) was repeated 4 times in a span of 15 minutes; that's how you ware out a song. Anyways, the opening and endings for Requiem for the Phantom were certainly unique and once again, fit in perfectly with the mood of the anime. The opening, Karma is such a neat piece of opening. The lyrics described the start and repetition of life, the aimless wanderings in search for the truth, bringing forth inner peace, and finally reaching the end. The art is same as any other dark anime really... Nothing special, but nothing bad about the art. I will mention that I liked the portayal of the precise, keen movements and senses of the Phantoms. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is Requiem for the Phantom worth watching? Look at the score; YES! Requiem for the Phantom stays true to itself until the very end the end. It does not opt out for any easy answers, or simplify the darkness of reality, and it manages to maintain a sense of class. The ending is truly of the saddest, most well-planned ending of all time. The ending was ambiguous, yet still had sense of finality to the work as a whole. I enjoyed it, I cried throughout, I felt a pinches of pain, and I learned a life lesson. Requiem for the Phantom is a meaningful anime, and certainly an anime that I'd recommend to anyone that can withstand watching an anime with no comedy relief, just pure darkness.",

            "content": "In my opinion, Phantom Requiem will may be figure in the top10 anime of the year 2009.\r\nPhantom Requiem is firstly an anime where you need to be attentive, in fact, mafia members in that anime often discuss about plans,strategies which are quite difficult to understand.However, the most fascinating side of that anime resides in the relationship between Reiji/zwei and Elen/Ein.I would say that the main theme of this anime is FREEDOM.\r\nPhantom Requiem is an anime for those who mostly love drama since the story of Elen and Reiji is very touching.Therefore, if you are searching for impressive scenes of actions and suspense, I suggest thatyou don't expect more from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStrength of this anime:\\n\\n\r\n1) Drama is very good- following how Reiji becomes more and more close to Ein is the main strength of this anime.In fact,Reiji and Ein share the same suffering and this creates a strong bond between them. \\n\r\n2) Art is extremely good- main characters and even side characters are well drawn.\\n\r\n3) The music is good- Opening(Karma) is damn good and background music(which are mainly gothic type) are perfectly adapted to a given situation\\n\r\n4) Many many many moral values which i'm sure will teach you many things.E.g Once you killed someone, killing again will become easier\\n\\n\r\nWeakness:\\n\\n\r\n1) You will probably hate 85% characters of this series since they are always looking for power.This is a real weakness since those characters will have consequent screen time.\\n\r\n2) Too many discussions among characters which is harsh to understand but hopefully, you can understand what is going on even he you didn't understand what was being said.( It's like politics XD)\\n\r\n3) Probably, this anime in my opinion had a very slow start but things will become more and more interesting around ep12 ( however, it was interesting to follow ep1-11)\\n\r\n4) Lack of suspense at the end of most episodes which I think is quite unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nBasically,this anime is great and you should definitely gave it a try.",

            "content": "At the time of writing, I've just finished this. At first I was in doubt if I should watch this or not, because of a rather vague description.\r\nI completed this series in two days, the fastest I've ever finished an anime! For anyone deciding whether or not to watch this, that should tell you everything you need to know. \r\nHere's the good versus the bad in my opinion:\r\nGood: \r\n- Doesn't lay all the cards on the table right away. Starts off mysteriously.\r\n- Some of the best sound effects for guns I've ever heard in an anime.\r\n- Dynamic, meaningful characters. Especially the main characters show gooddevelopment throughout the series.\\n\r\n- The male main character's theme song is awesome!\\n\r\n- At times very good and fitting background music!\\n\\n\r\n- Draws you in to keep on watching :). ( okay, one more episode! ) Not by using huge cliffhangers, but the endings that make you curious.\\n\r\n- Good amount of action, but enough cleverness and bitterness sprinkled throughout the series to keep it intelligent and mature.\\n\r\n- It had a very good first half of the season because it had just the right tempo....\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\n- ... but in my opinion they lost that for the second half by slowing down a little too much.\\n\r\n- Art: the male main character's design seems kinda generic. They could've replaced him halfway by Light Yagami (from Death Note)... and I wouldn't have noticed :-).\\n\r\n- The series is not always clear and consistent with how much power some of the characters really have. One moment the series veers toward realism, and the other moment near the extreme (and impossible).\\n\\n\r\n- I listened twice to the opening and ending songs... after that I skipped it each time. Not really memorable.\\n\r\n- First let me say I expected a bitter ending. Something sugar sweet would be quite of place in this series. I would be much more content if they kept the same end-result, but used a different way to reach it. It felt like they were going mainly for shock value. If the ending would've been better, I'd give this a 9. For now it's an 8, meaning 'very good' overall!\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nDon't be mistaken however by some of my critique however. It is worth your viewing! For me it's on the same level as Steins;Gate... but not quite there yet on the level of Death Note.",

            "content": "'' I can not escape from those darkened black eyes''\r\nPhantom: Requiem of the Phantom.\r\nIf you have been captured alive and pushed to the brink of death, and as reward for survival would be your life, what would you do? If the serious question was made if you were worthy to live or should just die, what would you do?In most situations panic would break out within a normal human being. But there are some that release a kind of instinct;the power to survive. \r\nPhantom: Requiem of the Phantom is one of a kind; a series that takes their own story trough a fly staircase ofserious issue's and problems, involving survival in the extremest situations in the dark world of crimes, maffia and more. The containing tenacity leaves no room for humor or plain fan service people already get sick of nowadays, but explainsthe story the creators ment to show it to the public. And i can't deny; the story IS so completely different from the main streams onto this day. Yet, This is one of the best stories i've seen put together, keeping it still as oneof the greatest put down into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nInitially the artwork seems a bit undetailed, but that changed quickly as soon as the backgrounds and outer looks of the characters begon to roll in.\\n\r\nIt's obviously professional work, and nothing is left in vain speaking of details and clearly recognizable emotions in facial expressions.\\n\r\nThere is one particulair detail that couldn't escape my eyes: the fact that the characteristics in artwork change from the characters once the mood changes. This includes the eye shades and colors, as well the hair colors and shades used. this form of symbolism isn't used much and therefore a dare to use in an already ''different'' sort of anime than the mainstream.\\n\r\nI personally liked this alot, and i'm one of those people who can admire what other people would call ''trainwrecks''. (this is ofcourse in a limit. let's not speak about School days ever again.)\\n\r\nthe action scenes and smooth movements also add ontop of the already praisen artwork section. The only pinch in the artwork, is that it's a bit different than, as i said, usual anime's and might be a bit hard for the eye to get used to. Nontheless, the art definitely adds up to the realistic feel it already eradicates.\\n\r\n8.7/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nAlthough not expected, the story came out of a brilliant corner. It's quite unusual in the start, but is explained in an outstanding matter later on.\\n\r\n(we've had this with Steins;gate as well) Once you reach the amount of 9 episodes, you will still have the image of misunderstanding and uncertainty if you would continue to watch; and at these folks i'd like to say: Yes, keep watching. Because i tell you now; there are some anime out there which truely change something inside of your mind, or atleast influence your vision on certain subjects. This anime, is one of those, going in the groups of ''clannad: afterstory'', ''Steins;gate'' and ''Fate/zero''. The story is very serious and doesn't leave out any time and space for humor or nonsense; Build up in chaos, continues in a covered romantic relation in fear, and ends in an emotional break down.  What this animation makes so brilliant, is that they used every ending as a semi-cliffhanger. and once you start to get into the story it only gets better. This series isn't ment for people who are just looking for some time to waiste on humor or action; The writers have put all their effort in showing their anime; their story, Which they succeed in dignity and grace. \\n\r\n9.3/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe pinching comes at this part; the sound, music and intro's.\\n\r\nLet's move straight to the point: The intro is something i can't, couldn't and will never understand. it's quite offsetting on what you're trying to watch,\\n\r\nand ruins cliffhangers from the last episode. However the ending theme gives the slight effect for you to come into the chaos the story initially was dugged in. The second opening is also a mood breaker, and just can't come into my mind as the opening theme of this series. The BMG's and sound effects were brilliant, amazingly well placed and no sense of playbacks. The voice acting was splendid, couldn't recognize their voiced untill i read it up who they voiced over as well, leading me to praise this part.\\n\r\n7.6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe unique vibe already gives reason to the watcher to reconsider watching this anime, and to top it off the characters are just that extra punch who scare away watchers. It depends, what kind of watchers you're searching for. As i mentioned before, the creators wanted to put down a story on their own; not filled with ''how are we going to make them watch our show''.\\n\r\nThis is a technique which can come out so well but also so destructive. In this situation, the main ''force'' of action fans dropped after having the bitter and/or sour bite of Phantom; Requiem Phantom.\\n\r\nIn other words; The characters are very deep engraved with detail and story, even though the protagonists are brainwashed (this will be resolved later).\\n\r\nThe characters are unique, have their own ''punch'' in the characteristics and deal with situations on their own way. This also is a factor of the realism the anime carries along troughout the story. I'll have to apologize for now since revealing the unique passives they carry are all related to the plot. As last; the characters communication and respondation to eachother feel really natural and make you connect with them as well. This only as a argument; the creators do lose interest from watchers, since it envolves in something you can eventually not make a relation with. Otherwords; The story moves to a moment that you can't relate yourself to the characters at all, creating a distance, and ending in a distance between watcher and character, which isn't what it was ment to do.\\n\r\n8.9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nInitially the goal of watching this anime with Forever Exiled, was to analize the differences in types of themes revolving anime, \\n\r\nand ended up in watching the anime in shorter than 24 hours. Following the story of two assassins trapped in a life they never asked for,\\n\r\npushed forward to do the tasks they are given, and gave up on any sort of retribution to a free life. From the idea of watching an anime with a good plot,\\n\r\nwe bumped upon an anime that stroke our minds and hearts. I've seen quite some anime around, i've experienced quite some titles.\\n\r\nBut this beats the theme this anime is resided in; a drama thriller which doesn't give a **** about the opinions of the watchers, concluding in a pure story told, a story that changes something within your way of thinking, and your way of seeing things on a free life most of us have.\\n\r\nBecause there is one thing that none keeps a thought about; The most precious things.... are the most obvious ones.\\n\r\n9.8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome stories are made for entertainment, some are made for drama; but some are made to bring you something that isn't always expected initially; it changes you and influences you.\\n\r\nThat is, what ''Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom'' is. If you decide to watch a thriller, it is this one i recommend to anyone who's interested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.7\\n\r\nStory: 9.3\\n\r\nSound: 7.6\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.8\\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith this i will end this review, and i hope to see you next time ;)\\n\\n\r\n- Zumorito",

            "content": "My Opinion:\r\nThis show presents the darkness of reality, a violent world filled with betrayal, madness, deceit and sacrifices. It shows coruption at its finest and the mafia way of living and dying.\r\nIt is the story of a man who\u2019s very essence and existence is changed through brute force. It presents the protagonist\u2019s path that leads to the man he will become as well as his struggle to find the man he once was.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe premise of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is truly original, with well done plot details and carefully thought actions, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, craving for moreof this fine anime. The story starts in America, with one man in his early twenties that can not remember his past nor his identity but has a natural talent for surviving and killing people. He is given a choice, to be killed or to kill in order to live, and with this choice starts our journey along side Ein and Zwei, in the contemporan world of corruption, crime and violence, a world ruled by the crime syndicate called Inferno.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is masterfully written, it has few to no holes, it is almost perfectly paced, it is mostly reality-like and following a rational path. Love is also portayed because the protagonists know they have feelings for each other but their status as assasins makes it hard for them to follow those feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe two protagonists are standing under a constant dilemma. \\n\r\n\"What is freedom if you have to kill for it\u201d is one of the questions brought up by the protagonists. If they kill others in order to assure their survival, does that not make them evil? If they do not follow and comply with Inferno\u2019s orders, they will be killed. If they fail at their task, they will be killed. The only way to salvation from their hell is death but their own survival instincts prevent them even from attempting suicide. Thus, their life becomes a constant struggle for maintainig their hummanity in the face of impossible odds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are very well built, solid but at the same time lacking any real information about their past. Zwei and Ein are two of the greatest ambiguous characters in anime. Ein and Zwei do not care for anything in the world but their own lives. \\n\\n\r\nEin, the female lead, has no past, she is an incredibly apathetic girl of age between 18 and 22 (my educated guess). Although she may look innocent she is a trained and experimented assasin that blindly follows Scythe Master\u2019s orders. She is described by Scythe Master as having no original thoughts, no ego, no descernable personality, but she later develops a certain degree of free will and a definetly stronger personality that comes with her new name, Ellen, given by Zwei. \\n\\n\r\nZwei, the male protagonist, is a man, of Japanese origins that is traveling in America. Through Scythe Master\u2019s assasin-processing treatment he becomes a ruthless killer. Zwei later finds his true identity and birth name, Reiji Azuma, and with finding his true identity he remembers his past but decides he can not go back to his fammily after the many murders he commited. Although he is an assasin, he is very diffrent from Ein, Zwei has a strong sense of free will.\\n\\n\r\nCal is a character that is not very well done, she has no background development. The whole story and execution of Cal, seem out of place and out of pace. She is about 8 years old when Zwei takes her under his care and after the 3 years time-skip, the little girl is portrayed as an 18 years old smoking-hot lady who is the new Pahntom of Inferno and looking to kill Zwei. As soon as Cal is revealed to be the new Phantom she is portrayed as an one man army, which has not happened before in this show. In my oppinion Cal is just a weak character, arrogant and cocky for no reason. In the end, Cal only sought approval and Zwei\u2019s friendship. After Zwei\u2019s and Cal\u2019s gun fight, as she was dying, Zwei said to her, \"we made a little mistake that changed our lives forever\" and that is so very true. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character worth mentioning is Claudia McCunnen, a highly intelligent and cunning female with an important position in Inferno. She will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, unfurtunately, her character is not developed properly. \\n\r\nSomeone else worth mentioning worth mentioning is Helmut von Giusepe also known as Skythe Master, he is a doctor of psyhology and neurology that uses his knowledge in his quest to create the perfect assasin. He is the main antagonist of the show and yet his character is not developed well.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and the action scenes are well coreographed. The character design and overall art is beautfiul being displayed using a sober color palette that perfectly fits the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was nice as well, containing great songs, sort of opera songs during the dramatic and fight scenes. The opening theme was good as well, the ending theme was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nA 10/10 rating is obvious, I loved the show and there is no need for further explanations.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 10/10\\n\r\nAbout the end of the series: it is one of the most well-planned and saddest endings of all anime. The end was ambiguous and opened to speculations and yet it still added finallity to the series as a whole. \\n\r\nAlthough it is hard to digest and meaningful, the ending is beautiful. In the end, Zwei and Ein are looking up at the sky from a hayfield somewhere in Mongolia, the birth place of Ein, also the place where Zwei will be assasinated moments later.\\n\r\n\"I lived a life leaving nothing behind but shuttered dreams and broken promises\", \"I want to fulfill a promise. That is to make you smile. To find your true smile. One day I will...\" is what Zwei said moments before his death.\\n\r\nIn the leadup to Zwei\u2019s death it is hinted that he saw his end coming and accepted it, seeing Ein smiling, his final task and promise fulfilled. When Ein sees Zwei\u2019s silent collapse after being shot, she poisons herself by eating the pedal of a flower named Geramium. \"I have memories of me being with you/These memories are enough for me\" is what Ein said before she fainted away from the screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10 \\n\r\nPhantom is a truly amazing show that kept me on the edge of my seat for its duration, having a complex yet solid plot accompanied by delicate yet firm characters and coming in a package with very good animation that works in tandem with the sound.",

            "content": "Phantom explores a scenario of teenage Zwei brainwashed, wiped of his memories and forced into becoming an assassin for the crime syndicate known as Inferno. The series starts off exploring the \"what if\" scenario of a teen being conditioned into an emotionless tool with the harsh training that he is subjected to by another brainwashed teen assassin named Ein. As the series progresses and Zwei becomes immersed in the criminal underworld of Inferno, he finds himself dealing with deception, rival crime syndicates, morality and coming to learn of his lost past. There is a good amount of focus on Zwei's character in his situation ashe finds himself increasingly coming into conflict with his morality and the situation he is forced into due to Inferno's influence. Ein also gets her focus as the influence of Zwei leads her to have doubts over the loyalty programmed into her by her \"creator\", Scythe Master, and the bond between the two becomes a major focus in later episodes as both come to rely on one another in the dark world they were forced into and it is these developments that are the major strength of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother solid element was during the middle of the show's run when Zwei befriends and raises an orphaned girl named Cal in a scenario similar to the 1994 crime thriller film, The Professional. Some shocking events that develop during the later points of this arc lead to a surprising plot twist that develops into the final episodes of the series that further complicate Zwei and Ein's situation with Inferno. The ending that results in the end of the series is bittersweet, but fitting considering the dark path that the two leads were seemingly forced on tragically.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of Zwei, Ein and Cal though, depth and development on other characters in Phantom are a bit of a mixed bag. Claudia and Lizzie are given some background with their characters that reveal the former's motives for her involvement in Inferno, but not enough was explored with them for me to care for their characters. Several gangs focused on at certain points in the series with some prominent figures of them get solid focus on their personalities and motives, one of which has an influential role that can be seen throughout Phantom's second half. Others like Scythe Master, Wisemal and Phantom's leader Raymond McGuire don't get much in the way of development or depth with Wisemal and McGuire existing only to explore Inferno's power structure and Scythe Master being the cliched grandeur and corrupted scientist.\\n\\n\r\nAnother weakness of the series for me was that there are occasions where Phantom can get a bit overbearing in showing off the dark elements of its storytelling. The series likes to be quite blatant at points in depicting the thoughts of its characters as they are reflected in spoken monologues and blatant onscreen symbols of the characters such as Scythe Master taking nude pictures of Ein while she is surrounded and embraced by mannequins to show how she is nothing but a thing to him. Also while the soundtrack to the series is pleasing on the ears with its dramatic and tense pieces, some choices of insert musical tracks are occasional mood killers during the title's dramatic scenes with their overbearing melodies.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Phantom is artistically pleasing with vast and highly detailed scenic shots of various landscapes like cities and deserts, with similar efforts also being applied to the designs of characters. Action scenes are clearly the highlight of Phantom's visual presentation with many instances of fluid movement and great choreography displayed during battles with knives, firearms and hand-to-hand. Vehicles within the series are animated in CG which move as fluidly as characters in battle scenes, yet isn't smoothly integrated with the regular animation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile having some issues, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is still a solid action-drama worth looking into that delves into the developments faced by Zwei and Ein as they come to grips with the moral implications of their deeds and defy the criminal syndicate that forced them onto their dark and tragic struggles.",

            "content": "We Are Ghosts, Meant for the Shadows\r\nThe Phantom returns. What you didn't know that there was a Phantom series before this? Phantom the Animation moved in and out from the anime conscious like a ghost. Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom [Phantom] is supposed to be a remake for that tragic three part OVA, as well as extending the story. It greatly improves upon the original, but does it succeed on its own?\r\nPhantom welcomes you to the underworld, where gang families trade dollar bills and bullets, the players run the game and the game plays with their lives. Inferno, an upstart organization, backed by mysterious Mr.Mcguire,has only one objective: to unite the underworld. It's an interesting premise but not the focus of Phantom. It's sniper scope focuses on two character's Ein and Zwei, the brainwashed assassins of Scythe Master, a scientist for Inferno.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting at first, as Zwei try to come to terms with his existence and amnesia. He struggles with the idea of killing a person against surviving himself, afraid of losing his true nature in a bloodbath. It's hard for him accept the assassin credo: Kill or be killed. Ein is a desolate voice, a melancholic mentor to Zwei in the shadowy world. She has a resigned view of the world, death being the only thing defining her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is compelling , the character interaction fascinating on many levels, from the understated to romance between the leads to the slave/master relationship between Ein and her creator Scythe. It is up until the halfway point that its when the tight seams start to loosen and the edges begin to fray. The action is pushed forward with jarring plot twists and a piles of grating melodrama. Around Episode sixteen, I was concerned that the show hadn't ended after Episode 10. But I am glad I continued, as the ending was deeply satisfying, giving closure to the characters I had fallen in love with in the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThere are two halves to the art in Phantom, as excellence soon becomes underwhelming. The dark and muted palette is abandoned for brighter colors. The excellent cinematography, which contained dynamic cuts, camera angles, and used liberal shot framing from compelling viewpoints to push the unearthly atmosphere, is regrettably simplified in the second half. The character models were well made, each actor being unique, designed interestingly, and their clothes personifying their identities. That's how models should be, a reflection of the person's soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was hit or miss. The first opening was perfect, dark and brooding, the vocals strong and filled with yearning. The second one was upbeat, almost frantic in it's execution. The best piece was the second ending theme, \"Transparent\", a haunting tune that sent chills down the spine. The voice acting was sharp, though many of the seiyuu performances are strained in the second half, as the script aims to be overly dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the show is split into two halves. The first 10 episodes are engaging and will keep you hooked. From there, the show's quality decides to drive off a cliff. Its surprising to see how noticeable it is, the craftsmanship is compromised after the time lapse. But I kept watching, consumed with the desire to know how it all ended. I fell in love with Ein and Zwei and the nuggets of their interaction threaded throughout the other half pulled me along. Sticking with it, rewarded me with a great ending that returned to the style of the first few episodes, the use of atmosphere and interaction to create an emotional effect.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nPhantom is a mixed bag. It has a good start, but the trail becomes rough. At times I felt the series was too long, and would have been better off had it run a shorter schedule like Jyu-oh-sei or Shingetsutan Tsukihime, both of which paced out beautiful stories in a small amount of time. Overall, I can recommend it because of a strong beginning and finale.",

            "content": "Phantom (170108)\r\nI really wanted to love Tsubasa Chronicle. It had a nifty story idea and I do like CLAMP\u2019s work because it tends to throw a curve ball right at you when you least anticipate it, so I expected great things. However\u2026it\u2019s in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w\u2026\r\nI was reading up on Tsubasa Chronicle and found that it was animated by Bee Train. Fast forward a couple of months and I randomly picked up Phantom. As I watched the Op, I noticed that this show was animated by Bee Train.\r\nHmm.\r\nWell, it turns out that either Bee Train is exceptionally inexpensive or unusually inept because Phantom is in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w\u2026\r\nCoincidence? Idon\u2019t know.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever watched filler episodes in a long-running show and noticed how all the main characters\u2019 IQs drop several points as they try to figure out the solution to a problem that should by all rights not be a problem for them anymore? That\u2019s how all of the characters in Phantom act, all of the time. You\u2019re sitting there constantly wondering, 'why did she do that?' Why did he do that? Why did they do that? Character motivations make little to no sense. At first, I thought perhaps it was because there was some twist that they were going to pull that would explain why nothing was as it seemed but having just finished the show, I have to sadly inform you that is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, something happens, time skips, repeat. When I say \u201csomething,\u201d it\u2019s invariably something that doesn\u2019t make the slightest bit of sense. They assassinate people in the middle of large crowds, leaving evidence everywhere, they case locations they don\u2019t do anything in, and other such stupid things. At one point, there\u2019s a manhunt in which some characters can\u2019t find people who are in exactly the same place they\u2019ve been living for weeks, if not months. This location is not just known to everyone, it\u2019s even been visited by all the major characters. ~_~; One of the antagonists wants to hunt down and kill someone because of a misunderstanding. The other character tries to explain at one point but then they suddenly stop because someone at Nitro+ or Bee Train realized that if it was explained to the angry character, there was no way they could possibly continue.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start, the two main characters are empty husks: mere assassins who do as they are told. They're supposed to be super-amazing and they're shown as being really effective for one entire mission. Then it's flashback time and you're forced to watch Assassin #2's humble beginnings unfold in an in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w fashion. After that, they're really clumsy and sloppy for the most part, as noted above. It's really surprising how inept these two ultimate killing machines are. They murder loads of people in the course of the show, but there are way, way too many times when some random person walks up behind them and they\u2019re completely surprised. Maybe they\u2019ve gone deaf from firing guns all the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of the story is the relationship between the amnesiac girl assassin who has no emotions and the amnesiac boy assassin. Um, if she's always acting and has no emotions of her own, how can they possibly form a relationship? There are no character-building moments between them, so viewers have no emotional investment in them as they have zero emotion between them. Yet somehow this relationship is supposed to be a driving force in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother large problem with the story is that for about 2/3 of the show, the story is NOT about the main characters. It's about a bunch of other people you glimpse in the background. It would be like if Duck Tales episodes were mostly spent on Launchpad flying from place to place as opposed to Scrooge and company having adventures. After each episode, I wrote summaries of what had just happened. For the most part, it was \"nothing.\"\\n\\n\r\nA weak story doesn\u2019t mean the show has to be bad but the show is almost entirely serious so you don\u2019t even have humor to distract you from these brooding characters doing completely illogical things. There were let's see, about two light-hearted moments in the whole mess.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to animation, I have to report there really isn\u2019t very much. After a couple of minor fight scenes in the beginning, it becomes sliding pictures for the most part. I was astonished when they animated crowd scenes but I guess they had money saved up from not animating the rest of the show. It\u2019s not as bad as say, Unwatchable Machine-Doll but they certainly seemed to strive for that. The only really animated bits are the CGI cars, which impress no one. If I was after rendered cars, I\u2019d go play a racing game, which now that I think about it, would likely have a stronger plot and better characters. Halfway through the show, they drop the art quality a bit and animate a little more but the show looks really low budget and with how in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026wly the horrible story is paced, I think they should've edited the show down to something actually tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you read a book, you have a plot and characters. When you watch an animated show, you have plot, characters, music, camera angles, pacing, acting, art, and animation. Here\u2019s the scorecard (out of 5) for Phantom.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 1 (There are some okay moments but they're only moments.)\\n\r\nCharacters - 2 (They could be likable if they were in a different show.)\\n\r\nMusic - 3 (Unobtrusive but it\u2019s hard to build emotional impact to dramatic events that make no sense.)\\n\r\nCamera angles - 2 (Mostly functional but they do like being upside-down and artsy. However, since nothing happens in the show, this makes it feel like style over substance.)\\n\r\nPacing - 0 (It also has inappropriate flashbacks, yay!)\\n\r\nActing - 3 (I can\u2019t fault the actors trying to work with the shoddy material.)\\n\r\nArt - 2 (It's okay at first but then drops noticeably later, which is when the animation picks up a little.)\\n\r\nAnimation - 2 (It's pretty stiff.)\\n\\n\r\nSorry to hand out another \"unwatchable\" rating but I'm trying to save you 650 minutes. There are no fun characters, interesting moments, clever ideas, beautiful art, stellar animation, or creative stories. If you still don't believe me, feel free to watch it but at least skip the epilogue. Please.",

            "content": "It's a fairly common trend in just about most action mediums, whether it be anime or not, to focus more on the action than the story. Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is part of that minority which focuses more on the story, and I have to say that it does a really good job of doing so without taking away from what makes an action medium well... an action medium.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story follows the twisted and tragic life of Zwei, a teenage boy who has no recollection of his past, and is forced to become an assassin under the guidance of Ein, also known as\"Phantom\", who, like Zwei, has no recollection of her past, and is a highly trained assassin, or more like a near-invincible human weapon. This is all done under the supervision of \"Scythe Master\", a maniacal scientist with a calm demeanour, whose only goal in life is seemingly to create near-invincible human weapons or \"Phantoms\" just like Ein. He is contracted by a growing mafia organisation called Inferno who wishes to use his \"Phantoms\" to help seize ultimate control of the mafia underworld.\\n\\n\r\nNow that's quite a load of information to take on before starting this anime and the entire premise of the story regarding Inferno takes time to develop and be fully explained. When things have been established and the story starts to take shape is when this anime really starts to get good. What this information fails to tell you though is that there are essentially three parts to the story, each being separated by a time skip of considerable length. Each part has its own merits and can be somewhat different to each other, and some people are sure to like one part more than the other two.\\n\\n\r\nEach part explores different themes and develops the characters in different ways. The first part explores the growing relationship between Ein and Zwei, and follows their interactions with Inferno. The second part introduces Cal Devens, a young girl, who is taken in by Zwei in his attempt to find something or someone worth protecting and giving his life for. And the third part takes elements from the previous two parts and concludes the story in a tragic and bittersweet way.\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little I can actually fault the story with. There are a few plot holes, both major and minor. However, I feel as though the effect they had on how I viewed the story was extremely minimal. Unlike other plot holes in other anime that I viewed recently, I was able to overlook them with ease and continue immersing myself in this gripping tale.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the decisions the characters made throughout this anime really pissed me off. Like REALLY. There were few times during which I couldn't comprehend exactly what was going on in the minds of the characters, especially given how smart and cunning most of them are. If they made stupid decisions that had minor consequences, then I would've overlooked them like I did with the plot holes. However, considering the potential impact that most of these decisions had and the fact that characters were later going to contradict an earlier decision they already made, it really pissed me off that they decided to make such a decision. It's almost as though the creators wanted to forward the story by making the characters complete retards when they needed a calm head the most. There were arguably much better ways for the story to progress and much better ways in which such ways could be achieved. (Sorry for the mild profanity but this was really something I needed to get off my chest)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are where it shines most. There are three main characters, being Ein, Zwei, and Cal, alongside an interesting supporting cast, consisting mainly of members of Inferno and \"uncooperative\" mafia groups.\\n\\n\r\nEin, Zwei, and Cal are developed almost perfectly. Each character has to live through events which change them, and their personality and attitude. For example, Zwei may be a cold hearted assassin yet he has a sense of morality which is continually explored throughout the anime, and through the exploration of this single trait, he changes and becomes a different person by the end of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is not explored very much at all. While there were somewhat interesting, they weren't interesting enough for us to really want to get to want to know more about. I personally believe that this is how a supporting cast is meant to be. They aren't meant to outshine the main characters. However, the anime gives us backstory about Lizzie and Claudia, a female duo who works in the higher ranks of Inferno's hierarchy. And I'm going to be honest, I didn't care about their backstory. While they do play somewhat major roles in the anime, their backstory is not needed at all. I cared very little for them because I was already engrossed with the main characters and their development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI've never ventured to say I hate an opening or closing from an anime. And I was extremely tempted to say it regarding the openings and closing of this anime. I'm sure there are people who like it but I dislike the style of music used and I never ever bothered to watch any of the openings or closings following listening to them my first time.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the background music in this anime is superb. From the gangster music which was constantly played throughout the first and second parts to the music used during the more tear-jerking moments, particularly in the third part, I loved it all. It constantly helped emphasise the atmosphere and really immerse myself in this anime. I want to specifically point out some of the music in the third part. Without spoiling too much, I'd like to say that the distorted sound and the groaning of a woman really emphasised how messed up everything eventually got in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom with english dubs. Now, I always feel like there is a rule which states that if an anime is set in an English speaking country, then the dubs are decent, if not better than decent. I can safely say that the statement still holds true in this anime. Ein and Zwei are bland due to their cold-hearted demeanours but showed their colourful side when needed. Cal's voice throughout the second part was that of pure innocence and young excitement, something which this anime was certainly lacking. The voice acting of the supporting cast was also really well done. Cunning and sly characters like Claudia always spoke in a suggestive and calm tone, while brutish and large characters always spoke with authority and confidence.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. The colours used mostly seemed darker in tone, and many scenes were in the dark which always added to the mafia underworld premise which the anime is set in.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was even greater. Everything from the fight scenes, to the firing of bullets, to the splatters of blood, to what I like to call the \"Phantom eyes\", to driving cars were all animated extremely well. Everything felt smooth and flowed nicely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI could've also give this category a 5/10 because things didn't go the way I wanted and the decisions some characters made just pissed me off big time. I'm going to be honest and say that it really hurt my heart to see things didn't end up the way I wanted but that's the beauty of a good anime. Things shouldn't be predictable nor should they go the way that the fans want it to. (But please let there be a remake where things end up the way I want them to)\\n\\n\r\nI love Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. It contained great action scenes, an immersive story, and a strong cast of characters. After every episode, I had the feeling I normally get when I watch a good anime; one where I let out a huge breath because I was so immersed in it that it feels as though I forget to breathe or one where I kick my legs in frustration because I want to really know what happens next. I recommend this anime to just about anyone because it has great action for the action anime fans but also a great story for those who aren't exactly into action.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and hope you enjoyed! Any feedback is much appreciated.",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom\r\nDeception is what describes this anime for me, i was so hooked since the first ep. and on ep. 13 or 14 i was thinking this was an 8 and before ep. 11 a 9 but in every ep. after 14 i felt that the quality of not only the story but everything was dropping and i ended feeling frustration because of the direction this was taking, also it reminded me of Noir and what i found out was that Bee Train was behind both animes, that's why Ein is really similar to Kirika, just like the lack of bullet holes,big organizations behind things and ''winning'', and both endings are similar; I saw people were pointing out that the ending was changed from the VN game and that it had different endings, so why Bee Train likes tragic endings? and this should be labeled as supernatural too.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nI don't know how to make a review for this story without spoiling but i will do my best. A story about puppets, betrayal, and nonsense, a lot of nonsensical crap; At first it begins really strong, i was hooked even from the first 5 min, it was developing well with a serious tone and a very good story, everything alright until ep. 10 where things that couldn't make sense happens, plot holes happens, it was stupid that one person took a bullet to save someone that should obviously die and then reappear later as an ''enemy'' but turns out that this person is there to be with this other person because of the promise and that was really stupid, it would have been like that since the beginning if ''it'' didn't put in front of the bullet to save the bad dude, it makes no sense, and at the same time the story was a mess or was dropped, and it was more focused on destroying the good character development to what they were before, i don't understand why Zwei promised to advenge a random woman he didn't know and why would he bring flowers to the crime scene, he didn't knew her; And then in ep. 17 to 19 there was a scene that didn't match, please pay attention to those eps. the ending on 17 and the other side point of view of the same event in ep. 19 (like if it was an alternate happening, but is not, because it wouldn't make sense) this was one of the things that frustrated me the most and ep. 20 just killed the story, how come a girl almost 11 or 12 in two years becomes a biker model with big magumbos and bubble butt? it's ridiculous, that was really stupid, i wanted to drop this right there and i never drop an anime but i was glad it had 5 eps. left; It felt like Zwei was dumb, he could try to fully explain the things, but he never tried to talk to Drei, it doesn't hurt to try you know; Ep. 26 wasn't that bad, good action, the ending was bad tho and not because it wasn't happy because i have seen more tragic animes with dark, hopeless ending but because it was bad, the story was a mess filled with gap holes without explanation, plot holes and more to consider it good ending. The story was fine till ep. 17. I can go on on pointing out the plot holes, gap holes, things that didn't make sense, the bad decisions made etc. but that would take too long.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe best asset from the anime, the animation, it was very good for the year it was released but it could be better, sometimes it wasn't smooth, i don't have complaints about the animation other than the lack of bullet holes on the enemies and only appeared on important enemies and that takes away my enjoyment, not seeing more ''realistic'' deaths was bothering, just like with Noir.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt was good, sometimes repetitive and not fitting and some other sounds were absurd, like the sex moaning track and others, the first OP is great, the second one is awful, really bad, just why? and both EDs were very good with interesting videoclips. VA was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were doing great until everything went backwards in the 2nd arc, Zwei was growing to be my fav. on this anime but he was going downhill for what i stated, and i didn't care what happened to him from there on, i was disappointed how well the characters developed after the events despite the plot holes of ep. 10, i'm not going to go deep on the characters because i feel too disappointed to do it, the thing is that at the end the characters were fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI was having a big time at the beginning but i was getting bored and pissed with the story decision, the bad directing, the all kind of holes, the disappointment with this anime is big, i don't know but from a 9 to a 6.5 from me shows how at the beginning to half the eps. i was enjoying it to how disappointed i was at the end.",

Hope this helps someone decide if they want to watch the series :)\r\nStory\r\nThe highlight of the story was the relationships that develop between the main cast, mainly the relationships that occur from both the female leads towards the male lead, I found this to be very interesting as they were both complex yet quite different relationships.\r\nUnfortunately, likely due to the strength of the main relationships, the interactions regarding the remaining characters were simply underwhelming.\r\nThe story was quite dark and confronting at times, touching on strong themes such as struggling with personal identity andsome decisions that really did shock me morally. \\n\r\nA time skip also occurs which adds another level of depth to the series, seeing the changes that occurred with each character was another highlight of the series.  As the changes were quite significant, and came about not only by each characters individual choices, but also due to the combined effect of the surrounding cast choices.\\n\r\nOverall the story was great, with its numerous plot twists, even though I didn't fully agree with the scenarios that occurred towards the end of the series, it still kept me hooked till the very end.  \\n\r\nThis is also one of the few series that I have looked back on after finishing, and thought about how significant a minor change of events would have altered the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFirstly let me say this series has probably the best cinematography I have ever seen in Anime to date, resulting in some really great looking scenes.\\n\r\nSome low quality/errors in the animation do occur, but they are very rare and weren't enough to distract me from enjoying the series.\\n\r\nThe lighting was very good, and considering the tone of the anime this was quite important, also the colour scheme and art style was very crisp and clean.\\n\r\nThe art style for each of the characters, had both their clothing and appearance reflect their personality well. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice acting was solid all-round, but was exceptional from the two lead females of the series. \\n\r\nThe music was very well done, including quite a wide range, from dramatic opera pieces to new age techno beats, which seem to kick in at just the right moments during action/dramatic scenes.  \\n\r\nBoth the opening/ending themes are well made, and even reflect the journey of the main cast throughout the series of trying to escape to a brighter life but still being trapped by their past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe main cast was outstanding, with each character grabbing my attention, in particular one of the female leads, who would have to be one of the best female characters I have seen in Anime so far.\\n\r\nUnfortunately the side cast simply are not fleshed out enough, and I found it hard to care about their own personal ideals.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMost of anime I have seen so far tend to have slow starts, this on the other hand grabbed my attention from the very first episode.  Unfortunately I didn't quite enjoy the series as much towards the end of the time skip, mainly due to some choices and scenarios I found hard to believe, as previously mentioned.  However overall I really enjoyed the series, and am very glad I decided to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAn exceptional series, something a bit different from anything I have watched so far.  I recommend anyone who is considering watching this series to just do it!  You won't regret it!\\n",

They may try to go after a new life and start again but the fact that they messed up before will haunt them forever.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nPrepare yourselves as you will be taken into a world full of violence, betrayal, deceit, and madness. You will be in the edge of your seats as every episode is an action packed episode. Everyone has the ability to kill or will kill when they think that their survival is being threatened. The protagonist chose a path that will change his life drastically. Not likehe wanted to go to that path, more like they forced him to. Love is also portrayed because both of the protagonist know that they have feelings for each other but their status makes it hard for them. Also, time skips made this series more interesting as it will suprise the viewers since everything and everyone had change after it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was great. They were some animation errors but you will forget them as you will be satisfied with the great and magnificent sceneries. The fighting and the shooting scenes were great too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was very nice. You'll be feeling like you're inside an opera room. Those falcetto notes during fights and dramatic events really helped. It deepened the impact on the viewers which makes it more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nWhen interraction is made, relationship starts to form. As our main assassins work together since they are partners in crime, they realize that they have feelings for each other. Add another girl, in which you wouldn't expect what would happen to her,and you get a love triangle. The organization, Inferno, also plays an important rolw because they are the ones who control and manipulate the strings of everyone. Organization so big that everyone in the underworld fears them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSuperb. It was very exciting. After seeing an episode, you'll just keep longing for more and more because every episode leaves you hanging. There are also a lot of sudden turn of events, ohh the irony. I really enjoyed it more after the time skip. The settings and the roles changed drastically that it'll make you be like \"OHH YEAA .\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat series, I recommend it to everyone. You will not feel regret.",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a prime example of a show that is too overrated by fans, who easily overlook some gaping plot holes, and downgraded into oblivion by haters, who cannot see anything but those plot holes. I think this show sits somewhere in between: it is a fine show to watch, nothing exeptionally great, but not bad either. If you're trying to decide on watching this, let this be your decision after 1/2 episodes: do you like the character relationship of Ein and Zwei? Go on. If you do not, don't bother with the show. I will try to provide my argumentswith as few spoilers as possible, but I cannot completely guarantee a spoiler-free review. Here goes.\\n\\n\r\n== Story == 7\\n\r\nThere are essentially two layers to this anime. On the superficial level, you have your standard mafia-esque corporations trying to gain more power, with the main corperation being Inferno. The distributions in power are a little vague in the beginning, but as the show goes on, one can see that higher-ups in the corperation are allowed a great deal of freedom when it comes to handling problems. Bosses will frequently go behind each other's back to solve personal problems. This would make for quite an interesting story of intrigue, but is a little dulled by the second layer of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe second layers revolves around our two main protagonists, Ein and Zwei. The complex relationship that these two characters have makes for quite an interesting main character cast, but I felt its relationship overshadows the story of Inferno and its attempt at gaining more power in the underworld. \\n\\n\r\nI found myself a little disappointed when the show shifted from the intriguing development of the main characters to highlight the structure and plans of Inferno. I understand that this is necessary for the plot to advance and therefore for the characters to even develop, but hope you also get what I mean by this. The story also suffers from an insanely large plothole, which I could not overlook and I will talk about in the Characters section. \\n\\n\r\n== Characters == 7\\n\r\nThe main characters is where the show truly shines, but is also a big downfall. Ein, being completely brainwashed now has to work together with Zwei, who is in the process of being completely brainwashed, but deep down is heavily conflicted. I loved how their relationship was set up, being purely platonic and bland at first, but slowly turning into something deeper that I will not explain to avoid spoilers. There were times that I completely loathed the decisions they made, which was proof for me that I was quite heavily invested in the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs with the story, the main characters overshadow the supporting characters, who are in this case mostly Inferno members. This ties into the more 'boring' superficial layer of the story. It was also nice to see that the show pulls off quite a few risky plot-twists, some of which work out greatly, while others fail horribly. \\n\r\nThis leads me to a plot hole, so gapingly large that it almost swallows the entire show. This is also why many people are so put off by this show. About 75% in, there is a time skip of two years. Some characters haven't aged a day, while another turned from a child to an adolescent in a mere two years. Not only is this completely illogical, it was also not even necessary to keep the story going. The story and characters suffer immensely from this. Until the end of the show, I could not get over this. Your opinion on the show will most likely hinge on this specific time skip. I was really put off by this, but continued to watch anyway. The opening and ending also change after this time skip, which made this plot hole even more terribly obvious. Judge this how you will, but you cannot deny the irregularities that this time skip brought. \\n\\n\r\n== Animation == 7\\n\r\nThe animation is good. There is nothing wrong with it, but it isn't amazing either. Some characters, often ladies, are sometimes irregularly shaped (scenes with weirdly long legs or unevenly sized breasts), but the rest looks good. Characters look great, are nicely animated and some painting-like scenery fleshes them out well, while giving you that artsy feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing bothered me though, and that has to do with the fan service. In the first minute of the first episode you will see a half-naked lady lying on the beach. BAM! Two tits in your face. While there is nothing wrong with that, I immediately thought: 'Oh it's going to be like that, huh?' But it wasn't. During the rest of the show, the animators went out of their way to not fully show nudity, to the point of unrealistic, nippleless, naked girls, which makes me wonder what the use of that very first scene was to begin with. You have the R+ rating already, so just show nudity when it is appropriate, or fully go out of your way to show nudity, and avoid naked ladies without nipples altogether. \\n\\n\r\n== Sound == 8\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The opening song sets the mood nicely, while tracks in the anime always fit the scenes. Some soundtracks are so great or are so obviously made to make you feel a particular emotion, that it can even feel out-of-place in some scenes. It is just too present and obvious sometimes, but most of the time augments the show perfectly. The second opening and ending songs are used after the time skip for the last few episodes, which made me feel weird, almost insulted. For me there was no reason why they should change the songs to make the time skip even more obnoxious.\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment == 7\\n\r\nThere were times when I was heavily invested in the main characters, only to be pulled out again by a dull side-story or hateful decisions some characters make. I still cannot fathom some of the plot twist inducing decisions that were being made and can ultimately also not say that I always enjoyed this show. A few times I just sat there, looking at my screen and asking: 'Why the fuck did you have to do that?' Sometimes the show dragged on for a bit too long on a specific subject or side-story, making me wonder if it had been better for the show if it had a few less episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPeople have been comparing this show to Black Lagoon a lot, but I must warn you that apart from the mafia groups and the conflicts of the main protagonist, the mood, setting and goal of the shows are completely different. Black Lagoon is much more action-oriented, while Phantom focuses more on character development.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this is not a bad show. It is not amazing either. It's just decent. You will probably like it if you like the relationship of the main characters, but do not try to sell this as the greatest anime ever made, as its flaws are too obvious to ignore. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Phantom is simply a mess. It's a mesh of fine ideas that ultimately is not executed well and ends up with a lot of wasted potential. Let's dive down deeper to see how Phantom ended up. \r\nThis review contains minor spoilers after the \"Read More\" mark.\r\nPhantom consists of 3 main arcs, each separated by a recap episode, and each focusing on 3 different characters, Ein, Zwei and Drei, although with Zwei being an important character throughout. The story starts of with an interesting premise of an amnesiac man being manipulated by a shady organization.\r\nHowever this thread is very quickly resolved when he learns of hisidentity 3 episodes in. And Zwei, oh Zwei isn't known for making rational or even normal decisions. I mean, how else did he get himself stuck in this situation am I right? Several times in the series I really question his true motivations or even reasons for carrying out certain actions, not because of some mysterious plot thread or engaging character behavior, but because of shoddy character writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters aren't any better in this regard. Ein is your standard emotionless girl who finds emotion through main protagonist stereotype and is absolutely dependent on someone else, be it Zwei or Evil Doctor person to live. Her character development is cliche as all hell, and ultimately she isn't much likable as a result. \\n\\n\r\nDrei on the other hand is more entertaining. She is a lot more enjoyable than the other 2 characters when it comes to her scenes, although her character motivations are just terrible. I won't go much into her reasons for being in the plot, but it feels so shoved in and terribly written that I couldn't garner any sympathy for her plight.\\n\\n\r\nThe other side characters are pretty forgettable. The main antagonist is an evil doctor whose name I forgot and is always one step ahead of the protagonists but has nothing substantial about him. He's evil and depraved and that pretty much sums up his entire character. Near the end he becomes a lot more theatrical and a lot more entertaining but that still doesn't redeem any of the previous moments involving his character.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the issue of the overall plot. The plot is competent enough, but the characters and the pacing drag it down significantly. The pacing in particular ratchets up so quickly near each arc's end that the audience would be left confused and tired by it's conclusion. The third arc manages it all best, where Zwei and Ein are more likable/less dumb and Drei always makes for interesting encounters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has very bad problems managing its themes/messages. One of the main themes the series attempts to showcase is that a name isn't everything and one should live to be oneself. This theme is delivered in the first arc when Zwei told Ein to ditch her old name and live anew, saying that she shouldn't be retrained by a name. Ironically afterwards he starts calling her Eren and expects her to abide by and live by that arbitrary name he gave her. Ein even calls him out on this but the show just ignores this and thinks it has written something profound or meaningful or something. It's ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the ending which is just terrible. It differs from the original visual novel by purposely altering it slightly to make it a bad ending but doing so completely defeats the purpose of the protagonists' journey and is also inconsistent with the previous parts of the anime where they could eat up bullets without needing too much medical attention. It's just bad.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot more I could go on about but I should just stop here. Phantom isn't worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "I can imagine many people bashing their heads against the wall trying to write a review for this anime without revealing spoilers; so I'm going to do this as best as possible... \r\nPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom. One thing for sure is that this is one masterfully written and awesomely portrayed bit of story telling. In the twenty six episodes you'll find that you keep saying to yourself: \"just one more episode\", since it is almost impossible to watch just one episode at a time. (I gave the story a solid 10/10).\r\nThe art and sound department did a superb job (the opening theme \"Karma\" inparticular is amazing, I'm ordering the OST that's for sure). English Dub fans will recognize most voices too. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are like none other. Character development is amazing, all are brilliantly depicted and each has their own unique 'aura'. The relationships between characters, the twists & turns; it's all is part of this awesome bit of story telling. Character design was without a doubt engineered towards stirring emotions, you will unknowingly become immersed in their world(s) and be eager to find out what happens next (going back to what I said earlier).\\n\\n\r\nThe way it throws you around with plot twists, action, betrayals and emotions... it truly is one awesome roller coaster... to carry on with that analogy: just imagine this superb roller coaster, a few aches and pains from the ride, you're left feeling euphoric, only to realise it's still not quite over.\\n\r\nI'll leave it at that. sorry, but that's just one of the ways this anime really does it's magic.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to nit-pick but there are a few minor things here & there, but they're all easily forgotten. For example it's fairly evident who the real 'baddy' is early on (it would involve spoilers too so please excuse if I don't elaborate). loose ends are definitely my only main grievance with this anime. Believe me you will say: \"did I just hear that!?\" at one point... \\n\r\nSo if you're a fan of action, hit-man/criminal syndicate, psychological thrillers; or if you just needed convincing, you will not regret picking up this anime.",

            "content": "This show is a classic case of: Good Idea, Bad Execution\r\nIt starts off simply enough with an intriguing (if all-too-common) storyline and interesting, shadowy characters. The first few episodes are pretty strong, focusing mainly on the development of the main protagonist and his interactions with his new employers and colleagues. I was eager to find out what would happen next, and in my eagerness, I ignored all the signs of what would come. \r\nVery quickly the story takes a very cliched turn, and the characters become little more than billboards of irrationality. The motivations of the protagonists, antagonists, and pretty much everyone in the show,suddenly become contradictory to their earlier actions, thoughts, and reactions. The plot develops, rather quickly, from a biting psychological-thriller, into a predictable and unrealistic drama. \\n\\n\r\nNot to spoil anything, but the hardened and brutal criminals of the first few episodes suddenly become weak and ineffectual, the anonymous, silent killers suddenly become flashy and all-too-eager to shout their names and identities from the rooftops. And of course, the calculating villains seem utterly incapable of understanding even the simplest of human motivations. It becomes all too easy to predict what will happen by simply having watched a multitude of bad television and feature films. If it's a cliche, it's probably used. If it makes little sense considering the setting, it probably occurs. Some people may think I'm being too harsh here, but the unrealized potential of the story makes the decisions of the writers and directors all the more questionable. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story begins to reach it's climax, one is forced to question the relevance of some major characters and earlier plot-developments. Little attention is payed to developing the rationale behind the decisions that the characters make; villain and \"hero\" (there are no real heroes here) alike simply act so that the plot can be advanced. Unfortunately, the plot advances in the least interesting and most predictable ways, and is itself full of holes. For example, a time-skip of two years leaves us with some people who look like they've not grown either physically or emotionally, and other characters who don't even closely resemble their earlier selves.\\n\\n\r\nThe result of the bad decisions made by the writing and directing teams is that some viewers lose interest in the outcome of the story, or the fate of the characters. Indeed, it is difficult in some ways to find the energy to care about the development of the plot and characters, when 90% of the time, your first guess is the right one. Actions are taken that seem to have no inner meaning or relevance to the actual story. Motivations which seemed ludicrous are revealed to be just that: ludicrous. Any hints that this may all be the design of some mastermind are left forgotten and we come to find out that the villains and \"heroes\" are all just that dumb. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I find it difficult to rate this series as anything above mediocre. The art and music are all perfectly fine, though one particular theme is overplayed. The story is intriguing, if one is not looking for complexity or depth, and is not expecting something \"new\" or very creative. The characters are often interesting on the surface, but upon closer inspection, they become one-dimensional and sometimes, very contradictory. The drama is contrived and the plot-holes begin to weigh down any emotional value the events may be trying to convey. The ending was, in my opinion, fitting for such a series: cliche and not very well-executed. What started off great was, sadly, doomed to failure. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 5/10. In some ways this is too harsh, but in others it is far too lenient. Stories that don't take risks are usually boring and not enjoyable, but stories that take risks have to deliver. In my humble opinion, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom took plenty of risks, but almost none of them payed off in the end. The higher one flies, the harder one falls. \\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I will put a quote from my brother about the show that I think summarizes it perfectly:\\n\\n\r\n\"It was like someone wanted to make a hard, biting, psychological show about assassins, but wanted to make it for an audience of fifteen year old girls.\" \\n\\n\r\n((((After Edit: Upon further reflection, I have decided that this is perhaps the worst anime ever made, and have appropriately given it a 1 score. I have left the original review intact however.))))",

            "content": "Personally the idea of a secret organization hidden in the underground has always sent a small chill down the spine.  One of thrill and a small yearn of wanting to join in on the fun.   Grunge, guns, passion, hate, emptiness, lust, power, suits, death, and fancy cars; these are some of things that is offered in this forbidden and hidden world.  At first glance it looks like a life worth trying out, but the void that can be created within one\u2019s mind can become the very undoing of their life.  Zwei is one of the most detailedcharacters I have experienced thus far that exhibits this trait.\\n\r\n    What happens when you take a person, someone of a certain \"innocence\", chase them down, try to kill them and then brain wash them into doing the bidding of this underground world, with the reward of just their life?  I for one have never experienced anything like that from the external or an internal source of the material world, so my input on a realistic level is incorrect.  Although, one thing that I can speculate on is the psychological formula of one's thought process and emotional response, thus understanding the turn that could occur and stir inside the heart of this character. \\n\r\n   This one minute characteristic of the show was the selling point that instant.  Being a sucker for cute boys is a weakness of mine, but the devoid Zwei captivated the \"poor lost soul\" gap within me. The artist nature of his hollow eyes, blank expression, and puppet like movements coincide with the response that would be fitting for the overall effect in the story.  The choice of when to have Zwei react in an emotional ran state or \u201cphantom\u201d state was right on the mark.  There has never been a point in time that the \u201cinternal drama\u201d lingered for too long, another winning aspect of Phantom.  \\n\r\nThe amount of conflict, emotional response and actions taken all fit together perfectly with no leftovers.  The feelings of dissatisfaction, confusion, bewilderment, or boredom have not occurred yet while watching this animation.  Waiting for the main climax to take shape tickles with excitement as the story unfolds and the characters become enveloped in the mix.  Seeing all of this from a non living organism makes me want to experience it even more, maybe not personally, but from a third person perspective.  To see this type of behavior develop in a real person would be something that someone faint of heart would not be able to accomplish; the absolute demise of a once innocent and \u201cliving\u201d person.  Do you want to see what happens when someone lives so close to death?\\n\\n",

            "content": "My thirst for gun action animes had grown after watching Hellsing Ultimate and Black Lagoon, and somehow, this particular anime showed up in my recommendations quite frequently. So I gave it a try.\r\nPLOT\r\nIt started off with a Japanese young man where he founds himself in a room. Having completely no idea about his reasons for being there and his identity, he tried to explore where he was. It was only then he was \"attacked\" by a girl named Ein. It was then shown that he was experimented in an abandoned outlet in the States to test his abilities and skills. Next, he realized that hismemories were lost and he was ultimately forced to work for a large mafia company known as Inferno. He was also given a new name called Zwei. Throughout his jobs, psychological thoughts were tested, manipulated and toyed. I liked how it deals with the mind, about how life feels being abandoned and trapped but you're still urging for an escape. That was how the plot goes. Slowly as the plot progressed, we could see Inferno's goals, the aristocrats' battle for power in the group, the struggle for freedom and of course, betrayal. Ein and Zwei also got closer in their relationship to fight for an escape but was hesitated by doubt and premonitions. I really liked how they played with your mind honestly speaking. But that was how it all started. There were risky but nicely planned plot twists albeit some parts were blurry in terms of where the plot wanted to go. It started off slow, but managed to pick up. The first part was a bumpy ride of despair and hope basically speaking. The second part was the separating point between Ein and Zwei. After Zwei acknowledged his true identity, a tragic incident transpired that caused him to switch paths which ultimately he met a young girl by a chance encounter. A new hope was revived and a new progress was revealed. Although there were more depth relating to power, escape and evil, the psychology was dealt greatly. But after another turning point of a tragic misunderstanding, everything that continued right after that was underwhelming. The third part of the plot became unclear due to a huge gap of time. The psychological aspects were suddenly forgotten, and everything was solely for the sake of a longer, useless plot that felt silly. It's an anime that progressed simply when something hopeful comes up, it's ultimately thrown away by another stupid tragedy only to be compensated by another flicker of hope that's fated to be destroyed once more. The reason for that? I'm guessing it's for masochism. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind multiple tragedies to prolong the story, but when you run out of fresh ideas, it's better not to add another twist that doesn't seem like a fine deal, I don't buy it. With the plot getting unsteady towards the end, the authors perhaps decided to add some more bitter icing to their distasteful cake that not only made it taste worse, but it became inedible. The aforementioned ending obliterated the plot's whole progression, the characters' motives and basically makes you feel horrible. Not only that, it served up as an obviously huge plot hole. I won't tell what but you could probably tell how bad it was coming from me. It was messed up so bad that ultimately, it only tells you this: Nothing in this show, including goals and dignity and essence, actually matters. There's no reason why you need to accomplish something. Which is why the plot was, as I said, wrecked terribly.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nThis anime was made in 2009, but it wouldn't mean that I'll give it some leniency for this. I do have reasons. First off, this anime had considerable amounts of fanservice, even at the second minute of the first episode you already get two \"you know what\" right in your face. However, nudity was, thankfully, not exaggeratedly conspicuous, but still, I can't seem to find reasons for these occurrences, which means that they were unnecessary. The character designs were pretty much bland and lackluster and not consistent all of the time but the backgrounds of the show were brilliant. Action scenes were great though. However, it was awkward seeing different contrasts that didn't compliment each other which felt somewhat incomplete. On the other hand, this anime had two opening and ending animations. As for the first opening and ending, I'll admit it was pretty damn good. It portrayed the mood of the songs perfectly and it was one of the few animes that seem really artistic. Truly, very well done. But, as for the second opening and ending, it burned my eyes. The second opening looked as if it came from a regular slice-of-life show which absolutely couldn't click with the pessimistic song that was playing along with it. The second ending was very lacking in animation compared to the first one and wasn't much to see. In conclusion, the animation is noticeably inconsistent and occasionally lackadaisical.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was actually really good in my opinion. Every track that played in a particular scenario fitted well. Some were good while others were actually really great. I did notice that there were two or more tracks that were remixed in terms of genre to fit the mood of a scene which I have to admit it was pretty ingenious. Repetitiveness may be an issue but the tracks still complimented every scene, and that's more important. The singular genres were diverse ranging from chant, violin, progressive rock, folk, orchestral and even music box while the fusion ones were pretty unique like techno chant, ambient folk with contemporary piano concerto and happy trance mixed with music box and drum 'n' bass. I'm loving the fusion ones more than the singular ones actually, but there's still room for the soundtrack to reach a top-tier level. As for the two opening and ending themes, they were all fantastic. Ali Project and Kokia done a beautiful job in conveying the anime's theme with neoclassical genres to give it an authentic feel to it. The soundtrack's great, but it's such a shame that the animation couldn't keep up with some of the intense or chaotic tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the anime's strongest point, but it was also its greatest downfall. The development for the main characters were great and thorough as the plot progressed slowly -- showing the bonding between them as they attempt to escape from the relentless struggle of acquiring freedom. Psychological standpoints from the characters (normally the mains) were dealt in a way that seemed realistic enough to be almost ingenious when it comes to decision making. But secondary characters were a bit lacking and unclear in character development. There were glimpses of their past, probably it gave them the drive of persistence, but it was still insufficient enough to determine their motives, which sometimes made their decisions seemed unappeasable towards me despite the actual plot had a major impact on it. But I felt that some characters were probably, no offense, dumb in making decisions. Most of the time during the last five episodes I was saying: \"Why the heck do you do that?!\" or \"How in the world could you even have that sort of mentality?!\" Basically, the characters' decisions and motives were disappointingly shallow which gave off to cliche, silly and predictable drama. But at least the anime gave us an advice: Always check your building even if it's blown up.\\n\\n\r\nPROGRESSION\\n\r\nIt started off slow, but managed to pick up its pace just fine in which the show was narrated in an initially unclear form to a clear and transparent understanding of every party striving for their own goal. My only problem with the progression was the third part, and it's always that! It felt tedious and long-winded because it's predictable and not suspenseful. Because of that, the final battle of the show was rushed and didn't seemed to give off a sense of finality that it felt somewhat illogical for it to be rushed due to the plot holes. Even when the main villain was defeated, it didn't feel decisive at all, as if something was lacking. Some major plot holes were obvious enough to be seen with the naked eye that it felt unsatisfactory when it ended, because it wasn't complete. No, it didn't even receive closure. It stopped right before the closure and credits just rolled and that was it. The finale was never shown because something bad was added that was never explained -- which created the biggest plot hole ever.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nI had been criticising lots of points of Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom, mainly it was because of the third part of the plot that messed up its original brilliance, which I felt biased already. It was initially enjoyable, I'll admit that. I really enjoyed the music as well. But what creates satisfaction is not how it started, but how it ended. It's the show's ending that's more important than its beginning. And since there isn't a sequel, the plot holes will forever remain in your interpretation. Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom started off strongly and interestingly, but gradually loses its grounds and topples.\\n\\n\r\nAnd deliberating over the ten traits of the anime: plot, characters, music, animation, artwork, progression, voice acting, setting, opening/ending and my personal enjoyment, my verdict for this is a 6.3/10.",

If your not into and loving this show after the early episodes, drop it, because that's as good as it's going to get, it doesn't turn the corner and will continue as more of the same.",

            "content": "What's our reason for existence? We all have one, but often, those reasons were given to us before we were even born. Most of us have the luxury of being surrounded by friends, family, siblings, etc. But what happens when we're completely stripped of all of those, and are thrown out to find a new existence on our own? \r\nStory - 9:\r\nThe core plot of Requiem for the Phantom centers around one's pursuit of one's reason to exist. To find one's place in the world. And as the viewer quickly discovers, successfully accomplishing this is quite an ambitious task. This is due to the factthat the environment itself forbids such concepts. In the dark, chaotic underworld, assassins are trained to be ghosts, empty beings that only do, never question. Deviation from this is frowned upon, and only guilt and regret awaits those who even try to stray from this rule. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot therefore quickly spirals into a tug of war between the will of the characters, and the environment they're in. As such, the events themselves revolve much around a single decision. Which is better? Being a ghost of non existence doing only as ordered so, but as a result feeling no guilt or sin, or having an existence, but feeling the regret of all the sins one has committed? \\n\\n\r\nHow the plot progresses, is through changes in each character's perspective on the above question. As each episode goes by, you'll feel as if they're \"growing\", gaining new intuition through their interactions with each other. They begin to see new beauty in the world that they've never seen before, eventually, reach their own respective decisions to \"the question\". The anime's definition of \"at least at peace.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe brilliance of the plot itself lies in how well weaved together everything is. Each action has an implication, and each implication has an effect. Each effect creates an emotion, and each emotion affects how the characters perceive the world, and themselves. Nothing is wasted. Every minute of each episode had a reason for being there, and taking any of them away would harm the overall experience. In fact, you'll be surprised how many times you'll ask yourself \"what would I have done?\". \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as sentimental and philosophical as the plot is, it isn't perfect. Along the path of ambition that the creators have taken, there are definitely a few hiccups. There are two points within the plot that suffer from what I call, \"time lapse syndrome\". A point in the story of which a character has a certain personality and attitude/behaviour, and then after a screen caption of \"x months later...\", their personality completely changes. Because we're not shown the events inbetween, only the before and afters, it makes the viewer feel as if the creators simply ran out of time, and decided to leave the rest up to our imaginations. Nothing wrong with using the imagination of the viewer to develop the plot of course, but the fact that we're not shown the complete picture does hurt the progression of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I think the L.A. skyscrapers looked better in this anime than in real life. The artistic style used not only compliments incredibly well with the dark atmosphere of the anime, but also in bring out L.A's \"true colours\" if you will. All in all, it's evident that the creators took the time in creating a world that was thoroughly believable visually. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, like with the art, the OSTs compliment the anime quite well. The falsettos compound the experience during dramatic situations, and the epic beats make those fights seem even more badass. Both the opening and the ending songs are quite catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, each character in the series existed to provide different perspectives on the same environment. They also act as the messengers that pass on the morals and consequences of events of the anime onto the viewer. It is also because of this diversity of personalities represented through each character that makes the series so compelling and enjoyable. It's consistently interesting to see how each character addresses their own issues based upon their own morals and goals, and how their different decisions bring upon them different consequences later on. For example, the behaviour of one character might show that too much ambition eventually backfires, while another may show that intense love could quickly turn into intense hate. \\n\\n\r\nThe choice for the two main characters were also excellent. The personalities of Zwei and Ein compliment each other perfectly. While Zwei eventually develops his own will, Ein remains trapped, without her own will, and therefore unable to act on her own unless ordered to. The journey that the two take together to reclaim Ein's past is so emotional because you understand very early on, that both of them, were just innocent bystanders tossed into a world that doesn't make sense. Yet it is because of this, that each of their achievements feel so much more worthy. And it is also the reason why this series does so well in delivering the emotion of losing oneself completely, and then slowly reclaiming what you have lost. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the series does also trip slightly over it's own ambition. The large character base meant that some characters didn't get the development that they deserved, while others didn't even get to contribute to the plot because they were introduced so late. But in light of everything that's going on, these were very small errors that will hardly be noticeable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nRequiem for the Phantom is one of those animes that will suck you in from episode one, and take you on a journey of deception, deceit and a slight hint of hope, of which you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat until the very end. It's one of those animes that will make you think and relate to the characters, and perhaps even change your own perspective on life...for better or for worse. \\n\\n\r\nBut above all, it's an anime that shows that even the darkest of worlds aren't completely devoid of light, and after you've finished watching it, it'll have left an impact that you'll never forget. \\n",

            "content": "This anime is disgustingly underrated. Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is an adaption of the visual novel, Phantom of the Inferno by Gen Urobuchi. The show contains much of Gen\u2019s dark and twisted depiction of reality. Characters are subjected to cruel fates, true despair, and most importantly the anime shows that \"hope\" is merely an elusive and fleeting illusion in our (in)humane world. The main focus of the anime is the idea of the perfect assassin. It is about crafting the mindset an assassin needs; how assassins are mere inhumane tools for psychopathic people. Requiem for the Phantom crafts a palpable sense of despair andanguish in people. \\n\\n\r\nIn our world, there are a plethora of gangs, mafias, and terrorist organizations. At the center of the story, the mysterious uprising organization, Inferno assassinates targets mercilessly with their invincible secret weapon, \"Phantom\". Inferno's goal? Bring forth a new era. What does that even mean?\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Reiji Azuma (though it's never revealed if that's even his true name) wakes up in an unknown building in the middle of nowhere with absolutely no memory of anything, and out of nowhere gets attacked by an assassin. That's when his killer survival instinct kicks in, and he flashes potential as a legendary assassin. The mysterious assassin who's later revealed as \"Ein\", a emotionless teenage girl, and her mad scientist master, \"Master Scythe\", decide to brainwash and train Reiji into an assassin for their organization, Inferno. Given the name \"Zwei,\" this once peaceful boy is now a puppet of Inferno. Drawn into a world of darkness, lies, deceit, and violence, Zwei must fight to survive, hopefully to one day regain his memories and escape from this world where he is constantly on the brink of death. As the plot thickens and darkens, Zwei and Ein seem to build a bond of love/friendship as they yearn for the truth of reality. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime started with unlimited potential, but later it became rather barren. At first, the shadows behind Inferno were interesting to look out for. What is their motif for murder? What's this \"new era\" that they envision? Then our main characters, Zwei and Ein... They are 2 of the greatest, ambiguous characters in all anime. What's their identity? Nobody remembers who they are, so do they truly exist? If they are killing others in order to survive, doesn't that make them evil? Throughout the entire anime, the dilemma presented here for Zwei and Ein, was intriguing and deep. They have absolutely no attachments to anything in the world but their own lives. If they do not comply with Inferno\u2019s orders, they will be killed. If they fail at their duty, they will be killed. Their own survival instincts prevent them even from attempting suicide. So, it truly becomes a struggle for maintaining one\u2019s humanity in the face of impossible odds. Unfortunately, not all characters got the development they should of gotten, and some VERY stupid \"character\" things happened. Lizzie (Reiji's boss) and Claudia, two members of Inferno, show up quite frequently in the anime, playing a role in Reiji's decisions on how to live. But, the anime never shows us their motif, what they personally want, and how they became who they are. In fact, Lizzie was completely dropped after a few episodes, she just disappears... Scythe Master shows up at the beginning of the anime as the main psychopathic antagonist of the anime. He is behind the creation of phantoms, and plotting of the ruthless murders other people. But, why is he doing this? We don't know. That is the biggest flaw. The main antagonist should have a back story and a motif, but nope; completely random. Another flaw that I really was upset about was the coming of age for Cal Devins, the 3rd main character in the anime. Cal was a little girl (looks like 8) that tried to hire Zwei thinking he was a killer for justice, by using money she had unknowingly stolen from Inferno. When Inferno tried to kill Cal, Zwei hid and protected her (humanistic side), but through tragic events, they were separated. Then there was a 3 year time-skip and suddenly Cal, who was a little innocent girl turned into a super smoking hot 18-year old chick that is the new Phantom of Inferno, after Zwei and Ein run away from the organization to live in peace and find their real identity. Furthermore, Cal got no background development, such a disappointment. Really in general, until the last about third of the anime, the main characters really didn't get much development at all, they could have done MUCH better.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the anime was mediocre, BUT it fit the anime perfectly. All the soundtracks were sinister, and mysterious fitting in perfectly with the overall dark mood of the anime. Unfortunately for the lack of a variety of soundtracks, the anime seems to repeat the same soundtracks over and over... and over again, so it gets kind of repetitive and it loses it's suspense. I think in one episode, Canzone of Death (best soundtrack in anime) was repeated 4 times in a span of 15 minutes; that's how you ware out a song. Anyways, the opening and endings for Requiem for the Phantom were certainly unique and once again, fit in perfectly with the mood of the anime. The opening, Karma is such a neat piece of opening. The lyrics described the start and repetition of life, the aimless wanderings in search for the truth, bringing forth inner peace, and finally reaching the end. The art is same as any other dark anime really... Nothing special, but nothing bad about the art. I will mention that I liked the portayal of the precise, keen movements and senses of the Phantoms. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is Requiem for the Phantom worth watching? Look at the score; YES! Requiem for the Phantom stays true to itself until the very end the end. It does not opt out for any easy answers, or simplify the darkness of reality, and it manages to maintain a sense of class. The ending is truly of the saddest, most well-planned ending of all time. The ending was ambiguous, yet still had sense of finality to the work as a whole. I enjoyed it, I cried throughout, I felt a pinches of pain, and I learned a life lesson. Requiem for the Phantom is a meaningful anime, and certainly an anime that I'd recommend to anyone that can withstand watching an anime with no comedy relief, just pure darkness.",

            "content": "In my opinion, Phantom Requiem will may be figure in the top10 anime of the year 2009.\r\nPhantom Requiem is firstly an anime where you need to be attentive, in fact, mafia members in that anime often discuss about plans,strategies which are quite difficult to understand.However, the most fascinating side of that anime resides in the relationship between Reiji/zwei and Elen/Ein.I would say that the main theme of this anime is FREEDOM.\r\nPhantom Requiem is an anime for those who mostly love drama since the story of Elen and Reiji is very touching.Therefore, if you are searching for impressive scenes of actions and suspense, I suggest thatyou don't expect more from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStrength of this anime:\\n\\n\r\n1) Drama is very good- following how Reiji becomes more and more close to Ein is the main strength of this anime.In fact,Reiji and Ein share the same suffering and this creates a strong bond between them. \\n\r\n2) Art is extremely good- main characters and even side characters are well drawn.\\n\r\n3) The music is good- Opening(Karma) is damn good and background music(which are mainly gothic type) are perfectly adapted to a given situation\\n\r\n4) Many many many moral values which i'm sure will teach you many things.E.g Once you killed someone, killing again will become easier\\n\\n\r\nWeakness:\\n\\n\r\n1) You will probably hate 85% characters of this series since they are always looking for power.This is a real weakness since those characters will have consequent screen time.\\n\r\n2) Too many discussions among characters which is harsh to understand but hopefully, you can understand what is going on even he you didn't understand what was being said.( It's like politics XD)\\n\r\n3) Probably, this anime in my opinion had a very slow start but things will become more and more interesting around ep12 ( however, it was interesting to follow ep1-11)\\n\r\n4) Lack of suspense at the end of most episodes which I think is quite unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nBasically,this anime is great and you should definitely gave it a try.",

            "content": "At the time of writing, I've just finished this. At first I was in doubt if I should watch this or not, because of a rather vague description.\r\nI completed this series in two days, the fastest I've ever finished an anime! For anyone deciding whether or not to watch this, that should tell you everything you need to know. \r\nHere's the good versus the bad in my opinion:\r\nGood: \r\n- Doesn't lay all the cards on the table right away. Starts off mysteriously.\r\n- Some of the best sound effects for guns I've ever heard in an anime.\r\n- Dynamic, meaningful characters. Especially the main characters show gooddevelopment throughout the series.\\n\r\n- The male main character's theme song is awesome!\\n\r\n- At times very good and fitting background music!\\n\\n\r\n- Draws you in to keep on watching :). ( okay, one more episode! ) Not by using huge cliffhangers, but the endings that make you curious.\\n\r\n- Good amount of action, but enough cleverness and bitterness sprinkled throughout the series to keep it intelligent and mature.\\n\r\n- It had a very good first half of the season because it had just the right tempo....\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\n- ... but in my opinion they lost that for the second half by slowing down a little too much.\\n\r\n- Art: the male main character's design seems kinda generic. They could've replaced him halfway by Light Yagami (from Death Note)... and I wouldn't have noticed :-).\\n\r\n- The series is not always clear and consistent with how much power some of the characters really have. One moment the series veers toward realism, and the other moment near the extreme (and impossible).\\n\\n\r\n- I listened twice to the opening and ending songs... after that I skipped it each time. Not really memorable.\\n\r\n- First let me say I expected a bitter ending. Something sugar sweet would be quite of place in this series. I would be much more content if they kept the same end-result, but used a different way to reach it. It felt like they were going mainly for shock value. If the ending would've been better, I'd give this a 9. For now it's an 8, meaning 'very good' overall!\\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\\n\r\nDon't be mistaken however by some of my critique however. It is worth your viewing! For me it's on the same level as Steins;Gate... but not quite there yet on the level of Death Note.",

            "content": "'' I can not escape from those darkened black eyes''\r\nPhantom: Requiem of the Phantom.\r\nIf you have been captured alive and pushed to the brink of death, and as reward for survival would be your life, what would you do? If the serious question was made if you were worthy to live or should just die, what would you do?In most situations panic would break out within a normal human being. But there are some that release a kind of instinct;the power to survive. \r\nPhantom: Requiem of the Phantom is one of a kind; a series that takes their own story trough a fly staircase ofserious issue's and problems, involving survival in the extremest situations in the dark world of crimes, maffia and more. The containing tenacity leaves no room for humor or plain fan service people already get sick of nowadays, but explainsthe story the creators ment to show it to the public. And i can't deny; the story IS so completely different from the main streams onto this day. Yet, This is one of the best stories i've seen put together, keeping it still as oneof the greatest put down into an anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nInitially the artwork seems a bit undetailed, but that changed quickly as soon as the backgrounds and outer looks of the characters begon to roll in.\\n\r\nIt's obviously professional work, and nothing is left in vain speaking of details and clearly recognizable emotions in facial expressions.\\n\r\nThere is one particulair detail that couldn't escape my eyes: the fact that the characteristics in artwork change from the characters once the mood changes. This includes the eye shades and colors, as well the hair colors and shades used. this form of symbolism isn't used much and therefore a dare to use in an already ''different'' sort of anime than the mainstream.\\n\r\nI personally liked this alot, and i'm one of those people who can admire what other people would call ''trainwrecks''. (this is ofcourse in a limit. let's not speak about School days ever again.)\\n\r\nthe action scenes and smooth movements also add ontop of the already praisen artwork section. The only pinch in the artwork, is that it's a bit different than, as i said, usual anime's and might be a bit hard for the eye to get used to. Nontheless, the art definitely adds up to the realistic feel it already eradicates.\\n\r\n8.7/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nAlthough not expected, the story came out of a brilliant corner. It's quite unusual in the start, but is explained in an outstanding matter later on.\\n\r\n(we've had this with Steins;gate as well) Once you reach the amount of 9 episodes, you will still have the image of misunderstanding and uncertainty if you would continue to watch; and at these folks i'd like to say: Yes, keep watching. Because i tell you now; there are some anime out there which truely change something inside of your mind, or atleast influence your vision on certain subjects. This anime, is one of those, going in the groups of ''clannad: afterstory'', ''Steins;gate'' and ''Fate/zero''. The story is very serious and doesn't leave out any time and space for humor or nonsense; Build up in chaos, continues in a covered romantic relation in fear, and ends in an emotional break down.  What this animation makes so brilliant, is that they used every ending as a semi-cliffhanger. and once you start to get into the story it only gets better. This series isn't ment for people who are just looking for some time to waiste on humor or action; The writers have put all their effort in showing their anime; their story, Which they succeed in dignity and grace. \\n\r\n9.3/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe pinching comes at this part; the sound, music and intro's.\\n\r\nLet's move straight to the point: The intro is something i can't, couldn't and will never understand. it's quite offsetting on what you're trying to watch,\\n\r\nand ruins cliffhangers from the last episode. However the ending theme gives the slight effect for you to come into the chaos the story initially was dugged in. The second opening is also a mood breaker, and just can't come into my mind as the opening theme of this series. The BMG's and sound effects were brilliant, amazingly well placed and no sense of playbacks. The voice acting was splendid, couldn't recognize their voiced untill i read it up who they voiced over as well, leading me to praise this part.\\n\r\n7.6/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe unique vibe already gives reason to the watcher to reconsider watching this anime, and to top it off the characters are just that extra punch who scare away watchers. It depends, what kind of watchers you're searching for. As i mentioned before, the creators wanted to put down a story on their own; not filled with ''how are we going to make them watch our show''.\\n\r\nThis is a technique which can come out so well but also so destructive. In this situation, the main ''force'' of action fans dropped after having the bitter and/or sour bite of Phantom; Requiem Phantom.\\n\r\nIn other words; The characters are very deep engraved with detail and story, even though the protagonists are brainwashed (this will be resolved later).\\n\r\nThe characters are unique, have their own ''punch'' in the characteristics and deal with situations on their own way. This also is a factor of the realism the anime carries along troughout the story. I'll have to apologize for now since revealing the unique passives they carry are all related to the plot. As last; the characters communication and respondation to eachother feel really natural and make you connect with them as well. This only as a argument; the creators do lose interest from watchers, since it envolves in something you can eventually not make a relation with. Otherwords; The story moves to a moment that you can't relate yourself to the characters at all, creating a distance, and ending in a distance between watcher and character, which isn't what it was ment to do.\\n\r\n8.9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nInitially the goal of watching this anime with Forever Exiled, was to analize the differences in types of themes revolving anime, \\n\r\nand ended up in watching the anime in shorter than 24 hours. Following the story of two assassins trapped in a life they never asked for,\\n\r\npushed forward to do the tasks they are given, and gave up on any sort of retribution to a free life. From the idea of watching an anime with a good plot,\\n\r\nwe bumped upon an anime that stroke our minds and hearts. I've seen quite some anime around, i've experienced quite some titles.\\n\r\nBut this beats the theme this anime is resided in; a drama thriller which doesn't give a **** about the opinions of the watchers, concluding in a pure story told, a story that changes something within your way of thinking, and your way of seeing things on a free life most of us have.\\n\r\nBecause there is one thing that none keeps a thought about; The most precious things.... are the most obvious ones.\\n\r\n9.8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome stories are made for entertainment, some are made for drama; but some are made to bring you something that isn't always expected initially; it changes you and influences you.\\n\r\nThat is, what ''Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom'' is. If you decide to watch a thriller, it is this one i recommend to anyone who's interested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.7\\n\r\nStory: 9.3\\n\r\nSound: 7.6\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.8\\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith this i will end this review, and i hope to see you next time ;)\\n\\n\r\n- Zumorito",

            "content": "My Opinion:\r\nThis show presents the darkness of reality, a violent world filled with betrayal, madness, deceit and sacrifices. It shows coruption at its finest and the mafia way of living and dying.\r\nIt is the story of a man who\u2019s very essence and existence is changed through brute force. It presents the protagonist\u2019s path that leads to the man he will become as well as his struggle to find the man he once was.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe premise of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is truly original, with well done plot details and carefully thought actions, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, craving for moreof this fine anime. The story starts in America, with one man in his early twenties that can not remember his past nor his identity but has a natural talent for surviving and killing people. He is given a choice, to be killed or to kill in order to live, and with this choice starts our journey along side Ein and Zwei, in the contemporan world of corruption, crime and violence, a world ruled by the crime syndicate called Inferno.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is masterfully written, it has few to no holes, it is almost perfectly paced, it is mostly reality-like and following a rational path. Love is also portayed because the protagonists know they have feelings for each other but their status as assasins makes it hard for them to follow those feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe two protagonists are standing under a constant dilemma. \\n\r\n\"What is freedom if you have to kill for it\u201d is one of the questions brought up by the protagonists. If they kill others in order to assure their survival, does that not make them evil? If they do not follow and comply with Inferno\u2019s orders, they will be killed. If they fail at their task, they will be killed. The only way to salvation from their hell is death but their own survival instincts prevent them even from attempting suicide. Thus, their life becomes a constant struggle for maintainig their hummanity in the face of impossible odds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are very well built, solid but at the same time lacking any real information about their past. Zwei and Ein are two of the greatest ambiguous characters in anime. Ein and Zwei do not care for anything in the world but their own lives. \\n\\n\r\nEin, the female lead, has no past, she is an incredibly apathetic girl of age between 18 and 22 (my educated guess). Although she may look innocent she is a trained and experimented assasin that blindly follows Scythe Master\u2019s orders. She is described by Scythe Master as having no original thoughts, no ego, no descernable personality, but she later develops a certain degree of free will and a definetly stronger personality that comes with her new name, Ellen, given by Zwei. \\n\\n\r\nZwei, the male protagonist, is a man, of Japanese origins that is traveling in America. Through Scythe Master\u2019s assasin-processing treatment he becomes a ruthless killer. Zwei later finds his true identity and birth name, Reiji Azuma, and with finding his true identity he remembers his past but decides he can not go back to his fammily after the many murders he commited. Although he is an assasin, he is very diffrent from Ein, Zwei has a strong sense of free will.\\n\\n\r\nCal is a character that is not very well done, she has no background development. The whole story and execution of Cal, seem out of place and out of pace. She is about 8 years old when Zwei takes her under his care and after the 3 years time-skip, the little girl is portrayed as an 18 years old smoking-hot lady who is the new Pahntom of Inferno and looking to kill Zwei. As soon as Cal is revealed to be the new Phantom she is portrayed as an one man army, which has not happened before in this show. In my oppinion Cal is just a weak character, arrogant and cocky for no reason. In the end, Cal only sought approval and Zwei\u2019s friendship. After Zwei\u2019s and Cal\u2019s gun fight, as she was dying, Zwei said to her, \"we made a little mistake that changed our lives forever\" and that is so very true. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character worth mentioning is Claudia McCunnen, a highly intelligent and cunning female with an important position in Inferno. She will stop at nothing to achieve her goals, unfurtunately, her character is not developed properly. \\n\r\nSomeone else worth mentioning worth mentioning is Helmut von Giusepe also known as Skythe Master, he is a doctor of psyhology and neurology that uses his knowledge in his quest to create the perfect assasin. He is the main antagonist of the show and yet his character is not developed well.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and the action scenes are well coreographed. The character design and overall art is beautfiul being displayed using a sober color palette that perfectly fits the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was nice as well, containing great songs, sort of opera songs during the dramatic and fight scenes. The opening theme was good as well, the ending theme was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nA 10/10 rating is obvious, I loved the show and there is no need for further explanations.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 10/10\\n\r\nAbout the end of the series: it is one of the most well-planned and saddest endings of all anime. The end was ambiguous and opened to speculations and yet it still added finallity to the series as a whole. \\n\r\nAlthough it is hard to digest and meaningful, the ending is beautiful. In the end, Zwei and Ein are looking up at the sky from a hayfield somewhere in Mongolia, the birth place of Ein, also the place where Zwei will be assasinated moments later.\\n\r\n\"I lived a life leaving nothing behind but shuttered dreams and broken promises\", \"I want to fulfill a promise. That is to make you smile. To find your true smile. One day I will...\" is what Zwei said moments before his death.\\n\r\nIn the leadup to Zwei\u2019s death it is hinted that he saw his end coming and accepted it, seeing Ein smiling, his final task and promise fulfilled. When Ein sees Zwei\u2019s silent collapse after being shot, she poisons herself by eating the pedal of a flower named Geramium. \"I have memories of me being with you/These memories are enough for me\" is what Ein said before she fainted away from the screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10 \\n\r\nPhantom is a truly amazing show that kept me on the edge of my seat for its duration, having a complex yet solid plot accompanied by delicate yet firm characters and coming in a package with very good animation that works in tandem with the sound.",

The series starts off exploring the \"what if\" scenario of a teen being conditioned into an emotionless tool with the harsh training that he is subjected to by another brainwashed teen assassin named Ein. As the series progresses and Zwei becomes immersed in the criminal underworld of Inferno, he finds himself dealing with deception, rival crime syndicates, morality and coming to learn of his lost past. There is a good amount of focus on Zwei's character in his situation ashe finds himself increasingly coming into conflict with his morality and the situation he is forced into due to Inferno's influence. Ein also gets her focus as the influence of Zwei leads her to have doubts over the loyalty programmed into her by her \"creator\", Scythe Master, and the bond between the two becomes a major focus in later episodes as both come to rely on one another in the dark world they were forced into and it is these developments that are the major strength of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother solid element was during the middle of the show's run when Zwei befriends and raises an orphaned girl named Cal in a scenario similar to the 1994 crime thriller film, The Professional. Some shocking events that develop during the later points of this arc lead to a surprising plot twist that develops into the final episodes of the series that further complicate Zwei and Ein's situation with Inferno. The ending that results in the end of the series is bittersweet, but fitting considering the dark path that the two leads were seemingly forced on tragically.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of Zwei, Ein and Cal though, depth and development on other characters in Phantom are a bit of a mixed bag. Claudia and Lizzie are given some background with their characters that reveal the former's motives for her involvement in Inferno, but not enough was explored with them for me to care for their characters. Several gangs focused on at certain points in the series with some prominent figures of them get solid focus on their personalities and motives, one of which has an influential role that can be seen throughout Phantom's second half. Others like Scythe Master, Wisemal and Phantom's leader Raymond McGuire don't get much in the way of development or depth with Wisemal and McGuire existing only to explore Inferno's power structure and Scythe Master being the cliched grandeur and corrupted scientist.\\n\\n\r\nAnother weakness of the series for me was that there are occasions where Phantom can get a bit overbearing in showing off the dark elements of its storytelling. The series likes to be quite blatant at points in depicting the thoughts of its characters as they are reflected in spoken monologues and blatant onscreen symbols of the characters such as Scythe Master taking nude pictures of Ein while she is surrounded and embraced by mannequins to show how she is nothing but a thing to him. Also while the soundtrack to the series is pleasing on the ears with its dramatic and tense pieces, some choices of insert musical tracks are occasional mood killers during the title's dramatic scenes with their overbearing melodies.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Phantom is artistically pleasing with vast and highly detailed scenic shots of various landscapes like cities and deserts, with similar efforts also being applied to the designs of characters. Action scenes are clearly the highlight of Phantom's visual presentation with many instances of fluid movement and great choreography displayed during battles with knives, firearms and hand-to-hand. Vehicles within the series are animated in CG which move as fluidly as characters in battle scenes, yet isn't smoothly integrated with the regular animation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile having some issues, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is still a solid action-drama worth looking into that delves into the developments faced by Zwei and Ein as they come to grips with the moral implications of their deeds and defy the criminal syndicate that forced them onto their dark and tragic struggles.",

            "content": "We Are Ghosts, Meant for the Shadows\r\nThe Phantom returns. What you didn't know that there was a Phantom series before this? Phantom the Animation moved in and out from the anime conscious like a ghost. Phantom: Requiem for a Phantom [Phantom] is supposed to be a remake for that tragic three part OVA, as well as extending the story. It greatly improves upon the original, but does it succeed on its own?\r\nPhantom welcomes you to the underworld, where gang families trade dollar bills and bullets, the players run the game and the game plays with their lives. Inferno, an upstart organization, backed by mysterious Mr.Mcguire,has only one objective: to unite the underworld. It's an interesting premise but not the focus of Phantom. It's sniper scope focuses on two character's Ein and Zwei, the brainwashed assassins of Scythe Master, a scientist for Inferno.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is interesting at first, as Zwei try to come to terms with his existence and amnesia. He struggles with the idea of killing a person against surviving himself, afraid of losing his true nature in a bloodbath. It's hard for him accept the assassin credo: Kill or be killed. Ein is a desolate voice, a melancholic mentor to Zwei in the shadowy world. She has a resigned view of the world, death being the only thing defining her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is compelling , the character interaction fascinating on many levels, from the understated to romance between the leads to the slave/master relationship between Ein and her creator Scythe. It is up until the halfway point that its when the tight seams start to loosen and the edges begin to fray. The action is pushed forward with jarring plot twists and a piles of grating melodrama. Around Episode sixteen, I was concerned that the show hadn't ended after Episode 10. But I am glad I continued, as the ending was deeply satisfying, giving closure to the characters I had fallen in love with in the first half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThere are two halves to the art in Phantom, as excellence soon becomes underwhelming. The dark and muted palette is abandoned for brighter colors. The excellent cinematography, which contained dynamic cuts, camera angles, and used liberal shot framing from compelling viewpoints to push the unearthly atmosphere, is regrettably simplified in the second half. The character models were well made, each actor being unique, designed interestingly, and their clothes personifying their identities. That's how models should be, a reflection of the person's soul.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was hit or miss. The first opening was perfect, dark and brooding, the vocals strong and filled with yearning. The second one was upbeat, almost frantic in it's execution. The best piece was the second ending theme, \"Transparent\", a haunting tune that sent chills down the spine. The voice acting was sharp, though many of the seiyuu performances are strained in the second half, as the script aims to be overly dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the show is split into two halves. The first 10 episodes are engaging and will keep you hooked. From there, the show's quality decides to drive off a cliff. Its surprising to see how noticeable it is, the craftsmanship is compromised after the time lapse. But I kept watching, consumed with the desire to know how it all ended. I fell in love with Ein and Zwei and the nuggets of their interaction threaded throughout the other half pulled me along. Sticking with it, rewarded me with a great ending that returned to the style of the first few episodes, the use of atmosphere and interaction to create an emotional effect.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nPhantom is a mixed bag. It has a good start, but the trail becomes rough. At times I felt the series was too long, and would have been better off had it run a shorter schedule like Jyu-oh-sei or Shingetsutan Tsukihime, both of which paced out beautiful stories in a small amount of time. Overall, I can recommend it because of a strong beginning and finale.",

            "content": "Phantom (170108)\r\nI really wanted to love Tsubasa Chronicle. It had a nifty story idea and I do like CLAMP\u2019s work because it tends to throw a curve ball right at you when you least anticipate it, so I expected great things. However\u2026it\u2019s in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w\u2026\r\nI was reading up on Tsubasa Chronicle and found that it was animated by Bee Train. Fast forward a couple of months and I randomly picked up Phantom. As I watched the Op, I noticed that this show was animated by Bee Train.\r\nHmm.\r\nWell, it turns out that either Bee Train is exceptionally inexpensive or unusually inept because Phantom is in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w\u2026\r\nCoincidence? Idon\u2019t know.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever watched filler episodes in a long-running show and noticed how all the main characters\u2019 IQs drop several points as they try to figure out the solution to a problem that should by all rights not be a problem for them anymore? That\u2019s how all of the characters in Phantom act, all of the time. You\u2019re sitting there constantly wondering, 'why did she do that?' Why did he do that? Why did they do that? Character motivations make little to no sense. At first, I thought perhaps it was because there was some twist that they were going to pull that would explain why nothing was as it seemed but having just finished the show, I have to sadly inform you that is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, something happens, time skips, repeat. When I say \u201csomething,\u201d it\u2019s invariably something that doesn\u2019t make the slightest bit of sense. They assassinate people in the middle of large crowds, leaving evidence everywhere, they case locations they don\u2019t do anything in, and other such stupid things. At one point, there\u2019s a manhunt in which some characters can\u2019t find people who are in exactly the same place they\u2019ve been living for weeks, if not months. This location is not just known to everyone, it\u2019s even been visited by all the major characters. ~_~; One of the antagonists wants to hunt down and kill someone because of a misunderstanding. The other character tries to explain at one point but then they suddenly stop because someone at Nitro+ or Bee Train realized that if it was explained to the angry character, there was no way they could possibly continue.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start, the two main characters are empty husks: mere assassins who do as they are told. They're supposed to be super-amazing and they're shown as being really effective for one entire mission. Then it's flashback time and you're forced to watch Assassin #2's humble beginnings unfold in an in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w fashion. After that, they're really clumsy and sloppy for the most part, as noted above. It's really surprising how inept these two ultimate killing machines are. They murder loads of people in the course of the show, but there are way, way too many times when some random person walks up behind them and they\u2019re completely surprised. Maybe they\u2019ve gone deaf from firing guns all the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of the story is the relationship between the amnesiac girl assassin who has no emotions and the amnesiac boy assassin. Um, if she's always acting and has no emotions of her own, how can they possibly form a relationship? There are no character-building moments between them, so viewers have no emotional investment in them as they have zero emotion between them. Yet somehow this relationship is supposed to be a driving force in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother large problem with the story is that for about 2/3 of the show, the story is NOT about the main characters. It's about a bunch of other people you glimpse in the background. It would be like if Duck Tales episodes were mostly spent on Launchpad flying from place to place as opposed to Scrooge and company having adventures. After each episode, I wrote summaries of what had just happened. For the most part, it was \"nothing.\"\\n\\n\r\nA weak story doesn\u2019t mean the show has to be bad but the show is almost entirely serious so you don\u2019t even have humor to distract you from these brooding characters doing completely illogical things. There were let's see, about two light-hearted moments in the whole mess.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to animation, I have to report there really isn\u2019t very much. After a couple of minor fight scenes in the beginning, it becomes sliding pictures for the most part. I was astonished when they animated crowd scenes but I guess they had money saved up from not animating the rest of the show. It\u2019s not as bad as say, Unwatchable Machine-Doll but they certainly seemed to strive for that. The only really animated bits are the CGI cars, which impress no one. If I was after rendered cars, I\u2019d go play a racing game, which now that I think about it, would likely have a stronger plot and better characters. Halfway through the show, they drop the art quality a bit and animate a little more but the show looks really low budget and with how in\u2026cred\u2026ibly s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026wly the horrible story is paced, I think they should've edited the show down to something actually tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you read a book, you have a plot and characters. When you watch an animated show, you have plot, characters, music, camera angles, pacing, acting, art, and animation. Here\u2019s the scorecard (out of 5) for Phantom.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 1 (There are some okay moments but they're only moments.)\\n\r\nCharacters - 2 (They could be likable if they were in a different show.)\\n\r\nMusic - 3 (Unobtrusive but it\u2019s hard to build emotional impact to dramatic events that make no sense.)\\n\r\nCamera angles - 2 (Mostly functional but they do like being upside-down and artsy. However, since nothing happens in the show, this makes it feel like style over substance.)\\n\r\nPacing - 0 (It also has inappropriate flashbacks, yay!)\\n\r\nActing - 3 (I can\u2019t fault the actors trying to work with the shoddy material.)\\n\r\nArt - 2 (It's okay at first but then drops noticeably later, which is when the animation picks up a little.)\\n\r\nAnimation - 2 (It's pretty stiff.)\\n\\n\r\nSorry to hand out another \"unwatchable\" rating but I'm trying to save you 650 minutes. There are no fun characters, interesting moments, clever ideas, beautiful art, stellar animation, or creative stories. If you still don't believe me, feel free to watch it but at least skip the epilogue. Please.",

            "content": "It's a fairly common trend in just about most action mediums, whether it be anime or not, to focus more on the action than the story. Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is part of that minority which focuses more on the story, and I have to say that it does a really good job of doing so without taking away from what makes an action medium well... an action medium.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story follows the twisted and tragic life of Zwei, a teenage boy who has no recollection of his past, and is forced to become an assassin under the guidance of Ein, also known as\"Phantom\", who, like Zwei, has no recollection of her past, and is a highly trained assassin, or more like a near-invincible human weapon. This is all done under the supervision of \"Scythe Master\", a maniacal scientist with a calm demeanour, whose only goal in life is seemingly to create near-invincible human weapons or \"Phantoms\" just like Ein. He is contracted by a growing mafia organisation called Inferno who wishes to use his \"Phantoms\" to help seize ultimate control of the mafia underworld.\\n\\n\r\nNow that's quite a load of information to take on before starting this anime and the entire premise of the story regarding Inferno takes time to develop and be fully explained. When things have been established and the story starts to take shape is when this anime really starts to get good. What this information fails to tell you though is that there are essentially three parts to the story, each being separated by a time skip of considerable length. Each part has its own merits and can be somewhat different to each other, and some people are sure to like one part more than the other two.\\n\\n\r\nEach part explores different themes and develops the characters in different ways. The first part explores the growing relationship between Ein and Zwei, and follows their interactions with Inferno. The second part introduces Cal Devens, a young girl, who is taken in by Zwei in his attempt to find something or someone worth protecting and giving his life for. And the third part takes elements from the previous two parts and concludes the story in a tragic and bittersweet way.\\n\\n\r\nThere is very little I can actually fault the story with. There are a few plot holes, both major and minor. However, I feel as though the effect they had on how I viewed the story was extremely minimal. Unlike other plot holes in other anime that I viewed recently, I was able to overlook them with ease and continue immersing myself in this gripping tale.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the decisions the characters made throughout this anime really pissed me off. Like REALLY. There were few times during which I couldn't comprehend exactly what was going on in the minds of the characters, especially given how smart and cunning most of them are. If they made stupid decisions that had minor consequences, then I would've overlooked them like I did with the plot holes. However, considering the potential impact that most of these decisions had and the fact that characters were later going to contradict an earlier decision they already made, it really pissed me off that they decided to make such a decision. It's almost as though the creators wanted to forward the story by making the characters complete retards when they needed a calm head the most. There were arguably much better ways for the story to progress and much better ways in which such ways could be achieved. (Sorry for the mild profanity but this was really something I needed to get off my chest)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are where it shines most. There are three main characters, being Ein, Zwei, and Cal, alongside an interesting supporting cast, consisting mainly of members of Inferno and \"uncooperative\" mafia groups.\\n\\n\r\nEin, Zwei, and Cal are developed almost perfectly. Each character has to live through events which change them, and their personality and attitude. For example, Zwei may be a cold hearted assassin yet he has a sense of morality which is continually explored throughout the anime, and through the exploration of this single trait, he changes and becomes a different person by the end of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is not explored very much at all. While there were somewhat interesting, they weren't interesting enough for us to really want to get to want to know more about. I personally believe that this is how a supporting cast is meant to be. They aren't meant to outshine the main characters. However, the anime gives us backstory about Lizzie and Claudia, a female duo who works in the higher ranks of Inferno's hierarchy. And I'm going to be honest, I didn't care about their backstory. While they do play somewhat major roles in the anime, their backstory is not needed at all. I cared very little for them because I was already engrossed with the main characters and their development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI've never ventured to say I hate an opening or closing from an anime. And I was extremely tempted to say it regarding the openings and closing of this anime. I'm sure there are people who like it but I dislike the style of music used and I never ever bothered to watch any of the openings or closings following listening to them my first time.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the background music in this anime is superb. From the gangster music which was constantly played throughout the first and second parts to the music used during the more tear-jerking moments, particularly in the third part, I loved it all. It constantly helped emphasise the atmosphere and really immerse myself in this anime. I want to specifically point out some of the music in the third part. Without spoiling too much, I'd like to say that the distorted sound and the groaning of a woman really emphasised how messed up everything eventually got in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom with english dubs. Now, I always feel like there is a rule which states that if an anime is set in an English speaking country, then the dubs are decent, if not better than decent. I can safely say that the statement still holds true in this anime. Ein and Zwei are bland due to their cold-hearted demeanours but showed their colourful side when needed. Cal's voice throughout the second part was that of pure innocence and young excitement, something which this anime was certainly lacking. The voice acting of the supporting cast was also really well done. Cunning and sly characters like Claudia always spoke in a suggestive and calm tone, while brutish and large characters always spoke with authority and confidence.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. The colours used mostly seemed darker in tone, and many scenes were in the dark which always added to the mafia underworld premise which the anime is set in.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was even greater. Everything from the fight scenes, to the firing of bullets, to the splatters of blood, to what I like to call the \"Phantom eyes\", to driving cars were all animated extremely well. Everything felt smooth and flowed nicely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI could've also give this category a 5/10 because things didn't go the way I wanted and the decisions some characters made just pissed me off big time. I'm going to be honest and say that it really hurt my heart to see things didn't end up the way I wanted but that's the beauty of a good anime. Things shouldn't be predictable nor should they go the way that the fans want it to. (But please let there be a remake where things end up the way I want them to)\\n\\n\r\nI love Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. It contained great action scenes, an immersive story, and a strong cast of characters. After every episode, I had the feeling I normally get when I watch a good anime; one where I let out a huge breath because I was so immersed in it that it feels as though I forget to breathe or one where I kick my legs in frustration because I want to really know what happens next. I recommend this anime to just about anyone because it has great action for the action anime fans but also a great story for those who aren't exactly into action.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and hope you enjoyed! Any feedback is much appreciated.",

A story about puppets, betrayal, and nonsense, a lot of nonsensical crap; At first it begins really strong, i was hooked even from the first 5 min, it was developing well with a serious tone and a very good story, everything alright until ep. 10 where things that couldn't make sense happens, plot holes happens, it was stupid that one person took a bullet to save someone that should obviously die and then reappear later as an ''enemy'' but turns out that this person is there to be with this other person because of the promise and that was really stupid, it would have been like that since the beginning if ''it'' didn't put in front of the bullet to save the bad dude, it makes no sense, and at the same time the story was a mess or was dropped, and it was more focused on destroying the good character development to what they were before, i don't understand why Zwei promised to advenge a random woman he didn't know and why would he bring flowers to the crime scene, he didn't knew her; And then in ep. 17 to 19 there was a scene that didn't match, please pay attention to those eps. the ending on 17 and the other side point of view of the same event in ep. 19 (like if it was an alternate happening, but is not, because it wouldn't make sense) this was one of the things that frustrated me the most and ep. 20 just killed the story, how come a girl almost 11 or 12 in two years becomes a biker model with big magumbos and bubble butt? it's ridiculous, that was really stupid, i wanted to drop this right there and i never drop an anime but i was glad it had 5 eps. left; It felt like Zwei was dumb, he could try to fully explain the things, but he never tried to talk to Drei, it doesn't hurt to try you know; Ep. 26 wasn't that bad, good action, the ending was bad tho and not because it wasn't happy because i have seen more tragic animes with dark, hopeless ending but because it was bad, the story was a mess filled with gap holes without explanation, plot holes and more to consider it good ending. The story was fine till ep. 17. I can go on on pointing out the plot holes, gap holes, things that didn't make sense, the bad decisions made etc. but that would take too long.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe best asset from the anime, the animation, it was very good for the year it was released but it could be better, sometimes it wasn't smooth, i don't have complaints about the animation other than the lack of bullet holes on the enemies and only appeared on important enemies and that takes away my enjoyment, not seeing more ''realistic'' deaths was bothering, just like with Noir.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt was good, sometimes repetitive and not fitting and some other sounds were absurd, like the sex moaning track and others, the first OP is great, the second one is awful, really bad, just why? and both EDs were very good with interesting videoclips. VA was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters were doing great until everything went backwards in the 2nd arc, Zwei was growing to be my fav. on this anime but he was going downhill for what i stated, and i didn't care what happened to him from there on, i was disappointed how well the characters developed after the events despite the plot holes of ep. 10, i'm not going to go deep on the characters because i feel too disappointed to do it, the thing is that at the end the characters were fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI was having a big time at the beginning but i was getting bored and pissed with the story decision, the bad directing, the all kind of holes, the disappointment with this anime is big, i don't know but from a 9 to a 6.5 from me shows how at the beginning to half the eps. i was enjoying it to how disappointed i was at the end.",

Hope this helps someone decide if they want to watch the series :)\r\nStory\r\nThe highlight of the story was the relationships that develop between the main cast, mainly the relationships that occur from both the female leads towards the male lead, I found this to be very interesting as they were both complex yet quite different relationships.\r\nUnfortunately, likely due to the strength of the main relationships, the interactions regarding the remaining characters were simply underwhelming.\r\nThe story was quite dark and confronting at times, touching on strong themes such as struggling with personal identity andsome decisions that really did shock me morally. \\n\r\nA time skip also occurs which adds another level of depth to the series, seeing the changes that occurred with each character was another highlight of the series.  As the changes were quite significant, and came about not only by each characters individual choices, but also due to the combined effect of the surrounding cast choices.\\n\r\nOverall the story was great, with its numerous plot twists, even though I didn't fully agree with the scenarios that occurred towards the end of the series, it still kept me hooked till the very end.  \\n\r\nThis is also one of the few series that I have looked back on after finishing, and thought about how significant a minor change of events would have altered the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFirstly let me say this series has probably the best cinematography I have ever seen in Anime to date, resulting in some really great looking scenes.\\n\r\nSome low quality/errors in the animation do occur, but they are very rare and weren't enough to distract me from enjoying the series.\\n\r\nThe lighting was very good, and considering the tone of the anime this was quite important, also the colour scheme and art style was very crisp and clean.\\n\r\nThe art style for each of the characters, had both their clothing and appearance reflect their personality well. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice acting was solid all-round, but was exceptional from the two lead females of the series. \\n\r\nThe music was very well done, including quite a wide range, from dramatic opera pieces to new age techno beats, which seem to kick in at just the right moments during action/dramatic scenes.  \\n\r\nBoth the opening/ending themes are well made, and even reflect the journey of the main cast throughout the series of trying to escape to a brighter life but still being trapped by their past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe main cast was outstanding, with each character grabbing my attention, in particular one of the female leads, who would have to be one of the best female characters I have seen in Anime so far.\\n\r\nUnfortunately the side cast simply are not fleshed out enough, and I found it hard to care about their own personal ideals.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nMost of anime I have seen so far tend to have slow starts, this on the other hand grabbed my attention from the very first episode.  Unfortunately I didn't quite enjoy the series as much towards the end of the time skip, mainly due to some choices and scenarios I found hard to believe, as previously mentioned.  However overall I really enjoyed the series, and am very glad I decided to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAn exceptional series, something a bit different from anything I have watched so far.  I recommend anyone who is considering watching this series to just do it!  You won't regret it!\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nEvery now and then, while watching an anime, you take a step back and realize how much of an effect that the work is truly having on you. I\u2019m sure that anyone reading this review is familiar with the feeling: You couldn\u2019t be more engrossed the story, you couldn\u2019t be more emotionally attached to the characters, and you couldn\u2019t look away from the screen even if you wanted to. Adrenaline courses through your veins at every subtle movement as you shift even further to the edge of your seat, demanding to know what happens next. Your heart sinks and rises in complete dissonanceas you are praying for your desired result, desperately hoping that nothing will go wrong for your beloved characters. These are the experiences that I live for. These sensations are the reason I am a fan of the medium in the first place. For me, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom will always be one of the first anime I think of when I reminisce on my very fondest anime-watching memories because it provided that experience for me. Everything from its interesting and unique plot, to its magnificent characters, to its near flawless use of sound and music, to its realistic art style create a finished product that that is more than worthy of praise. Simply put, I LOVE this anime. Here\u2019s why:\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: A mysterious crime syndicate known as \u201cInferno\u201d has developed a monopoly on the black market through the use of their near-invincible human weapon referred to as only \u201cThe Phantom.\" One day, a Japanese tourist accidentally witnesses The Phantom committing a murder, prompting it to hunt him down and eliminate him. Desperate to escape, the tourist hides in a secluded building. However, Phantom is instructed by the leader of Inferno, \"Scythe Master\", to capture the tourist and turn him into yet another human weapon for Inferno to utilize. Completely brainwashed and given the name \"Zwei\u201d (2 in German), the man is now a puppet of Inferno with no memories of his past what so ever. \\n\\n\r\nI think the reason that RftP is such a great anime is because it can be enjoyed on so many different levels; it is completely saturated with well-written and well-executed themes. Want to take the story at face value, as a tale of a man trying to escape the clutches of an evil organization? You may. Maybe you want to take it is as a story about identity and what individuality truly is? Go ahead. Even still, you might want to consider the story to be an exploration into the ability to escape your own past and if past sins can ever truly be forgiven. That works too. Is it an action show? A Drama? A Romance? A Thriller? Eventually, I stopped trying to figure out which one of these themes/genres the show truly was focusing on and I realized that this is a story about all of those things. Unlike the vast majority of other media, this isn\u2019t a story that focuses on a single, overarching message. Much like our real lives, the problems that the characters face are multifaceted and complex. We see them experience many different conflicted emotions and having to learn many different lessons at the same time; this is what makes the anime so effective and so believable. It captures a realistic sense of emotional turmoil, including the concepts of identity crisis and self-loathing, amazingly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside to this is that such a large number of themes can sometimes alienate viewers and give the illusion that the show doesn\u2019t know what it is trying to be, even though it does. For example, juxtaposition is a device that is frequently used in the anime for a variety of purposes, particularly during the 2nd half (the 1st OP vs. the 2nd OP is a good example of this). Some people notice these strange, sudden shifts from the norm and dismiss them as problems with tone, bad writing, or even plotholes. If you ask me, the exact opposite is true; this show is very cleverly written. That being said, I don\u2019t mean to imply that RftP is perfect, because it certainly isn\u2019t. For example, the beginning of the 2nd half makes some strange writing decisions and slows its pacing down far too much, creating a bit of a disconnect. Additionally, some of the action scenes are directed in an overly theatrical way and not-so-realistic manner that occasionally conflicts with the otherwise serious atmosphere of the show. In fact, the show\u2019s taste in drama is overall a bit too melodramatic for me. There are several tiny flaws such as these throughout the plot, but when it comes down too it, the pros drastically outweigh the cons. The story has the uncanny ability to get the viewer very emotionally invested in its progression and its characters. As a side note, this is one of the saddest, yet most beautiful shows you will ever watch; it absolutely slayed me by the end. Fantastic plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot is likely what will tune you in to RftP, the reason you will stay until the end will be for the characters. RftP has one of the best and most fleshed out casts in anime history if you ask me. This show should be used as a guidebook for character development: we see the characters go through not just one major change over the course of the show, but two or three. They couldn\u2019t possibly have better conveyed the inner conflict and emotional suffering of the main characters if they tried. I got very, VERY emotionally invested in many of these characters simply because they are so relatable and genuinely human. Zwei serves as a fantastic protagonist because of how his emotions ebb and flow just like a real person; I can't talk a whole lot about what I love about his character without spoilers, but I must stress that I love every single thing about him. \u201cThe Phantom\u201d is a bit personality-less in the beginning of the anime (understandably), but she is far from some clich\u00e9, emotionless doll stereotype. In fact, her internal struggle between remaining loyal to her master and defying her master along with her identity crisis is arguably the driving force of the show. Her complex dynamic with Zwei is one of the best character relationships I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. The viewer is able to so systematically feel and/or understand whatever these two are feeling, and that is the pinnacle of successful character writing. There are tons of interesting side characters as well, but due to the dynamic nature of the plot, I won\u2019t risk discussing them due to spoilers. Let\u2019s just say that they are utilized to absolute perfection in order to not only receive stories and development of their own, but to bring out different sides in our two main characters. I could gush for hours about how effective and well written I believe this cast truly is, but I think you get the point by now.\\n\\n\r\nTop off this stellar writing with the best sound effects I\u2019ve ever heard in an anime, a realistic/stylized art style that serves the narrative, and a beautiful OP that juxtaposes with the, well, *cough, \u201cdifferent\u201d 2nd OP, and you have described one of my all time favorite anime. If Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is not a masterpiece, it\u2019s damn close to it. To anyone who hasn\u2019t seen this show yet: clear your schedule. The anime not perfect, sure, but it kept me in suspense for its entire duration and wrapped itself up with a beautiful ending that is more than worthy of the series it\u2019s attached too. Needless to say, I highly, HIGHLY recommend it.",

            "content": "What can I say? I loved Phantom.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom basically takes place in three arcs. I found the first two to be frankly amazing: great plot, mood, character development etc--not much to say about them other than you will probably really enjoy them. My main problem with Phantom's story is the third arc. While I still found it entertaining, there were quite a few parts in this arc that required a bit too much suspension of disbelief. I still couldn't stop watching, which is saying a lot, but some people will probably be really annoyed at the way certaindevelopments are handled that seem to make little sense in the context of the story. In particular the last two episodes made so little sense that they bordered on absurd at times. But since the majority of the series was really well handled, I give the story an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really great. I love the character designs, and the action sequences look fluid. The dark aesthetic fits the mood and the settings are occasionally quite beautiful. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf I could give the sound an 11 I would! I am not the kind of person who usually pays much attention to the music in shows unless it is so good that it's impossible not to notice. Well, this show fits in that category. The music comes on at crucial moments and just sets the mood perfectly, I think most people who watch this show will enjoy the music very much. Besides that, the voice acting was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in this show were quite interesting and sympathetic, and though many of the side characters were not what you would call likable, they were still entertaining to watch. My main issue, again, was how some of them behaved in the final arc, as it didn't seem consistent, but overall I thought the character development of this show was great. Many of the characters have changed and grown quite a bit by the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5\\n\\n\r\nI could not stop watching this, it was so addicting. I was absolutely planning on giving it a 10 up until the final 2 episodes. However the ending didn't ruin the series for me, just made me \"wtf\" a bit. So take from that what you will.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nGreat series, I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of action and dark psychological themes, or even if you just want to look at some pretty characters (they're very pretty I assure you). Go watch now!",

The story, which bears striking similarities to that of theanime series darker than black, is told chronologically in an episodic manner, with each episode revealing a little bit more about the characters and their lives.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of its soundtrack and art, the offerings from this series have not jumped out at me, atlhough that is not to say that there is anything to complain about.  The animation of the series is nicely done, with the action scenes appearing well animated and flowing smoothly, although most blood and the actual killing of characters is not shown as the camera is almost always turned away, with just the gun sound effect left intact.  Whilst this may please some, to me this feels slightly unnatrual and detracts from the impact the violent scenes of the show should have upon the viewer.  The general theme of violence and killing that runs throughout this show (as you would expect in a show about assassins) would however still make me reluctant to recommend it for younger viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series is highly entertaining, and a very good watch if you enjoy the combination of a mysterious action filled story, with interesting characters and villains.  If you liked series such as darker than black, or ghost in the shell, then your sure to like this - overall 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom has certainly proved to me that there is anime out there that, despite being under appreciated, truly is worth the watch, as it provides so much suspense and enjoyment throughout the series.\r\nThe story is well structured, enjoyable, entertaining and just plain awesome, the whole made to kill or be killed thing appealed to me especially, considering what a tough situation that must be like in real life. The crime aspect of the show also cements my passion for it simply presents us with an exciting scenario. The time skips, character developments and many other things further enhance the great storyline,from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show puts many other animes to shame, the great visuals are shown by the scenery, character animation, and the effects. All of this allows viewers to enjoy the story as well as the visuals, further building upon an already capable show. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, along with the opening and ending songs to the show are some of the best I have heard in a while, fitting nicely with the show's dark and serious nature, being able to subtly show the sinister outline of the show from the beginning. The sound effects do not disappoint, being able to capture the essence of the backgrounds and work effectively with the visual effects. The voice acting for the show is top notch, each voice fits the character perfectly, no out of place voices what so over, thankfully. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are indeed the main drivers of this show, you have the calm and steady protagonist Zwei, the mysterious Ein, the villainous and somewhat disturbing Scythe Master, and of course the innocent Cal, along with other characters that greatly enhance the show's dark and interesting vibe. The development of main characters throughout the show's run further allows you to develop an understanding of them, they each in their own way bring a sympathetic aura about them. With the effective voice acting adding to this, it makes a great cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe show presents some serious challenges to the characters, whether it be murder or betrayal, it simply adds to the highly enjoyable, action packed series. The seriousness of the show is also something to be aware of, as it makes no effort to add anything camp or cheesy to the show, something some viewers may not like, but in my opinion it gives us a taste of realism. The violence and profanity make it appealing for a more mature audience, as well as the complex plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall with a solid storyline, great characters, excellent voice acting, sound effects, music as well as the great visuals this show will provide you with great enjoyment throughout, and with an interesting ending, it makes it that much more memorable and exciting. Good luck, Phantom!\\n\\n",

But anyways, this show is well worth a watch. and a rewatch. and then another. The art is amazing, and the music, beautiful. Like seriously, the music is beautiful. Classical music that fits the show too well, i cant help but think it's all original. Needless to say, thisshow is a true masterpiece and deserves some kind of anime award. 20 out of 5 stars.",

I have watched Darker than Black too and found that this looks quite alot like it.\r\nThe story setting is quite a dark one, where you are plunged into not knowing stuff. as it looks you will learn more about the Main chars and Inferno as you watch along with the serie.\r\nThe action in the serie is good, its almost what you could come across in real life. Its very good. The animation is also high class, it has some slight improvements but stilllooks alot like Darker than Black.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST that come along with this serie are greatly adding to the animation. With some celtic / church like music on some points to let the scene get more impact is just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, i like the idea of their memory erasure, them not knowing themselves anymore. still i think they are a great couple =) Ein is tooo cute :p\\n\\n\r\nso GOGO download / buy whatever you want of it and go watch it. you wont be let down as an action fan or a fan of storylines",

            "content": "I'll just say this right now: I don't care much for mafia drama. Films like The Godfather and Scarface bore the shit out of me and the entire genre is way too tedious to keep my interest any longer than say 5 minutes. With that said, I've always had a fondness for programmes like Breaking Bad and Dexter but they just get ridiculous after a certain point. So where does that leave Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom? Well, I suppose it's the direct inverse of .hack//SIGN (another Bee Train show): it's a show that started off strong and had an intense middle act that endedup losing a lot of points due to a lacklustre final act. Is it worth watching? Well, yeah but try keeping an open mind when you're doing so.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the background of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, allow me to fill you in. This is an adaptation of a visual novel known as \"Phantom of Inferno,\" which deals with the story of two assassins with no memories and nowhere else to go named Ein and Zwei. Another thing to note about this anime is that it's divided into a sort of \"three-act\" structure. The first \"act\" is more or less an introduction to the characters, the second \"act\" covers Zwei's life as the new \"Phantom of Inferno,\" and the third \"act\" takes place after a two-year time skip from the second act, which I'll talk about later on in this review.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story of Phantom goes, it takes itself VERY seriously with virtually no comedy whatsoever. The atmosphere in this show is full of tension and it's rather rare for an episode to actually be lighter in tone than the rest of the series. Even then, those episodes are still rather serious in nature. There's little to no levity to be found so if that's a turn-off, well... deal with it or just find another show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this is a mafia drama, it's to be expected that there would be some action/violence in this show. However, the appearance of any sort of violence in this show is rather sparse to say the least. Phantom uses violence as a means to relieve some of the tension that would otherwise build up and quickly make the show tedious/uncomfortable to watch. Even then, the action in Phantom isn't really akin to what you'd see in Scarface where a guy pulls out a machine gun and starts firing randomly into the crowd. It's more along the lines of stealth-based kills and such. Ein and Zwei ARE assassins, after all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, violence isn't really the only way that Phantom relieves some of the excess tension. For instance, there's some fan service thrown into the mix. I'm not even joking about that. Fan service is often provided by Claudia, one of the higher-ups of Inferno with so many ambitions that she'd fuck a homeless guy with every strain of hepatitis known to man if it would further her cause (all joking aside, she's actually a good character). There's no shortage of scenes in the second \"act\" where we get to see Claudia in an open bath robe with plenty of cleavage to spare.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough though, there's almost nothing in the way of nudity. Like the most that we ever really see is a shot of a woman's bare breasts at the beginning of the first episode which was inexplicably covered up by a bikini top in the Phantom release on Funimation's YouTube channel. I question how a pair of exposed breasts suddenly warrants an \"R+ - Mild Nudity\" rating. This isn't the first time an anime with one instance of exposed breasts got a \"Mild Nudity\" rating here either (ref: Akira; odd how there's a scene in Episode 7 of Hellsing Ultimate where we see a guy fucking a corpse in a flashback, but Hellsing Ultimate still has a \"Violence and Profanity\" rating).\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the story at hand, it's got quite a bit in the way of strengths but some rather glaring weaknesses. On the positive side of things, this isn't like Akame ga Kill and Elfen Lied where the show doesn't really have a sense of what it wants to be, and so it constantly swaps between two tones that are complete polar opposites of each other. We know that right from the beginning that Phantom is a crime drama that takes itself seriously. On another note, I find the concept of an organisation like Inferno to be quite intriguing and it's a lot more interesting than the \u201cstarted-from-the-bottom-now-we-here\u201d approach that other mafia dramas like The Godfather and Scarface opt for.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one glaring problem that Phantom has is the fact that it is a visual novel adaptation. Visual novels are designed in such a way where certain secondary/tertiary characters get thrown to the wayside since it's assumed you'll be playing through the other story routes if you really want to see what happens to them. However, that does NOT translate over to an anime context since the medium doesn't have an answer for that little nuance. Certain character arcs feel incomplete with some backgrounds being insufficiently explored or the back-story just being dropped altogether.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that Phantom has in relation to it being a visual novel adaptation is the fact that Zwei, the protagonist of this series is a teenager. This reflects the nature of visual novels tending to use adolescent protagonists no matter what the contents of the story actually is. The way that Phantom presents itself in the beginning makes you think that Zwei is an adult, but no. It's revealed toward the end of the first \u201cact\u201d that Zwei was in fact a student in high school before getting mixed up with Inferno. Why is this a problem? Well... for starters, you've got suspension of disbelief constantly at risk of being broken. This ties in with the next problem that Phantom has: the third \u201cact.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the fact that Zwei is of high school age and this is a visual novel adaptation, it was only a matter of time before there was a portion of the show that took place in high school. The only problem? All of this high school crap took place during the final seven episodes of the show. The story doesn't really turn to shit here because if you can suspend your disbelief, it's pretty good. The only problem is the fact that well... I CAN'T SUSPEND MY DISBELIEF FOR THESE FINAL SEVEN EPISODES IN THE SLIGHTEST. \\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of little details that just had me raising my eyebrows and then just wondering \u201cwait, what the fuck is going on here?\u201d Now, I can get on with it if I approach the story from a slightly different angle, but that angle involves me having to pretend that certain things just didn't happen... even though it's so blatantly obvious that it did happen, and this show takes great pains to remind you that what you saw actually did happen. So yeah... not a huge fan of that since it's basically Gen Urobuchi's way of saying \u201cwhat I'm doing is wrong, I know it's wrong, but I'm gonna do it anyway.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to conclusions, Phantom's conclusion was rather hasty to say the least. Well... that's how it felt to me. At the same time, at least it felt like a proper finale and offered a sense of closure. I can't help but wonder how different Phantom would be if it was as long as Death Note and paced things out differently. Like if the high school bullshit happened first, I really wouldn't have a problem with Phantom whatsoever. But alack, that's yet another story of what could have been that will only be answered by fan fiction writers.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, Phantom has a wide variety of characters with their own varying degrees of significance. However, keep in mind that Phantom's visual novel roots prevent certain characters from truly making an impression. First up, we have Ein and Zwei: two trained assassins with no memories of their past lives and nowhere else to go. Ein initially comes off as a Rei clone, but her character is further explored as the series goes on. Zwei on the other hand is characterised in a manner very similar to Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal in the sense that he's got nowhere else to go so he keeps on killing. I would keep going about these two, but I spent a good hour or so trying to come up with a way to provide insight but I kept going into spoiler-heavy territory. So yeah... you want more info? Watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other members of Inferno (i.e. Claudia, Scythe Master, Raymond McGuire), they're all pretty interesting characters but I found myself wanting to see more of Raymond and Scythe Master since they didn't really leave all that much of an impression on me despite the potential they had. Scythe Master is the man who created the Phantom, so right off the bat we had set-up for someone who could be a REALLY good villain. However, his characterisation falters toward the end because Gen Urobuchi decided to paint him like a madman obsessed with Broadway theatre. Raymond on the other hand is the supposed \u201cleader\u201d of Inferno, but we never really get to see much of him. We don't get a good feel for his morality and he pretty much just remains this enigmatic \u201cbig boss\u201d character, which is quite a shame since I quite liked him. \\n\\n\r\nAside from Raymond, Ein, and Zwei, there were two other characters that I grew quite attached to: Lizzie Garland and Cal Devens. Lizzie Garland basically acted as moral support for Claudia and Zwei and in addition to that, I just love the role she was given as someone who has to put up with Claudia and Zwei's bullshit. As for Cal Devens, she's an 11-year-old orphan that Zwei ends up \u201cadopting\u201d in the second \u201cact\u201d of Phantom, and she's similar to Lizzie in the sense that she's there to provide moral support to Zwei. However, another role that she serves is to actually lighten up the tone of the episodes at the point in time that she's introduced.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people take umbrage with Cal because her appearance in a show like this felt rather \u201cout-of-place\u201d and to some extent, you'd be right. At first, I really didn't understand why she was even there to begin with. However, given that this series is rife with tension that needs to be diffused every now and then, a role like Cal's is necessary to prevent the show from getting stiff. Usually, this is where comedic relief would kick in and to some extent, Cal does provide some humour. However, comedy is a very volatile element.\\n\\n\r\nIf you put in too much or the wrong kind of comedic relief, the atmosphere you were trying to build up could instantly dissipates and you'd have to spend a whole lot of time just to rebuild said atmosphere. Cal basically serves as a reminder of Zwei's humanity, hence the reason why he took her in rather than outright killing her. Phantom relies on juxtaposing Zwei's mentality as a killing machine and his own humanity. While we get plenty of the former throughout the show's run, we don't really get a lot of latter. Cal's inclusion in Phantom allows for us to see the \"human\" side of Zwei that we often lose sight of whenever he's caught up in any business pertaining to Inferno.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the biggest problem that Lizze and Cal have pretty much trace back to the visual novel origins that Phantom has. Lizzie was absent from the third \"act\" and Cal undergoes a... well, let's just say that she ends up changing quite a bit during the time skip and it comes out of nowhere. Remember what I said about certain character arcs being either abandoned completely or just insufficiently explored because anime can't account for certain visual novel nuances? Yeah... that comes back to bite this show in the ass quite hard. There's also the matter of my suspension of disbelief collapsing due to the fact that all of this shit culminates together in the end rather hastily and without much second thought.\\n\\n\r\nEnough about the characters though. Let's get on with the art/animation. As far as the art direction goes, everything translates over from the visual novel quite well. Character designs are nice and nothing looks uncanny, the backgrounds have a nice amount of detail put into them, and all that good shit. When it comes down to the actual animation, Phantom doesn't really have a lot in the way of it because it's primarily a crime/mafia drama and as such, there's a lot of talking involved. As far as action goes, there isn't a lot of it to be found in Phantom given that the roles that Ein and Zwei play are that of covert assassins. This plays toward Bee Train's strengths since animating fights isn't really their strong suit (ref: Blade of the Immortal, and .hack//SIGN).\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the art and animation in Phantom boils down to the opening and ending sequences. From a visual standpoint, all of them are beautiful to look at. With that said, I'm biased toward the first opening sequence, since it was paired up with an absolutely gorgeous song called \"Karma\" by KOKIA which syncs up perfectly with the visuals and really captures the essence of what this show is about: two assassins forced to kill with nowhere else to go. The visuals are rather abstract to say the least, but that's part of what makes the OP so good in the first place. It's almost impossible to explain without actually describing each individual frame of animation, so just do yourself a favour and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest shortcoming that the animation has is the usage of CGI. CGI is NOT Bee Train's strong suit, and it looks even worse than the CGI dragon from Fate/stay night or pretty much anything you'd find in the Gantz adaptation produced by Gonzo. What exactly gets CG'd here in Phantom? Pretty much any means of transportation like cars, trucks, and such which means we get treated to some bad CG at least once every 1-2 episodes. I wouldn't really mind the bad CG if it was at least animated properly (ref: the CG horse-drawn carriages in Black Butler), but the actual animation of the CG cars/trucks/whatever is so stilted and jerky to the point where it becomes an eyesore. They aren't around for TOO long, so I can't hold that against Phantom for too long. Regardless, it's a rather ugly blemish to a show that would've been otherwise flawless in the visual department.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, the OST is some downright amazing stuff with plenty of tracks that fit the atmosphere of the show and whatever mood it's trying to convey at that specific point in time quite well. There were quite a few sombre BGM tracks that I was quite fond of along with Cal's pocket watch tune, however that's not where the OST really shines. The highlights of the OST really lie with the first opening theme \"Karma\" and the second ending theme \"Transparent\" by KOKIA. I don't know how to describe the songs without using superlatives, so the best that I can tell you is to just listen to both of those songs and make of it what you will.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the voice-acting goes, I've never watched this show in Japanese with English subtitles, so I can't comment on the Japanese voice-acting. Both times I was watching Phantom, I watched it dubbed. As far as the dubbing goes, it was some really solid stuff and featured several voice actors that Funimation seldom uses like Shay Moore and Newton Pittman, both of whom give solid performances as Lizzie Garland and Zwei respectively. Aside from Shay Moore as Lizzie Garland, my favourite performances would have to come from Colleen Clinkenbeard as Claudia McCunnen and J. Michael Tatum as Raymond McGuire.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it short: after hearing Clinkenbeard and Tatum in shows like Fullmetal Alchemist, Black Butler, and Ouran High School Host Club, it's a refreshing change of pace to hear these two playing roles that are fairly grounded in reality. While Tatum doesn't really get a lot of chances to shine in Phantom since Raymond's appearances in the show are rather limited, he does amazingly well with the role he's been given. Aside from Stephanie Young and possibly Lydia Mackay, I can't imagine anyone else who could've played Claudia better than Collen Clinkenbeard. Like when you hear the expressions and inflections she uses, it's impossible to tell that the person voicing Claudia is the same woman who voiced characters like Ros\u00e9 Thomas. It's quite nice hearing Clinkenbeard voice a character that ISN'T a damsel-in-distress, and for that I applaud her.\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly prevents this OST from being nothing short of perfection? Two words: Ali Project. To put it simply, Ali Project's songs all sound the same to me and it seems like no matter what show I hear them in be that Phantom, Code Geass, Another, or what have you, the OP/ED theme that they'd come up with would feel horrendously out-of-place and grate on my ears. Plus... it doesn't help that Ali Project came up with the second OP for this show and that second OP replaced Karma for episodes 20-26... right around the time that all of that visual novel ugliness goes down. Ali Project is the sole reason as to why I wish that this show ended at Episode 19 rather than 26, by the way. I can tolerate all of the visual novel bullshit, but when I have to put up with that crap AND deal with a really subpar alternative to a beautiful OP theme... THAT'S when I draw the line and say \"you know what, I'm done.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow for the ultimate question: should you watch Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom? First, ask yourself two questions:\\n\\n\r\n1) Are you capable of suspending your disbelief for just about anything?\\n\r\n2) Can you stomach anything produced by Ali Project?\\n\\n\r\nIf you answered yes to both questions, I highly recommend watching Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. If you answered no to the first question, watch until Episode 19 or just skip the show altogether and watch something else like say Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal. If you answered yes to the first question and no to the second one, skip the first ED and the second OP and watch the hell out of this show, buy it if you feel that strongly about it. Aside from its redundant name, bad CG and rather questionable final episodes, Phantom is a good show that's definitely worth watching. As far as visual novel adaptations, it ain't perfect but it's a million leagues better than the 2006 adaptation of Fate/stay night. I just wish that this show was four episodes longer so the events of the third \"act\" had more time to sink in, but whatever. It's still a good show regardless. Feedback is always welcome, and with that I'm out. Peace :)",

Phantom -Requiem for the Phantom- takes you right into the underworld where there are gangs, guns and one wrong move could cost you your life.\r\nThe anime captures you right from the very beginning by really making you think. Questions are already beginning to forming that you want the answer to. Who or what is Inferno? Who is Zwei really?\r\nThe best part was, unlike in otherseries' that i've watched, in Phantom -Requiem for the Phantom- your questions all get answered!\\n\\n\r\nThe story line was fantastic, not too fast pace and not too slow. I openly admit that i was crying from start to finish. :)\\n\r\nThe story is set in 3 parts, with the first part being the best, but the others weren't far off. I was all but nailed to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSadly with Phantom -Requiem for the Phantom- there's alot of plotting, planning, connections and names that you 'll need to remember, but to be honest when the story is that gripping its hard to forget.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the main story is based in the underground type world, you probably assume that this anime will be filled with action and gore. Luckily that's not the case, there is a good enough story line that it cancels out anything too extreme.\\n\\n\r\nBefore i finish i have to give my praise to the music used for this anime. It was amazing to listen too, and it all fit in so well with the different scenes. It takes alot to make me continuously listen to this kind of music, but after i heard it i couldn't stop listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't think it's your type of anime, i seriously suggest you watch at least the first episode to experience how gripping it really is. I am always left thinking and reeling about what's happened after each one!\\n\\n\r\nI can say without a doubt Phantom -Requiem for the Phantom- is MY favourite anime :)\\n\\n\r\nI hope i was was able to help :)",

            "content": "When I first heard of this show I was so happy because I really liked the Phantom movie and wanted to see more. Like the movie, a Japanese guy takes a trip to America and witnesses an assassination. The man who trained the female assassin sees potential in him and kidnaps him, wipes his memories and trains him to become an assassin.  Now he's living in a kill or be killed world of mob bosses, syndicates, drug dealers and so on. He takes on the code name Zwei and works with his partner Ein. \r\nUsually in these types of anime the female character isalmost always either a ball buster out going girl or a happy go lucky idiot but Ein reminds me a lot of the girls in Gunslinger Girl minus the love for her boss. She simply does what she can and has pretty much accepted her fate. She isn't too happy to do what she does but she doesn't allow herself to be crippled by it and that's what i like about her. Zwei on the other hand did not become as accepting, constantly questioning everything around him and never completely falling victim to their trainer \"The Scythe Master\" this actually makes him a prime target of Claudia, a woman looking to move up in their blood thirsty world of Inferno. She sees the greater potential in Zwei.\\n\\n\r\nNow the show itself seems to be broken up into two parts parts. episodes 1-10  being the first part I talked about above. Then episode 11 as a recap episode, then 12-26 for the rest. However IMO, the show is better broken down into three parts: \\n\\n\r\n1-10\\n\r\n12-17\\n\r\n18-26\\n\\n\r\nIf 1-10 introduces us to Zwei and allows us to see how he progresses through the world of Inferno then episodes 12-17 lets us see him in all his assassin glory. These episodes are by far the most epic of them all, the music is different, the atmosphere the the anime is different, the story matures right before our eyes and it is no longer about some guy becoming an assassin with a trail of doubt behind him but a thriving assassin, the best of the best. I don't want to spoil it too much but certain events take him away from his partner Ein and honestly I think he is better off and so is the show. Now I'm not saying Ein sucked or that episodes 1-10 weren't good, they were, they had to be to keep me watching to the 12th episode, it's just that the show is at its height of awesomeness during these episodes. I even liked the young girl Cal that is introduced. Which btw, I love the character development here and the interactions between them all were top notch. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 18-26, this is when Ein returns to the story and sadly the story begins to go right into the toilet. Just like in my Gungrave review where I mention how sometimes animes and go overboard on the story simply because they can. Well, this is what we get here. We have this great story about a guy who becomes an assassin against his will, he goes from surviving to thriving in this world, we have mob bosses and in fighting within Inferno, Claudia causing a little trouble as she climbs to the top with Zwei as her lover. But nope, the creators thought \"gee, how about we add mind controlled assassin clone girls, make it a high school anime, and rapidly age certain characters, yeah that will work...oh no this sucks so lets add a plot driven no nonsense ending so people will focus on that instead of how bad the show has gotten\" \\n\\n\r\nI HATED what they did to this anime. Here we have ADULT characters, in a MATURE setting then thought it was a good idea to turn them into high school students. They try hard to explain that the characters needed to be in high school for their plan to work, but no they didn't, they just wanted the characters in High school for NO REASON other than they wanted some sort of high school element. Here we have Zwei, who is a GROWN A$$ MAN sitting in a freaking high school class. Even when I check out some of the synopsis of the show they list Zwei as a Japanese teenager. *sigh* He was a college student taking a trip to the US not a freaking highschooler. Aside from that we have these clone b*tches and scifi crap added in and obviously a bunch of creators who had no idea what they could do for this story. So they try to make it deep by adding a question mark ending for no reason other than they just wanted people to talk about it and see it as more than what it is based on the ending alone. Well no, the ending was stupid and so was the last leg of the show. I would even advise to stop watching when Ein comes back because nothing good happens afterwards and as much as I liked Ein in the beginning, I just think that she should have been properly killed off and left at that.   \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI think we had other ways to live our lives. If we had met some other way, we might have been able to live happily ever after.\u201d \r\n\u201cYeah \u2026 We just messed up somewhere, that\u2019s all \u2026\u201d \r\nThis interaction between two of the characters (and I won\u2019t say which ones, so don\u2019t feel spoiled; they are not the ones you\u2019re probably thinking about right now) sums the whole thing up nicely. Because this anime is mostly about taking lives \u2013 in various ways: Take the victim that is shot. Or the assassin who is mourning for his lost innocence and feelings. Or the person whowas in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets their life changed in drastic ways. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 \\n\r\nThe story is great. There is the perfect combination of action and characterization / character reflection. Building up tension works out nicely since characters and their motivations are revealed bit by bit, which leads to a complex structure that makes room for suspicion, manipulation and betrayal. Better not trust anyone too much, is what you think \u2013 and you\u2019re still taken by surprise. \\n\r\nPlus there are two points where the plot changes its pace into a totally different direction \u2013 unexpected and absolutely surprising. Due to two time skips there are major changes in almost everything \u2013 character, setting, focus and apparently even the main theme. But it only takes a few minutes to make sense again, to fall together and to make you admire the diversity this anime has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 \\n\r\nThis is the point were everything became really awesome \u2013 because for me characters are the most important thing of a story, maybe even a little bit more important than the plot. And the characters in this series had a fabulous way of developing. In the beginning they were just a bunch of people \u2013 most of them interesting, none of them likeable. There actually was a point to this story where I found myself sitting there, rolling my eyes and thinking: \u201cGreat, now I really hate every single character this series has to offer.\u201d This was somewhere around episode 6, if I remember correctly. I felt like yelling at every one of them. \\n\r\nBut they had their way of creeping up on me and before I knew it I found myself mourning their deaths. The way of introducing, developing and presenting the characters was just great. Everything was timed very well. Therefore you were able to understand each and every decision the characters made (although some of them might have taken you by surprise before that) and feel for and with them. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound 8/10 \\n\r\nThe art was good. And it works out even more nicely, if you have a weakness for good looking characters ;) \\n\r\nThe sound went well with the scenes, attaching the right feeling to every one of them \u2013 especially the soft gentle piano themes worked out nicely and Cals pocket watch theme was used in a very clever way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 \\n\r\nIt\u2019s really great. I recommend it to anyone who takes a liking in mafia stories, moral conflicts, loyalty & betrayal, not overly emphasized but well paced drama, the crazy plans of a mad scientist or spectacular action scenes.",

The summary of characters is as such: \"\"\"genius\"\"\" slut who plots to take over the organization with a plan that isn't very well thought out at all. A chair sniffing loser named \"Scythe Master\" who seemingly has no real purpose other than to be the smart guy with glasses that's obligatory in any thriller. Eins, who hardly ever shows emotion, and Svei, who hardly ever shows emotion. Later on they throw in Cal, who doesn't seem tooffer anything other than a motivation for the two emotionless main characters to keep the action scenes going. You also have this Japanese yakuza who's an idiot, and his assistant, who's also an idiot. The main boss of the mafia is some ineffectual placeholder that never seems to have anything to say or do. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good. Not much to say, it fits with the aesthetic of a mafia filled with betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, especially the animation.

            "content": "Phantom starts off with an interesting concept then falls of the ladder in my opinion. Watched to the 5 episode mark and wanted to continue but after 10 episodes I felt it was a bit of a drag, the recap episodes was the low point of the series. It was the writing I thought that brought it down but most action stories have weak plots, however this story was more so than average.\r\nDon't watch the recap episodes, they are clearly made for budget saving reasons.\r\n There are lots of niche animes like this one that people like. If you're ok with this kind of tragichyperbole of a story then you will probably like it. If not then I guess not, but if you've got some spare time and wan't to watch a niche anime like I did, then watch phantom, at least to the 5 episode mark then decide if you can stomach it.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes were kind of tossed to the wayside at times and then brought back, but I thought they failed to be cohesive or add anything substantial to this cheesy anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Was weak but it's an action flik I watched for fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I liked the art, obviously this is where most of the budget was invested. However almost every character was shinpachi shimura from gintama just with some tweaks. lol\\n\\n\r\nSound: Audio was clean, the soundtracks were average. I think they could have made better choices but it's a cheesy anime this is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Only got attached to Eren(Ein) wanted to see her pull through and survive. Which she did, the ending is kinda ambiguous but after I watched it twice I thought it obvious Eren Lived and Reiji died. However this is basically a fantasy where main characters survive every scenario. I thought Reiji's choices didn't make sense for his character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good for one to watch if you've got time to kill and are addicted to watching anime. Ultimately I only enjoyed Eren's character and her coming through. Otherwise I thought it was cheesy hyperbole which I can stand to watch sometimes.\\n\r\nThe plot holes are obvious and are just plain comical. Had to just lol at them.",

            "content": "Phantom - Requiem for the Phantom: It's been a week since I finished this anime and I still occasionally find myself visiting youtube just to listen to the \"Canzone of Death\" theme to reignite my thoughts on the series and it's conclusion. When an Anime has such an emotional impact on me that it leaves me reeling yet still coming back for more, I'd say it's done a pretty damn fine job, right?\r\nThe premise for Phantom is rather simple. Our main protagonist is an innocent tourist who is brainwashed and turned into an assassin. A few montages later he perfects his skills and is readyto kick some ass. Now I know that sounds a little generic, but this anime is anything but. It coulda just been a cool thriller but it manages to find a clever balance by putting a lot of focus on the relationship of the two main characters and their internal struggles, so there's a pretty big \"human\" element to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in Phantom really are a strong point and the main reason for it's emotional pull, with almost every character having it's own distinct personality and feeling completely fleshed out. Here every plot twist, every betrayal, every death has a huge impact because of the presence each character has in the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it shifts away from it's character focus we are treated to a constant battle of wits as the leaders of Inferno (the group of assassins) struggle for power over the organization. It has a well paced and twisty-turny style, with each episode ending with a cliffhanger of sorts. It's unpredictable macabre game of power and betrayal means you never quite know who is going to come out on top so you'll never find yourself thinking \"Oh, I KNEW that would happen!\" (Unless you are one of those people that always says that, and if you are.... I hate you people!) Due to the nature of it's storytelling it's really hard for me to go into specifics, I'd prefer to give a few examples of what I liked but I fear I'd ruin half the experience if I did!\\n\\n\r\nI gotta mention the art and sounds since I loved both. The artwork was as good as anything I've seen, detailed characters and well drawn settings. (Some of the panning shots of the city looked almost lifelike). As for the sound I am a HUGE fan of dark melancholy vibes, so the opening theme \"Karma\" shot straight to the top of my favorites. It's haunting opera, battle music and Zweis cool latino style rap theme are used to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up this anime, for me it's a masterpiece in well crafted story telling and fleshed out characters. Maybe there's one or two faults in the story, which are mostly contained in the third act, but I feel that they pale in comparison to what I consider is a near perfect anime. This is 100% recommended for anyone that likes their animes dark, but beware, this is a rollercoaster of emotions. And I don't mean the kind of rollercoaster that ends with it slowly grinding to a halt so you can get off safely, it's the kind of rollercoaster where the track leads to a cliff face and hurtles you off with no regard to your safety!",

I had seen this anime on various top 100 lists, and it took my friend's recommendation to finally watch... and honestly, I was fairly disappointed. From monotonous episodes, idiosyncratic plot points, and often redundant characters; this anime is a good example of how an interesting concept initially presented well, goes downhill quickly. \r\nStory: 5\r\nIn my opinion, the story is the weakest aspect of this anime. It opens up in an interesting way, the world seems vibrant and interesting, and the insinuation of assassins killing for the mafia seems enticing. However, soon, the anime is plagued with awful time skips andpacing, the reasoning for various actions becomes void as more and more characters and groups are introduced, with a lot of emphasis put onto them, but with very little meaning conjured. I often found myself bored with the preaching of morality, and could see what was going to happen before it happened. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special. Everything is okay. The scenery is okay, the action sequences are okay. The character's visual design is okay. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI like the first opening and ending a lot. The various different OST implemented in this anime were quite good, and very fitting for the mood that was trying to be conveyed. The gunshots sounded good, the voice acting was nothing special, and the noises of vehicles was pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nAlthough there are many redundant characters, I would say the anime's strongest feature are the protagonists, and to an extent, the antagonists. The protagonists are in an interesting context, so understanding the various emotions and thoughts evoked by this context was often interesting. We see as they grow together, and how emotions change. The antagonists (who you could argue was everyone) were somewhat unique, from a manipulative, artist obsessed mad scientist type, juxtaposed to a sexual manipulator, obsessed with greed and power type. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nThis anime is a pain in the arse because it had the potential to be one of the better made, but fell right on it's face. Perhaps if this anime was shorter, it would be more enjoyable as there would less drawn out, ridiculously arduous segments. Overall I rate this a 6, if you are someone who has seen a lot of anime, I would recommend not bothering with this anime as it does nothing new. It pushes no boundaries, and lot of the dialogue and narrative is monotonous and samey. But, if you're relative new to watching anime, this could be an interesting watch if you have a lot of time.",

            "content": "Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~ showed great promise and for the most part delivered on that.  The best yet of the spring roster but it was also at many times the weakest.  Coming from Studio BEE TRAIN and director Koichi Mashimo on the coat tails of the mess that was Blade of the Immortal but the lesser known diamond in the rough episode \"Field Test\" on the joint US/Japan production of Batman Gotham Knight Phantom delivers action with some emotion sporadically at best, but still lives up to expectations in the end.\r\nDirector Mashimo who created the famous Girls With Gun trilogy of Noir,MADLAX, and El Cazador de la Bruja has gone back to his niche genre of amnesiacs and guns and sexy girls but throwing a boy into the mix.  Also basing this off a game he has plenty of source material to work with and his writer Yosuke Kuroda.  Having not read/play the visual novel/game there's not much I can say about how well or not well this has been adapted.  Whether it's very loyal or partly loyal or too spiritual I don't know.  The writing though is mixed from good to mediocre to subpar.  A few characters get little development while others get all; there's not much balance.   Still there a few stand out lines and scenes and moments that capture me and my attention.  The series though suffers from over writing.  With a few pointless slice of life episodes, flashback episodes the series could have stood to be shorter.  The addition of these minor school characters and the small romantic subplot between Zwei and Mio were unneeded.  It's almost like many times they wanted to make a different series.  Still I'll probably be one of the few that finds the introduction of Cal needed.  Cal's entrance into the series provides a bit needed comic relief in the middle of the series and gives a needed break to the audience.  Still the series doesn't pick up from there as the writing doesn't really improve until the last couple episode.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art and character designs were probably the best I've seen from BEE TRAIN yet.  Working with his veteran designers Mashimo and co. have made an amazing assortment of characters that look and feel natural.  Makiko Kojima's color pallet gives a dark and gritty film noir look.  The animation also the best I've ever seen.  You can tell they had a serious budget to work with compared to some of their earlier works.  Fewer stills but still not short of his trade mark camera pans nor cut aways.  Fluid and amazing animation and easy on the eyes CGI are the frosting on top and probably make this THE best animation of the year.  \\n\\n\r\nEqually impressive the music.  Mashimo never being the shy one when it comes to using music brought in Hikaru Nanase this year who would compose her finest soundtrack yet.  Working with Mashimo I'm sure brought the best in her composing since Chrono Crusade and has delivered an assortment of tracks that dare I say it, even probably out scored longtime Mashimo collaborator Yuki Kajiura.   \\n\\n\r\nI don't have a heavy amount more to say on Phantom.  The series has many good points and sadly many bad points that kept me from giving it a 8-10.  Pointless recaps show a sign of laziness and over production if you ask me.  It's a worthy check out for fans of this style but for some it won't be.\\n",

            "content": "A great hit-man/psychological anime. \r\nWhat stood out to me about this anime is how much the music and sound affected the entire story to evoke the emotion behind Zwei and Ein, also Reiji and Eren. I still listen to the ost and feel what I felt when watching the episodes for the first time. The accuracy of the sounds goes down to the type of guns they each used. The music also balances the dychotomy of the tension and calmness throughout the entire anime. \r\nThe characters develop as they mature, although personally I would have preferred to see a little more spark between Reiji andEren. That would've even drawn out the non-killer, human side of them, wanting and needing to get out of what they've been put into. The outcome was still believable, seeing that they're assassins after all, and they needed to detach all emotion in order to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to the characters, this is filled with various emotions, that's always followed by an array of questions. \\n",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a high profile and well presented series with an interesting premise - that a criminal organization programs people to become hardened assassins. However from the first episode and until the very end it presents an extremely weak storyline, episode one presents a man with amnesia (that laziest of plot devices) who has been selected to survive some \"training\" with a veteran assassin and Navy SEAL. The man directing the training (Scythe Master) does nothing more than throw the protagonist (Zwei) into the deep end, Scythe doing nothing more than spouting vague and weakly whimsy statements. This is a bigproblem that reoccurs throughout the series, that Scythe seemingly does nothing but somehow magically churns out assassins.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses we get several timeskips (another bad plot device) and vague circumstances which allow for storyline padding and filler. It's frustrating to see characters suddenly switch personality purely because there has been a timeskip, particularly when characters seem to act in entire contradiction to their formerly established personalities. Without wanting to give too much away the story is very linear, shallow and predictable; characters are bland, one-dimensional and schizophrenic.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is almost uniformly outstanding. Aside from some occasionally bad CG, this is one of the best looking anime series I've seen to date - characters move with incredible smoothness and detail, backgrounds are usually quite beautiful. I cannot emphasize just how good this anime looks.\\n\r\nIf anything the artwork is what offers the series some salvation, since the gunfights are so well animated and fun to watch. If you can sit through a bad storyline, watch the series for this alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dubtrack for the series was unusually good, one of the best I've heard in a long time. Despite the ridiculous lines the actors were forced to read, they did an excellent job delivering them; almost all the actors seem to fit the roles perfectly, and considering the (mostly) American setting this is the more fitting the audio track to listen to. Kudos to Funimation and their team for doing such a good job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a very disappointing series let down by a poor script, but one of the most visually interesting series you'll ever see. Such is the weakness of the story that I can't really recommend this series, but instead encourage people to check out superior programmes such as Black Lagoon or Jormungand.",

            "content": "\"Please tell me, if I could never have happiness in real life, can't I at least get to dream about it sometimes?\" Cal Devens/Drei.\r\nPhantom : Requiem of the Phantom is a beautifully told sad story. This is one dark anime that doesn't compromise, depicting the psychological state of mind of the main protagonists in a way you can feel their pain, their despair, their struggle. Kill or be killed. Instincts end up having the upper hand, and those who aren't able to kill anymore die invariably.\r\nUnable to remember their past, two assassins, Ein and Zwei, are forced to lead a dreadful life, killing repeatedly forthe infamous crime organization Inferno as the almighty Phantom, just to stay alive. Even under such circumstances, the main protagonists remain interesting. Their ability to adapt to hardships and their mutual interactions are conveyed in a way you can feel sympathy for them even though they are assassins. From denial to acceptance, they change, sometimes drastically, find their resolves, make promises and choose unexpected paths, which is accentuated with the time skips in the anime. Scheming, manipulation and betrayal are the main occupation of the supportive characters who happen to be the executives of Inferno. They control Phantom as would a puppet master handle his puppets, especially the calculating Claudio Mc Cunnen and the sly researcher Scythe Master.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are enthralling and dramatic, complementing the emotional heaviness of Phantom : Requiem of the Phantom to reveal the full power of those widely known as the assassins of Inferno. The smoothness of the animation, the greatness of the voice acting cast and the mostly classical and fitting original sountrack make the show highly appealing. This anime is a poignant experience that changes something within your way of thinking.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is an anime series based on a visual novel game from Nitro+. With the initial release in 2000 for the PC. In 2009, it was adapted into an anime from Bee Train & Genco. Bee Train does have some experience with anime based on games, having done anime based on Arc the Lad & Wild Arms. In this case, I'd never heard of either the game or the anime before it was requested. So, I don't know what to expect. Let's delve right in.\r\nStory:\r\nThe narrative follows a young man who wakes up in a strange place with no memory, ohhow I missed plot convenience amnesia since the series I watched right before this one. He finds himself being chased by a young woman in a theatrical mask. The two struggle and he manages to momentarily gain the upper hand, discovering that the whole scenario was a test. The woman introduces herself as Ein and tells him that his new name is Zwei. The series is going for number names but they're kind of doing it wrong since her name should be \u201cEins.\u201d You might think it's nit-picky to point that and that's because it is. I will freely admit that. Anyway, it turns out that Ein is a top tier assassin and that she uses the moniker, Phantom. In order for Zwei to survive, he has to train as an assassin. The series then follows his transformation and various tasks undertaken by him and Ein.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really only one significant problem with the story in this. The series suffers from plot contrived slowdown. Basically, there are situations that should be over very quickly that the series takes excessively slowly either for the sake of trying to artificially force drama or because they need a character to act slowly so that they can get another character in a position that they need to be in for the story to go where they want it. I won't spoil anything important, but there's a scene where Zwei is trying to kill someone, has ample opportunity to take a shot, but waits it out for a good five minutes for absolutely no legitimate reason. At least it's not as bad as watching someone bleed to death for fifteen minutes while their inept companion can't be bothered to tie a tourniquet. I will also say that the ending is very sudden. It arguably works but you might find it a bit off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the series does have an interesting story arc with a lot of compelling elements. There are twists, turns and time skips that are largely effective at keeping things going in a way that's natural for everything that's been built up thus far. It uses flashbacks pretty effectively. It does build tension well, when it's not forcing the action to a crawl to try to force it. There's always something going on that keeps you interested in seeing how it plays out. The pacing is pretty close to perfect. It suffers a bit from the slowdown, but the series mostly knows when to use slow moments to build things up and when to get fast-paced and hectic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere are no good characters in this series. The characters are complex, well-written and have some sympathetic elements to them, but they're also all pretty damn reprehensible when it gets right down to it. And this is one of those series where that really works to its benefit. Having characters who are really moral and upright wouldn't work with the setting. This is one of those cases where the characters are largely unsympathetic, but still really interesting. It manages to get you invested in the characters and their narratives by giving you complexity, well executed character development and some intriguing dynamics. The only real issue here is that there's a character who undergoes a pretty extreme metamorphosis over the course of a time skip and doesn't seem remotely like they used to be when you next meet them.. The series does try to explain it and flesh it out, but the impetus that it gives for the transformation are pretty weak.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty strong in this. There are some really creepy moments, some of which involve molestation and are pretty hard to watch. I do appreciate that the series doesn't sexualise those scenes. It does take the high road and keeps it classy. The action sequences are nicely intense and can be really interesting. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well. I do have a couple issues with the artwork, though. The first is that Bee Train's idea of making a character look intense sometimes includes having them go cross-eyed and there are some scenes where that really detracts from the tone. The other issue has to do with oddly angled scenes. There are some scenes where they'll show everything slanted or upside down in what appears to be an attempt at looking artistic. It doesn't. It's just distracting and a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some really strong performances in this. Irino Miyu, Takagaki Ayahi and Sawashiro Miyuki in particular. If there's any weakness it's Chiba Isshin. His performance in this can be a bit over the top. Although, in all fairness, it's not bad. He doesn't chew the scenery, he just bites into it a bit. Most of the music is pretty amazing and grandiose. There is, however, one big exception. There's a bit of instrumental stuff towards the end that throws in the sound of a woman moaning in a vaguely sexual way. I have no idea why that's in there, to be honest. It pops up mostly in action sequences where the moans clash pretty horribly with what's happening. There's really no narrative reason for the disconnect. It's like Kato Tatsuya thought that a woman randomly moaning would make things intense, not realising that the intensity it brings isn't a violent action sequence type of intensity but, rather, a sleazy hotel room type of intensity. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's really not any in this.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom has a great story, great characters, strong art, acting and music. It had potential to be so much better, but it gets held back by some really poor decisions throughout. The slowdown of plot elements in a cheap attempt to add drama, the weak character transformation, the oddly angled shots and looks of cross-eyed intensity and the tonally awkward moans in the music. Maybe these are cases where the game handled them fine and it just didn't transition well or maybe they were problems inherited from the game. Either way, the anime gets an 8/10. It's still a great series in spite of those issues. Next week, we'll begin horror anime month with a look at the second Corpse Party OVA.",

I have to say, it is one of the best anime I have ever watched.\r\nArt (9/10)\r\nThe art is very great. It is animated very realistically while still retaining the part of anime art that attracts so many people. Phantom's movements and eye changes are some of the exceptional arts.\r\nCharacter (10/10)\r\nThis, I have to say, is the most important to me. With all the anime being created, there are less of the cold, cool malecharacter that possesses amazing abilities at the beginning. Instead, most anime nowadays center on a pathetic, weak male character being beat around by an arrogant female character, overcoming challenges and eventually emerging victorious,(blah blah lame). Zwei in this anime is all that anyone could ever look for in a good character. He is cold, logical, intelligent, cool, skillful, taciturn and doesn't take crap from anyone. HE is in control. Throughout the anime, I always seem to relate to him and cheer him on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is the story of Reiji, a kidnapped tourist who was trained to be a heartless assassin of peerless skill at a desert facility and given the codename Zwei. He meets Ein, the prototype assassin, also known as Phantom. They endeavor on the quest to find out their true identities and escape from the world of assassinations and the crime organization Inferno, which they once belonged to. Throughout the story are numbers of twists and revelations that would certainly beat the \"journey to slay the evil dragon\" storyline any day. The end is much like the end of Code Geass R2. It is very ambiguous and leaves the viewer confused and deep in thought.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nThis anime embraces tragedy and vengeance, two often ignored concepts in anime. Life isn't always full of happiness and flowers and the producers of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom understand that. If you are bored of all those mainstream animes where the pathetic main character has no backbone and just gets beat around but then (SUDDENLY) obtains great powers... only to be beat around by the female character again, then this anime is the answer to your prayers.\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE\u2122\r\nCould you kill a person?\r\nI don\u2019t mean some hypothetical \u201cbutton you could press and someone you\u2019ve never met dies.\u201d I mean: could you look into the eyes of another human being and pull the trigger?\r\nFor a long time now Gen Urobuchi and I have had a love/hate relationship. I\u2019ve absolutely adored some of his works, while others have left me profoundly underwhelmed. Phantom Requiem, however, does not neatly fall into either of these categories. Some parts of the anime truly showcase Urobuchi at his best, and some parts are frustrating, clich\u00e9d or just downright stupid.\r\nSTORY 8/10\r\n[This entire section was removed due to spoilers]\r\nOk, ok, I\u2019llat least try. Phantom Requiem follows the lives of assassins in the underworld as they struggle with shifting loyalties, their morals and conspiracies on top of conspiracies. The main character: Zwei finds himself in a world where he must kill to survive with no one to count on but himself. There are no solid factions, and certainly no \u201cgood guys.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t a whole lot I can say about the story without spoiling it. The whole paradigm of the world of Phantom gets turned on its head several times throughout the story. The story is very well put-together and it is probably one of the hardest plots to predict that I\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the story can\u2019t resist indulging in some rather vexatious clich\u00e9s. I always get a little agitated when I catch a whiff of the stench of harem, and while most of the girls who fall for Zwei have a damn good reason, at least one has no business liking him other than to increase his appeal as insert character. And, oh yes, part of this anime somehow manages to worm its way into a high school. These world class assassins, capable of confronting armies of thugs, are, of course, in their teens. But to be fair, this particular annoyance is not explicitly stated in the anime, only in the source material. That is really all these things are: annoyances. Annoying as these tropes are, they serve to distract rather than detract.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does detract is the staggering amount of bullshit that permeates this series. Only a few examples: making impossibly long sniping shots in one try with no spotter, deflecting knives with knives and surviving clearly fatal wounds with no medical attention. The rules of Phantom Requiem\u2019s world are extremely confusing, skirting the line between gritty realism and surreal action scenes where the characters perform unmistakably superhuman feats.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough irksome at times, the story is really one of the best thrillers I\u2019ve seen in anime. It kept me guessing at the edge of my seat the entire time. It is complex and emotional, despite its flaws. It hits hard, and best of all for such an intricate plot, manages to have no inconsistencies.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to get too technical, but to use a professional term: this show looks like a pile of ass. If I had to pick one gripe about this show, it would be the art. It is really unfortunate how a story like this is so let down by the visuals. The animation is choppy, the characters\u2019 eyes are the size of dinner plates and they squeezed in as many still frames as they could. There is a lot of variety and the dark art reflects the show well, however it overall leaves the impression that the studio tried, but just couldn\u2019t quite hack it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is mostly an intense mix of rock and hip hop, fitting the show excellently. The low production values do shine through a little in the great lack of variety and somewhat uninspiring openings and endings. The voice acting in Japanese is stellar, emotional and convincing. Skip the dub on this one, it\u2019s terrible.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the characters of Phantom Requiem are a true strong point. The main characters are all truly top notch, but the side characters are also exceptional. Some are criminals for the money, some for the respect, some for the thrill and some are just insane. Even the few law-abiding characters are compelling and their interaction with these criminals can be some of the more interesting parts of the series. The side characters are generally very well characterized with believable stories and motivations. However, I would have liked to see a couple of them fleshed out a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are truly outstanding. Many \u201ctragic\u201d characters earn that title only by being the punching bag of the director. The main characters of Phantom Requiem all show truly tragic qualities. Again I am restricted by spoilers, so I won\u2019t say too much. One thing Urobuchi excels at is working flaws into his characters; in this respect, the \u201cPhantoms\u201d are sublime. The plot may squeeze in a stereotype or two, but the characters are refreshingly original.\\n\\n\r\nEin and Zwei, the two leads, evolve beautifully both as people and their relationship with each other. Their development is gradual, strongly linked to their environment and acquaintances, and wonderfully absorbing. Because these two start out as essentially blank slates, the viewer is not permitted to assume anything about them, forced to rely on the superb character development.\\n\\n\r\nEventually we are introduced to the tritagonist, Cal Devens. The shifts in her character are powerful, driving the second half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will end this section here because I am already starting to bump up against the fuzzy line of \u201cspoilers.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it: this anime is a tearjerker. Phantom Requiem is emotionally very intense. Mr. Urobuchi\u2019s nickname, \u201cUrobutcher,\u201d is no coincidence. This series is dark, nihilistic and depressing at times, so it hardly appeals to everyone. Personally I was completely caught up at times, but often I found myself frustrated or angry. I think this anime is a lot easier to appreciate than to like.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nI have not mentioned the ending of Phantom Requiem. I will not spoil it, but I can say I think any viewer will have a strong reaction to it, and it was completely unnecessary. It is very difficult for me to describe my feelings on this anime, my opinion is very much split. I can\u2019t wholeheartedly recommend this series, but if you are a fan of Urobuchi you definitely shouldn\u2019t miss this.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nAn era of America where the Mafia is the most feared organization in the world. Inferno, the most powerful and well known. Their secret and almost invincible weapon of all is Phantom! Incidentally a Japanese tourist is a witness to one of Phantom's murders. Trying to escape the chaos he hides himself, being deprived of starvation, water, and in all of this.....he still tries to survive. The basic human instinct, Survive at all costs. Now learning that Phantom is not inhuman but a young girl called \"Ein\". Inferno seeing these traits that are also part of \"Ein\", strips him of his memories and putshim through rigorous testing, both physically and mentally. Eventually earning him the name of \"Zwei\". Now another one of Inferno's puppets \"Zwei\", he fights to survive the new  world of violence, deceit, and loneliness to hopefully one day regain his lost memories.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe artwork near the beginning can seem dull but enlightened at the same time. The art helps put you into the setting and mood that is being portrayed throughout the story. In the beginning, training out in the desert reminds me of a war time scenario. Training to perfection, secluded, and nothing but focus on the mind. The art really helps in getting you to envision what it would be like to be in Zwei's shoes. Smooth transitioning and keep you on your toes exciting art play a role in the action and calm moments during the story line. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nBy far, one of the best choices of music and sounds. Every moment from beginning to end is reflected by the music which entices the viewer even more. The intro brings you into that suspenseful but yet relaxed mood of enjoyment. From there, each setting and scene is different and creates unique and beautiful sounds throughout the story. The loneliness is felt through the mood of the sounds or sometimes the lack of noise itself. It really helps put you into the shoes of the characters. When the action hits hard, so do the sounds and it makes you want to start running....heck, maybe train to be an assassin. The voices of the characters accent their mood. How they act and react to scenarios is shown very impressively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nViolence, deceit, loneliness, and lost memories. This almost sums everyone up in a nutshell. All of the characters are unique and I think the character progression and uniqueness set this apart from other animes. Brainwashed assassins trying to regain their memories and at the same time fighting and a battle within themselves. Inferno employees always trying to get a one up on one another by whatever means necessary. On the female side, the two that were the most enticing and could even say seductive were Ein and Claudia. Both have that loneliness inside of them but one is completely lost and fighting her way out while the other is on a mission the achieve the greatest she can with Inferno no matter what. On the male side, you have Zwei and Scythe. Two different yet some similar traits in both of them. Each one is set out on a mission. The difference being Zwei helps you feel for both Ein and Claudia. The relationships built with Zwei and the other characters makes your heart feel warm but on your toes at all times. Scythe makes you see, feel, and be horrified by what his masterpieces are. How he lives in the shadow of Inferno and lives in a dark and secret world of his own. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThere are 26 episodes in total. The story is a 10/10. Art was great but could use some improvements in areas 9/10. The sounds were a great asset in this epic story 9.5/10. Characters were very unique 10/10. Enjoyment level 9/10. \\n\r\nOverall score: 9.5/10",

            "content": "Phantom Requiem for the Phantom is basically a mix between Bourne Identity, The Departed and The Godfather. It is written by Gen Urobuchi (Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, and PsychoPass), whose work have been critically acclaimed and praised by many. Why this show never got the same attention as the shows mentioned above is a complete mystery to me, as this is an ambitious, engaging and terrifically executed anime.\r\nStory: 9/10 (Excellent)\r\nThe plot surrounds a character name Zwei: who gets captured, his memory gets wiped and is forced to work as an assassin for an underworld organization called Inferno. The best assassin in Inferno, Ein, trains him tobecome the ruthless bad ass he needs to be. What really makes this anime stand out is the interesting perspective it draws on assassins and the workings of being one. These qualities and their methods are cleverly integrated in very creative and interesting missions that are forced upon the two main characters. It has a grounded and realistic approach that really helps immerse you into the show. There are three major acts in this anime that progress the main character, and each present major challenges for him to overcome. The first two acts are outstanding: incredibly engaging, full of memorable and shocking moments, with excellent character development. Where the story stumbles... is during the last act. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems with the last act was some odd and unrealistic decisions that breaks some of the realism established in the preceding acts. One example of this is when machine guns are firing at one of the assassins and the assassin just goes into God mode. The henchmen shoot like storm troopers somehow hitting every molecule around the assassin without hitting the assassin!! The show did such a good job making the gun fights feel threatening and real earlier, so what is with this hiccup?! One of the cool things in the show was seeing the assassins come up with ways to apply their training or clever thinking to outmatch their opponents. This obviously sticks out as a problem, because of how well handled they were before. Another problem with this third act was the tone; I am all for dark stuff, but holy crap it was bleak and negative to the point where it got tiring. The first arc offset this dark tone with plenty of well spaced missions and action, and the second act accomplished the same with an optimistic and humorous character. To me its important when having a dark story to have other elements to balance it; otherwise it becomes harder to enjoy after a while. One last major issue with this final act is a tragic moment near the end that isn't as impactful as it could have been due to a mishandled character. Without spoiling anything a major character could have been more sympathetic in her portrayal, as this character becomes surprisingly unlikable at this point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its problems, the last arc makes up for its shortcomings with an admittedly riveting climax with things coming together strongly at the end. The ending itself is divisive and won't be to everyone's liking. However, I feel like it really couldn't have ended better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 (great)\\n\r\nDespite the one mishandled character I mentioned earlier, the rest of the cast is handled amazingly. Zwei is an antihero done right. They find just the right balance between sympathy and stone cold bad-assery, which makes him a really strong protagonist to follow through the show. Of the secondary characters... Ms. McCunnen and Cal really stand out.  Ms. McCunnen is manipulative, cunning and quick on her feet. She is a really cool character with some great moments. Cal was also excellent in the second act of the show, providing a charming and funny personality that the show needed. She also has the closest things to really heartwarming and emotionally genuine moments this anime has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound: 9/10 (great)\\n\r\nThe production values are surprisingly excellent for a studio I have never heard of.  But it isn't the art and animation that blew me away, it was the music. The OP is beautiful and perfectly complements the show. The soundtrack is also killer: adrenaline pumping when it needs to be and giving the show a chilling and haunting atmosphere that fits wonderfully. The English dub is also really solid, so if your not anti-english dub that is an option. I found Ein's voice to be a bit odd in english, but everyone else is solid (especially Cal's VA). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall, I loved this show. I was always left in suspense and was constantly impressed with the smart and thought provoking elements of the show. In my eyes this is a show about ones actions, and the ramifications one faces as a result. The past is like a ghost that comes back to haunt you, that reminds you of your sins and has you struggle with it as a consequence. I really like shows that are thought provoking, and it is certainly memorable. If the final third could have just injected a bit more humanity and kept the grounded realism of the first two-thirds of the show it would have been perfect. This was like Death Note in a sense.  Overall its fantastic, but the last third is clearly the most flawed part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show. This may not appeal to you if you are looking for something fast paced, simple and purely fun. However, if you are looking for a great dark psychological thriller, this is a truly excellent show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I was first fascinated by screenshots and thought its gonna hurt to try one or two episodes. After watching first few episodes i become phantom fan.\r\n There are many reasons why i like phantom, one of them being its superb background theme  and art mix. It has quite a unique story  intertwinedwith art and sound to produce a great entertainment. In this anime you can witness the deceitful ,violent natures and conspiracies of underworld. Vicious organizations leaders who struggle for power and using subordinates as disposable tools, and the henchmen whose  lives and destines are changed  by the unexpected nature of underworld,and finally the gradually forming strong bond built between two top notch assassins,which is the main focus of this drama, are the things you will see in phantom.",

This review contains spoilers however thats not a problem as hopefully you will not watch this if you have any respect for good writing. \r\nIf you just want to have a good action-thriller or something like that, watch something else. Normaly I put my recommendations at the end but because the following is a deconstruction of how incredibly shitty this show was, I'll be so kind and tell you right nowsome shows that actually make sense:\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror\\n\r\nBaccano\\n\r\nDurarara\\n\r\nBlack Bullet (kinda at least)\\n\r\nDarker than black\\n\r\nBtooom\\n\r\nShinsekei Yori\\n\r\nHigashi no Eden\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe plot:\\n\\n\r\nThe story of \"Phantom: Requiem for the phantom\" takes place somewhere inbetween 2000 and 2010. It tells the story of \"Zwei\" (german for two), a japanese student that was caught in the middle of a fight of an organisation called Inferno. He was however spared, as our classic villain with the desire to create the perfect assasin found him and saw \"raw potential\" in him and his instinctive strength to kill and survive. We also get to know \"Ein\" (german for one, although it would be eins if the writer had known any german and not used google-translate). She is - unlike Zwei, a lot less talented. However she is the perfect doll as she seemingly has completely lost her will to resist the orders of \"master scythe\". The story follows the \"tragic\" life of our cast as they have to face death, crime, injustice and so on. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAt first, Phantom delivers a solid action-thriller. A very, very strong first episode that makes us ask \"why, who and what happend\". Sadly, the writer basicaly solves the entire mystery after 2 respectively 5 episodes. Wow. After that we have to witness a slow decline in credibility and logic until in episode 10 and 11 we look at the screen and ask ourselves: \"What the fuck even?\"\\n\\n\r\nExamples of this absolute nonsense are the following: meaningless, unrealistic plottwists like the sacrifice of ein to protect her master are just dumb. You see her standing in a waiting-position BEHIND Zwei as he faces the master, he screams (ofc he followed him like 2 minutes in steady 10 meter distance to face him off in an epic, mysterious deadend aka the end of the port). And no, he does not wait, he shots at the master. But \"HEY LETS FORGET ABOUT FUCKING LOGIC FOR A SECOND\" aka  ein magicaly teleports infront of Zwei, jumps infront of the master and saves him from the bullet. (btw we see that the shot went through her body in later episodes but okay, it then must have stoped in midair inbetween her and the master and droped to the ground). Zwei loses his shit and instead of killing the master he has a mental breakdown. The master then shoots him three times in the chest from basically 1 meter or less with a high-caliber gun. We also see that he has shot him in the middle of the chest. Zwei gives no fucks about that, falls into the sea, gets transported to the beach (btw the water would've filled his lungs and he would0ve just drowned as he was still alive when he fell into the water) where the waves cover him entirely (so that he sure as hell must be dead because he also couldn't breath).\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, what did you say? He survived it? AND EIN TWO? Oh boy how could I forget about that they have mastered ultra instinct (yes, they avoid bullets from machine guns mid-air in earlier episodes) AND survive direct hits to the heart AND don't need air to survive AND return to the places they hate the most. Yeah. We all do that to from time to time, don't we?\\n\\n\r\nEven if you forget about these \"smaller\" things or the wtf moments like when the characters somehow manage to overcome all problems and do some absolutely impossible things like jumping 3 meters high; its very clear, that the show has major flaws in writing and it looks as if they had a solid foundation and then a very, very untalented writer.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot much to say. The animation was very nice, especialy in the beginning. It felt fluent for the most part, featured lovely backgrounds and solid character design. Tho at times the CGI was a bit odd (can be forgiven for a show from 2009 tho).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIts an absolute shame this show is such garbage beceause the soundtracks sure as hell weren't. An absolutely stunning OP, a very strong ED and to top it all: a fitting, atmospheric OST. I wish more shows had such an amazing sound. The voiceacting was good, nothing very remarkable tho. The english dub is also pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOh boy. Just no. Let me introduce you to the cast once more:\\n\\n\r\n\"Ein\" aka kudere-girl that has somehow NO will to get back her memories and merely exists to give us a reason for Zwei to betray everyone.\\n\\n\r\n\"Zwei\" aka our classic protagonist with no deeper meaning, a very strange character development from super scared to super scary to super badass to super bad fucked in the ass. After he loses \"Ein\" he adopts a little girl and helps her seek revenge for her dead sister (except they probably didn't even kill the right murderer.)\\n\\n\r\n\"Drei\" (german for three, I guess you see the pattern here by now), the adopted girl that loved Zwei over everything but then decided that she would follow our villain and kill zwei because he \"let her back dead\" when really she was in dispair and hopelessness because she lost her only family like 10 minutes earlier in the show. \\n\\n\r\n\"Scythe Master\", a classic villain with no real reason besides to be the villain.\\n\\n\r\n\"Claude\" aka super weird lady with the will to kill everyone in her gang because she wants to climb the ladder of power (something that her dead brother never could) and merely exists to give zwei a reason to kill and to present some fanservice. You know they knew the show must be bad if they depend on fanservice in mid-show after they realized their show has nothing more to present besides boobies)\\n\\n\r\nThe \"gang\" aka a big group of random evil mafia-gangsters, yakuzas and triade-members that build the foundation of the ultimative, evil group of \"inferno\"\\n\\n\r\nYeah, you get it. The characters are shit. At first however they seem very interessting (including ein - zwei - drei) but they soon lose all credibility and become very unlikable. Oh did I already mention that Drei went from \"super loli that can't possibly be older than 13\" to \"women that looks like 25 - 30 with the will to kill everyone without reason\" in 2 years? Great, isn't it. Its like as if after they killed boobie-sponsor 1 they needed someone else so they decided to make drei into the boobie-sponsor of the last arc. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMan, I wish this show was better. I wanted to drop it after ep 11 but kept watching. I just had that hope, that it would take a 180 degree turn and deliver a solid second half. And it did - for around 4 episodes, then it went downhill even more than before. \\n\r\nIts somehow sad to say but I'd rather watch Kiss x Sis than this because there at least I know what I can and should expect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nDecent at best. Not recommended. If you like action-thrillers, watch something else. \\n",

But its just done horrible.\r\nI like plot twist, dont care if a main character dies or gets betrayed etc in the end cause sometimes that works out great. But its just done horrible. Can only discribe it as \"Made\"\r\nNow let me explain why i picked that word, \"made\". It explains the characters actionsand the story.\\n\r\nIts made by some people from a anime company. \\n\r\nImmagen u gotta escape prison but there is no wall, no guards, no nothing. Your basecly just there cause someone told u it was a prison and dont try to escape. U want to escape u hate it there u have the option and there no drawback. WHY WOULD U STAY? cuz someone is drawing a picture of u staying in the prison. \\n\r\nSame with the character design. ITS like they put a sigaret in a guys mouth but he doesnt smoke cuz hes a healthfreak.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to explain it in a way it makes sence and dont give away spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nMeaning everyone in the series act the way they do NOT cuz it makes sence to the plot or the characters.

Well this anime series is just that. With the mixture of violence and gangs of the world this is a very action back series that most everyone will enjoy.\r\nI really enjoyed this anime series so much that I plan to watch it again sometime next month. I haven't ever stumbled onto a jem like this series before! This is so much like mission impossible or the bourne supremacy series that I fellin love with it in a flash.\\n\\n\r\nThe story behind this anime is solid. Its nothing to out of the way to understand and nothing so amazing you just realize from the end that its all over. Its a good train, kill, be killed, emotional reck and take it to the man kind of story. I found it interesting and very appealing to my liking :) I scored an 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a very tasteful and experiencing thing. In this anime I notced myself watching their faces more because they had emotion on their face most of the time and the shading was very realistic during the night and day! Its a very graphically inclined series with I enjoyed as well, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOkay for the music to me it was just as how when you watch James bond it has there own music to it. Well for Phantom its does just the same! The music was SO great! It showed some ghosty/phantom presence when played and it was very haunting which is why I loved it so much! a perfect score...10\\n\\n\r\nThe character relationship to the mafia, businesses and there masters are deep and very disturbing how something people can be so brainwashed to do such things. They have a very deep passion when it comes to freedom and wanting to live life. I love the character development in this series! perfect score 10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor was certainly there! Who doesn't like to see wold class assasains killing and making a uproar! ha yeah this was a very fun series to watch. I rated it a 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall this series Phantom is the best assassin anime out there. The mixture of an assassin who is a ghost when fighting is just so amazing. There is even a deeper meaning to why it is to be a phantom. I won't spoil any spoilers but please watch because this series is really a must see if you enjoy action pack government consparisy movies !",

Although i love all tracks, my favorite has to be the one at the beginning  of episode 12 x_x\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: I have one word for this, the anime is a \"MASTERPIECE\", really well done, thank god this show doesn't have lazy animators, because that ruins the fun!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Really extraordinary characters, beautifully made, and well developed throughout the series\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: This is one of the animes that gave chill/thrills of excitment most of the time(especially after ep 11). For some people, they might give up after a few episodes because they might not really like it, but they are they stupid ones, because they real plot twists start after the first few episodes! I GUARANTEE YOU WILL ENJOY IT!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: ONE OF MY TOP 10 ANIMEs FOR SURE, IT TRULY IS A GREAT ANIME, AND EVERYONE(even if you aren't a fan of the genre) SHOULD WATCH IT! I TAKE GUARANTEE THAT ALL OF YOU WILL LOVE IT!",

            "content": "So since my last review got deleted because it had no arguments, i will do a better one. \r\nAbout the plot. I found the plot to be really interesting. The story is about the world of crime and how is it like living as an assassin. It give us a view of how hard it is, and how painfull. It explores how is it like,\" living with no emotions\". \r\nIt shows us the dark side of any city nowadays and it makes us feel how it would be like if we were in their position.  \r\nWe do have a romance story here, with alitle bit of drama. For me, i found it \"okay\", it is not good, but makes the development of the plot much more interesting, and that can make you feel hooked. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the rest, it's normal stuff. The bad guys, the main character beeing strong as hell(wich in this case it's nice since the action is all about who shoots the gun first), and all of rest. That's why i didn\u00b4t gave it a higher rate for the plot, it is not original. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is good, altough in the action part, the detail is not that good. Taking that out , the rest is nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is cool. The first opening in my opinion portrays the quality of the show. It is a brilliant opening that fits perfectly with the anime (both the music and the lyric). While on the action, we do hear almost everything, wich make us feel like we were there assisting to the figth. It's just for me at least, a good feeling. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, i advise this show for those who seek for a different plot and different themes. It is a nice show, so if you like dark animes with tons of action and a litle bit of romance and drama, watch this one. For young people, i don\u00b4t advise this show. Since usually young groups prefer the classic shonen for an action anime, this one is not that kind of thing for sure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope this time i could help you out with my review.",

            "content": "\"Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom\" , this title brings back memories.\r\nThe series itself has everything you may want : a good storyline with some unsuspected twists, evolving characters and good interaction between them, great soundtracks and animation quality.\r\nThe story starts with the main character waking up in an unknown place and finds himself being chased by some masked girl that tries to kill him. Having an amnesia , the only think he does is rely on his survival instincts and tries to get away, but he is soon forced to face the girl. He manages to pin her down , disarms her but doesn't killher. He then gets recruited by some mad doctor that makes assassins and from that...good luck with finding out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty solid, and even in the moments when you think that \"it's pulled out of the writer's butt\" ,if you stay and study it a bit , those guys are professional killers with high level of training so things like that are simple for them, especially in anime. The think that this series present is how different people take different paths to later claim the same goal, how the characters who find themselves ins similar situation try to pull each other out of the hole, how having nothing left to lose make yourself not caring about anything and how going gaining a reason to live makes you want to get others like you to get one too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters development is really good. In this anime all characters change their mind sets to get accustomed to the situation. They will still aim for the same goal but the way they approach the problems will differ.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great.I like the way the characters and their clothes and equipment is drawn. Also the animation is really good : especially the fighting scenes are really fluid and the angles at which the action is presented is adding to my enjoyment. The facial expression of the characters is the right one for each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAgain another great think : soundtrack. It's just great. Except the first ending song which seems to me a bit too out of place , I listen to every single one of them. Not only they sound good , they are in the right place. You wont be hearing a boring song in the middle of a fight.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this anime. If you are into drama or thriller genre you will love it. Also if you like action you will surely find yourself saying \"Just one more before I go to sleep\" and get yourself to marathon it. Actually...you can be into any kind of genres and this anime will appeal to you. I like to think that the ending of the anime is left open like...\"That's it guys , we ain't making another season but...that doesn't mean that's how the story ends...make up your own!\"...or that's the way I think...",

            "content": "The Only Place For Killers is Right Here and Now...\r\nThe first half of this series was posed to become a new personal favorite for me, but without spoiling anything plot-wise, I'll just say that so many sharks were jumped at around the halfway mark you'd think you were watching an Olympic water skiing competition on the set of Jaws. It took a lot to win me back over after that but I stuck with it due to my sheer love of the first half and it eventually did. This series is, in essence, anime's response to James Bond, Mission Impossible, Jason Borne and the likeand it has an OP drenched in atmosphere that could give almost any Bond stinger a run for its money.\\n\\n\r\nThough the type of story being told, amnesiac assassins forced to fight for a shady organization, has been done before, the way in which the themes are handled philosophically was what heightened the impact and effectiveness for me. The exploration of such psychological concepts as nature vs. nurture were very well-handled. It asks, \"if you could erase all of the experiences that made a person who they are, could you turn any average person into a cold-blooded killer, or vice versa?\" This question has a deeply disturbing psychological toll on the main characters which was expertly conveyed through some top-notch voice acting in both the sub and dubbed versions which makes you feel a strange connection to these sometimes seemingly cold, soulless and robotic killers.\\n\\n\r\nThe results of the experiment also form the basis of what could be one of the most loathsome villains in anime for me. While Master Scythe may not be masterfully designed, or really imposing or memorable in any physical way, the manor in which he violates the very nature of characters and strips them of their humanity makes him a completely despicable individual who you route for the defeat of whole-heartedly. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the series had a very strong start and potential to be something truly great, it slipped up in the middle, but brought it back around for a satisfying enough conclusion, did I mention one of the BEST scores of any show ever made? Hype soundtrack is a 10 out of 10, the show as a whole is more like a 7, well worth a watch if you're a fan of the mafia/hitman psychological action-thriller genre though.",

            "content": "Well, this is an interesting little \u2018James Bond\u2019 style opening they have. Strangely, we follow a man who doesn\u2019t remember anything about his background, not even his own name. I feel as though they kind have coped out with using amnesia as their background. The only little look we get into his past is his \u2018master\u2019 who I see as a stupid slime ball. That\u2019s only the first act though, and the others get even crazier. Unfortunately, the first episode lost me. They started talking about science and animal instants to a point I had no clue what they were talking about. I was stillconfused as I kept watching and got pretty much no answer, and to top it all off, there are three arcs that seem to mess me up a bit. There were many times they kept hinting at a love between some of the characters and yet it was pretty much all a tease.\\n\\n\r\nAs I kept watching, it did get slightly better on the character scale but the story line fell apart. Yuko turned into a slut and though the two main characters turned into more interesting characters but it was little too late. Not only that, but the basterd \u2018master\u2019 was even creepier more then before. Spy also turned rather creepy, bent on killing the master as though he was brainwashed again. You see his true self, which isn\u2019t different then when he was a phantom. And it doesn\u2019t help that the main character should have been dead at episode 10, but somehow, he ends up surviving. It poses the question, how the hell did he end up surviving being drowned and shot three times in the chest. MAK put it best when I was speaking with him outside the podcast as putting it \u2018Logic: \u201cUm\u2026 what happened?\u201d Phantom: \u201cWell, Fuck you! HAHAHA!!\u201d\u2019 There is no logic in the show at all and this makes it worse.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we go into the second arc, which makes no fucken sense. And its only 6 fucken months when Spy \u2018died\u2019 and when he pretty much does what he wants by going back to being a stool pigeon for Inferno. Logic also doesn\u2019t have a hand in how he looks so much older then he was before. And they brought a strange lolita girl into the mix and he takes her down like what happen to him. Then near the end of that arc, they made a really strange story up about mistrust in Inferno and had a bunch of the characters killed off. These little storylines behind the characters were a little heart wrenching\u2026 if it didn\u2019t feel like they were pulled out of someones ass. There was no hints what so ever that there was something odd going on or about Claudia\u2019s brother or nothing, noda zip-ditalie do da day bit of info that any of this was ever going to come up.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the third arc should never of existed. Again in the words of MAK \u2018Consistency: Hey guys, what the hell is going on?Phantom: Well, you see here is that...*slaps consistency* Fuck you, that what's going on.\u2019 I mean, Spy and Ein go to school\u2026 and are acting as brother and sister. Not only that, but Cal who was the youngest character is now pretty much an adult. What I see is somehow, Cal grew up rather fast in two years and Ein and Spy have actually somehow de-aged. I also love how when Spy sees Cal, the first thing he thinks is why she\u2019s here, then she\u2019s alive\u2026 but we don\u2019t get the question on everyone\u2019s mind of how she grew up as fast as she did.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is actually rather good looking. Backgrounds have a lot of interesting detail to them and yet it doesn\u2019t push the characters into feeling out of place or blend them to into the background. When they bring in the CG, it wasn\u2019t all that off putting though they should of probably stuck to normal animation. The beginning of episode 12 starts out with some very realistic images of a city which actually looked a little ok. We could really do without the sexual images of little girls being rubbed down by older sick men. It annoys the hell of me that all of these shows have that. One other thing that really bugs me is the idea of the recoil on the guns in this show. There is no real physics in it like the fact that in real life, you cannot shoot an AK47 with one hand because of how bad the recoil is. I have seen this done many times in real shows. It is just not possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and opening is actually rather sad, using surreal images and somewhat sexual looking backgrounds to the point it feels very James Bond like. Sadly, the ending song seems more like something from Rozen Maiden in both style and imagery. I guess it does work slightly but just makes me feel a bit sad because the opening and ending feels like it should have been switched.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are\u2026 let\u2019s just say don\u2019t fit well. One or two actually sound alright to the characters but the main characters feel a bit off. Ein feels like Yuki from Haruhi Suzumiya in that she never seems to actually speak without a dull monotone that wants to lull me to sleep. As for Zwei, he feels a bit disinterested in anything around him and rather boring as well. I did like Raymond McGuire, who is voiced by J.Michael Tatum, who is one of the main executives of Inferno. Claudia is also done rather interesting with a voice that is pretty much Yuko from xxxHolic. She seems as a voice of reason and actually has rather good intentions to the characters. As such, I guess it was reasonable to give her Yuko\u2019s voice.\\n",

Besides a few \"too dumb to live\" moments and the apparent special abilities of the main characters (which was kind of explained, though pure skill definitely doesn't account for all their abilities).

Thesound, while generally good for the first arc, seemed to drop off noticeably in the second. Reiji and Cal's main themes both got old fast, and Reiji's especially just annoyed me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nReiji's development was actually fairly good, and Ein underwent some dramatic changes, even if they didn't show as much superficially. Cal, on the other hand, was really disappointing to watch, especially since her entire life purpose stemmed from a misunderstanding that could easily have been rectified.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was still an extremely good show. There were a few moments that were downright chilling, and the action just kept coming. Despite a few obvious flaws in plot and an unsatisfying finish, it was still a great show. 9/10",

            "content": "Certainly an interesting story, and definitely has potential to keep people rolling, but I\u2019d say for those who aren\u2019t particularly close to art in every form (writing particularly), they\u2019ll miss the phantom that the author had interlaced into every detail of the animation.\r\nStory - 8. Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. Such a wonderful name. Just saying the name was quite exciting. And the setting? Muy Bien. To stage a story of a \u201cphantom,\u201d what could be better than the very underground of which we know nothing of? The underground, a shadow of the working class, a ghost to those close, yet unaware. Yes, I believethe dark, violent, and mysterious mafia and gang setting was a beautiful stage for this story. The plot was very good. While it really just has to do with the struggle for turf dominance and the fight to ascend in ranks, it\u2019s really the characters that make this all worthwhile, because the characters, whom become phantoms of the lives they used to live, get to show off, just how phantomly they are when dominated the entire underworld. Later, the setting itself becomes the phantom which chases the characters, as they struggle to run from their own shadows. However, I found the last episode very lacking. The twist was interesting, and not expected, but the feel of the episode didn\u2019t quite fit the canvas painted by the plot. This includes the twist, as it really had nothing to add to the plot which had been sewn so intricately. At best, the last episode was really a poorly wrapped box to signify that the contents inside were all you were getting. I\u2019m quite use to the traditional \u201cgo out with a bang\u201d and I feel as though that would have been a better way to leave an everlasting impression for this type of series. Thus, I give the story only an eight.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10. I will step away from my traditional sense of art when I write reviews, because this one requires a little deeper an understanding. I believe that in creating this series, more than just drawing and animation had to go into the art. The author was trying to create an entire painting with the series. He set the plot as the canvas, the music as the mood, and the character\u2019s stories and backgrounds as the subject. He wanted not just the story to be of a phantom, but the entire ordeal to scream that of ghastly conscious. He wanted us to recognize that every detail that went into it was a feature of a phantom, the underground, the lost characters, even the scenery which most would consider ordinary, is phantomly in that it is something our characters can never grasp, and always wonder and muse over.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10. This certainly played into the mood of each scene, as the author wanted you to know when someone was about to have their soul ripped from them, he wanted you to know when the main characters were going change the atmosphere, he wanted you to see the light being sucked out of each scene as the phantom like characteristics of arrived.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10. The thing I found most enjoyable about the character was the development (if you could call it that). Each main characters were phantoms of by having their souls ripped straight from them. Having a normal life taken away and dangled in their faces. Having them disappear from the world. It wasn\u2019t just that they were feared assassins of the underworld, it was so much more, every single fiber and aura emitting from them was that of a phantom.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7. I truly did find it enjoyable, the fact that we can pick out every little bit that the writer chose to make phantomly, but not only was the ending lacking, overall, every transition was bad. As a new setting was reaffirmed, we had to be given an entire episode to readjust, only for it to be torn open again (the tearing was fine, as the action is what you come to want from this series). Right up to the very end, where we once again, are forced to readjust and figure out what they\u2019re doing and what mood to faun over for the characters we follow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9. I do like this average. The author obviously put a lot of work into creating the perfect stage, and if you don\u2019t pay attention to everything, you just might miss the phantom. I just wish the transitions weren\u2019t so abrupt and the same for the ending as well. I would definitely recommend this as an animation for those fanatics who constantly like to dissect an animation, and determine the why\u2019s of the author\u2019s purpose for putting everything in.\\n",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a great, slow paced anime that really focuses on strong character development in a fascinating setting.  The story focuses on its 2 main characters, Ein and Zwei, who both have their memories erased and are trained to become deadly assassins for an underground mafia group called Inferno.  Although the premise and the first episode may make the viewer believe that this is an action packed show, its actually extremely slow paced (not in a bad way) and focuses more on the characters than the story. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe best part of the story is how dynamic it is.It is split into 3 arcs which are all completely, different from each other.  The characters, mood and settings are all drastically different in each three arcs, which is the main strength of the story.  However, the story of Phantom is not perfect.  For instance, certain points in the story can become a little far fetched. But most of these occurrence happen in the first arc (which is also the worst out of the 3 in my opinion) so once you get past that the story really shines.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10\\n\r\nThe background art in the show is very detailed and the character designs are great, not too over the top but still interesting.  When there are actions scenes, there are animated very fluidly and excitingly.  The sound is even better than the art.  The voice acting is some of the best and the music is truly amazing.  There are so many different tracks that can be heard in this anime so that it never gets repetitive.  The music also fits the mood of the story perfectly at all times.  Honestly, even though Bee-Train is known for their excellent soundtracks, they really outdid themselves with this series\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nAnd now we get to the true strength of the series: the Characters.  It is hard to describe the strengths of these characters without delving into spoilers, but seriously this show has some of the best character development I have ever seen.  Specifically Zwei and Cal have some amazing character development that all really comes together at the climax of the show.  Furthermore, this show has very interesting and well developed side characters.  The best is the interaction between all these characters is wonderfully thought out and presented perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTo me this series was a complete pleasure to watch.  It is not for everybody though.  As previously said it is very slow paced, which some people do not want to bother with. Another one of the most enjoyable aspects of this show is the themes it deals with; mainly regret and the effects of ones decisions.  It deals with these themes subtly and maturely.  And as said before, the characters are just so easy to fall in love with and become completely attached to. Be warned this show does have an extremely notorious Love it or Hate it ending, which I personally loved\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThe characters and music more than make up for the shortcomings of the logic in this anime's story.  I was really torn between giving this show a 9 or a 10 overall, but the problems it does have are not glaring flaws and the character development that comes from the problems in the story is more than worth it.",

            "content": "So I'll put it like this:\r\nSPOILER ALERT!!\r\n(Btw, lotta f-bombs in this review, I have too much passion for this show to not fully express my hate and disappoint without them, so, sorry.)\r\nIt's like watching Game of Thrones in the sense that all the good characters that you fall in love with end up dying, and it's like instead of Joffrey dying, he just wins and everyone else dies and you finish the show feeling like shit.\r\nThis show has some of my favorite characters of all time, most specifically Cal Devens my favorite female character of all time.  The characters, as many others have said,is where this show shines, it definitely has some of the best character development I've seen in my life, all the important characters have a well developed back story, and even the side characters have well-thought-out motives for the schemes they plot and actions they take, however a lot of times the characters in this show go full-retard for no reason and make some of the worst decisions that literally piss me off in real life to the point where I can't watch another episode until I cool down.  Also, there's a bunch of problems in logic and physics, plotholes, and just bad writing in general for certain parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nTime for my list of questions about the stupid things in this show that will never be addressed:\\n\r\n- How did Reiji slice through Ein's mask without cutting her face in half as well? (this complaint is a bit nit-picking, but none-the-less I wanted to address it)\\n\r\n- Why doesn't Ein just kill Reiji when she already knew he was hiding in that old broken down room that Scythe master and Ein find him in, where he waited for 3 days? (Scythe Master wasn't around at the time, so no one was there to order her not to hill him)\\n\r\n- How was Ein able to catch up to Scythe Master and block him from a bullet when she was several yards behind Reiji when he shot the bullet? (PLUS, she was wounded and barely even able to walk, does she gain fucking super speed when she's injured, that whole scene was bullshit)\\n\r\n- How was Ein able to snipe the statue in the meeting Room where the Godos were becoming members of Inferno, they clearly zoomed in from where the bullet was show, and they had to pan the camera around a building in front of where she was shooting from, can Ein both shoot and see through fucking entire buildings while sniping?\\n\r\n- Why doesn't Reiji even attempt to check if the burning apartment actually killed Cal, he just assumes she's dead without any true evidence? (I guess though, one could assume he was in shock and committed to the idea that she was dead)\\n\r\n- Why the fuck is there a completely unnecessary two year gap in the story? (This has to be one of the most forced story progression tactics I've ever seen, in fact they skip a lot of months in the show to further the story when it's not really necessary, but the 2 year one is the largest and most apparent of course.)\\n\r\n- How did Cal age so much after just two years? (I'm sorry but that amount of body development would take around 5 years, I guess you could say it was a growth-spurt, but that's just total cop-out for and unjustified amount of aging she did)\\n\r\n- Now for my biggest gripe against this show. WHY DOES REIJI FUCKING KILL CAL?! He made zero attempts to truly apologize for abandoning her as well! This really pisses me off for two reasons, Cal in my favorite female anime character of all time because of how they built her up and showed the true sadness of her life and background, and the fact that Reiji was able to save Ein on several occasions and even talk her out of killing herself or himself in multiple occasions, but when it came to Cal he went full-retard and just said 'yup, gotta kill her' he didn't even try to resolve the issues between them under any circumstance. AT THE VERY LEAST! He could've decided to not mortally wound her, by maybe shooting her hand, shooting the gun out of her hand, shooting her in her arn socket, shooting her before the music stopped in some place that would stun but not kill her, the possibilities are endless, main-point he didn't have to kill her by any means. And even if you do decide to accept that she died, had to die and there was no other way, you just end up feeling really shitty, and as the story continues it goes more downhill and you feel shittier, and then Ein and Reiji suicide/die, and then you're just left feeling like shit now that the whole show is over and everyone fucking died, FUCK! The ending of this anime where Reiji and Ein die, I can somewhat find myself accepting, but everything that led up to them having to do that was fucking BULLSHIT!\\n\r\n- Not a question, but it just really pisses me off that the villain flat out won and got away with basically everything he wanted like the asshole he is, I'm talking about Scythe Master of course, I know that they did end up killing him in the end, but he got away with everything he wanted before that, so he just indisputably won in the end.\\n\r\n- One gripe I gotta mention though, the ending scene where Reiji and Ein kill themselves is incredibly confusing upon first view, I had to actually go into wikipedia and look on that episode specifically to understand what just happened, I'm sure a lot of people who watched this anime didn't even realize that Ein suicided by eating a poisonous flower, and were just wondering \"why did she smile at Reiji collapsing?\", I know I did.",

Quotes such as \"survival of the fittest\" and \"i have to kill to live.\" The reason i did not give the story a 10 is because it left me feeling bummed out but not because the story itself was not a 10! More like i pictured it to have a different ending but amazing nonetheless.   \r\nI really have no wayof describing this masterpiece! It's way to under rated here in MAL.   \\n\\n\r\nI rarely get on here to write reviews. i only written 2 reviews so far.

            "content": "This review is going to be a little different. Instead of focusing on one main theme for my review like I usually do, I'm going to explain several. This is my second attempt at writing a review for this anime.\r\nFreedom is something that is not easy to achieve. Whether it's freedom of the heart, mind, body or soul; freedom does not come cheap. Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom really portrays well how powerful the idea of freedom is.\r\nEin has no freedom, and is a puppet to be used for peoples needs. Whether she's killing someone or having sex, none of it is for herself. Shenever does anything for herself, and truly believes that the only reason she exists is for someone else. Until she meets Zwei. Zwei goes under the same harsh training and brainwashing Ein does, but somehow manages to keep hold to some part of his humanity. Do you want to know why? Because he has freedom. Even if it is only a little, and most of it is false, he has some freedom. Because of that he can become truly strong. Ein is mesmerized in her own way at how strong Zwei is. Zwei surpasses Ein, solely because he has freedom. He still has enough freedom that he can go home if he wants. But he doesn't, because he's in love with Ein.\\n\\n\r\nLove. Most people will agree with me when I say that love is one of, if not, the most powerful emotion. What will you do for your loved one? Anything? If not, then chances are they are not truly your loved one. When you will do anything for someone, that is truly when you and that person are at serenity. That is truly when love first blooms. Because this is the case, love is a powerful emotion. Ein and Zwei are the perfect example of love. They are truly living for each other, mainly because they both have nothing else. Having their pasts wiped, they have nothing but each other, which is what makes this story so beautiful. Trying not to give any spoilers, Ein and Zwei live and die for each other, with each other, by another.\\n\\n\r\nLosing everything, only to find it, then lose it again will cause most people to go insane. Zwei is strong, but not invincible. His mind is erased, which cause him to lose everything. He finally finds one person he can put all his trust in, only to have her ripped out of his life, and by his own hand. The only way he can cope with this is to forget it. He forgets it and follows orders, just like a robot. He tries to move on, and when he finally moves on, she is thrust back into his life. Have you ever heard the saying \" You don't know what you have untill it's gone\"? Well, this saying has never been taken to such an extreme before. He's lost everything twice now, so Zwei definitely knows how to cherish something while he's got it. And cherish it he does, until the very, very end.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom is truly a beautiful story that teaches us many things about life. Dealing with love, loss, the implications of freedom, and last but not least, revenge, you're emotions will run wild. Most of the time you'll be crying, or in awe. Sometime both at the same time. Honestly, I'm surprised this anime isn't under the romance section, because honestly it deals a lot with the implications of devoting your life to someone else. What's more romantic than that? Anyways, whatever you like, Phantom:Requiem for the Phantom will leave a big impact on how you look at the world. Whether you love it or hate it, your feelings will not be left in balance.",

            "content": "Requiem for a Phantom is a show that follows two highly trained assassins and their struggle to escape the lives they were forced into. With natural killing talent Raiji, becomes the world\u2019s best and well-known assassin. Contributed by the fact that the assassin\u2019s memories were erased, the fight with morality isn\u2019t hard and killing becomes easy.\r\nAt first, when I read the synopsis and looked at the shows main photo, I thought the show would be too gruesome for my taste, but actually it wasn\u2019t so bad. The show is actually centered on a romantic story with a lot of killing and explosions to go around.Since the two assassins are hardened killers with severely repressed emotions, it is like watching a romance story being played out by two zombies.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nThe story has already been explained pretty well. It follows Raiji a new assassin in training throughout his 5 year life as a hardened murderer. Throughout, he will struggle to remember his past and get in touch with his emotions, but the longer he stays as an assassin, the harder it will be for him to become a normal person later.\\n\\n\r\nWill he succeed and will he fulfill his promises? You\u2019ll have to watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe English dub is actually really good. The voices didn\u2019t seem out of place, however, you will find long strings of dialogue that is mono-tone. When the assassins talk to each other, they truly are like zombies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when they have to act out of character to hide their true identity, if feels unsettling and out of place. The sounds for the guns are great, and the voice actors didn\u2019t seem to be reused and that is a big plus for me since other shows tend to reuse the same voice-actors for many characters. This show was not low-budget like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is great and it sits perfectly with the show. It has a very serious tone to it and sometimes I forgot I was watching an anime show. The directing is top-notch. The use of darkness to show the loss of morality and the dying flowers are great visual metaphors of what\u2019s happening throughout this well-thought-out story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are not intricate beings, but they are still human. I think this show really romanticized what it is like to be an assassin, but the extremely repressed emotions are truly realistic as you may see from soldiers returning from war even today. The characters backgrounds did not go very far, but as I figured out, the memories that these assassins need are not of their forgotten past, but rather the memories they are making together.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I didn\u2019t get to know much about Raiji or Erin\u2019s past, but I did get very attached to them throughout the show. I felt as if they were monsters, but I also had conflicted feelings that they were also humans that were in pain. You\u2019ll have to decide whether they are too immoral and unforgivable or not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThe ending is absolutely driving me nuts and I think you might see why if you watch the show. The blood and gore was not over-the-top and actually you didn\u2019t see the deaths happening half the time. With great directing, it was still very powerful stuff to not even need to see the deaths.\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this show and I hope others will too. This is something I had been avoiding to watch, but now I see it was a mistake to do so. With great directing, great voice casting, art, story and characters, this has to be one of the best directed shows to exist.\\n\\n\r\nSub Group Used: [Arigatou]\\n",

            "content": "First things first, this show is one of my most favorite shows and I have only 4 of those among 100 I have seen so far.\r\nWhy did I like it so much?\r\nWell first of all I'm huge sucker for drama, action and dark stories. Phantom: Requiem for the phantom presents all of it in one pack.\r\nHowever, despite me giving this show 10, it does have some minuses. At one point story might feel to have lost its touch but in the end it still manages to pull you back. Also towards the end some things seemed to be a bit unrealistic, but they can beeasily forgotten because of how good the show was before and keeps being.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be fair, my most favorite part was the first arc which is completly based around Zwei's training as assasin. How he went through all that hell and how he dealt with it was my favorite part including how we got more background on Ein the original Phantom who didn't appear to be so hearless after all. Both of them were changing during the whole time and I found it really enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say that Zwei's training was boring but I say that they are wrong. It actually adds to the depth of his character. It would be random to see a person who didn't want to kill at first to suddenly turn into a killing machine. I don't like when trainings are skipped in most animes. They usually make you end up in WTF mode...\\n\r\nAnd it also might explain why he is that good at what he does and why he does it at all.\\n\\n\r\nAlso another reason as to why I liked arc 1 the most is because it is the most darkest one in my opinion.\\n\r\nBut won't be deceived. The other two arcs also have a lot of character development and memorable moments as well as dark ones. \\n\\n\r\nAnother plus of this show are the characters. All of them are different and unique in their own way. Some of them will appear like huge bastards and you seriously will start to hate their guts but at one point you still might feel sorry for them despite all the bad things they have done and will make you think \"Maybe they are not such bastards after all?\" Though after you start to re-watch the series you might start to hate them again XD\\n\\n\r\nThe only exception probably would be Scythe Master... hated his guts till the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also has good animation but most of all aweasome soundtracks which are always spot on and make the dark and depressed feeling to increase.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeh this show gives you a lot of enjoymeant, you might not agree with me about mark 10 that I have given but I think that it will be hard to give this series lower than 8.\\n\\n\r\nAh and in adition to pluses that I had mentioned don't forget the action. Series might not have it too much but when you see it, it is of high quality. Also most of attacks are always well planned and are not just a random barging on someone's teritory.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I must give one warning. If you don't like tha heavy, emotional shows then it isn't for you. The show is about proffesional assasins who kill EVERYONE, and I mean that. If you can't stand the cruelty of the world and see innocent people die, better don't watch it or you simply will end up hating this show.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review.\r\nThrough the series I can\u2019t help but say that the cast actuation don\u2019t look genuine save for Cal\u2019s and Lizzie\u2019s. The puppetry topic in Phantom: Re is to blame for this. In other words, most of the cast doesn't feel human but like puppets controlled by the incarnation of either greed, lust or emptiness. However, this doesn't demerit the cast or the dialog which are in my opinion far better from average and as a whole even better; I grant you that there will be at least one character you love and one you hate, those in my case were Cal Devens andScythe Master respectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot development is great, a fast paced one that successfully explores the world of full time assassins. Plot armor is a common thing working at its fullest during the first requiem at episode 10 and also at around episode 20 to the point that I simply couldn't understand what the hell was going to happen. This show made me FEEL that the world is a cruel and rotten world but also that human feelings can make this world extremely beautiful and enjoyable. Yet sometimes it didn't let me feel a thing. There are plenty of twists in the story, some of them being so drastic that I had a real hard time accepting them. The ending properly wraps and closes the story as it should but you should not expect it to be anything special or beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are above average, this means you can see those departments put love in the project. The same goes for the music. Yet I would not go as far as saying it is perfect. In that regard, I would mainly complain about the second opening and ending which doesn't match at all the bitter-sweetness and tragedy carved in Phantom: Re.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: Phantom: Re is a work of dark fantasy, tragic, bittersweet, mature, twisted and worth seeing. \\n",

            "content": "I agree with some others that Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is quite overrated.\r\nFirst of all, I had the feeling that this anime was a little pretentious in that it seemed that everything was over-exaggerated.  In less eloquent words, the central theme of this anime is \"yeeaaahhh, we're assassins isn't that so cool?  Look at all these stoic killers and gangster UHHH SO COOOL\"....\r\nThis very much restricted me bonding with the characters, and there came a point where I didn't even care what happened to most of them, despite the fact that I was SUPPOSED to.\r\nThe story both annoyed and entertained me.In summation, it was a good plot that was not executed very well.  The story doesn't really go into the specifics behind the motivation of characters, and I guarantee that most people watching this anime had a lot of questions.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that bugged me a lot was the fact that a lot of elements in this anime did not follow basic common sense, but I won't go into specifics.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the plot and characters are excellent, but I don't think that everything came together just right.  It's like having the  best ingredients for a world-class meal and then burning it in the oven.\\n\r\nI thought this anime was very good, but I feel like I could have LOVED it if they would have just cleaned it up a bit to where it doesn't seem like they're trying so hard and where I actually bond with the characters a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this said, I still urge you to watch it, because it is very entertaining and I did enjoy it.",

            "content": "Do you know about those shows? You know what I mean, the ones where two sides of a conflict are facing each other, guns pointing at each other, yet one of the sides still has the time to deliver a long as fuck speech without getting shot? Well, Phantom is one of those shows.\r\nFor you see, Phantom is a thriller show, but it isn\u2019t a thriller for reasons that you might expect. Instead of fast paced and juicy action, Phantom actually delivers its thriller qualities through suspense, dramatic dialogue, and assumed events. See, there are fast paced and violent thrillers out there, such as Anotherand the beginning of Attack on Titan, who draw you in with their highly detailed and disturbing death scenes. Phantom has no disturbing scenes, or at least, it doesn\u2019t show any of it. Yes, Phantom can get quite brutal, but it leaves it all up to your imagination. Whenever an important character gets shot, he/she doesn\u2019t go out in a blaze of glory. Instead, the music stops or intensifies, the pace becomes turtle slow, the screen fades to black or white, and then you hear a shot in the background. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and then you get that cliche moment where a character just stands still for a few seconds with a look of confusion, and then falls down in slow motion, with the sound effects echoing in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThat is how Phantom delivers its thriller quality. And what would you expect? It\u2019s based off of a visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Phantom is by no means a bad show as a result, in fact, I think it\u2019s an amazing one! For one thing, its style of delivering drama and thriller really highlights the importance of a major character. Phantom also excels at making the villain extremely detestable. I swear to god, I haven\u2019t been this triggered by an anime villain for a long ass time. And finally, Phantom is a master of setting the mood for its scenes, whether it be through its god tier OST or through its drama delivery style. While it might have been gripping in ways that I didn\u2019t expect, it was still gripping nonetheless, and it still hit you right in the kokoro.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Very emotional and beautifully executed scenes.\\n\r\n- Great characters who demand a lot of respect.\\n\r\n- God tier OST!\\n\r\n- Actually explores human morals fairly deeply, probably deserves a Psychological tag.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Lazy lazy lazy animation.\\n\r\n- Fair amount of plot holes and cliche moments.\\n\r\n- Why is there moaning in the OST?\\n\r\n- Way too many flashbacks, leads to slow pacing.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPhantom sports a story completely packed full of drama, tragedy, and heartbreak. Really though, Phantom is overwhelmingly sad, with only a select few happy moments that you know won\u2019t last. As a result, Phantom will tug at heart strings, without a doubt. It\u2019s a very emotional story that despite being not very thought out, it still leaves a powerful impact. It touches a lot on human morals, and I mean A LOT. It\u2019s very heavy on the idea of life.\\n\\n\r\nIs everything that you do in order to survive considered righteous? Why does one live in the first place? Why does one fight to survive? Is it ok to kill in order to live?\\n\\n\r\nThe story also focuses a lot on betrayal, mistrust, and manipulation. It\u2019s one of those stories were the characters are manipulated by another character, who is in turn manipulated by another character, who is also manipulated by some other character, etc etc etc. You really can\u2019t tell who the good guys or bad guys are, for everyone is just doing what they think is most efficient in order to survive. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, a promising story like Phantom\u2019s is still prone to plotholes, and Phantom is riddled with those as much as the characters are riddled with bullet holes. As stated before, the characters in this show act very unrealistically at times, such as talking casually with guns at each other\u2019s faces. Characters make stupid decisions that, when you think about it, are incredibly easy to avoid. In the end, Phantom is a powerful and emotionally story that just begs you to point and yell \u201cTHAT SHOULDN\u2019T HAPPEN!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNow, for the worst part of this series. Phantom\u2019s art and animation were all around disappointments. First, I\u2019ll just get the good parts out of the way.\\n\r\nI like the character designs, they look either badass, beautiful, adorable, ugly, whatever whatever, you know. Also, the guns and some of the background scenes were incredibly well detailed and animated. Some.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now on to the rest. The action scenes in this series were very mediocre. While there were some very entertaining scenes, such as well choreographed hand to hand combat scenes, this show is mainly about guns, and I gotta admit, these shootout scenes were pretty lackluster.\\n\r\nFirst of all, during the actual action scenes, there is almost no gore. When a character gets shot, they just randomly fall to the ground. No bullet holes, no impact, no blood, nothing. They just die.\\n\r\nSecond, when a non important side character is firing a gun, it\u2019s basically just a still image with light particle effects. \\n\r\nAnd lastly, as stated before, there are those incredibly cliche moments where when a character gets shot, they just stand there, motionless, for a few seconds, as if time had stopped. Sometimes the character looks completely fine, there are no bullet holes, and their facial expressions have just a little panic. And then, all of sudden, que the grunt noise, and *thud*, they fall to the ground. What?\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the animation didn\u2019t quite live up to expectations. I cry everytime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nArguably the best aspect of this series is the music. The music is either incredibly beautiful and emotional, or very thrilling and hype generating. In fact, the action scenes were absolutely carried by the soundtrack. Without the soundtrack, the action scenes would be a complete chore to sit through. Also, shoutout to the first OP. That song is just pure awesomeness!\\n\r\nThe sound effects were also very good! Things such as gunshots, silenced shots, glass breaking, and even car noises were very accurate and well executed. The seiyuus also did a great job in conveying the characteristics of their characters and the mood of the situation. Yes, even though Ein is an emotionless character. Ein is an actress herself, after all!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThese were some tragic characters. The characters of Phantom go through a lot of great development, but were somewhat lacking in the backstory department. Yes, they had backstories, but none were really special. Both Ein and Zwei were great lead characters, who really just kept up with their dangerous lifestyle in order to survive. Down the road, they develop into more emotional beings with more human morals. Most can agree that they were very respectable characters, so really, the make or break character would be good ol Cal.\\n\r\nI was one of the ones who really liked Cal. Not only is she absolutely moe, but she was also a very tragic character as well. She represents the ones who throw away their morals on purpose in order to see justice done, in comparison to Ein and Zwei who were brainwashed into becoming assassins. As a result, Cal was shown to be the most determined character in the show, as she was willing to throw away everything in order to get what she wanted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSure, the lackluster action left much to be desired, but overall, the gripping tale and absolutely heartbreaking tragedies in Phantom more than made up for it. Although, that ending needs to like, not happen\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, Phantom is a decent show, but it is definitely one that may go against the expectations of those who watch. Its drama outweighs its action, so for those who haven\u2019t watched it yet, keep that in mind!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Musaigen no Phantom World would have been completely different if this show came into play...\\n",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying that this anime, in my opinion is a kin to a hidden gem. The main reason I say its akin to a hidden gem is because I'm honestly not sure how well know this anime is, however before I happened across this anime at the local  anime store I had never heard of it.\r\nThe story, at least for me gets better as you go on. As the anime began I found it good, but nothing spectacular. Then as I got about half-way through I thought it was easily a favorite of mine but definitely not top ten material. AsI got the end, or more specifically, the very last part, my opinion shot through the roof, blowing my expectations away with such a surprise that I couldn't but admire it. Without spoiling anything, I do have to say that this anime has one of the best twist endings I have seen, partly because I was so confident in my ability to predict how it would end, and how wrong I turned out to be.\\n\r\nThe music is nothing that impressive until you get the main character's theme song. It starts playing about half-way through the series and this is when the series kicks it up to the next gear, the song is so powerful in how its delivered, its not the song its self but how well the song ties in with the main character's thoughts and feelings at the time that makes it feel so powerful.\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves while overall they aren't  too impressive, I do have two favorite that I feel stand out from the crowd. Lizzie Garland, and Hardheaded Tony.\\n\r\nThe way this story keeps you guessing is a huge advantage of its, you usually have some idea of whats going to happen but the delivery of which is always surprising. \\n\r\nThis was actually the second anime I showed to my Father, who is not someone who particularly likes anime, but even he said that it was thoroughly enjoyable when it was all over.\\n\r\nEither way I think this is a great anime full of great action, suspense, and interesting plot twists that will keep you watching right up to the end. Its worth a watch most any day in my book.",

            "content": "Phantom of Inferno, or the title that the anime chooses to adopt\u30fcPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom is based off of an eroge visual novel by Nitro+. All pretenses dropped here, I am biased toward the anime production of Phantom of Inferno, because I played the DVD-ROM American censored version of the visual novel when I was a teenager and then later watched the anime. So, my opinions about my like of this series is primarily based on that. \r\n\t\u2022 Gen Urobuchi pretty much makes it so that you have to have Ein as your best girl in the original visual novel. You spend hours andhours and hours with her before you meet any of the other characters, and you are forced to either have somewhat of a romantic route with Ein or GAME OVER with Claudia. And by GAME OVER, I mean you sleep with Claudia and then it\u2019s literally GAME OVER.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Many people that I know who only watched the anime like Cal/Drei more. Whereas, those who have played the visual novel first always have Ein as their best girl. I was horrified that Bee Train was producing the Phantom of Inferno anime when it first came out. I was baffled that a company that I despise because all of their awful series like .hack//Roots, Noir, Madlax, the list goes on\u2026 many of them all look like the same show, with similar effects and directing!\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Tell me how many times you can count: hands reaching for each other, opening eyes, silhouettes, and a kaleidoscope of cascading colors and silhouettes bleeding into each other in a Bee Train opening and you\u2019ll know what I am getting at. Sadly, I feel this way about them, although I really liked .hack//SIGN a lot as a child and obsessively watched it on Adult Swim\u2026 some tricks just get old. It seems that Bee Train does better when they\u2019re doing an adaptation, rather than an original story though. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I thought that the adaptation was done well. It was very faithful to the source material. It seems that the voice actors, OST, and script writing were even the same. That being said, on it\u2019s own merit as a story, Urobuchi should be known as the Uro-borrower rather than Uro-butcher, because in every single thing that I\u2019ve watched of his, he borrows immensely from other things, to the point to where it\u2019s noticeable.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I even consider Gen Urobuchi to be more of a main stream broadcasting agent, rather than an otaku panderer. Any person who\u2019s been a fan of anime all of their life, like me, will notice the similarities with me. For example, I played Saya no Uta a few years back and was mortified that Urobuchi almost scene-for-scene copy and pasted the same story from Osamu Tezuka\u2019s Phoenix Volume 5, except it\u2019s flesh monsters rather than aliens. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Madoka Magica is pretty much Bokurano mixed with whatever other tropes were popular at the time, and Psycho Pass is obviously thriving from Ghost in the Shell\u2019s fame. He\u2019s a brilliant marketer. That being said, Phantom of Inferno takes a lot from other things as well.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Much of it is like if Neon Genesis Evangelion met a Hollywood gangster flick. Ein, I\u2019m saying this even though she pretty much laid eggs in my heart when I was young and impressionable, is pretty much an exported Rei Ayanami. Let\u2019s not even joke here, her role in the story is nearly identical and her hairstyle isn\u2019t even that different.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Many complain about the exposition in the story, but you have to keep in mind that this an adaptation of a visual novel. Visual novels often time have nothing, but chuuni explanations of powers and the story, the bread and butter being the illustrious bishoujo and romantic aspects. I\u2019m not defending this style of writing by any means, but that IS what the anime adaptation was trying to get across. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The harem aspect of the show, seeing as pretty much any female in this series wants to bang Zwei, isn\u2019t that unprecedented \u2026 seeing as he\u2019s the best assassin in the country, being brainwashed and trained in seclusion, and his role in the routes of the viable female options are: saving, kills alongside, adopts as a child (gross), and bolsters the career of certain female leaders of Phantom. So, it seems more understandable than a typical high school protag who\u2019s average in everything and has nothing particularly great about him.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The anime does a very good at portraying the sense of loss and emptiness Zwei feels upon Ein\u2019s absence, and that seems like it would be difficult to do, seeing as hours of written material convey this loss in the game. I think the anime stands well on its own, without solely being promotional material for the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The ending is rushed admittedly, but it\u2019s an open-end to new viewers, leaving enough to have a interpretation, while fans of the game will get it and applaud the symbolism. Overall, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is worth a mention. Though, I would suggest playing the visual novel first to anyone who will listen. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There was a re-release of the game with improved visuals, which may help, seeing as the gameplay and the visual would be tedious for any modern gamer. I give Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom a 6/10. The older OVA for Phantom is not even worth mentioning, unless you are a crazy completionist like me.",

            "content": "***This review was made without reading the original story from the visual novel***\r\nIt is quite an admirable show story-wise.\r\nEmotions were brilliantly invoked at the right time, this single aspect alone made 60% of the show's impact. It wasn't rushed or exaggerated. \r\nThe first half of the show was definitely awesome. The story was good but it was the progress and script that really shines. They handled the atmosphere of the show brilliantly while subtly adding minor themes that would later make sense when the story nears its climaxes. \r\nAfter experiencing the thrill and excitement of the story's first two parts you can palpably notice adecline in the quality of the story, a disappointment. You know the final part could have been better, a lot better. You might get the feeling that it was somewhat rushed. Although some of you might beg to differ,  those who were planning to add this anime to their all-time favorite probably noticed it. It showed its true color, being  a visual novel, with multiple routes, endings and heroines. In the end of the day, there was this single big loose rope, looking for someone to tighten it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was ok, yet again disappointing. I've always have thought this kind of story would end tragically but I wasn't expecting to be that vague and unsatisfactory.  (8)\\n\\n\r\nNothing special in art and animation. It was mediocre but tidy and consistent. (8)\\n\\n\r\nBackground music and effects has always been the invoker of emotions. One might not notice it but even the subtle sound of insects or even the mere silence can bring out the deepest emotions, given that they are played in the right time. In that aspect you can say that the show made the best out of their music department. (9)\\n\\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see a cast of non-stereotypes, well might not be completely. All characters are likeable. Each one of them are involved in other one's life. You can really see good connections on each on them and to the main character. They were also developed beautifully. Drei's development was quite noticeable. Not only her physical but also mentally. I would like to further discuss but I would rather avoid  spoilers.(9)\\n\\n\r\nThe show should've been a lot more enjoyable if they have only they have put more effort on the final act and focused on building a solid relationship to one of the heroine. But it was still a great show to watch because of its good direction and plot.(8)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was worthwhile to watch. It is definitely a must-watch for those who loves action, underground organizations  and those who want a non-cliched show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~ was truly a masterpiece in my eye.  It was one of the few anime that I've seen, that I felt such emotion to a few characters, as well as felt moved.  Violence, drama, romance, and even a few comical quirks were all wrapped into one large stage play.  \r\nThe story, was by far, the most interesting stories I have seen a long time.  There's been a lot of assassin ideas thrown around, but more or less so, anytime you seen an assassin they seem to be invincible and heartless.  Zwei, the main character of thestory, is far from invincible, and a very emotional character.  His memory gets wiped while on a trip to the United States, and was soon captured after witnessing a crime by the infamous \"Inferno\" Phantom.  The plot itself later reveals twists, turns, and at times, teeth clenching.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very well done, sure it isn't perfect, but I liked the way that every gun shot didn't spread blood everywhere like most anime, and the characters themselves I felt were drawn well to the way their personality represented.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices were amazing, when in the heat of the moment, Zwei yells into the sky, and makes you truly feel how he feels.  The gun sounds were a bit common, as well as the sounds of the cars.  The music by far was one of my favorites, representing a bit of opera to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very well done.  Zwei, living in bliss at first, and later realizes what is going on, truly gives him an edge on other assassins.  He expresses emotion, something all the other's never had.  Phantom, for instance, expresses zero emotion considering how she was raised.  The \"Inferno\" also had a few interesting characters, and a few unsuspecting plot twists involved with them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a great anime, from start to finish, without letting it down for a  moment.",

            "content": "This series started off really good until the LAST SIX EPISODES. Kinda sucks because it was well written at the beginning too main character gets kidnapped by a nefarious organization and force himself to learn how to kill to survive. As a result he changes from a normal boy to one of the top assassins in all of inferno. the main female lead Ein is raised from a young age to be an assassin and the former best assassin but as a result she barely/has no emotions whats so ever. the other characters are forgettable like one of the characters reminds me of that onegirl from the movie the professional, the main antagonist is forgettable to the point of begging to be in a Shakespeare play more than in this series. About the story structure it started off like a masterpiece then after SIX MERE EPISODES THE STORY FALLS INTO A CRAPFEST! The music or ost is forgettable and the enjoyment level is a 6 like the story if I can give the beginning an 8 and the ending 5 and the enjoyment level in the beginning a 9 and at the end a 6. So that's my review of this promising work that fell to disappointment at the last running streak.",

            "content": "This is one of the only anime I have watched that allowed the viewer to totally immerse themselves in the story. Even classics such as death note, FMA:Brotherhood, Cowboy Bebop, NGE, or even Trigun allowed me to become so immersed in a story. \r\nThe three main arcs of the story allow a wide range of characters, sides, and emotions to be shown. \r\nThe first ten episodes of the show are probably the most well constructed and interesting episodes ever constructed for an anime. This is probably the only anime couple in a sense that feels organic and not forced. The character development, motivation, and pacingis on point.\\n\\n\r\nThe 11-15 episodes allows groundwork to be built for the rest of the series. Although it allows a great stage to be set, there are some parts of the story that feel lacking in comparison to the first 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 16-20 reinforce the character development, tie up a lot of lose ends, and bring the story full circle. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc allows the true ramifications of the previous actions to be set in effect, and allow a truly perfect yet bittersweet ending. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of clever references to romeo and juliet in this work. I have not scene the play phantom in the opera, but it seems that it could draw from this work also. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the series seems very short. Some events could have been more flushed out. Despite this, the series is one that really invests the audience and plays its cards at the right time. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a must watch for viewers of black lagoon, darker than black, or similar titles. It does not have a lot of fanservice, but it feels appropriate when it occurs. This grace uplifts the show. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the weaker points are some inconsistent pacing, and a rather weak or cliche villain. The head of the organization also does not receive his proper development, but this is because he appears more as a figure than as a real person. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Some people may look at a reviewers score, or the overall score of a show and draw certain conclusions.  I certainly do.  However, even though I rated this a 5 and the average ratings on MAL is around 8.5, the distinction I draw is firmly in the details.\r\nLet me start by saying I did enjoy this, most of the characters were deep and interesting, and the storytelling was so good that I felt like I bonded and cared about them.  The musical score was probably the best part though, they really hit it out of the park with the soundtrack.\r\nThere are plentyof positive reviews on MAL highlighting everything the series did well, but there are some things this show missed on, and they didn't miss by an inch but a mile.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is the story, not to be confused with the storytelling, it was disjointed, the basic premise didn't really make sense.  But that is clearly forgivable, otherwise almost no japanese anime could be watched.  The inconsistencies were not only legion but constant.  Holding captive 2 of their best killers by only erasing their pasts?  The fear of death you say?  You should be able to see how and why that doesn't sit well given the context.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other major aspect, skipping the bundle of minor irritations, was clearly the hamfisted execution on key parts.  The notorious episode 10 just didn't make any sense.  I almost dropped it.  The relationship between Ein and Master was portrayed as Puppet and Puppetmaster, and yet that rang oh so hollow given the bizarre actions of those characters.  further, their relationship was never expounded, it was left up to the viewers imaginiation.  By doing so, my imagination took it at face value and it read shallow and contrived; even convenient.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads me to the final point on the story which is that most of it felt contrived as to be convenient to push the plot along its predestined track.  With the plot jumping around so much and characters like Cal introduced seemingly to add a surfaced dramatic feel, i couldn't help but think that the trajectory was flying so wild, damned be the details.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, while it did do a good job of putting us into the seats of the underbelly crime world, it felt like the goal was merely a dramatization.  Everything centered around a certain feeling, and it went to that well so many times, by the end i considered it bone dry.  Drama for the sake of drama is good if you like drama, but not good if you don't like being flung all over the place to achieve that end.  I would have preferred consistency.",

If I was put in the same situation as Reeiji Azuma (MC), losing my memory, being forced to kill or be killed, what would have I done? \r\n(Thank God, I haven't killed any person, but this anime seriously made me thinking... )\r\nSitting at my comfort, I am thinking - May be I should have struggled and tried to escape rather than killing people for no reason, even if I lost my life in the process. I know it's easy to say. I pray to God to spare me of such a misery of life. Life is beautiful,life is painful, all depends on fate.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been a long time since any story made me thinking this seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the anime and seeing the very last painful scene, I ask myself, \"Does a person who killed so many people, no matter what reason it was for, deserve to live? Even though he didn't wish to kill anyone?\"\\n\\n\r\n.. I came to the same conclusion as the anime... NO.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe art wasn't fair. There wasn't enough blood... (LOL). I'm serious, you kill a person and there isn't blood, it's not good art. It's good to avoid unnecessary gore. But too much of avoiding blood and corpse, it sure kills the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe main characters received sufficient development. They were realistic. Easy to understand. Easy to relate and feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain (Scythe Master) is an evil scientist, an agent of chaos... This is a downer. The villain should have had more realistic reasons...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe story is heart touching. It's painful. It makes me want to enjoy the life to the fullest. The first few episodes may seem mediocre, may be even boring. But very soon, I got hooked up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a gem in my anime collection. It had a different taste to it. It's realistic, sad, painful. A great tragedy anime.\\n\\n",

The three assassins have motivations that are total nonsense, which ends up poisoning what is otherwise a good story.

The first half was a lot of fun, but everything that happens after they hit Japan is pretty terrible. It's a shame too, because I really do think this could've been one of my favorite anime shows, but then it just wentbad part way through.",

The beginning of the anime was brilliant. It was difficult to stop watching, the end of every episode had me clicking on the next and i couldn't stop. I loved the first 11 episodes so much that i would rate them a 10/10. Up to that point Requiem for the Phantom had me emotionally invested. i hadn't felt so emotionally connected since i watched Code Geas afew years ago.\\n\\n\r\n  After episode 11 there was some character development that in my opinion took away some of my interest. However the anime did recover shortly after and it again had me binge watching. Just when my love for this anime had hit the top, some events ruined the character relationships. Then to make matters worse there was a time skip that left me with unanswered questions. \\n\r\n                The show started to fall after this time skip, i still enjoyed watching it but it wasn't 10/10 anymore. The final third of the anime had plot holes plus there were things that were illogical. The ending also was below my expectations. The first 2 thirds of the anime was a 9/10 to me but the final third was 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a good anime but it had the potential to be amazing but they squandered their potential. If you have time you should definitely watch it but you should keep in mind that the last few episodes are mediocre.",

Like Its weird that I would but Phantom Requiem fulfilled my desires that a regular wife (One piece) couldn't. The story was excellent and had great build up I think I had to have watched this in 2 or 3 days and re-watched right after but you know the mistress is a mistress for a reason so its not perfect towards the end I felt like it was rushed and it really crushed my heart because so much more could've been embedded into it just tomake the anime a better master piece than it already was. Everything else to me was superb and couldn't be matched by most anime thats engineered today. Im really biased on a lot of stuff though especially Seinen because thats my favorite but if you love dark anime with a good mafia feel to it you got to watch this.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                           Sincerely,\\n\r\n                                                                           KichtheKid",

            "content": "I could start this review off with some philosphical statement. You know, one of the many you saw in this show, but instead I'll take this time to welcome myself to reviewing anime. This will be my first review, and if you have any coments on it, please hit my profile up and I'll be glad to help you with anything.\r\nNow, I don't judge anime on any pretext other than my own enjoyment and own opinions. So please bare with me :).\r\nNow, the story although not episodic has an episodic feel. Almost as if the stories broken up a bit, but that's all character developementand emotion. I believe, the beging of this anime is as important as the end. There's quite a few plot twists; all of witch you don't expect. There are a few episodes that again although aren't fillers  feel as if they have no meaning aside from portraying certain emotions or to help develope characters. Overall the story is absolutely amazing, no questions asked. I'd personally give it a 9/10(It'd be 10/10 if it had an ending that gave off a difinitive ending).\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was quite dark. You didn't get to see much of the \"Happy go lucky\" parades.(Although, there was that one episode ;-) ). I found everything well drawn, it wasn't an over used animation style(Moe?) but it didn't bring anything new to the table. I'd give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime, is very subjective. Now, it doesen't have anything you'll remember the rest of your life, nothing just jaw dropping but every song every sound from voices to footsteps all fit into the show perfectly. I'd give it a subtle 10/10 for doing everything sound is meant to do.\\n\\n\r\nHow likable a character is, will always be debatable. It will always be an opinion however something you can't argue, is the developement. We saw multiple characters develope and change in this story, and it really was something amazing to watch. Mix that and the fact you won't forget about these characters, and they earn a very solid 10/10 in my books.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, this is what I like to look at and say \"Oh cool someone gets to just BS their way through a review section\". Now, don't get me wrong, this was my favourite anime of all time. But I can't tell you if you will enjoy it. There's plot twists, amazing characters great sound, and an over-the-top-in-a-good-way-story. It's a 10/10 for me, but fill this in with your own rating afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is something you will never forget. The converversy in the ending, the amazing fight scenes throughout(Not really \"Fighting\") mixed with drama and amazing..Everything leads to one of my favourite animes of all time. It's an overall 10 from me.",

Its hard to remember when last i found such a well scripted story line... that is... until the 2nd season where i was a little disappointed in the new direction the director seemed to be taking with our main characters. This was also evident with the new opening song which made the series feel less like a deep psychological masterpiece and more like a childrens show. \r\nThankfully they didnt disappoint with the ending which was just amazing, even though heartbreaking.\r\nTo sum thisup, the plot was top notch, the dialogue excellent and the soundtrack mesmerizing. I would of happily given this 10/10 if it were not for the disappointment of most of the 2nd season. But even still this will be remembered not just as one of the best anime ive ever watched but one of the best shows ive ever come across... period.",

All the other characters that were involved in the story played great parts too. They all had their own background and way of dealing with situations.\r\nThe story was awesome. Having a secret organisation with assassins by the name of phantoms is definately owned by someone with an imagination.\r\nOk so I found the ending a bit sad & and I don't know how or why they left it as they did but an amazing ending for an fantastic anime.",

Throughout the series there were a couple times when I thought that the series lulled but then there were many times as well where I felt an actual emotional attachment to the characters.\r\nOne issue I did have was that the logic of the characters became really unbelievable towards the end. Even with the fact that these characters are severely psychologically damaged, sometimes the characters motivation doesn't make sense at all and is completely unbelievable.\r\nLike I said though, overall the series was good. The action was intense, the story was exciting with a coupleadded twists, and the characters did get me emotionally attached.

What lengths would you go to, to be a free person? Two exceptional questions to ask yourself when watching this. These are decisions the protagonist must make throughout the whole series. \r\nIn this series, what attracts me is the heartbreak the leading male recieves, and how he can still push through. Despite being heartless andhaving no feelings, he still finds a way for them to show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a 10 out of 10 for me. It drew me and it is to this day the only anime I have sat through in one night to watch. Being pulled in episode after episode is a real feat and this anime does it well. \\n\\n\r\nThe art I gave an 8 out of 10. The art didn't bother me, but it wasn't what I was paying attention to throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a 9 out of 10 for me. It really brings up the intensitive level of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a 10 out of 10. Ein and Zwei are just loveable, even if they are heartless. While both can frustrate you, you can feel the despair they go through as they want to be taken away from their \"slavery\" and become their own person. You can also feel the nefariousness of Drei when she comes back, but she is also a person who just wants to be accepted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 9 out of 10. It kept me up till 5 am, if that isn't enjoyment and anticipation I don't know what is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9 out of 10. No series if perfect and I refuse unless the circumstance is extremely rare to give a 10, however if a series was to be given a 10 by me, this would be it. This is the epitome of a brilliant anime in my eyes.",

            "content": "There was something to know about this particular show is based on a visual novel game, which was created by NitroPlus (the company Urobuchi worked for) and before this series, there was an OVA of this, which I admit I didn\u2019t watch and I don\u2019t think you need to watch to get into the story of this adaptation since it was made by a different studio and there was no continuation between the OVA and the anime. There is something about the assassin genre in all media that captures my eye, especially in anime since I like shows like Noir but here\u2019s hoping it cansurprise me.\\n\\n\r\nA young man with no memories fights to salvage his humanity when he\u2019s forced into a life of murder by a dangerous crime syndicate called Inferno. The organization gives him a new name, Zwei, and molds him into a perfect killing machine, a meticulous instrument of death created to obey his masters\u2019 every deadly command. Zwei\u2019s not the only puppet controlled by Inferno; Ein is a girl as beautiful as she is brutal, as lethal as she is lost. While mafia violence escalates around them, the two assassins grow closer, and Zwei begins the struggle to reclaim his past and save Ein from a blood-soaked future.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is divided into three arcs, I really expected this show to be more of the smart and challenging assassin series that most people make it out to be, considering the word-of-mouth it got and for a short time, it was. But that\u2019s the problem. It was only like that during the first arc (Episode 1-10 and Ep.11 being a recap) of the series. The second arc (Episodes 12-19) did start out ok but in the middle is where it starts to not make sense with most characters either dead and then suddenly coming back to life and also an addition of one annoying character that I will get to and the third arc (Episodes 20-26) is the most heinous of all for the arcs for being highly inconsistent with story, characters (especially their design), setting (in high school\u2026.IN A FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL! I didn\u2019t apparently know they were vital for an assassin show) and the execution of that. The show is can often be pretentious as when it tries to show us how hard it is to be an assassin when it\u2019s quite obvious that the audience already knows that. It\u2019s not telling us anything new by that.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, the main ones to look out for is Zwei and Ein\u2026..well, those are the names they go by in the show, at least until the end of the first/start of the second art where he know their real names. They are lost, confused people wondering how in the hell they got into this situation. They often sound depressed but then again, you\u2019re hired as an assassin meaning a job of basically killing a lot of people, even if they aren\u2019t the \u201cbad guys\u201d. Claudia McCunnen is actually quite a character in the show, especially in her past about her dead brother Romero and her partner Lizzie is also one of the better side characters as the various bosses, dealers, gangs and other various gangs don\u2019t really draw that much attention from me. Some of them just seem too bland for me to notice and then there\u2019s Cal Devens\u2026..and this is one of the most irritating characters on the show. She may not be when she\u2019s introduced but further down when she becomes a Phantom and the later 2 years changed her as well and speaking of that\u2026\u2026..\\n\\n\r\nAnimation for the show is provided by BEE TRAIN\u2026..you know, they made those type of shows I like (and you probably hate)\u2026\u2026oh, and .hack, too. They are consistent with the animation considering this type of show is their bread and butter, minus a few elements of that but the inconsistency from them comes from the character designs and by that, I mean Cal in the third arc as in she went from a little girl into a full grown-ass woman in the span of 2 years (that\u2019s in show, BTW). It may be the fact of steroids or similar like that but it was never explained well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music, I actually like the first opening theme, \u201cKARMA\u201d by Kokia as I thought the ominous dark tone of the song fits the show as well, although it may sound like a lullaby (a deadly lullaby), it\u2019s still a favorite anime theme song of mine. The ending theme song done by Ali Project was a little more fast paced than the opening but not actually a song that would listen to by itself and the same can be said for the 2nd opening and ending when the third arc comes around and like the third arc itself, it is pretty useless.\\n\\n\r\nFor the FUNimation dub, I had some problems with it\u2026.such as the voice actor of Zwei is not that good. He is pretty much in Keanu Reeves mode in here and even though Ein\u2019s voice actress is similar to that, at least when she\u2019s acting like a normal person, she tries and does it well. Colleen Clinkenbeard\u2019s performance as Claudia was decent and Shay Moore as Lizzie was plenty great (and good thing FUNi actually hired a black actress to play that role. Points earned).\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This is a beautiful disappointment but more on the latter word as while some elements of the show are kind of interesting, it\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t seen before and Bee Train has done so many other good shows than this (well, save for Madlax and .hack//sign) and I feel like they could\u2019ve tried harder or got it better but alas, it was only a distance figment of my imagination. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this but I wouldn\u2019t say to avoid it like the plague.",

            "content": "The story is KIND OF divided into 3 main arcs. In terms of story and plot, this show was excellent. The animation was good, had nice coloring, effects, fight scenes. They did an especially good job with the driving scenes; there were a few fights that seemed uninteresting and slow, and there was one episode where the CG looked sooooo real, that it was difficult to think it was an anime for the first minute or so....that may not have been a bad thing, but somehow the contrast threw me off. The background music, and the OP and ED were both great....EXCEPT FOR THE LASTARC...the OP sound was nice and so was the ED but the vidoes for it were horrible, and there were a few NEW background music they got that just spoiled the scene....like for example there was one that had a little music and ended with a woman moaning in an orgasm. The characters were all interesting and innovative, they each had a personality that was entertaining to see unfold; and the show showed the darkness in the characters. I mean, this is one series where the main character can be as bad as you can get for an \"anti-hero\" if you could even call him that. The main character was the MOST BADASS DUDE YOU WOULD EVER GET. I MEAN DAMN, throughout the entire series I KEPT LOVING THIS GUY....even his days of hesitation was extremely short to notice the amount of BADNESS he put in the show. He wasnt a hero, the guy was selfish, and manipulative....i.e. he was the worst kind of bastard you could get YET he knew his wrong and even depressed about it at times. There were also quite a few people he TRUELY cared for.....only to get bitten by those same people anyhow. All the other characters...there were phases where you liked them...then hated them....then liked them...or something so; that like-hate-like would relate to EIN, but were somewhat similar for the others too. \\n\r\nSo far I have shown that the show should get close to a 10 and not a 7 as I have actually rated it. THE reason the show got a 7 was......3 ARC!!! That arc was horrible....first of, they took the MOST LOVABLE CHARACTER EVER and made them crazy enough to hate...second, HIGH SCHOOL AND ROMANCE???????!....I get the characters were high school age....and hey, I love high school animes....BUT ONLY IF THE HIGH SCHOOL SETTING FIT! Clearly it didn't here....and the burst of romance in it and attempt at comedy was ANNOYING. I have to say though, the very last minute of the series was COMPLETELY EPIC IN MY OPINION....but to many others it would be HORRIBLE....in fact for me the show got a 7 when it COULD have gotten a 6 DUE TO THE 3rd ARC JUST BECAUSE I PERSONALLY LIKED THE ENDING...it felt like the right way to end it.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, Phantom is a good show, much better than the original OVAs, it was entertaining, and if not for the 3rd arc would have been a DEFINITE COLLECTION MATERIAL, but due to the 3rd arc it was a good show that should be watched.",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom(made by the creators of Darker than Black) is based on the popular visual novel \"Phantom Inferno\". In fact, there are two adaptations of this game. First one is called Phantom the Animation and it's basically an OVA, which shows only 20-30% of the full story.  Second adaptation, Requiem for the Phantom, is better in every aspect. 26 episodes is enough to tell the story, which is divided in three arcs. And the story is great, it's  a magnificient criminal drama with action elements. Music is gorgeous and art style with character design is very good. \r\nAbout what isbad in this series... well, SPOILER!!!, creators of this anime have strange vision of how much people grow in two years. Also, for some people, this anime could be a bit boring. Because, as I said before, this more a criminal drama, than action.\\n\\n\r\nBut trust me, if you're looking for a spectacular criminal drama, similar to the legendary Leon with Jean Reno, or you like such series as Noir, Darker than Black, Madlax, than Requiem for the Phantom is the right choice for you.",

            "content": "If I had to rate it I would give it a 7/10 and that is being generous. The best thing about this anime is honestly its action plot. The romance is horrendous, the drama is okay but by the end you're so numb to it that even the ending leaves you like 'of course, why wouldn't it end that way'. Honestly there are only 2 parts in it that really made me super sad, Clau and Cal both of them and that is mostly because they left so much unanswered and super rushed. Like Clau had SO much shit left to explore in her characterand it was incredibly odd how it ended, we still have no idea what she actually wanted nor whether she actually intended to betray those people. Cal basically was just batshit crazy and all of a sudden she has a revelation where she isn't crazy anymore?\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is actually really good in my opinion, it was a very satisfying watch and they didn't rush. But if I had to I would split the series into 3 different parts, 'Training', 'Working', and 'Running'. Training is really good and a bit of working is also good, but the rest of the series is really meh tbh. I wouldn't quite call it 'trash' but it definitely felt like they planned to have WAY more episodes and then had the budget cut.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all the series will definitely leave an unsatisfied taste in your mouth. The ending was horrible and didn't even really end, they added characters just to try desperately to increase the amount of connections you had to people who died. Like seriously, Mio added NOTHING to the series, the entire series would've been just fine without Mio's little background story as a yakuza princess. It is definitely a great series for the action but as far as the background story goes? Nah it is a trash backstory that leaves you thinking half the characters are retarded. It has a DBZ feel to it concerning the 'power' of characters that constantly fluctuates to fit with a retconned story line, and the 'drama'/'romance' is about as fulfilling as an overcooked piece of cheap chicken nugget.\\n\\n\r\nWould recommend to anyone who just NEEDS something to watch, but all this series does is try to make you cry (I'm really easy to make cry and I didn't even shed a tear). But anyone that wants a satisfying story (they should've ended it in the battle against scythe) find something else I promise there is nothing here for you.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Depends if you have nothing better to watch. Super duper overrated, huge plot holes with gaping issues in character development. People seem to love the show because it has an 'angel beats' tragedy feel to it. I would avoid this show if at all possible unless you're desperate for a terrible tragedy story that makes no sense by the end.",

Then the main character Zwei did the biggest sin in any type of entertainment. Instead of just doing what he set out to do he takes an hour to chase and kill the guy he was after. I struggle with these kind of scenes because it doesn't speak to him beinga master assassin, instead it makes him seem like an amateur. I just don't understand. how these characters think. Add 2 clip shows and boring, pointless subplots with no like able characters, and obvious, better solutions, you get the biggest disappointment for me since Gantz.",

It's not in the action genre, but it does have \"gunplay\" (meaning some characters shoot guns. Nothing stylish, just for plot function), and a little knife play (the little choreography that exists is good). It's not a character piece, because character development/growth doesn't really happen. I'd call this more an introspective piece. It asks the viewer \"How would you feel if you were made to kill? How would you see your life moving forward from there?\"\r\nNothingoverly original here plot wise. The story is really baseline reactionary for the protagonists. The antagonists could have had a better throughline, but the plot really settles on boilerplate power struggles between characters you care none about.\\n\\n\r\nThe Main characters suffer from the same amount of apathy. They're both extremely cold, emotionally distant people. It's extremely rare that either make any decisions on their own instead of just reacting, so you can't empathize where they're going, and further more, where they end up is exactly where you think they do. No surprises. Nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, I was bored and unimpressed with this, and yet, it got me to the end. I watched it straight through, and I don't hate that I did.",

            "content": "I was really looking forward to watching this show because of the art is just my type. It wasn't what I was expecting. It's dark in an off yet predictable way, but you can't help falling in love with the animation. \r\nThe story centers around brainwashed assassins, and what one would expect to see realistically in a situation involving them. It was entirely predictable which come as a surprise because it has more story twists than any other anime I've watched. Despite its complexity, I thought it left something to be desired. It gave the viewer a real look at how things play out inan AWOL assassin situation where the twists are even realistic. But the predictability is due to even more than reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the key to knowing what's going to happen. I am highly sensitive to facial expressions and what they mean, and the art is exceptional in showing those expressions. Every face is beautifully drawn, and every emotion as readable as if you were looking at a real person. As if that wasn't enough, the animation is to die for. The action sequences had me drooling with it's realistic movements and insane speed. The choices made in the movements aids the viewer in understanding the characters almost more than the story. It's definitely some of the best work I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are a bit lackluster and extremely cliche. I found it difficult to like any of them let alone empathize with any one. While the viewer gets the information he needs and there is obvious character development, I found it hard to care (With the exception of the very last minute of the show).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pumped and quite enjoyable. It introduces a lot of different sound but generally stays in the synthy Europe music realm. There are a few moments of bad music mixing, but it keeps to a pretty basic standard. I especially enjoyed the opening of the first half and the ending of the second half. The sound mixing is pretty good with one of the best interludes I've seen/heard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this an 8/10 thanks to the animation and sound. You should definitely watch it dubbed though. Most of it takes place in America and you won't hear the exquisite voices and accents if you watch it subbed. It's like watching Black Lagoon subbed. :P  It feels very slow at times, but it's worth the end, the art, and the action scenes.",

            "content": "For some reason, this anime seems to be in the midst of controversy on this site. I've come to the conclusion that this lies in false expectations. So I decided to write a review that highlights which demographic of watchers would enjoy this anime. Short story: if you enjoy psychological thrillers; complex characters; highly emotional moments, jason bourne-esque action scenes; philosophical questions regarding de-humanization, survival, freedom, redemption, and spiritual peace; and imagery, then you will enjoy Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIf you are expecting a Godfather anime with bits of comedy, you shouldn't watch this anime. This is a very dark anime that refusesto glorify the lifestyle of the mafia. The focus of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom strongly lies in the thoughts and struggles of the two main characters. The mafia world in which they live in is explored to an extent, but not enough to distract from the focus of the show. Personally, I found this plot to be one of the most exciting thrillers I've ever seen. Between the dramatic action scenes, the grim and emotional dialogue, the constant uncertainty of the characters' fate, the dark atmosphere, and the suspenseful plot twists, this was an easy watch-in-one sitting anime. But if you are not invested into the main characters and understand their thought processes, the story will not leave the impact that it was intended to make. In regards to the \"plot-hole\" that some point out later in the show, I have to say that I could not find a legitimate one when I rewatched it. There are a handful moments that call for the \"suspense of disbelief,\" but they are very minor, rare, and only distract from the story if you are looking to nit-pick. There is some debate over the last minute of the show (which is not in the visual novel,) but it does not greatly effect the quality of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe animation studio obviously had a good budget for this anime, because the animation is excellent. Nothing unusual or as detailed as ufotable, but the animation served the anime well. The action scenes are the best non-superpower combat scenes I have seen in anime. The martial arts or knife combat are especially fluid. The assassination missions are also thrilling to watch. I particularly liked the use of imagery: glazed over eyes, strategic shadowing, puppet-like movements, and the masks. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are the some of the best I've heard in anime. The guns all make different sounds depending on the model, the direction they are firing, and the way they are being used. The knives had the a distinctive sound that differs from generic \"sword clashing\" in a lot of anime. But the thing that stood out the most to me was the sound effects for movement. The pacing of the footsteps and with swishing of cloth during action scenes really added to the intensity. As far as voice actors, both the sub and dub overall do a good job. Personally, I prefer the dub (which is rare for me) because American accents make sense in a story set in LA. Voice acting was key to understanding the story, because of the subtleties of the characters. Music wise, the opening and ending by Kokia are gorgeous and appropriately set the mood for the show. The second opening, however, feels out of place. The soundtrack was quite good: a mix between Jason Bourne and Carmina Burana in style. The male choir chanting over a thrilling chase sequence really added to the atmosphere. The haunting and prayer-like pieces associated with painful and emotional moments were especially well done. My only gripe is that there is one piece that feels uncomfortably out of place in comparison to the rest of the soundtrack, but that's just me being nit-picky. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow here is the focus and best part of Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. I do not give out 10s easily, but the constant amount of deep emotion these characters made me feel gave me plenty of reason to give out a 10. After watching all of the mental, emotional, and physical pain they went through, you can't help but shed tears and pray that they achieve their goals. I can't say too much without writing a spoiler, so I will keep this section vaguer. You get to see what taking a normal person, removing his humanity, training him into an obedient assassin, and how he deals with the internal consequences from these things. Ein is a reserved character that gradually develops throughout the series. Zwei's interactions with Ein are particularly touching, but their are other character interactions that leave an impact. I will warn you that you have to have a decent amount of natural empathy to understand these characters though. Phantom excels at achieving intense emotion through dramatic storytelling, complex characters, and subtleties (imagery, voice acting, etc.) In fact, I was amazed at how much the characters could drastically affect my emotions. But if you do not enjoy thinking while you watch, this is not the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an emotional roller-coaster that I've rewatched several times. The depth of the characters, the thrilling plot, the epic action scenes, emotional dialogue, and the complex concepts have made this a personal favorite of mine. It was emotionally painful for me to watch at several points, but these parts were so well done that I enjoy it all the more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI believe this is one of the finest psychological thrillers ever made. For what the creators were trying to do, I believe they achieved their goal marvelously.",

The Musical score for this anime was quite brilliant to say the least.I've thoroughly enjoyed the Musical Score with quite a few standout tittles like Requiem,To Kill or Not Kill,Reservoir City.The animation is pretty good.I'd recommend you to watch the Dub.Not because the sub is bad but because the theme fit the English language more than the japanese.Similar to Cowboy Bebop,Black Lagoon and Wolf's Rain.There are some minor flaws throughout the series but I can't discuss them without spoiling it so, I won't get into that.The Ending was truly fantastic.It was a fitting ending to the perfect tale.That ending is seriously on my top 10 anime ending.\\n\r\nSimilar Anime:\\n\r\n*Monster(Doesn't have too much similarity on the genre,plot or characters but both have a very realistic approach to their respective stories and characters)\\n\r\n*Gungrave(Another Gangster anime.Though it has far more action than Phantom both the series manage to pull of a very perfectly well executed Gangster setting)",

The story itself, will be predictable for most, it does have some surprises though. \r\nWhat had me, hooked on this anime, is thecharacters. the characters are very well made, and as the story progesses, and you see deception, lies, and love. the way the characters feelings is exposed, is something that will have an emotional impact, atleast it had for me. \\n\\n\r\nI would say that, the show is worth watching for sure. but if you have the time, to watch the entire show within a short amount of time, over a weekend or so, then it will leave you, breathless",

            "content": "With no idea what I was getting into, I watched Phantom~Requiem for the Phantom. And I learned a lesson from watching this anime: sometimes you should take the path less traveled and watch something you never hear about. Because Phantom is so good\u2013it should be talked about. Phantom is so good I couldn\u2019t stop watching it. Phantom is so good it manages to make you love despicable characters and feel bad for them throughout. Phantom is an anime made straight from the hands of the Gods. There are so few things wrong with this anime, it should be illegal to have that many things right.Sure this won\u2019t appeal to everyone, sure it\u2019s not a total gore and violence-fest. It\u2019s a character-driven, plot intensive show that doesn\u2019t need the amazing fight sequences to keep it afloat. All it needs is Ein and Zwei, two of the most likeable characters I\u2019ve ever seen in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nLet me stop sucking Bee Train\u2019s train and tell you about this anime and why it\u2019s so good before I go back to sucking that train. It tastes good.\\n\\n\r\nA teenage boy loses his memories and finds himself thrown into a world of assassins, gangs, and rich organizations that keep them in line, all in Los Angeles. He is trained to be an assassin by Ein, a girl who has also lost her memory and is nothing more than a killing machine. Zwei, the new name given to the teenage boy, fights side by side with Ein, known as Phantom. Phantom is Inferno\u2019s best assassin, Inferno being an organization run by different gangs and assassins. As the plot progresses we see a lot of deception and a lot of character development. It\u2019s really hard to give a big plot description without giving a lot away, as this series revolves around many characters, all with their own agendas.  Part of the drama is how everyone seems to be playing each other and no character has a single mask they wear, they have two masks that are complete opposites.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is intense. It\u2019s not amazingly amazing, but the shootouts and knife fights are so well done and exciting that you\u2019ll wish there were more. But at the same time, the progress of the story is so edge of your seat dramatic that you want to see that play out more. It balances these two things so well and in the end, you wish there was more of Phantom to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of setting this in Los Angeles is original and smart. It\u2019s exciting to see an anime that doesn\u2019t stay in Japan and the idea of people running off to Mexico and the use of the Bloodies (the Bloods essentially) as bad guys is goddamn smart. It feels like something almost American.\\n\\n\r\nThe second act of the series, the final seven episodes, you\u2019ll either love or hate. It moves into Japanese high school territory. This can be a total turn off, as I was pretty appalled by the turn of events. But when you look into it,\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\n\r\nit is actually pretty good. Ein and Zwei wanted to be normal and live normal lives. To the Japanese, a normal anime would be in Japanese high school. So it only makes sense to put it there. This is also where I wonder how old the characters are. At the point they go to high school it has been three years since Zwei started training as an assassin. Zwei is also driving a car and going into casinos and stuff at that point. So he must have a forged ID or something because I figured him to be about seventeen or eighteen during the LA arc. This becomes equally confusing when Cal, a girl whose sister has died and lives with Zwei during his time in LA, comes back two years later to Japan. From a petite little eleven or twelve year old girl, she becomes a giant breasted, tall, Amazonian woman on a motorcycle (or, quite simply, fan service). I didn\u2019t understand the ages and some of that kind of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is fantastic. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve choked up, but I did watching the final battles of Phantom. And the very, very end is\u2026unexpected? I liked the very end, but I was kind of shocked.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS END)\\n\\n\r\nCal quotes Danny DeVito and Clint Eastwood at one point in the anime. And movies starring those two are apt movies to say that this anime was inspired by. The underworld and assassins and gangsters. It\u2019s like an homage to the old 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s crime films. Hell, the use of the watch with music as a device for when to shoot during a stand-off comes straight out of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, but not great. It\u2019s smooth and the characters are easily distinguishable. Hell, I have no complaints here, so let\u2019s move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is another thing entirely. The first opening is fantastic, the ending meh. The second acts opening and endings are just meh. The music during the show is really good and the voice actors are really good as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the series are where Phantom really shines. Ein is a likeable heroine. Despite being a bad guy, you feel genuinely bad for her situation and her development throughout the series is really great. From a girl with nothing to live for but to kill to a girl who lives to see her partner smile, it\u2019s quite cute and the hints of romance just add to that cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nZwei is another likeable character. As the main character, and a male, you would expect him to be pretty bland (as is the case with many anime), but he turns out to have a whole lot of personality. His development is just as good as that of Ein, maybe even better. Even though he is a killer and detests himself, I loved him.\\n\\n\r\nCal was so cute and so fun to watch in the first act. In the second act, she becomes so likeable for some reason, even more so than at first. I don\u2019t know why, maybe it\u2019s because of how bad you feel for her. If I had to say that one character was my favorite, it was Cal. I loved her throughout.\\n\\n\r\nClaudia McCunnen is another character I\u2019ll bring up because she\u2019s the other character that really stood out to me. I liked her because she was a bad guy, but a good guy, but a bad guy. She\u2019s the only member of Inferno I truly felt bad for and had emotions for.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys of the series are fucking bad guys. They don\u2019t piss around. Scythe Master is a freaking godsend in a medium with so many lame bad guys with stupid intentions. Scythe Master is just a bad guy. Pure and simple. He doesn\u2019t need to have a lot of reasons to be bad, because he\u2019s crazy. And the insane bad guys are always the best. Oh, I hated him. I hated him so much. But I loved hating him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no bad characters here. They are all good. None are annoying, none are stupid, none are cardboard.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom is awesome. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever loved in anything thrown together. Assassins, gangsters, an awesome underworld, double and triple crosses, a smidgen of romance, a lot of drama, a lot of likeable characters, and some seriously sad moments. The only wrongs it truly has are some of the music and the change of Cal from a twelve year old to a twenty year old. Otherwise, it\u2019s nearly pitch-perfect in the drama and action department.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this series more than I ever expected myself to.",

An whole 360 degree circle. But I enjoy dynamic characters. There are more or less side main characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThere is a power struggle between organizations. Who will reign supreme? I enjoyed the characters developing stages, the music, and how the settings were put into play.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe anime deserves a watch no matter how you look at it. The first episode was kind of boring but once you push through it, you'll get hooked. And you will learn to love the characters. The ending...such tragedy..but I won't ruin it for you. You'll just have to watch it and find out what this psychological anime is about and what it will do to you.",

            "content": "~~~~~~SPOILER~~~~~~~~\r\nThe story was great. There are tons of explanations for the ending. It was destined to be a tragedy, but I hoped it wouldn't. Regardless it still had a sense of a happy ending. They both got some part of their past returned. Swei finally fulfilled a promise, and Ein got to return to her homeland and live the rest of her life with him, albeit a short one. It is my personal opinion that she was shot as well. The whole story is one of redemption, upon leading to ones death. Ein regained her past and finally smiled before she died. Swei fulfilled apromise, and Drei got to reconcile with Swei before their deaths. Even Claudia died after realizing she failed at redeeming her brother. It doesn't make sense to me that the director would punish Ein and Swei for being part of the mob when they didn't have a choice if his/her morale of the story was their is no escaping the underworld. I wish there had been more romantic relationship development between Ein and Swei, but the fact that there wasn't makes me believe the director had a major point he/she wanted to make and chose not to potentially mislead the audience into thinking this was a love story. It seems that he/she was pointing towards how much control we really don't have over our lives, and the many paths they can take us. The countless flashbacks to possible outcomes seems to point towards that. The chance that Swei hadn't missed Drei, or the chance that Swei hadn't decided to visit LA on his vacation. With so many coincidences going on in our world, is it possible to have control over our lives? Do all we have control over is how fast we come to our own predetermined end as Claudia points out? And will we all suffer the same fates of those who willingly participate in the actions we have forced upon us? These are all questions I believe the story poses, and after writing this review I feel they reflect the questions the author answered while writing the story.",

It is psychological and dark so if your not into that then I don't really recommend it, but if you don't mind or like that you definitely need to see this anime. The character development is really good and even though the ending of the first half isn't happy, it's still good and it made me cry. \r\nAs for the second half, it was completely unnecessary. The whole thing made me cry, seriously 0/10. They took away most of the good things from thefirst half and turned the anime into absolute shit. How did such a good anime go so wrong? They continued it. *SPOILERS FROM HERE ON* With a dead love interest and the MC alone what to they add? A stupid fucking loli, seriously! Now with this annoying little shit with him the MC goes on some stupid much less dark quest with the annoying loli which basically sums up that unnecessary second half. You'll understand once you watch, but still the first half is amazing.",

            "content": "Phantom: Requim for the Phantom is an emotional and action packed roller coaster ride which keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the series.  Depicting the unsightly underbelly of the American Mafia and following the story of two assassins which work for them this anime depicts some strong emotions from rage to love and everything in between.  The great plot keeps you thinking while the art and characters gives a grasp of realism to the world depicted in the story.\r\nThe plot deals with a wide variety of subjects but integrates them together neatly and never feels rushed or forced.  Thereis a constant undercurrent constantly moving the story forward all while small story lines are finishing at the surface which keeps you waiting for the next episode.  The anime keeps you guessing and does a great job drawing you into the story throughout as the action, deception, and depth constantly crescendos to the finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on the series has great depth down to the small details, the backgrounds and the scenaries.  As you watch the anime you feel at times as if you are seeing from the eyes of the specialy trained assassins, constantly scanning the surroundings and picking up small objects and information that comes into play later.  The characters are also well drawn, and the physics are portrayed evenly throughout the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are balanced, well written, and progress throughout the series.  As the plot moves the characters grow with the constantly moving plot.  Though often showing a facade on the surface typically, this is what the series seems to be deep rooted in, that nothing is surface deep.  The characters are each peeled back slowly revealing their true natures, wants, desires, and then once they are all used up they realize their mistakes, but maybe not always in time.\\n\\n\r\nAll aspects of this series was great, and the entertainment value was through the roof, however for me, the last 30 seconds of the final episode almost ruins it.  Though it seems to be a foreshadowed event, it was just not my cup of tea.  I would still HIGHLY recommend this series, and even have it on my watch again list.\\n\\n\r\nRating 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPosted by @GameJok3r\\n",

            "content": "The Story:\r\nThe premise is pretty simple: Your memory has been erased, you are being trained as an assassin, kill or be killed. Along the way there is plenty of action, betrayal, revenge, intrigue, drama, and a small smattering of romance. \r\nThe series as a whole is broken up into three arcs with the first two being the most sophisticated, logical, and clever. I'd go as far as to say you even get a bit of the wonderful Death-Note-style intrigue/manipulation in the first arc. Unfortunately all that gold largely disappears in the 3rd arc, where characters often make silly, needlessly complex decisions, arrive at illogical conclusionsor undergo unexplained shifts in character. That being said, arc 3 is still entertaining and it doesn't matter because you're already hooked :).\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation seemed pretty crisp to me. I don't have a background in art or drawing so I can't comment too much on this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was pretty good as animes go. They play this one song that sounds like \"Clubbed to Death\". I haven't found it yet but it just has that kind of unrelenting mafia bad ass feel. The other stand out song was Cal's intro song (you'll see what I mean). It's called Battle of Crimsons and I really liked the way it melded piano and kick ass techno beats.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe characters were very good. The series kept you fascinated by their decisions and their thought process. It made you ask yourself what would \"I\" do in this situation? How much would it take to make me kill? Would I behave like them? If you want a black/white, good versus evil kind of struggle this is definitely NOT the anime for you. There is lots of moral grey area, guilt and regret. Character development is strong during the first two arcs but then stalls in the 3rd. Basically it becomes harder to relate to their decisions because many don't really make sense. I'll just stress that overall, the characters are engaging and fun.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed the series. Even though I felt like they could have done some things better they still delivered. I think it really depends on what type of anime you like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI gave this an 8/10 overall because I think it does have some flaws and unanswered questions. Still worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nMisc:\\n\\n\r\nViolence/Gore: Lots of gun violence! Definitely not for children or the faint of heart.\\n\r\nRomance: moderate-minimal\\n\r\nSex/nudity: minimal-none\\n\r\nConsistency: Some inconsistency in character actions/decisions. \\n\r\nEnding: potentially frustrating w/ loose ends",

The pacing in this anime was excellent. It never  felt dry and every episode was important even if it didn't seem that way at first. The action in this show was top notch which is surprising because the story is very deep and it is usually hard to have a deep anime with great action scenes but this anime was able to combine the two masterfully. The best aspect of this show, in my opinion, was the complete character change thatthe three main characters went through. Zwei goes through the most changes and it's interesting to see him go back and forth from ruthless assassin to broken teenager. This isn't a really upbeat anime so expect mellow music and a gloomy atmosphere. Also be prepared for some characters that you might get attached to, to die.  \\n\\n\r\nTip: The dub for this anime is actually really good.",

From the beginning up to somewhere around episode 12 it was boring, and then after the interesting part ended, its like they were trying to bore me up like in the beginning. It was plain. The author just didn't stop forcing it to be dark and depressing. He did fairly good making it dark but at times it seemed really cliche and forced.\r\nAnimation - 6/10\r\nThe animation or artstyle is nothing special. It wasreally plain in my opinion and it did quite a fit to be \"dark\" but it was still too plain and boring. It looked more \"sad\" than \"dark\".\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 5/10\\n\r\nThe music was so cliche, as if it was some kind of naruto amv made by a 12 year old. At times you might cringe at how much the producers were trying to make it look like a typical hollywood movie with that terrible \"kewl\" music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were good and unique. I also liked how the author didn't make some of the lead characters too \"unique\" but kept them more 'balanced'. Though you may cringe at some of the character's stupidity and ignorance. I think that characters should be ignorant in an enjoyable matter, like 10 minutes after their ignorance they become good to reason with. But noo they just had to act stupid and make it more irritating than dark and deep. Oh and also the character were overdramatizing, a lot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nIt was a fairly good \"pass the time\" anime but the things just didn't fit for me to get me excited. As I pointed out many times, it was really plain and edgy; but decide for yourselves. \\n",

It was interesting, exciting, the sound was great, the story seemed kind of cliche but had captured my attention. \r\nI couldn't stop watching. I kept moving on to the next episode to the next. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning. The characters were mysterious and made me want to learn more about them. The writers give us fragments of a story that we are to make of for each character in considering their motivations. The two main characters void of emotion or memories are simply and utterly captivating. \r\nFor the first half (ish) of the anime I would giveit a 9/10 or even a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the second half. This is when things get hard to stomach. Indeed, I couldn't stop watching the show, but I felt angrier and angrier watching characters do things that had absolutely no reason or motive behind them. The characters become dull, and everything from then on seems contrived to advance the \"plot\". \\n\\n\r\nToo many characters are introduced. Not enough screen time. Ridiculous, meaningless actions from them used to conveniently move on with the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n The story is about finding one's identity (such as with many other works of any age) and in a sense, the writers address that fact. I have no qualms with the ending, but the way the anime reached it was disappointing. It is so hard to not write spoilers for there are so many instances where these flaws just completely ruined the ending of the show. They become more significant than any of the advancements in plot or events in the story line as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are unlike me, and you can just accept things as they are without questioning the ridiculousness of the character's actions you may indeed enjoy the show more. The ending left a sour taste in my mouth and brings me back to the disappointment I obtain from watching shows that are made to fit the convenience of the writers.\\n\\n\r\nLast half score:  6/10\\n\\n\r\nThese scores so far are for story, character, and enjoyment only. \\n\\n\r\nArt: sometimes the images would look sloppy but overall good job 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the first opening. Second one was eh. Overused battle soundtracks and character theme songs. Good OST I guess, but when used too often becomes less impactful and slightly annoying. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10 \\n\r\nI would recommend this show, with reluctance. It would be good for those who are looking for enjoyment, but consider my warning: expect to be disappointed with the ending of this show that shows so much potential with the beginning.\\n\\n",

Even Scythe was memorable, no one could forget the Villain, his actions, his demency and how he met his end \u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good, character design are realistic and so is pretty much everything, there isn\u2019t much color and the background is somber, the CG drawn cars are realistic looking but look out of place and the action is quite fantastic to watch, especially in the last episode, its chilling and exciting, watching Ein fight was the pinnacle of the excitement\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic perfectly tuned to the mood, never missing a beat or a chord and elevating the action to a new height and setting the mood for the drama, making the best scenes memorable\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I started skeptical, but soon enough I found a gun pointed to my head while hearing an eerie orgel (music box)song play on my back, I couldn\u2019t contain the tears of excitation while biting my nails, I knew what was going to happen next, watching the characters move while listening to the music and watching everything happen right in front of me was truly the peak of the moment, and while watching patiently the last seconds, they almost surprised me and I could finally whip my tears of excitement and have a deep breath\u2026\\n\r\nHonestly of all the possible endings, this one was the most exciting they could make\u2026",

It was a fairly simple misunderstanding between 2 great characters (won't mention which to avoid spoilers)  that I really liked and felt sorry for. One of them is turned into a murder crazy jerk because of a simple misunderstanding and refuses to listen to the explanation until she is dying and it's to late. The drastic change in her design and body build /shape also felt extremely unrealistic for an anime for the most part trying to have realistic looking characters and environments. Other thanthat it was pretty good. And I really do appreciate that it's a complete anime and not one of those  'watch 12 episodes and then buy the Manga if you wanna know the ending' semi advertisement animes, they do tie up all the loose ends.",

It's by the title of phantom of inferno\r\n--- major spoilers---\r\nFirst of the things I enjoyed about this series\r\nI enjoyed the character designs, the story, and the 2nd closing and ending songs.\r\nthe reason I rated this anime so low ( the main reason ) is the story plot holes and technical errors. Who kills Zwei in the end? Why is there so many time skips? Another thing that highly irritated me was the fact hat th routes were obious and poorly put together. How were Ein and Zwei rescued? Or how did they survive? How did that little girl( forgot her name was the 3rd phantom )become opaii Maximus from a washboard in two years while Zwei who looks older end up going to high school? What was with Ein's change in personality after the 2nd time skip? \\n\\n\r\nAlso why show nudity in the first 20 seconds of the first episode? Seemed really tacky. I'm ok with nudity but there were scenes that could have used some nudity ( Claudia and Ein ).\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I couldn't get into the characters. There were some scenes that I would have cried on but because I didn't \"feel\" the characters the feels were non existent. \\n\r\nIt's wierd though if they stopped the anime on episode 11 after both Ein and Zwei had died and maybe had a wrap up episode after, it would have been a much better anime. \\n\\n\r\nOver all it's worth a watch but slightly irritating on details.",

It is a great show and anyone who loves shows involving characters growing stronger and becoming great( similar to bleach, naruto, one piece etc except for more mature audiences:P) should watch this. Anyone from 10+ could watch this and enjoy however it's maturity that isrequired.. not a person who is all innocent and still believing everyone could live happily after all. To tell the truth, this show really reminds me of Luluch of the rebellion or whatever because the main character is not all good but not all evil. The point is.. most people should watch it!:))",

            "content": "REQUIEM FOR THE PHANTOM: One of the most overlooked titles out there\r\nViewers have the tendency to believe that popularity is directly proportional to quality. This frame of mind has made some of them dismiss unpopular titles without even giving it a chance. It is a mere misconception, and it is very plain that many titles have suffered from diminishing audience share because of it. One of these overlooked titles is Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, and it is a title that doesn\u2019t deserve to be overlooked at all.\r\nThe series features a story that revolves around trained assassins who work for an underground organization. It canbe considered as a mafia account, so a lot of action is to be expected. Story-wise, the series is quite slow in a very good way. What makes this rather sluggish pacing effective is the overall treatment of the series itself, which is mysterious, dramatic, and elegantly dark. This style is used to portray an action-packed story of isolation, loneliness, betrayal, and other themes that have a solemn effect. All of these themes, when put together, create a contradiction between action and drama, which is very intriguing as a concept. The story is plagued not with senseless bloodshed, but with action that triggers a lot of different subtle emotions. And what makes the story even more interesting is its author\u2019s courage to kill off the characters, who, I must add, are very easy to feel sympathetic to.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom: Requiem for the Phantom features an interesting pool of characters. The reason for this interest is their enigmatic nature. This air of mystery in the characters can be used as an excuse to hide their flatness, but this is not the case for this series. The characters are not flat at all. The viewers are able to see their motives, beliefs, and depth despite the vagueness of their identities. This fact renders them very well-made characters, and not just quiet individuals who pretend to be profound. And the way they interact are very sensual, sometimes, even erotic, that it has contributed immensely to the intense drama behind all the violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem I have with the series is the last Story Arc, which appears to be a little forced considering the timeline of events. Aside from that, I see no other faults. Taken as a whole, I consider this of above-average quality, for the story and characters blend well with their chosen themes, which, I must say, are portrayed quite elegantly. Without doubt, Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom, is a series worth watching. Don\u2019t let unpopularity take away from you an experience that will make you realize that, despite the frailty of us humans, we have the ability to get back up and hope -- a hope that, someday, we would be able to transcend from our phantom-like existence.\\n",

            "content": "The story centers around two assassins, called Ein and Zwei. It starts with a mysterious orgainsation, known as Inferno, taking Zwei in to be trained as an assassin. Ein and Zwei would eventually do missions together for Inferno. However, things aren't that simple in the underground (in the mafia sense) world. A dark tale of murder, betrayal and finding oneself unfolds.\r\nThe show was highly action packed and thrilling. Both assassins who have no identity would eventually find themselves, after the long journey of murder, betrayal and acting as puppets. I loved the acting skills of both assassins in the stakeout sessions before the actual missions,though Zwei\u2019s was usually a bit off. I felt that this further added to the thrill, yet also managed to add some light-heartedness. Further adding to the light-heartedness was the start of the second half of the show, where the assassins would act as high school students. The amount of light-heartedness might sound like a lot, but it\u2019s just the right amount, which allows for an occasional break from the thrill and intensity of the action. The first opening theme was also quite haunting yet alluring. Personally fell in love with the insert song (which I linked below).\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJgEGTS13x8\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a dark, espionage-like show with a good plot and featuring mafia families, plus well-developed characters, then this show is very worth a watch imo. The show features gunfights, so fans of guns and gunfights might be able to enjoy the show.\\n",

And then last arc totally screws it all up. Well, not totally, but enough for it to matter. Soundtrack was splendid, there were many exceptional tracks that worked miracles with setting the mood, but then there's one black sheep track that felt so incredibly off. Interestingly enough art had similar feel, very well pulled off, except sometimes on rare occasions it would seem cheap, but it's okay, all thingsconsidered. The way dash of romance was so very subtly interweaved with the serious and dark plot was likely my favorite thing about all this. My issues with last arc: \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD: \\n\\n\r\nI hated how after time skip, everyone looked exactly the same except Cal, who suddenly looked 8 years older. It was a super mega immersion breaker for me. And the fact I hated her character twist didn't help at all. Seriously, that character twist just felt so off, like she's suddenly whole different person and nothing that happened so far mattered. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the overused trope of over exaggerated misunderstanding was lame in Code Geass but Phantom somehow managed to make it even lamer with Reiji not even attempting to communicate his point of view.I understand it's one aspect of J culture but god damnit it's still dumb as fuck. That bullet in the epilogue was so bad it was good. Plus he had it coming. Wasting that kid and having Karma as opening and insert theme song was a death flag if I ever saw one. \\n\\n\r\nI almost thought we were in for a twist with nothing happening in the end but hey whatever, it's fine either way with me. But Elen's reaction hardly made any sense then so... yeah... stupid semi-ambiguous endings being semi-weird. Ah whatever, it's nothing in the face of how terrible Cal's development felt for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe darkness of whole show was uplifting, interesting, immersive, shocking, but at that point it just became depressing, sad and lame. However, since it's Urobuchi, even a screwed up arc still had some coherency and kinda worked well enough to not destroy the show. At least Elen-Reiji dynamic still worked wonderfully, and the whole school setting twist was unexpected and hence fun. The fancy-suit-Reji from second to last arc was likely the coolest thing ever.",

            "content": "Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a remake of three part ova sires Phantom the animation. When i went in to this show i wasn't expecting much but then i so that the writer is GEN UROBUCHI known for madoka magica and fate zero my hopes jumped high up. But from the three shows i have watched from Urobuchi i can say i was disappointed with this one it had the potential to be a great show but it made a lot of mistakes in the final part that made it almost unwatchble.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe plot in phantom is split in three parts it tells the storyabout a young boy who gets adopted from an organization called inferno and becomes an assassin for them partnered with another assassin called ein also known as phantom, Thats the summary of the show with out any spoilers. Its your basic plot for an assassin show a young boy gets adopted by an organization he has some talent for killing and has no choice but to join the organization or either be killed but after he starts to see that what his doing is wrong that's when the plot starts moving and i have to say when i was watching it til episode 15 i was enjoying this show i would gave it a 9 if i rated it for the first 15 episodes but than comes Cal aka the bitch and the third part that was very rushed compered to the other parts and made the finale be very easy to predict.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThis is by far the weakest part of the show the only character that was interesting was the main character but even he is very generic, ein on the other hand is an interesting character but never developed and we never find out about how she becomes an assassin, and Cal aka the bitch for me is one of the most annoying characters in anime. The other are your typical characters for a mafia based show.\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe animation its very good and  the action is fluid and the characters look very realistic and the world looks realistic but it has some stiff animation in some of the episodes.\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe music in phantom is also one of the better parts in the show also the sound effects are very good and the guns sound like guns. But there are some moments where the music is over used and distracts you from the plot\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nOverall Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom is a good assassin anime but it didn't diliver in the end to make it a great anime but if your a fan of action assassin and mafia stories you will enjoy it and it almost 2013 so i will be generous and give this anime a 7/10 and for all those who are reading this review HAPPY NEW YEAR.",

            "content": "Bear with me as this is my first review. The anime started off being fairly interesting. A kid wakes up and doesn't know where he is and out of the blue, he has to fight this chick who tells him that he's an assassin and he has to follow the orders of this organization called Inferno. All is well until the anime tries to do too much with what it has and begins to trip on its heels fall on on its face.\r\nA few plot twists here and there are great but if they're going to be in an anime, it has to flow smoothlywith the entire anime. In Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom you have a great plot with great potential. Two assassins carry out orders for Inferno, but at the midway point of the anime where there are twists after attempted twists, for me, the anime lost its appeal. After a plot twist, there should be a nice smooth transition with the rest of the story building off of the twist. P:RftP gets the twist part right, but the transition is choppy and doesn't sit well with me. \\n\\n\r\nThe flow issue might have to do with the characters and their rigidity. The MC, Dwei/ Phantom/ Azuma Reiji (He's got multiple names/Titles) is your typical MC who follows orders but deep down, killing people is chipping away at his humanity, His boss, the blonde and busty girl, Claudia has an interesting role, but around the midpoint of the anime, there's a twist that seems a little inconsistent with the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is decent but could be better for a 2009 anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good and had some interesting parts throughout the anime. The second OP was particularly interesting. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? For the first half, it was somewhat enjoyable but at about halfway, I started to lose interest and began to nitpick at everything, which explains why my rating is kinda low.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 5. MAL calls 6 \"fine\" and 4 \"bad\". Since I thought it was neither fine because of the little things, but it didn't qualify as bad because the story was actually pretty good. It was the execution that didn't agree with me and that basically explains my rating.",
