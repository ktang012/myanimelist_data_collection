            "content": "The problem with creating a historical anime is frequently similar to that of adapting a manga or video game: oftentimes, the author has to resort to filler or fan-service materials to clumsily meet the airing requirements for shows. However, an axiom that directors ought to familiarize themselves with is that quality is invariably better than quantity.\r\nThankfully, this inference only applies to certain aspects of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, a recent adaptation of the original light novels under the same name.\r\nSet in a time period of gruesome wars to political corruptions, Maoyuu depicts a fantasy world where humans and devils are fighting for the ultimate authority, whileexploring the infrastructures involved in wars. Despite it falling under the fantasy genre, Maoyuu brings many historical references into play--from the great innovations of the Discovery age (such as the compass, movable type prints, etc.) to the spread of crops like potato and corn into the agriculture industry. Moreover, it is reminiscent of a certain series that many of us could've never forgotten--Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nBetter known for its formula of enchanting romance, Spice and Wolf consists of a very similar antique structure in the way that it handles its plot, drama, world-building, and specifically, the daily lives of merchants. While this may sound bland, Spice and Wolf manages to make it work with a recipe of individual arcs for concentrated purposes, and thus, the viewer can gain a fine viewing of diverse episodes with several delightful, piquant subjects at hand.\\n\\n\r\nIf Spice and Wolf is a mix between curry and rice, then Maoyuu would surely be a mix between potatoes and candy bars; since, it is neither a smart combination nor a completely satisfying experience. Still, it's only in comparison that one is weaker than the other. The steady, episodic approach that Maoyuu employs very much stands out on its own.\\n\\n\r\nA scaffolding plot, after all, is better than none at all. The story of Maoyuu starts out with our protagonist Yuusha, a hero siding with the humans, not expecting the beautiful demon queen Maou, whose only wish was to negotiate with him, in the heart of the demons' castle. After their fated meeting, Yuusha then embarks on a journey at Maou's will, and each episode continues with mini-stories about Yuusha's encounters and findings for a seemingly nonexistent reason.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas, it is fairly obvious from the start that Yuusha has difficulties conveying his true intentions for Maou, and oftentimes these misunderstandings are used for comedic purposes as well as entertainment. Although repetitive, the several quirks that Maou and Yuusha begin to form do add onto the character interaction, and definitely made certain arcs more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, side characters do abruptly intervene in the capital of romance arcs, usually with very few good reasons for doing so, and thus, some developments can turn out stagnantly without progression. Most side characters also have very little to offer, ranging from a delusive maid to female knights like Onna Kishi. At times, female characters would surround Yuusha in herds, and it becomes questionable whether or not pandering to the audiences was the purpose. And, although some characters were satisfyingly fleshed out with conclusive stories, other individuals had trouble deciphering their prominent role in the series. Such abstruse matters also bring up the lack of characterization or any predisposition to determine the presence of a solid personality for specific characters, since most of the cast only experience trite developments.\\n\\n\r\nMaou, for example, is best described by her acquaintance as \"useless meat\". Although Maou herself denies this, and claims at all costs the significant deeds that she has achieved and will, the fact of the matter remains that her role embodies a few inconsistent hiccups. At times, she continuously aims to resolve world peace, while the scenes which repeatedly follow her scholarly deliberations are abruptly placed daydreams of Yuusha. Such applies to the grander scale of Maoyuu as it deconstructs historical figures and side characters to bring concerns about the time period being depicted--the medieval ages. Contrarily, the portrayal of the church's public servants during prehistoric times may have exaggerated some of the exploitations, but Maoyuu does extensively illustrate the corruption which overtook officials of feudal societies. Additionally, a charming aspect of Maoyuu resides with how the characters were named after fantasy classes, which effortlessly resonated a lovely core. However, due its enormous cast, Maoyuu couldn\u2019t engender insightful eccentricities for certain characters as it did for others.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the character aesthetics in the series stuck with genuinely dull decorations as exemplified by Yuusha, whose character design emits the appeals of a generic, immutable male lead. Similarly, Maou has her own pairs of inflatable balloon issues, which many will see as being hackneyed and unoriginal. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art directing, layouts for many of the map animations and arrangement of urban images are, in comparison, much better. Correspondingly, majority of the background frameworks and presentations also fulfill their duty in making a location look rural, metropolitan, or even appropriately hideous.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is undoubtedly one of Maoyuu's greatest assets. The original soundtrack entrances viewers with its vibrant nature, and likewise, the use of many instrumental pieces evokes an indelible atmosphere. With a spirited opening and ending theme, Maoyuu further enlivens its vigor. Correlation between the animation and music also paints an impressionable feeling for the series overall, and the seiyuus all befit their roles perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, good narration doesn\u2019t necessarily equal quality dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the conversations in the series do present interesting observations about macroeconomics, some expositions on the networks of commerce can come off as brusque. Not only so, Maoyuu emphatically focuses on the construction of its own fantasy world, rather than the chronological order of its historical references, so some of the mentioned inventions furnish idealized timelines over what's factually correct. This, in turn, produces temporarily engrossing world-building, but it can also repeatedly bore or confuse the viewer with arbitrary elaborations on ultimately flimsy subjects.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the tone of my writing, it may sound like the majority of Maoyuu is about monotonous history or economics; however, during the latter parts of the series character relationships take center stage, and action scenes transpire more often. As most climaxes do, the story delivers a closing end towards previously unresolved issues, and desolating sides of things take form in both dialogues as well as battles. This, in some ways, may dismay some audiences since the pacing relatively changes, but as a closure, many aspects of the show become a lot more tasteful and digestible even in spite of the several interrelated topics displayed.\\n\\n\r\nModerately diverse, Maoyuu is a series that really tries to bring something to the table for everyone, and in its mixture of historical references with fantasy themes, some of its themes are marred by oversimplified explanations. Although the stale, generic personalities some characters exhibit are very definite flaws, the majority of Maoyuu can still offer insights on the economic and strategic aspects of war, which shifts towards a manner infrequently attempted in its medium. It is most unfortunate, then, that this unique concept lacks the excitement its influences (Spice & Wolf) had obtained so gracefully. Perhaps if given a second season, the lackluster aspects of Maoyuu can do itself more justice through more concise yet lively handling of its themes, and its character relationships may become even more captivating. If nothing else, this series provides a fascinating outlook on the protocols and systems of commercial economics, but sadly, is a hero crippled by his towering boldness of attempting too many feats. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its unfortunate flaws, Maoyuu can still compensate for its faults by further constructing its dynamic universe, but only if a sequel will be permitted to fully execute the conceptual values.",

            "content": "The success of \"Spice and Wolf\" probably came as a surprise to most. Who'd have thought a dialogue-heavy fantasy anime about economics on the surface but powered by the character chemistry underneath would sell, right? But sell it did, and some people must have extrapolated that there's a under-tapped market for such an anime, because the next thing you know, along comes \"Maoyu Maou Yusha\", a show so blatantly similar to \"Spice and Wolf\" (the fantasy settings, the economic lectures, moe heroine sporting ginger hair and unusual strength of character and intelligence, etc etc) that people immediately started labelling it \"Spice and Wolf with Tits\".If you're wondering where the \"tits\" part comes in, it's probably because some people also speculated that the \"Spice and Wolf\" formula could be improved upon by providing the heroine with a pair of giant knockers to shake around in front of the screen at every opportunity.  \\n\\n\nBut an improvement it ain't. And by sharing so many things with \"Spice and Wolf\" (including a big chunk of the staff),  \"Spice and Wolf with Tits\" - or just SaWT for short - naturally invites comparisons with the material that inspired it. Alas, it's a comparison which ultimately does SaWT no favours because it falls so far short. But perhaps I'm being overly harsh on the show; it does deserve plaudits for putting some interesting twists into the age-old humans vs demons script. \\n\\n\nThe show starts with humans and demons at war with each other, and the Hero - literally named \"Hero\" - storming the demon king's castle solo to try and end the war. The demon king (and guess what the demon king is called) surprisingly turned out to be an attractive girl with big bouncy breasts instead of a giant frothing monster with razor fangs. What also surprised Hero was her personality: she spoke a remarkable amount of sense, and, with a few well-chosen arguments, demolished the pre-conceptions the Hero had regarding humans, demons, and the nature of the war. Bewitched by Demon King's silver tongue and hypnotised by her jiggling assets, Hero agrees to co-operate with her mission to set the world to rights with wisdom rather than wars. \\n\\n\nSaWT started a little rough, but its concept got me interested enough to continue watching. Most of the first half helped maintain my interest, mostly with the way Demon King went about changing the world through her learning, introducing new technologies, new methods of doing things and new ways of thinking. And it's this, and not the interaction between the main leads that's the focus of SaWT. But that's not a bad thing, because while the nuanced interaction between the protagonists excels as one of the greatest strengths of \"Spice and Wolf\", that same aspect is one of greatest weaknesses of SaWT. I realise things are supposed to be a bit awkward between the ridiculously shy leads, but the insipid small-talk and overblown romance cliches is a combination cringe-worthy enough to embarrass a third-rate romance novelist.\\n\\n\nWhile showing some initial promise, the show soon started falling apart. SaWT has a major problem of being overly self-conscious of what it's trying to do, and thus very little of what it does feels natural. Speeches about the ways of the world is almost condescendingly delivered through long expositions that's aimed more at the viewer than the other characters. Then there are Demon King's inventions: she starts off introducing things like crop rotations methods, but soon began inventing one major technology after another, like some kind of Thomas Edison raised to the third power. What's more, her contributions span across ludicrously diverse fields, from agriculture to medical science to navigation, just to name a few; nearly every episode she conjures up something new. In one episode, someone other than her actually managed to invent something (namely, sparkling orange juice, aka Fanta), and, determined not to be outdone, Demon King invents not one but TWO things during that episode (and no, Coke isn't one of them). By the half way point of the series, I felt like I was watching a game like \"Civilization\" being played, with the Demon King way ahead of the other players in researching the tech tree comprising mankind's greatest ideas and inventions.\\n\\n\nIf Demon King is guilty of over-performing in her role, Hero is guilty of the opposite: as one half of the central protagonist pair, he simply doesn't carry his weight. While Demon King busied herself with changing the world, Hero spends the first half just tagging along and doing very little beyond admiring her. Though later on he does goes off to distant lands and contribute to Demon King's plans there, we rarely see what he does because the story is still mostly focused on Demon King and her endless output of inventions. In fact, the imbalance issue extends to everyone else, too: the Demon King seems so intelligent that she makes the show kind of boring, and everyone else appear so dim that they can't do anything until Demon King bestows onto them her pearls of wisdom; you have to wonder how the human race managed to hold off extinction before the Demon King came along.\\n\\n\nSaWT also has pacing problems. I enjoyed the gentle strolling pace of world changing used for the first part of the series, but the global politics quickly escalated to the point where I struggled to follow. Everything began changing in all the nations, half of which the show failed to properly establish in the first place; I'd also started getting lost in all the economic babble, perhaps owing to my own meagre knowledge. The show simply accelerates away during the later parts and finishes in unseemly haste, leaving one giant political mess, full of dangling plot strands and badly explained developments, in its wake.\\n\\n\nBut there I go again, coming down quite hard on the show. I do have a degree of respect for what SaWT tried to do, but the problem is that it simply did not do a good job. While it captured my interest early on, I struggled to get through the series as it progressed. It may not be a show devoid of intelligence, but it needed to be more intelligently written; it may not be a bad show, but it's far from being good. I guess it's just too much to expect a show that sought to improve upon something noted for its writing by throwing in a pair of big tits to amount to anything beyond A Good Try. And A Good Try is all SaWT managed to be.\\n\\n\\n\nPersonal rating: -0.5 (mediocre)\\n",

            "content": "Fantasy isn't quite like it used to be nowadays, or at least it doesn't want to be. Tolkien-like stories of great heroes and their adventures in the world inspired by Medieval are considered old news; now fantasy likes to be dark, edgy and bitter, showing the \"true rough nature\" of the world. There are good examples of such \"mature\" fantasy, the Witcher, for example, much as I dislike its focus on angst over substance. Often, though, it just comes down to buckets of blood and a lot of sex scenes (yeah, so mature) with no depth to it.\r\nThis anime's take on modern fantasy and overallMedieval is different and much more appealing, to me, at least. Oh, it doesn't hesitate to show how rough it can be but it chooses to introduce economics into its world. The premise is that demons are at war with humans, and finally a hero with three sidekicks gets close to stopping the war (of course he does, it's the plot of any party-based RPG ever) and heads off to kill the Satan. Who turns out to hate war herself and, in turn, tells him she actually wants to stop the war. He agrees to help her, and the rest of the show more or less focuses on her plans and their consequences.\\n\\n\r\nMost of these plans revolve around reforming agriculture, economics and so on. In the beginning it felt similar to Spice and Wolf: there are two main characters falling in love, the female is going to introduce some clever schemes, the atmosphere is equally warm, even the two leads are played by the same actors. However, Maou's ideas are all pretty simple, the intrigue comes not from the plans themselves but from the effect they have on people and, ultimately, on the country. The plot is coherent but seems to be episodic at times, partially because of the inevitable time jumps, as such reforms require time to actually take effect. \\n\\n\r\nThis one is difficult to talk about, for it's really hard to point out one single element that makes the anime good; it's mostly the little touches. For example, I really enjoyed watching the Hero for many reasons, one of them being that he asks an interesting question: what is there for a hero to do after the war has concluded? He won, awesome, so what's next? This character seeks peace to begin with, and his interactions with Maou only serve to keep him on this path, while he actually can only function in times of war. The question of what war means to different people is an interesting one, and it's explored from different angles throughout the show. There is no clear answer, though, which might irritate people; me, personally, I hate when such questions get a clear answer, ambiguity is what makes the topic interesting to begin with. Many issues are addressed, some in a rather unusual light; for example, merchants tend to place profit before everything else - is this bad? Not necessarily, as this series suggests, one character was turned from an obvious and boring \"heartless douche\" type almost into someone to root for without any real change whatsoever. I have actually thought of a thing to praise here: the writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good when they are given enough time to shine, I'd like to see more of the Mage with her split personality (for once, it's not a villain who has it), for example. Maou is interesting in that she's clearly wise and cunning but still childish and innocent, which overall makes her all the more appealing. Yuusha is pretty lighthearted and not that smart, though intelligent enough to understand his problems and limited usefulness; to his credit, he doesn't fall into angst, he always tries to help people. So, yeah, he's the Hero, no real surprise there. There obviously is a romance between these two (as usual with the characters voiced by these actors - Lelouch and Kallen, Lawrence and Horo), there is even a love triangle with the Knight lady, though this is the weakest part of the show. Don't get me wrong, the main couple's interactions are mostly nice but it leads to many unnecessary moments, like, say, discussions of boobs, which is always classy. It doesn't feature fanservice, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast consists of a variety of characters, some of which evolve throughout the series, others are interesting as they are. There are, of course, those who mostly serve as a throwaway joke or are ultimately pointless (the Old Man, the little servant girl, the Dragon Princess) but they almost always are there to complement someone else's personality, so it's not distracting. In the end, they do reflect the world they live in and present interesting possibilities for the writers to take advantage of. More than enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the score both serve to reinforce the aforementioned warm atmosphere and yeah, they work. It's not the sharp drawing style I usually enjoy but it's justified here. Everyone looks unique, particularly Maou, who is not drawn like your usual anime nice girl but instead opts for a more mild kind of beauty, which is refreshing in a female lead. The voice acting is awesome: practically all significant characters are voiced by someone whom I have heard and liked before (be it in Code Geass or Rozen Maiden), and they do a good job here too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the show. Yeah, it doesn't really pay off in terms of the romance, and the story can feel somewhat unfinished, particularly with the ending being only semi-happy but I really like to see real world economics and serious issues like cultural diversity being brought into fantasy world. It makes for an intelligent plotline with believable outcomes for all actions and allows the creators to show how Medieval actually progressed. This is what I'm going to think of now when I think \"Modern Fantasy\". A great anime.",

            "content": "So begins the journey...\r\nIn any fantasy world, some beings just don't get along. Take for example, demons and humans. In order for two races to co-exist, they have to accept each others' values. Yet that dream is an overwhelming task to achieve because let's all face it, some things just don't mix well. It's been fifteen years since the war waged by the humans and demons have begun. After an awkward meeting and the revelation that the Demon King is in fact a female, the duo forms an alliance after some reluctant arguing. Hence, let the tale of a human male and demon female begin!\r\nMayou(Maoyu Maou Yusha, aka Archenemy and Hero) is an anime adapted series from a light novel that was originally \u201cserialized\u201d on 2ch. The series is written by Mamare Touno who is not well known but has recently made his debut. The LN has sold over 450,000 copies and here we are, the anime adaptation. As one of the first full length series to debut in 2013, it definitely needed to set the bar high. So without further ado, let's see if Maoyu lived up to the hype.\\n\\n\r\nMaoyu follows the story of a hero and queen of demons as they seemingly join forces to bring about a new world. They desire a world of peace, a world without conflict, and a world where values and ideas are accepted without violence. The series begins with a lot of promise as in the format of a preview as to what's to come. In fact, our two main characters (from the poster) takes up most of the tv time as they engage in humorous dialogues and discusses their ways of changing the world. It is actually quite fresh and entertaining as viewers can see that the demons and humans are not so different. For instance, the demons themselves has their own code of ethnics and politics. They have their own ideologies and ways of thinking. To top it off, they also don't have actual or maybe I should say..physical features in the way some people may originally see them as. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, the series takes off with strange tropes and turns it into a rather refreshing series at first. I mean, we have an ordinary human and meets a not-so-ordinary demon king. Hero also gets a surprise from the fact that the Demon Queen is actually a female rather than what he originally expected. (a rather big breasted one if I may add...) The Demon Queen herself is shown to be not violent but rather trying to persuasive for her goals. It also sets up a state of prejudice at first between the races but as time goes on, it's shown that the duo can get along quite well. Even from the pilot episode, Hero seems convinced enough to join the Demon Queen despite her rather sophisticated dialogues. The dialogues themselves contains lengthy references to politics, economics, and a historical lesson rather than any violent backgrounds. In a entertaining way, it transforms the tale of struggle between humans and demons into a story of that almost seems to be educational at times. It's almost like watching the fantasy version of the Discovery Channel as the Demon Queen educates about trading and her ways of inventions.\\n\\n\r\nThe series maintains as a small cast of characters. Obviously, we have the two main stars of the series, Maou and Yuusha. They often go by their titles, Demon Queen and Hero respectively. In fact, many of the supporting cast seems to follow this trend. We have Onna Kishi known as the Female Knight, Onna Mahoutsukai known as the Female Magician, etc. Their names matches their respective titles and defines the role they play in. But perhaps the most interesting relationship in the series is between Hero and the Demon Queen. This is because they are nearly nothing alike, even in terms of being the same race. Hero seems to be a guy of using action rather than words of persuasion. On the other hand, Demon Queen seems to play the role of a politician and uses her intelligence. Yet upon closer examination, they get along quite well and intimate at times. This brings a problem of their relationship being too rushed. As a matter of fact, there is strong hints of romance between the duo already after the initial episode. To add to this relationship is a strong dose of fan service. The term \u201cuseless meat\u201d becomes a recurring joke for the Demon Queen as she takes on the role of an eye candy. With or without horns, she retains her stature as a female that seems to allure viewers. This shouldn't come too much as as surprise though as the production studio Arms handles the series. Arms is known for its rough and sketchy ways of presenting fan service such as in Elfen Lied, Ikkitousen, and Queen's Blade. Their stance of producing lascivious visuals has been a long standing trend. In this case, Maoyu isn't off their charts.\\n\\n\r\nAs being labeled as an adventure genre, the series takes the fantasy theme well. There are the old medieval like architectures and maintains that feeling of being in a fantasy world. The way the characters are dressed reflects this theme of being in simple wear in the case of servants, modern in the case of the maids, and fancy in the case of high level authority figures. Hero's design sees him as a warrior and 'hero' as the title suggests him. On the other hand, there is Demon Queen who is dressed in an ornamental way that is elaborate and eye-catching. Unfortunately, some of her appearance is played as a joke like the \u201chorns\u201d on her hand and once again, the useless meat. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of useless, I find the fan service of this series to be just that. Even with the light humor, romance, and sweet moments, I find the fan service part of the series to be in the way and preventing Maoyu to shine itself. It is distracting and seems manipulative in some of the sweet dialogues that moves away the balance. \\n\\n\r\nOther problems I've ran in to the series is the rather weak story based off the original premise. Some of the preceding episodes from the narrative prequel pilot almost seems like filler. It doesn't also help the fact that some of the jokes made throughout the series becomes a bit stale. Furthermore, Hero seems to attract other female characters of interest and creating some unfriendly rivalry for our Demon Queen. It falls under a track of insubstantial romance with a seemingly love triangle between her, Hero, and the Female Knight. \\n\\n\r\nMaoyu also seems to adapt many of the same themes as another popular title that debuted a few years back. Fans of Spice and Wolf may notice many similarities such as the adventure style storytelling, theme of economics, fantasy setting, and even the main female protagonist shares the same seiyuu. It can make an impression for viewers who once again desire a taste of economics and adventure rather than the typical \u201csave the world with swords and magic\u201d. It does have some of that though but the majority of the series focuses more on the politics, economics, and the interactions between the Hero/Demon Queen.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, the series did its job right. Despite some of the characters being serialized with the fan-service and presented in a gratuitous way, it maintains its background of the fantasy setting well. There is the elaborate landscapes, the majestic rivers, and plain rural backgrounds. The way the characters are dressed reflects off that old and classic feeling from the Dark Ages. It's the way that an adventure should be and maintains that theme well. At times though, it does look like the visual qualities of the show slows down. Yet, it maintain its fantasy posture well. \\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack, I found the series to be only mediocre. Toshiki Kameyama plays the role of the sound director and he seems to give that feeling of smoothness and melody of the medieval ages. However, it is hardly noticeable or distinguishing itself from other fantasy theme series. The OP and ED songs also presents a style of primitive artwork in the style of the old medieval ages. It is just too simple and not unique enough in my estimation.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Maoyu is an adventure series that I have mixed feelings on. From one standpoint, it is a fun and entertaining series with our lovable duo. Their interactions and dialogues makes a first impression but that later becomes repetitive and stale. The way fan service is presented becomes a source of diversion rather than some comedic fun. It is comedic in some ways though but ultimately, it doesn't achieve its goal. However, there are instances where the series launches itself with its fresh way of adventure story. It is a story about a Hero, a Demon Queen, and the plan they hope to achieve in order to make the world a better place. I just hope they succeed and achieve glory for what they strive for. \\n",

            "content": "This season seemed to lack a lot of luster for me till i saw the picture for this anime that stirred my curiosity. After watching the first half of this anime i already know where it intends to go and i can see the increase and quality every episode.\r\nThe Characters of this anime are all uniquely set in there role and Given names to reflect that. (Eg. Knight,Hero,Mage) I enjoy this method of naming cause it makes everyone really easy to remember and there role apparent from the start. It does away with a lot of formality by establishing the characters early. Then the showcontinues to pepper in details and history's of the characters without having to take up large  gaps of time in flash backs. All the characters seem to fit and act correctly in the settings and keep me personally very entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe two Main characters are both transparent in there intentions and honest in expression. They convey feelings and thoughts to the viewer well with imagery and just body language alone. The Demon King/Crimson Scholar is by far the most showcased and deep character of the series with many ideologies and a innocent quality that does not leave you frustrated with the character. She maintains a well balanced innocence and maturity that keeps her from getting too preachy or too cold which makes you feel invested in her character more and more. The hero himself is not as much yet and you only are set up for more thing as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime is fantastic with nice rural and cityscapes. I also like how the demon realm is kept realistic and not fantastical which makes the settings more engrossing. Every character is well made and clearly a individual with nobody looking recycled or reused for lack of inspiration. Everything looks vibrant and really alive in the color tones and the general lighting of scenes. I wish more anime did what this one did when trying to portray a world instead of recycled walk cycle backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound quality is fine for this anime, the one thing id like to praise is the voice acting. There is not a single intolerable voice in this anime. Everyone sounds good and not abrasive or out of place. Even the little girl character who's supposed to be cute and adorable doesn't sound too over the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is where it shines brightest, after this first episode you realize this anime does not waste your time with unnecessary back story or plot it cuts out all the generic fat and gets down to business. It gives a clear and precise objective and establishes the main characters well and then it peppers in the details about them organically episode to episode so you actually get to know the character instead of entire episodes dedicated to back story. This also creates interest in many minor and major characters cause your shown bits and pieces of them and you start eagerly wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty intelligent it uses fantasy elements in a almost realistic world only to enhance the story. It  uses these enhancements well too considering how much of the show is based on the politics,economics and public perception on war. Though it uses really mature plot points like that it isn't above normal understanding, the show keeps it easily understandable for anyone.  The show often surprises me with just how unexpected and original it can be with the progression and i am eager to see more of this series every week.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime thoroughly and while it may not be a masterpiece it surely is worth a watch if you want to see something new and intelligent instead of rehashed and recycled plots. It is a pity that it will only be 12 episodes long and i hope they develop a second season with just a strong a value as the first.",

            "content": "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is one of those animes where although it is enjoyable to watch there seems to be too many issues to really give it a high recommendation. Maoyuu draws you into its grand plot and characters however they really fail to develop primarily due to it only being a 12 episode anime. \r\nSet in a medieval fantasy world in which the human race and demon race are at war for territory and power, the story follows the human Hero and the female Demon King (They are simply referred to  by these titles) who team together to solve the underlying reasons the war;economics.\\n\\n\r\nThe Demon King can be seen as the brains of the operation and the Hero as a diplomat to some extent. Their idealistic belief to ending war by ending poverty, and advancing technology is quite a grand idea in that it takes time to really make such significant changes. The Demon Kings new ideas and technology such as new farming techniques and promoting education require lengthy periods of time before results are seen. The anime acknowledges this by numerous time skips, almost a year had past by the 4th episode and despite moving the plot forward it resulted in hardly any character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime constantly alludes to this magical world where the Hero is off saving Fairy's and helping Dragon type Demons but never dwells into it. It also begins with an almost instant romance between the Hero and the Busty Demon King but again fails to develop it. The show seems to struggle in deciding what is wants to be. It addressees intellectual themes such as economics, religion and social intolerance. Then flirts around with a love triangle between the Hero, Demon King and the Blonde knight. And while they are enjoyable to watch in the end both themes feel rushed and it it fails to conclusively resolve either. I should also add that the fan service seemed out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons this show is enjoyable is that it has likable characters. I liked the idealistic main characters The Hero and Demon King, they were powerful around others but so confused around each other, i would have liked to see development into their romance rather than just being forced into accepting it, that being said nothing really happened. The rest of the characters all had a purpose with different backgrounds and seemed to fit well into the Demon Kings plan. The majority of characters were human and it would've been great to see things from the Demon perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime is mixed. There were times when the background was just great with detail and color, other times it was like looking at blobs of green and brown supposedly resembling a forest or farm. I found the character design to be pretty good, nothing that set it apart but good nonetheless. Overall its highly watchable since this is a dialogue heavy anime but really average in quality. The same can be said for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was actually quite enjoyable but i can not recommend an anime that leaves its plot so incomplete. The overall feel to the show is somewhat rushed, it needed more time to invest in the characters and plot. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you ever wondered why there are wars, how the economy goes, political corruptions, lust for power and alike. Then this anime would be for you. A Hero/Warrior made his way through the castle of the Demon lord to confront him. It turns out that the Demon lord was a woman, that needs the help of the hero to reach peace, prosperity, and independence of the people from the support of other countries, and to end pointless wars against the humans and demons.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe plot flow is just perfect. The actions of the characters to the plot is well planned. Hiding from the high officials,and starting new identities, slowly making bonds from different kinds of people(Merchants, Priests/Priestesses, Locals, Generals.). Yet, the story still finds a way to reveal the big problems although everything seemed like all went smoothly. This anime can be related to real life wars nowadays, real life economics. I just can't say the right words for this anime, but it surely does make me view the world in a new way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first i find the animation a bit too crappy for my standards. But as time goes by i noticed that a grew a liking for this kind of animation. I noticed this, mainly maybe because for an anime that took place before the advancements in technology like electricity and such, it just kinda synced with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAwesome, the background musics were medieval like, matching the plot of the anime. As you listen to the OP/ED, I really felt the aura emanating while watching, we all have those moments, to be honest. Anyways, the sound effects were great, matched and synced perfectly. I admire the voice actors specially when some romantic scenes are made, it just makes me giggle every time, and i mean every time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are well planned. Mages, Warriors, Scholars etc. All of them do what they have to do, a dash of comedy in some parts, and a bit of meaningful words to reflect on in heart warming conversations. And may i add, all the characters here seemed to have a main role in the anime, which i find very amusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the anime. The ideas being pointed out here that can make you think about life of the people nowadays made me enjoy it the most. 1 week is too rough for the next episode, signifying my excitement for the next episode. But as the week goes by, we are already half-way through the series. And i suppose right now, I'm hoping for a second season. If not, then an ending that I'll never forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHey why not a 9/10? Story is outstanding, art matches it's medieval war like setting, characters are well oriented, and can be related to the current events in our human lives. But the better question is, why not a 10/10? Mainly because to give a 10/10 anime, i must first finish the series, giving 9/10's is reserving a space for further improvements in this overwhelming anime.\\n\r\nI'll return soon when the anime is finished airing, and we'll see if this deserves a wopping 10/10 score.",

            "content": "\u201cOriginal and different yet wanting. A well-founded mythological world that reveals a very interesting concept and focus within it, but lacks that something to become something transcending\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\n-STORY: 7-\r\nTo set this show as just a typical adventure/fantasy anime would be a shortsighted description of it; after all, this show has more potential than just that. \u201cMAOYUU\u2026\u201d grasps into things \u2013more complex- such as politics and economics \u2013although they are observed from a very basic and simplistic point of view and nothing more complicated, probably for the sake of the aimed viewers -. But let\u2019s not get carried away, this show isn\u2019t a masterpieceeither, although it has potential to be bigger, by this I mean that the show doesn\u2019t reach its fullest potential but let\u2019s not forget it\u2019s made into a 12 episode format show.\\n\\n\r\nEven though being an original show \u2013mostly by the focus shown- the show falls sometimes into the typical dull and repetitive routine shown in many other shows. Although, the characters make you forget this stalemate and those repetitive moments don\u2019t last long.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 8- \\n\r\nSo to tell the truth, besides the fact that this is a fantasy anime something else caught my attention/interest too, and that \u201csomething\u201d was the art. The art is neither the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d nor something antiquated; it was pleasing to put it bluntly. \\n\r\nNow, the fact that the art in the show is pleasing it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s one of those arts that immerse into the show after all; the art in the show is a mixture of the old \u2013shown mostly on the scenery- and the new \u2013shown mostly on the character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe palette is amazing ranging from dark oriented colors to bright and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe ART team did a remarkable job.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 7-\\n\r\nOne of the main goals of voice acting is to stimulate and transmit feelings through voice and sounds, sadly the voice acting in this show didn\u2019t achieve such a thin., The voice acting isn\u2019t bad, but it isn\u2019t great, it isn\u2019t transcending and thus it isn\u2019t memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a quote by William Shakespeare that says: \u201cIf music be the food of love, play on\u201d. The context in which the character \u2013Duke Orsino- says this words is because he\u2019s infatuated with Olivia, and she\u2019s not interested in him, so he asks his musicians to play some music, so he can surpass -or \u201coverdose\u201d- his appetite and let such feeling \u2013love- die.\\n\r\nMy point here is that there\u2019s a reason within a soundtrack or the ambient shown in a show, and it isn\u2019t having music for the sake of JUST having music within a show, it is because you want your audience/viewers to experience the feelings of the characters in an \u201cenhanced\u201d way, through music. Regretfully that\u2019s a potential that they couldn\u2019t fulfill, a potential that they couldn\u2019t squeeze right.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 6-\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a thing that I dislike and find boring about short anime shows and it\u2019s the fact that most of them lack something essential in a story \u2013every story- and it\u2019s the character development. Blame it on the lack of time; blame it on the writers or whatever\u2026 If you want a character to be memorable you need to make him or her transcend, and not just by giving him a cool sword or bad-ass armor, I mean by making him/her relate to us the viewers whether by making him mature through the show or change or have some new goals and most importantly by making them have a believe as their foundation, those are the character that are remembered in the hearts of people.\\n\\n\r\nSadly this is the aspect in which the show fails \u2013tremendously if I may add-.\\n\r\nThe characters are well done \u2013yes- and some are cute but nothing else was achieved.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT: 8 & OVERALL: 7-\\n\r\nSo to put things shortly. The show is enjoyable? Yes. It IS original and it has an appealing and easy on the eye art, and it has a sweet \u2013but not amazing nor memorable- soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some \u201cfan-service\u201d focus shown on this show \u2013for those interested in such things-.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWhat happens when you take the writer, director, and voice actors from the beloved series Spice and Wolf and add executive meddling, fan pandering, and have it produced by Studio ARMS? You get...a massive disappointment.\r\nWarning Spoilers!!!\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe human and demon worlds have been at war for 15 years, but the humans have gained the upper hand and an elite squad is sent deep into the demon world to assassinate the Demon King and end the war. However, for poorly explained reasons our main character, who is just named Hero, goes on ahead of his squad to undertake the assassination himself. When he arrives at theDemon King's castle, he learns that the Demon \"King\" is actually a Queen...with G cup breasts. The busty queen doesn't fight back, but instead calmly explains that the war is actually a good thing and far more people would die during peace time from famine and plague as a result of the booming war economy coming to an end. This would be an interesting utilitarian argument similar to the Real Politik espoused by Otto Von Bismarck and Henry Kissinger...if it wasn't a piss poor oversimplification of the original argument that completely ignores reality. \\n\\n\r\nWarning! the following paragraph contains history!!! If you don't like history, skip ahead!\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn reality FAR, FAR more people die of hunger and plague during war time than peace time. The more backwards the setting (like the medieval setting of this series) the more true this is. During the Great African War fought between 7 African nations in the late 1990s, 6 million people died of hunger and disease in just a few years. Although this region has always had famine and plague, this death rate was far higher than ever before or since for that region. One of the worst peace time famines was the Soviet Famine of 1932 caused by forced collectivization and the wildly idiotic farming methods enforced by Joseph Stalin. 7 million people including 4 million Ukrainians, 2 million Kazakhs, and 1 million Russians died of hunger. However, even the brutality of Stalin wasn't as bad as the wartime Soviet famine of 1921. During that famine a shocking 10 million people died as a direct result of WW1 and the Russian Civil War. During a brutal war, all sides tend to use scorched Earth tactics and deliberately destroy farmland to starve the enemy. In addition, all armies involved stole HUGE amounts of crops from the farmers and peasants and gave them nothing in return. In an ass backward medieval setting like Maoyuu, the army would NOT be paying the farmers more money during war time. They would steal all the crops for themselves and give the farmers nothing. That is what always tends to happen when war comes to a non-industrialized country. Another HUGE cause of starvation and plague during war that makes it MUCH worse than peace time is blockade. Nearly the entire city of Athens died of plague and starvation after the Spartans blockaded the city during the Peloponnesian War. During World War 2, 500,000 Greeks, and no less than 5 million Soviets starved to death as a result of the blockade tactics employed by the Germans. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire argument on which this story stands is complete bullshit! When Maoyuu isn't making an idiotic attempt to explain the life saving nature of war, it is talking non-stop about crop production and agricultural theory. This comes across as a completely random tangent that doesn't really add anything to the story. If I wanted farming theory tangents out of nowhere, I would go re-read Anna Karenina thank you very much! (I hope you all heard that last sentence in the \"Cinema Snob's\" sexy voice!) At least the Demon King has foresight and wishes to ultimately end the war when the military industrial complex has been dealt with and peace will be meaningful. She actually has a strategy that is far less divorced from history and logic than some other idiotic anime series I have seen. Can you imagine how stupid it would be if the Demon King thought she could end the war by taking over the Demon and Human worlds and getting everyone to hate her, then having Hero kill her and just assume that a massive power vacuum following the death of a hated tyrant would somehow cause world peace?! Now THAT would be stupid! Fortunately even Maoyuu is a better anime than that!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the Demon King herself is a fairly interesting character, the main male lead \"Hero\" is as boring and generic as hell! What made Spice and Wolf work is that both Holo and Lawrence were complex, interesting characters. You can't have a great, memorable romance if one of the characters is about as interesting as watching paint dry! The other characters besides the main 2 are basically worthless and add nothing to the series. So essentially the entire series is carried on the back of one character: The Demon King. Unfortunately, she is not THAT strong a character and her silly outbursts and fanservice moments often undermine her alleged strategic and inventive genius. She is the world's greatest scientist and military strategist, but she randomly acts like an airhead at random intervals. This doesn't come across as a character quirk like a mad genius, but instead lazy writing that changes the character whenever the situation calls for a comedy moment. I realize what they were going for I guess. Holo was old and wise, but could act childish at times and it was funny. However, Spice and Wolf was a longer series with MUCH better developed characters, so with Holo it felt far more natural and less forced than when the Demon King would have a random comedy moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you NEVER want to see on your anime is \"produced by Studio ARMS\". It is the unholy stamp of death similar to the LJN rainbow on old NES games. The only decent anime ever produced by ARMS was Elfen Lied back in 2004, and the only reason the Elfen Lied staff chose ARMS for the project was out of desperation after a dozen superior animation studios refused to work on it. Unlike Elfen Lied, Maoyuu is not a super risque anime that nearly every studio would refuse. Maoyuu COULD have chosen a vastly superior studio, but actually went with Studio ARMS. I am not a puritanical twat that goes ballistic whenever an anime features nudity or fanservice. However, I do have a basic sense of artistic aesthetics, and I appreciate female characters NOT having tits larger than their heads. I don't want to watch an anime version of a fucking Rob Liefeld comic!!! The director of Maoyuu should have hit the animators with a rolled up newspaper like a dog when he saw the character designs. \"NO!\" NOO!\" If Elfen Lied was made by ARMS and had realistic breast to body ratios, then we know it is possible if you hit the animators enough times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I relentlessly ripped this series a new asshole, I actually don't think it is the worst series in the world. It is NOT a good series and it is a HORRIBLE spiritual successor to Spice and Wolf, but Maoyuu at least has some instances of decent dialogue and tries to tell an unconventional tale with unconventional morals and lessons. It was horribly executed, but I feel like this actually could have been good with less executive meddling and less fanservice bullshit! I see untapped potential here. The soundtrack is also decent and as much as I bagged on the art, it often isn't THAT bad. Overall, this series is very average and deserves an average to mediocre 5/10.",

            "content": "It's a series that had potential, but ruined it by doing too much. \r\n[mild spoilers pertaining to storyline progression and general point-of-view]\r\nA third season of Spice and Wolf is perhaps the most desired adaptation among fans of the franchise. When announcement came through that a similar series, with similar staff members, was going to be released, fans were ecstatic. Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple to live up to the name of the predecessor, and it's even more difficult to satiate an entirely new crowd. Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha suffers from a variety of debilitating features that not only make it a shitty, half-assed 'successor', butan awfully trite,mundane standalone. \\n\\n\r\nMaoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha doesn't have the world's most amazing storyline. In fact, it's relatively archetypal -- the king of demons and the hero of humanity wish to team up to ultimately better the world. Sounds relatively creative right? It's not. But it could have been. We're given two main characters, Maou, and Yuusha [translated to Devil and Hero]. Their names are titular of their roles. During each episode, humanity attains a new invention that may better life [e.g. new farming techniques, agriculture]; and during each episode, a mild time skip is applied [typically a few months]. What does this do? It advances the plot. But does it do anything more than that? Probably not. Is it bad because it's simple? Not necessarily. Is it bad if they advance the plot over developing the characters/mood/every other aspect of the show? Probably. \\n\\n\r\nA certain series revolving around a travelling merchant and a wolf goddess revolved around the characters -- every episode moved at a snail's pace, and the characters were developed accordingly; in Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha, it isn't uncommon for several months to move in one episode. The characters aren't developed. There's a romance between Maou and Yuusha. But the romance between the two are magnetic. They're only together for the storyline. A magnet doesn't need a reason to attract the opposite charge, neither does Maou to Yuusha, and Yuusha to Maou. They're together, but there's no semblance or inclination that would insinuate anything outside of being together for the storyline. Love? What's that. 12 episodes, or several years, resulted in a half-assed display of affection at the end. No discourse implying anything significant, and no actions outside the cursory depicted a sort of love outside of obligation. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha was fantastic? You mean the art and animation during Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha's first episode was fantastic. Arms was tasked with animating the series -- Arms did a really nice job during the former half of the series. The latter half, they kinda just gave up on maintaining consistent quality. Surprisingly, Arms, a studio, known for their integration of ecchi into everything, didn't put that much ecchi into Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha. That's a bright side. How about the soundtrack? The soundtrack's probably one of the best, redeeming features of the series. The track titled 'Beyond the Hill' by Takeshi Hama [composer of the original Devil May Cry soundtrack]would on its own, bump the score up by at least a point. The series contained a fantastic soundtrack, albeit, it wasn't exactly applied that well. The general soundtrack is perhaps one of the few things that Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha does better than its related series. It may not have been used as well [the soundtrack in the former was heavily ambient, but that ambience was integral in developing the mood], but it's certainly noteworthy [the main theme really is good]. \\n\\n\r\nSo, we're given a series with generic characters that are seldom developed, the noble goal to save the world, time skips for plot, alongside a fantastic soundtrack, inconsistent animation, and a predictable, archetypal plot progression. Oh, and don't forget the romance. Everybody loves romance. So to sum it up, we're given a series that attempts to do too much within 12 episodes, that's understandable right? Well, it probably would be if it attempted to do something difficult. Every other development and concept explored in Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha isn't exactly novel, or avant-garde; it's not even a rendition of generic concepts. They're really just generic concepts without any sort of application. Economics? Spice and Wolf had more economics within a single episode than this did in 12. The notion that opposite sides often have a lot in common and that they probably shouldn't kill each other? That's clearly edgy and new. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not as enjoyable as it could be to watch because the series tried to do too much. When you introduce a romance, actually develop it. When you attempt to mirror a similar series, at least compliment it. The series doesn't revolve around combat and the mechanics of the world? Then don't dedicate an entire episode to combat. There wasn't enough time to do what we wanted? Then don't do so much.",

So when you watch this series you are more likely to encounter economic dilemmas that intend to solve or ruin people's lives. Whats the point you ask? well for us maybe there is none or maybe they just wanted to show us how hard it was living back then. \r\nAfter this you have a nice romance story evolving on the background of a war that is not based on conquest but on survival. All these while adding various comedy scenesto release some of the tension you've built up until then.\\n\\n\r\nIt has always been a pleasure for me watching strategy based decision turn the tide of a war which seems to happen often, decisions possible only through the courage of many.\\n\r\nAlso seeing many people profit from the little or large schemes they've come up with also provides good amounts of amusement for me only to see them fail miserably or end up unable to enjoy the spoils.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you have a thing for medieval warfare this series is a very good example.\\n\r\nAt certain points I disliked the artwork but perhaps I was asking too much, still I believe we can overlook some flaws for the sake of a good story.\\n",

The hero is the stereotypical fighter with a strong belief in justice and a kind heart. But you love him almost instantly because he's not brash, only a little reckless, and willing to learn whatever he doesn't know. The Demon Queen (the other protagonist) is intelligent, calculating, and strangely naive when it comes to men and relationships. She's totally funny, too, because you never knowwhat she's going to say or do next. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Spice and Wolf, you'll enjoy this. This fantasy makes you think--about agriculture, economy, politics and what motivates people. But it's entertaining as well. I'm five episodes in and it's fast becoming a favorite. \\n\\n\r\nBut, like I said, if you're looking for an anime where the hero brashly rushes in to slay the dragon and rescue the damsel in distress...yeah, you're probably not going to like it much.

            "content": "Story about the hero who kills the demon king is become classic or maybe mainstream story for all of us, Usually we see this concepts in video games or maybe films. but what if the hero become a partner with demon king itself for the peace of the world?\r\nA short explanation above is maybe enough to describe what this anime about, but if you think this anime was like any adventure romance anime, then you're totally wrong. The story from this anime itself is kinda complex for some people. why? this anime was not about slash-and-kill or lovey-dovey things (its not like SAO), but itsmore deep than that. You will see a lot of dialogue dan less action, so whats so good about this anime if an adventure is less action and more dialogue? for me, is the details for the concept to anime itself.\\n\\n\r\n[contains minor spoiler]\\n\r\nThe meaning of details that i said before is about explaining the whole things that happen in the anime itself, in this anime were focussing on HOW to bring the peace. i give a suppresion on HOW because many of the scene were focussing on this, like about how standard farming practice for boosting the food production can be useful to bring a peace (I am not gonna spoil it why it can like that), its not like any typical adventure action anime which battle is always the best way to bring the peace. If i can compare, then this anime was more like using \"soft\" way than coersive way to bring peace. Its make this anime more \"rich\" than any adventure anime. [end spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nThe course of this story is more proggresing which means its more about the present and not to take many backflash or past of each character and more, the story goes fast (time-skips), and for me its really a good thinking, since it will take many times and hamper the storyline, after all, this anime was an adventure which focussing on \"how to achieve the goal\". But, of course there was a consequence for not bring the past, it will makes us (the viewer) hard to get attached with the main character (as we know, the first impression of the hero (Yuusha) is like a doll for achieving the demon king (Maou) goal, its make the Hero is not so appealing for us) and more,  we didnt really know who our main character is, which make us more harder to get attached. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite of all that potentials, that there is something that makes this anime is become more \"cheapo\", beside of all that serious matters become useless with useless  jokes and unnecessary fanservice (bouncing, any kinds like that) but its forgiveable since as we know ARMS, known as the H-anime and Ecchi anime (Samurai girls and Himawari) and we cant ignore they make some good anime (like Elfen Lied). Its not like i hate fanservice but sometimes this anime was more prominent in Maou's boobs, honestly i more prefer something like Spice and Wolf which is same as like this anime (Maoyuu Maou Yuusha), they more focussing on storyline than fanservices.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art and sound, there isnt something really amazing. Focus on the art first, pale coloring that they used in Maoyuu Maou Yuusha were really present the medieval era, it really blends well with the scenery and the background. But, at the sometimes, people who arent used in medieval setting will find it dull and boring. But for those who had watching something like this before (like Spice and wold) will find this were interesting. and for the sound section, the only one i aware was the opening song \"Yohko - Mukai Kaze\", its a good song and yet its quite attaching.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime isnt finished airing until i write this review, i cant conclude yet if this anime were good or not, but as far i have seen until now (episode 5) , i find this anime is quite catchy yet i realize this anime was not-for-all-anime since some of people will find it boring since so many dialogues, but i recommend this one for  those who appreciate a good and deep story",

            "content": "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha has an interesting concept. It takes a look at economic and social issues during a medieval themed period, and it focuses on the \"behind the scenes\" sort of events. Again, it's an interesting concept, and at times I really liked it a lot. The ending was very disappointing, and it dropped my opinion of it dramatically. I simply want to warn that this story really doesn't have an ending and will most likely leave you expecting more (notice I didn't say wanting, but expecting). I did like this story (I figured I should say that much). I did look forward to iteach week, and I was intrigued by the concept. I wonder if I was more intrigued by my speculation of where it was going as opposed to where the story actually went. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the basics. It looked good so I can't complain there. The music was ok, not very memorable, but it worked. The voice acting was good (probably one of it's strongest points). I did like all of the basic details, and I don't feel it really let me down in any of these areas. The problem is that it attempted to create a fantasy tale that wasn't a fantasy tale. There were demons, knights, mages, castles, kingdoms, and churches. There was a long standing war that was at the center of this story as well. Holy crusades are talked about during this story. Detach yourself from these facts immediately. They are simply background to what is actually taking place. What you get with Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is a love story between a superhuman and a demon that are attempting to end their war (long term mind you) by correcting the social, economic, and political issues of their time. The methods they choose are the story. It's not much of one, but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the lack of something substantial, this story is interesting. I enjoyed watching the demons introduce new ideas and technologies to a world full of dumbfounded sheep-like people. It had a lot of good moments, but the story was ultimately flawed. I made a lot of speculation during my viewing of the show that probably carried over into my opinion. This is not an extremely exciting nor a game changing anime series. It does have some good things to offer, but do beware that it is filled with a lot of plot holes and bad logic. The potential is there, but it is never fully realized, so I feel it should have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the best part of this show... the characters. So what if it's filled with stereotypical fantasy characters. I liked the characters in this series. I enjoyed the weird love story that was in there too. I wanted to see different events transpire, and I wanted to see a little more of the action, but we don't get too see too much of that. There's a lot of setup and not a lot of execution, but the characters are still fun to watch regardless. \\n\\n\r\nThere's mild relationship humor and some interesting friendships are born throughout the journey. It's filled with character interaction and reaction. It's the reactionary behavior that I enjoyed the most. The self conscious main characters with low self esteem created a sort of fun awkwardness that I thought brightened the show. Without that, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.\\n\\n\r\nI know I have both rued and complimented this series, but my overall feelings are that this was interesting, yet it was very flawed. It is a 7 for me, even though I was left a little confused as to my reasoning. Sometimes liking something doesn't have to make perfect sense, and this series is an example of that for me. With only 12 episodes it's an easy watch, and I do recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nThough I think it's worth watching, it is hard to say who exactly will like it or hate it. Some people will like it because it's different, while others will hang on its many flaws. All in all, I suggest you try a couple of episodes to get a feel for the story, and if you don't like it after the first couple of episodes then you probably won't like it at all. Do expect a lot of dialogue, and do expect to watch more of the mundane than you may be used to.",

            "content": "It goes without saying that life seems more enjoyable when those around you share similar traits, but more importantly, Interests. In anime, many shows of whichever genre they derive from are often formulaic; many of which the stories of each share common and highly similar premises and themes. Unfortunately, this tires many dedicated fans of such genres and leads to a \"I've seen this all happen before..\" Kind of situation when watching or reading one such story.\r\nMaoyuu Maou Yuusha appears to be no more than your typical \"fantasy\" taking place in medieval-ish times with a few hints of modern ideas floating about and incorporated intocivilization. However, my initial thoughts and expectations excitingly shot down and I came to love Maoyuu Maou Yuusha a great deal. While the score may not show it, it is highly enjoyable despite its shortcomings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it all shines.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins in an all too familiar setting of many fantasy-like stories; a Continent/land divided into multiple factions/countries/nations etc. Much to my chagrin, initially, the story did come off as formulaic with some chosen hero ready to fight off the \"evil\" of his world to obtain years of peace to come... \\n\\n\r\nAt least, That's what I thought for the first seven minutes of the first episode...\\n\\n\r\nYes, our story starts with the unison of what seems to defy all preconceptions of good and evil. A hero who comes to behead the \"evil\" Demon king joins her instead. This is where it all gets interesting.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many officially aired shows I've thus far seen, few have actually depicted the \"evil\" side as not so horrid as they are made out to be. While this idea isn't new, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha takes this premise and refreshingly tells the tale through a more romantic tale of our Hero and a Demon King whose beauty is as pure as the colored Crimson of her whole appearance. The story, instead of solely focusing on the action of things, approaches the viewer with a more complex philosophical (logistics of civilization?) stance on war, reasons for it, and other standpoints you'd not expect. Additionally, the show emphasizes a focus on components that keep civilization going besides war; example being agriculture. Of course for those of you who are in it for the action, you'll find yourself a tad disappointed, but don't worry, it's still there. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is a show that tries to show the viewer all the cogs/gears that make up your view of the demon/human society.\\n\\n\r\nPacing of the show, in terms of speed, seems exponential once momentum starts to take over. Initially, the show is slow paced, trying to establish a setting and differentiating the initial preconceptions of conflict and the \"Good vs Evil\" dealio. After that is established, the show is a tad too fast for its own good, but still paces itself accordingly from the rising action into the climax of the story. If you're not a fan of unforeseen time skips from episode to episode, you might feel a tad uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nMoving along, the story itself, as mentioned before, is unique in its own right, even if the premise has been done before. Admittedly, at times it feels as though too much seems to be happening at once I the later development of the overall plot. At times, I feel the plot got a tad complicated and I didn't understand fully what was going on. On a brighter note, the story has many moving moments and the creativity of the story is almost boundless, and the show isn't obviously predictable nor too outrageous.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't bad, more on the good side of things. It simply can be hard to get into due to common preconceptions of \"evil vs good\" and some other little holes that don't seem to add up, example being an establishment of how the humans view the demons. It is much easier to come into this show with an open mind as  you'll find that the characters and civilization aren't all that relatable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are nothing fancy, nor ugly or dull. The art more or less seems to be a bit half-baked at times, but there are benefits to a simplistic approach in terms of design, detail, and animation. For starters, the show is easy on the eyes, and the characters are still easily identifiable and even attractive. Background wise, nothing is extraordinarily outstanding or horridly misconfigured. The animation is sometimes choppy, but annoyingly so. The art is just a head above average, and arguably, that's all it really needs to be. After all, the art isn't where the show really shines.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\\n\r\nNothing spectacular and memorable comes to mind in the soundtrack nor the character's voicing. The Opening sequence is pretty catchy, and the Ending can be hit or miss. On a brighter note, everything fits the situation, and I really couldn't ask for more since, again, this isn't where the show really shines. Sure, it could have been better, but it could have been far worse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I really wanted more, I wanted to delve into the pasts and the vast experiences that make up how the characters came to be. Our protagonists are well developed to a degree, but I felt a lack of any real significant change in many, this includes Maou and the hero. That said it isn't all that bad even if only fragments of our characters' pasts actually reveals a small degree of the character themselves. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, much more emphasis is placed on the story's focus on the necessary components that support and make up the demon and human civilization. Whether it be more beneficial than harmful, the supporting characters and mains themselves serve as symbols that represent each influential component of civilization, so it is arguable that the characters served their purpose. Of course, this isn't true when things get a tad lovey-dovey. It's simply unfortunate that many stories with broad casts seem to suffer familiar consequences.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite my little rants, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha was well worth the watch. I felt a sense of originality and got excited over this fact. The show had components excepted of the fantasy genre; romance and action included, the show tried to portray the best of these while trying to keep the story original and entertaining. To my delight, this was a success and I have no real issues with the show besides the show's episode count which did put me in an awkward mood in the end. Had a more satisfying ending been drawn, this could have gone down as an all time favorite, but alas, the world is cruel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it's well worth a run through. Would I rewatch this? Probably not. If you're looking for something unique and original, you'll find this story to be a delightful one. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a must watch, but It definitely deserves much needed recognition.\\n\\n\r\nHope this was helpful.",

Newer style if you are looking for something old school like older anime art then you are not obviously going to findit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't exactly remember there being something wrong with the sound or so but picking the music for certain part could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nDemon being demon who does good while hero being hero whose task is to fight, nothing else to say\\n\\n\r\nAbout enjoyment, it was marked as a romance, I cannot exactly say it's a romance because they didn't see each other exactly much and during that time hero was just being childish or so, rejecting. So getting that vibe of anime including romance was hard.\\n\\n\r\nBut in general a great anime, teaches new things, mostly economics and equality that difference is part of being unique that fighting is bad for both sides, and that everything is controlled by bigger parties.",

            "content": "I'll be short. I've gone into this show at first with great hopes. It was quite hyped and seemed the most original pick of the season. The very idea of a Demon King and a Hero signing an alliance to put an end to the reliance of the world's economy on eternal war was original and interesting. So what did go wrong?\r\nBasically, everything.\r\nThe final result is a unique example of total blandness. This anime is, there's no other way to put it, boring. Horribly so. The characters are generic as they can be, starting with the Demon King, who's got bouncy boobs and is inexplicablyin love with the Hero since when he was a newborn, and continuing with the Hero himself (a walking Deus Ex Machina), the Head Maid, every single villain, and on, and on. The story is aimless: there's a bit of plot but it's all serviceable to the thesis of the show, consisting in demonstrating how feudalism is bound to lose its match against mercantilism/capitalism. This is basically the history of Europe in the 16th century, only much more boring, because every invention which changed our style of life springs in some way from the Demon King, who discovers potatoes, corn, the printing press and gunpowder without breaking a sweat. Things happen because they need to, not because it makes sense; whenever some miracle is needed, either the Hero or the Mage pull off some new convenient power, and overall there's never any sense of struggle. This could be excused if the anime was aiming at teaching some relevant economic concept or putting forward some original, compelling thesis. But it does neither, as the economy is trivial and the thesis is even less interesting. I had to watch this series in order to blog it and by the end I hated every moment of it. Don't watch.",

            "content": "The problem with creating a historical anime is frequently similar to that of adapting a manga or video game: oftentimes, the author has to resort to filler or fan-service materials to clumsily meet the airing requirements for shows. However, an axiom that directors ought to familiarize themselves with is that quality is invariably better than quantity.\r\nThankfully, this inference only applies to certain aspects of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, a recent adaptation of the original light novels under the same name.\r\nSet in a time period of gruesome wars to political corruptions, Maoyuu depicts a fantasy world where humans and devils are fighting for the ultimate authority, whileexploring the infrastructures involved in wars. Despite it falling under the fantasy genre, Maoyuu brings many historical references into play--from the great innovations of the Discovery age (such as the compass, movable type prints, etc.) to the spread of crops like potato and corn into the agriculture industry. Moreover, it is reminiscent of a certain series that many of us could've never forgotten--Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nBetter known for its formula of enchanting romance, Spice and Wolf consists of a very similar antique structure in the way that it handles its plot, drama, world-building, and specifically, the daily lives of merchants. While this may sound bland, Spice and Wolf manages to make it work with a recipe of individual arcs for concentrated purposes, and thus, the viewer can gain a fine viewing of diverse episodes with several delightful, piquant subjects at hand.\\n\\n\r\nIf Spice and Wolf is a mix between curry and rice, then Maoyuu would surely be a mix between potatoes and candy bars; since, it is neither a smart combination nor a completely satisfying experience. Still, it's only in comparison that one is weaker than the other. The steady, episodic approach that Maoyuu employs very much stands out on its own.\\n\\n\r\nA scaffolding plot, after all, is better than none at all. The story of Maoyuu starts out with our protagonist Yuusha, a hero siding with the humans, not expecting the beautiful demon queen Maou, whose only wish was to negotiate with him, in the heart of the demons' castle. After their fated meeting, Yuusha then embarks on a journey at Maou's will, and each episode continues with mini-stories about Yuusha's encounters and findings for a seemingly nonexistent reason.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas, it is fairly obvious from the start that Yuusha has difficulties conveying his true intentions for Maou, and oftentimes these misunderstandings are used for comedic purposes as well as entertainment. Although repetitive, the several quirks that Maou and Yuusha begin to form do add onto the character interaction, and definitely made certain arcs more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, side characters do abruptly intervene in the capital of romance arcs, usually with very few good reasons for doing so, and thus, some developments can turn out stagnantly without progression. Most side characters also have very little to offer, ranging from a delusive maid to female knights like Onna Kishi. At times, female characters would surround Yuusha in herds, and it becomes questionable whether or not pandering to the audiences was the purpose. And, although some characters were satisfyingly fleshed out with conclusive stories, other individuals had trouble deciphering their prominent role in the series. Such abstruse matters also bring up the lack of characterization or any predisposition to determine the presence of a solid personality for specific characters, since most of the cast only experience trite developments.\\n\\n\r\nMaou, for example, is best described by her acquaintance as \"useless meat\". Although Maou herself denies this, and claims at all costs the significant deeds that she has achieved and will, the fact of the matter remains that her role embodies a few inconsistent hiccups. At times, she continuously aims to resolve world peace, while the scenes which repeatedly follow her scholarly deliberations are abruptly placed daydreams of Yuusha. Such applies to the grander scale of Maoyuu as it deconstructs historical figures and side characters to bring concerns about the time period being depicted--the medieval ages. Contrarily, the portrayal of the church's public servants during prehistoric times may have exaggerated some of the exploitations, but Maoyuu does extensively illustrate the corruption which overtook officials of feudal societies. Additionally, a charming aspect of Maoyuu resides with how the characters were named after fantasy classes, which effortlessly resonated a lovely core. However, due its enormous cast, Maoyuu couldn\u2019t engender insightful eccentricities for certain characters as it did for others.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the character aesthetics in the series stuck with genuinely dull decorations as exemplified by Yuusha, whose character design emits the appeals of a generic, immutable male lead. Similarly, Maou has her own pairs of inflatable balloon issues, which many will see as being hackneyed and unoriginal. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art directing, layouts for many of the map animations and arrangement of urban images are, in comparison, much better. Correspondingly, majority of the background frameworks and presentations also fulfill their duty in making a location look rural, metropolitan, or even appropriately hideous.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is undoubtedly one of Maoyuu's greatest assets. The original soundtrack entrances viewers with its vibrant nature, and likewise, the use of many instrumental pieces evokes an indelible atmosphere. With a spirited opening and ending theme, Maoyuu further enlivens its vigor. Correlation between the animation and music also paints an impressionable feeling for the series overall, and the seiyuus all befit their roles perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nOn the contrary, good narration doesn\u2019t necessarily equal quality dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the conversations in the series do present interesting observations about macroeconomics, some expositions on the networks of commerce can come off as brusque. Not only so, Maoyuu emphatically focuses on the construction of its own fantasy world, rather than the chronological order of its historical references, so some of the mentioned inventions furnish idealized timelines over what's factually correct. This, in turn, produces temporarily engrossing world-building, but it can also repeatedly bore or confuse the viewer with arbitrary elaborations on ultimately flimsy subjects.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the tone of my writing, it may sound like the majority of Maoyuu is about monotonous history or economics; however, during the latter parts of the series character relationships take center stage, and action scenes transpire more often. As most climaxes do, the story delivers a closing end towards previously unresolved issues, and desolating sides of things take form in both dialogues as well as battles. This, in some ways, may dismay some audiences since the pacing relatively changes, but as a closure, many aspects of the show become a lot more tasteful and digestible even in spite of the several interrelated topics displayed.\\n\\n\r\nModerately diverse, Maoyuu is a series that really tries to bring something to the table for everyone, and in its mixture of historical references with fantasy themes, some of its themes are marred by oversimplified explanations. Although the stale, generic personalities some characters exhibit are very definite flaws, the majority of Maoyuu can still offer insights on the economic and strategic aspects of war, which shifts towards a manner infrequently attempted in its medium. It is most unfortunate, then, that this unique concept lacks the excitement its influences (Spice & Wolf) had obtained so gracefully. Perhaps if given a second season, the lackluster aspects of Maoyuu can do itself more justice through more concise yet lively handling of its themes, and its character relationships may become even more captivating. If nothing else, this series provides a fascinating outlook on the protocols and systems of commercial economics, but sadly, is a hero crippled by his towering boldness of attempting too many feats. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its unfortunate flaws, Maoyuu can still compensate for its faults by further constructing its dynamic universe, but only if a sequel will be permitted to fully execute the conceptual values.",

            "content": "The success of \"Spice and Wolf\" probably came as a surprise to most. Who'd have thought a dialogue-heavy fantasy anime about economics on the surface but powered by the character chemistry underneath would sell, right? But sell it did, and some people must have extrapolated that there's a under-tapped market for such an anime, because the next thing you know, along comes \"Maoyu Maou Yusha\", a show so blatantly similar to \"Spice and Wolf\" (the fantasy settings, the economic lectures, moe heroine sporting ginger hair and unusual strength of character and intelligence, etc etc) that people immediately started labelling it \"Spice and Wolf with Tits\".If you're wondering where the \"tits\" part comes in, it's probably because some people also speculated that the \"Spice and Wolf\" formula could be improved upon by providing the heroine with a pair of giant knockers to shake around in front of the screen at every opportunity.  \\n\\n\nBut an improvement it ain't. And by sharing so many things with \"Spice and Wolf\" (including a big chunk of the staff),  \"Spice and Wolf with Tits\" - or just SaWT for short - naturally invites comparisons with the material that inspired it. Alas, it's a comparison which ultimately does SaWT no favours because it falls so far short. But perhaps I'm being overly harsh on the show; it does deserve plaudits for putting some interesting twists into the age-old humans vs demons script. \\n\\n\nThe show starts with humans and demons at war with each other, and the Hero - literally named \"Hero\" - storming the demon king's castle solo to try and end the war. The demon king (and guess what the demon king is called) surprisingly turned out to be an attractive girl with big bouncy breasts instead of a giant frothing monster with razor fangs. What also surprised Hero was her personality: she spoke a remarkable amount of sense, and, with a few well-chosen arguments, demolished the pre-conceptions the Hero had regarding humans, demons, and the nature of the war. Bewitched by Demon King's silver tongue and hypnotised by her jiggling assets, Hero agrees to co-operate with her mission to set the world to rights with wisdom rather than wars. \\n\\n\nSaWT started a little rough, but its concept got me interested enough to continue watching. Most of the first half helped maintain my interest, mostly with the way Demon King went about changing the world through her learning, introducing new technologies, new methods of doing things and new ways of thinking. And it's this, and not the interaction between the main leads that's the focus of SaWT. But that's not a bad thing, because while the nuanced interaction between the protagonists excels as one of the greatest strengths of \"Spice and Wolf\", that same aspect is one of greatest weaknesses of SaWT. I realise things are supposed to be a bit awkward between the ridiculously shy leads, but the insipid small-talk and overblown romance cliches is a combination cringe-worthy enough to embarrass a third-rate romance novelist.\\n\\n\nWhile showing some initial promise, the show soon started falling apart. SaWT has a major problem of being overly self-conscious of what it's trying to do, and thus very little of what it does feels natural. Speeches about the ways of the world is almost condescendingly delivered through long expositions that's aimed more at the viewer than the other characters. Then there are Demon King's inventions: she starts off introducing things like crop rotations methods, but soon began inventing one major technology after another, like some kind of Thomas Edison raised to the third power. What's more, her contributions span across ludicrously diverse fields, from agriculture to medical science to navigation, just to name a few; nearly every episode she conjures up something new. In one episode, someone other than her actually managed to invent something (namely, sparkling orange juice, aka Fanta), and, determined not to be outdone, Demon King invents not one but TWO things during that episode (and no, Coke isn't one of them). By the half way point of the series, I felt like I was watching a game like \"Civilization\" being played, with the Demon King way ahead of the other players in researching the tech tree comprising mankind's greatest ideas and inventions.\\n\\n\nIf Demon King is guilty of over-performing in her role, Hero is guilty of the opposite: as one half of the central protagonist pair, he simply doesn't carry his weight. While Demon King busied herself with changing the world, Hero spends the first half just tagging along and doing very little beyond admiring her. Though later on he does goes off to distant lands and contribute to Demon King's plans there, we rarely see what he does because the story is still mostly focused on Demon King and her endless output of inventions. In fact, the imbalance issue extends to everyone else, too: the Demon King seems so intelligent that she makes the show kind of boring, and everyone else appear so dim that they can't do anything until Demon King bestows onto them her pearls of wisdom; you have to wonder how the human race managed to hold off extinction before the Demon King came along.\\n\\n\nSaWT also has pacing problems. I enjoyed the gentle strolling pace of world changing used for the first part of the series, but the global politics quickly escalated to the point where I struggled to follow. Everything began changing in all the nations, half of which the show failed to properly establish in the first place; I'd also started getting lost in all the economic babble, perhaps owing to my own meagre knowledge. The show simply accelerates away during the later parts and finishes in unseemly haste, leaving one giant political mess, full of dangling plot strands and badly explained developments, in its wake.\\n\\n\nBut there I go again, coming down quite hard on the show. I do have a degree of respect for what SaWT tried to do, but the problem is that it simply did not do a good job. While it captured my interest early on, I struggled to get through the series as it progressed. It may not be a show devoid of intelligence, but it needed to be more intelligently written; it may not be a bad show, but it's far from being good. I guess it's just too much to expect a show that sought to improve upon something noted for its writing by throwing in a pair of big tits to amount to anything beyond A Good Try. And A Good Try is all SaWT managed to be.\\n\\n\\n\nPersonal rating: -0.5 (mediocre)\\n",

            "content": "Fantasy isn't quite like it used to be nowadays, or at least it doesn't want to be. Tolkien-like stories of great heroes and their adventures in the world inspired by Medieval are considered old news; now fantasy likes to be dark, edgy and bitter, showing the \"true rough nature\" of the world. There are good examples of such \"mature\" fantasy, the Witcher, for example, much as I dislike its focus on angst over substance. Often, though, it just comes down to buckets of blood and a lot of sex scenes (yeah, so mature) with no depth to it.\r\nThis anime's take on modern fantasy and overallMedieval is different and much more appealing, to me, at least. Oh, it doesn't hesitate to show how rough it can be but it chooses to introduce economics into its world. The premise is that demons are at war with humans, and finally a hero with three sidekicks gets close to stopping the war (of course he does, it's the plot of any party-based RPG ever) and heads off to kill the Satan. Who turns out to hate war herself and, in turn, tells him she actually wants to stop the war. He agrees to help her, and the rest of the show more or less focuses on her plans and their consequences.\\n\\n\r\nMost of these plans revolve around reforming agriculture, economics and so on. In the beginning it felt similar to Spice and Wolf: there are two main characters falling in love, the female is going to introduce some clever schemes, the atmosphere is equally warm, even the two leads are played by the same actors. However, Maou's ideas are all pretty simple, the intrigue comes not from the plans themselves but from the effect they have on people and, ultimately, on the country. The plot is coherent but seems to be episodic at times, partially because of the inevitable time jumps, as such reforms require time to actually take effect. \\n\\n\r\nThis one is difficult to talk about, for it's really hard to point out one single element that makes the anime good; it's mostly the little touches. For example, I really enjoyed watching the Hero for many reasons, one of them being that he asks an interesting question: what is there for a hero to do after the war has concluded? He won, awesome, so what's next? This character seeks peace to begin with, and his interactions with Maou only serve to keep him on this path, while he actually can only function in times of war. The question of what war means to different people is an interesting one, and it's explored from different angles throughout the show. There is no clear answer, though, which might irritate people; me, personally, I hate when such questions get a clear answer, ambiguity is what makes the topic interesting to begin with. Many issues are addressed, some in a rather unusual light; for example, merchants tend to place profit before everything else - is this bad? Not necessarily, as this series suggests, one character was turned from an obvious and boring \"heartless douche\" type almost into someone to root for without any real change whatsoever. I have actually thought of a thing to praise here: the writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are good when they are given enough time to shine, I'd like to see more of the Mage with her split personality (for once, it's not a villain who has it), for example. Maou is interesting in that she's clearly wise and cunning but still childish and innocent, which overall makes her all the more appealing. Yuusha is pretty lighthearted and not that smart, though intelligent enough to understand his problems and limited usefulness; to his credit, he doesn't fall into angst, he always tries to help people. So, yeah, he's the Hero, no real surprise there. There obviously is a romance between these two (as usual with the characters voiced by these actors - Lelouch and Kallen, Lawrence and Horo), there is even a love triangle with the Knight lady, though this is the weakest part of the show. Don't get me wrong, the main couple's interactions are mostly nice but it leads to many unnecessary moments, like, say, discussions of boobs, which is always classy. It doesn't feature fanservice, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast consists of a variety of characters, some of which evolve throughout the series, others are interesting as they are. There are, of course, those who mostly serve as a throwaway joke or are ultimately pointless (the Old Man, the little servant girl, the Dragon Princess) but they almost always are there to complement someone else's personality, so it's not distracting. In the end, they do reflect the world they live in and present interesting possibilities for the writers to take advantage of. More than enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the score both serve to reinforce the aforementioned warm atmosphere and yeah, they work. It's not the sharp drawing style I usually enjoy but it's justified here. Everyone looks unique, particularly Maou, who is not drawn like your usual anime nice girl but instead opts for a more mild kind of beauty, which is refreshing in a female lead. The voice acting is awesome: practically all significant characters are voiced by someone whom I have heard and liked before (be it in Code Geass or Rozen Maiden), and they do a good job here too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the show. Yeah, it doesn't really pay off in terms of the romance, and the story can feel somewhat unfinished, particularly with the ending being only semi-happy but I really like to see real world economics and serious issues like cultural diversity being brought into fantasy world. It makes for an intelligent plotline with believable outcomes for all actions and allows the creators to show how Medieval actually progressed. This is what I'm going to think of now when I think \"Modern Fantasy\". A great anime.",

            "content": "So begins the journey...\r\nIn any fantasy world, some beings just don't get along. Take for example, demons and humans. In order for two races to co-exist, they have to accept each others' values. Yet that dream is an overwhelming task to achieve because let's all face it, some things just don't mix well. It's been fifteen years since the war waged by the humans and demons have begun. After an awkward meeting and the revelation that the Demon King is in fact a female, the duo forms an alliance after some reluctant arguing. Hence, let the tale of a human male and demon female begin!\r\nMayou(Maoyu Maou Yusha, aka Archenemy and Hero) is an anime adapted series from a light novel that was originally \u201cserialized\u201d on 2ch. The series is written by Mamare Touno who is not well known but has recently made his debut. The LN has sold over 450,000 copies and here we are, the anime adaptation. As one of the first full length series to debut in 2013, it definitely needed to set the bar high. So without further ado, let's see if Maoyu lived up to the hype.\\n\\n\r\nMaoyu follows the story of a hero and queen of demons as they seemingly join forces to bring about a new world. They desire a world of peace, a world without conflict, and a world where values and ideas are accepted without violence. The series begins with a lot of promise as in the format of a preview as to what's to come. In fact, our two main characters (from the poster) takes up most of the tv time as they engage in humorous dialogues and discusses their ways of changing the world. It is actually quite fresh and entertaining as viewers can see that the demons and humans are not so different. For instance, the demons themselves has their own code of ethnics and politics. They have their own ideologies and ways of thinking. To top it off, they also don't have actual or maybe I should say..physical features in the way some people may originally see them as. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, the series takes off with strange tropes and turns it into a rather refreshing series at first. I mean, we have an ordinary human and meets a not-so-ordinary demon king. Hero also gets a surprise from the fact that the Demon Queen is actually a female rather than what he originally expected. (a rather big breasted one if I may add...) The Demon Queen herself is shown to be not violent but rather trying to persuasive for her goals. It also sets up a state of prejudice at first between the races but as time goes on, it's shown that the duo can get along quite well. Even from the pilot episode, Hero seems convinced enough to join the Demon Queen despite her rather sophisticated dialogues. The dialogues themselves contains lengthy references to politics, economics, and a historical lesson rather than any violent backgrounds. In a entertaining way, it transforms the tale of struggle between humans and demons into a story of that almost seems to be educational at times. It's almost like watching the fantasy version of the Discovery Channel as the Demon Queen educates about trading and her ways of inventions.\\n\\n\r\nThe series maintains as a small cast of characters. Obviously, we have the two main stars of the series, Maou and Yuusha. They often go by their titles, Demon Queen and Hero respectively. In fact, many of the supporting cast seems to follow this trend. We have Onna Kishi known as the Female Knight, Onna Mahoutsukai known as the Female Magician, etc. Their names matches their respective titles and defines the role they play in. But perhaps the most interesting relationship in the series is between Hero and the Demon Queen. This is because they are nearly nothing alike, even in terms of being the same race. Hero seems to be a guy of using action rather than words of persuasion. On the other hand, Demon Queen seems to play the role of a politician and uses her intelligence. Yet upon closer examination, they get along quite well and intimate at times. This brings a problem of their relationship being too rushed. As a matter of fact, there is strong hints of romance between the duo already after the initial episode. To add to this relationship is a strong dose of fan service. The term \u201cuseless meat\u201d becomes a recurring joke for the Demon Queen as she takes on the role of an eye candy. With or without horns, she retains her stature as a female that seems to allure viewers. This shouldn't come too much as as surprise though as the production studio Arms handles the series. Arms is known for its rough and sketchy ways of presenting fan service such as in Elfen Lied, Ikkitousen, and Queen's Blade. Their stance of producing lascivious visuals has been a long standing trend. In this case, Maoyu isn't off their charts.\\n\\n\r\nAs being labeled as an adventure genre, the series takes the fantasy theme well. There are the old medieval like architectures and maintains that feeling of being in a fantasy world. The way the characters are dressed reflects this theme of being in simple wear in the case of servants, modern in the case of the maids, and fancy in the case of high level authority figures. Hero's design sees him as a warrior and 'hero' as the title suggests him. On the other hand, there is Demon Queen who is dressed in an ornamental way that is elaborate and eye-catching. Unfortunately, some of her appearance is played as a joke like the \u201chorns\u201d on her hand and once again, the useless meat. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of useless, I find the fan service of this series to be just that. Even with the light humor, romance, and sweet moments, I find the fan service part of the series to be in the way and preventing Maoyu to shine itself. It is distracting and seems manipulative in some of the sweet dialogues that moves away the balance. \\n\\n\r\nOther problems I've ran in to the series is the rather weak story based off the original premise. Some of the preceding episodes from the narrative prequel pilot almost seems like filler. It doesn't also help the fact that some of the jokes made throughout the series becomes a bit stale. Furthermore, Hero seems to attract other female characters of interest and creating some unfriendly rivalry for our Demon Queen. It falls under a track of insubstantial romance with a seemingly love triangle between her, Hero, and the Female Knight. \\n\\n\r\nMaoyu also seems to adapt many of the same themes as another popular title that debuted a few years back. Fans of Spice and Wolf may notice many similarities such as the adventure style storytelling, theme of economics, fantasy setting, and even the main female protagonist shares the same seiyuu. It can make an impression for viewers who once again desire a taste of economics and adventure rather than the typical \u201csave the world with swords and magic\u201d. It does have some of that though but the majority of the series focuses more on the politics, economics, and the interactions between the Hero/Demon Queen.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, the series did its job right. Despite some of the characters being serialized with the fan-service and presented in a gratuitous way, it maintains its background of the fantasy setting well. There is the elaborate landscapes, the majestic rivers, and plain rural backgrounds. The way the characters are dressed reflects off that old and classic feeling from the Dark Ages. It's the way that an adventure should be and maintains that theme well. At times though, it does look like the visual qualities of the show slows down. Yet, it maintain its fantasy posture well. \\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack, I found the series to be only mediocre. Toshiki Kameyama plays the role of the sound director and he seems to give that feeling of smoothness and melody of the medieval ages. However, it is hardly noticeable or distinguishing itself from other fantasy theme series. The OP and ED songs also presents a style of primitive artwork in the style of the old medieval ages. It is just too simple and not unique enough in my estimation.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Maoyu is an adventure series that I have mixed feelings on. From one standpoint, it is a fun and entertaining series with our lovable duo. Their interactions and dialogues makes a first impression but that later becomes repetitive and stale. The way fan service is presented becomes a source of diversion rather than some comedic fun. It is comedic in some ways though but ultimately, it doesn't achieve its goal. However, there are instances where the series launches itself with its fresh way of adventure story. It is a story about a Hero, a Demon Queen, and the plan they hope to achieve in order to make the world a better place. I just hope they succeed and achieve glory for what they strive for. \\n",

            "content": "This season seemed to lack a lot of luster for me till i saw the picture for this anime that stirred my curiosity. After watching the first half of this anime i already know where it intends to go and i can see the increase and quality every episode.\r\nThe Characters of this anime are all uniquely set in there role and Given names to reflect that. (Eg. Knight,Hero,Mage) I enjoy this method of naming cause it makes everyone really easy to remember and there role apparent from the start. It does away with a lot of formality by establishing the characters early. Then the showcontinues to pepper in details and history's of the characters without having to take up large  gaps of time in flash backs. All the characters seem to fit and act correctly in the settings and keep me personally very entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe two Main characters are both transparent in there intentions and honest in expression. They convey feelings and thoughts to the viewer well with imagery and just body language alone. The Demon King/Crimson Scholar is by far the most showcased and deep character of the series with many ideologies and a innocent quality that does not leave you frustrated with the character. She maintains a well balanced innocence and maturity that keeps her from getting too preachy or too cold which makes you feel invested in her character more and more. The hero himself is not as much yet and you only are set up for more thing as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the anime is fantastic with nice rural and cityscapes. I also like how the demon realm is kept realistic and not fantastical which makes the settings more engrossing. Every character is well made and clearly a individual with nobody looking recycled or reused for lack of inspiration. Everything looks vibrant and really alive in the color tones and the general lighting of scenes. I wish more anime did what this one did when trying to portray a world instead of recycled walk cycle backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound quality is fine for this anime, the one thing id like to praise is the voice acting. There is not a single intolerable voice in this anime. Everyone sounds good and not abrasive or out of place. Even the little girl character who's supposed to be cute and adorable doesn't sound too over the top.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is where it shines brightest, after this first episode you realize this anime does not waste your time with unnecessary back story or plot it cuts out all the generic fat and gets down to business. It gives a clear and precise objective and establishes the main characters well and then it peppers in the details about them organically episode to episode so you actually get to know the character instead of entire episodes dedicated to back story. This also creates interest in many minor and major characters cause your shown bits and pieces of them and you start eagerly wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty intelligent it uses fantasy elements in a almost realistic world only to enhance the story. It  uses these enhancements well too considering how much of the show is based on the politics,economics and public perception on war. Though it uses really mature plot points like that it isn't above normal understanding, the show keeps it easily understandable for anyone.  The show often surprises me with just how unexpected and original it can be with the progression and i am eager to see more of this series every week.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this anime thoroughly and while it may not be a masterpiece it surely is worth a watch if you want to see something new and intelligent instead of rehashed and recycled plots. It is a pity that it will only be 12 episodes long and i hope they develop a second season with just a strong a value as the first.",

            "content": "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is one of those animes where although it is enjoyable to watch there seems to be too many issues to really give it a high recommendation. Maoyuu draws you into its grand plot and characters however they really fail to develop primarily due to it only being a 12 episode anime. \r\nSet in a medieval fantasy world in which the human race and demon race are at war for territory and power, the story follows the human Hero and the female Demon King (They are simply referred to  by these titles) who team together to solve the underlying reasons the war;economics.\\n\\n\r\nThe Demon King can be seen as the brains of the operation and the Hero as a diplomat to some extent. Their idealistic belief to ending war by ending poverty, and advancing technology is quite a grand idea in that it takes time to really make such significant changes. The Demon Kings new ideas and technology such as new farming techniques and promoting education require lengthy periods of time before results are seen. The anime acknowledges this by numerous time skips, almost a year had past by the 4th episode and despite moving the plot forward it resulted in hardly any character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime constantly alludes to this magical world where the Hero is off saving Fairy's and helping Dragon type Demons but never dwells into it. It also begins with an almost instant romance between the Hero and the Busty Demon King but again fails to develop it. The show seems to struggle in deciding what is wants to be. It addressees intellectual themes such as economics, religion and social intolerance. Then flirts around with a love triangle between the Hero, Demon King and the Blonde knight. And while they are enjoyable to watch in the end both themes feel rushed and it it fails to conclusively resolve either. I should also add that the fan service seemed out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons this show is enjoyable is that it has likable characters. I liked the idealistic main characters The Hero and Demon King, they were powerful around others but so confused around each other, i would have liked to see development into their romance rather than just being forced into accepting it, that being said nothing really happened. The rest of the characters all had a purpose with different backgrounds and seemed to fit well into the Demon Kings plan. The majority of characters were human and it would've been great to see things from the Demon perspective.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime is mixed. There were times when the background was just great with detail and color, other times it was like looking at blobs of green and brown supposedly resembling a forest or farm. I found the character design to be pretty good, nothing that set it apart but good nonetheless. Overall its highly watchable since this is a dialogue heavy anime but really average in quality. The same can be said for the sound.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was actually quite enjoyable but i can not recommend an anime that leaves its plot so incomplete. The overall feel to the show is somewhat rushed, it needed more time to invest in the characters and plot. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you ever wondered why there are wars, how the economy goes, political corruptions, lust for power and alike. Then this anime would be for you. A Hero/Warrior made his way through the castle of the Demon lord to confront him. It turns out that the Demon lord was a woman, that needs the help of the hero to reach peace, prosperity, and independence of the people from the support of other countries, and to end pointless wars against the humans and demons.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe plot flow is just perfect. The actions of the characters to the plot is well planned. Hiding from the high officials,and starting new identities, slowly making bonds from different kinds of people(Merchants, Priests/Priestesses, Locals, Generals.). Yet, the story still finds a way to reveal the big problems although everything seemed like all went smoothly. This anime can be related to real life wars nowadays, real life economics. I just can't say the right words for this anime, but it surely does make me view the world in a new way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first i find the animation a bit too crappy for my standards. But as time goes by i noticed that a grew a liking for this kind of animation. I noticed this, mainly maybe because for an anime that took place before the advancements in technology like electricity and such, it just kinda synced with the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAwesome, the background musics were medieval like, matching the plot of the anime. As you listen to the OP/ED, I really felt the aura emanating while watching, we all have those moments, to be honest. Anyways, the sound effects were great, matched and synced perfectly. I admire the voice actors specially when some romantic scenes are made, it just makes me giggle every time, and i mean every time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are well planned. Mages, Warriors, Scholars etc. All of them do what they have to do, a dash of comedy in some parts, and a bit of meaningful words to reflect on in heart warming conversations. And may i add, all the characters here seemed to have a main role in the anime, which i find very amusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the anime. The ideas being pointed out here that can make you think about life of the people nowadays made me enjoy it the most. 1 week is too rough for the next episode, signifying my excitement for the next episode. But as the week goes by, we are already half-way through the series. And i suppose right now, I'm hoping for a second season. If not, then an ending that I'll never forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHey why not a 9/10? Story is outstanding, art matches it's medieval war like setting, characters are well oriented, and can be related to the current events in our human lives. But the better question is, why not a 10/10? Mainly because to give a 10/10 anime, i must first finish the series, giving 9/10's is reserving a space for further improvements in this overwhelming anime.\\n\r\nI'll return soon when the anime is finished airing, and we'll see if this deserves a wopping 10/10 score.",

            "content": "\u201cOriginal and different yet wanting. A well-founded mythological world that reveals a very interesting concept and focus within it, but lacks that something to become something transcending\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\n-STORY: 7-\r\nTo set this show as just a typical adventure/fantasy anime would be a shortsighted description of it; after all, this show has more potential than just that. \u201cMAOYUU\u2026\u201d grasps into things \u2013more complex- such as politics and economics \u2013although they are observed from a very basic and simplistic point of view and nothing more complicated, probably for the sake of the aimed viewers -. But let\u2019s not get carried away, this show isn\u2019t a masterpieceeither, although it has potential to be bigger, by this I mean that the show doesn\u2019t reach its fullest potential but let\u2019s not forget it\u2019s made into a 12 episode format show.\\n\\n\r\nEven though being an original show \u2013mostly by the focus shown- the show falls sometimes into the typical dull and repetitive routine shown in many other shows. Although, the characters make you forget this stalemate and those repetitive moments don\u2019t last long.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 8- \\n\r\nSo to tell the truth, besides the fact that this is a fantasy anime something else caught my attention/interest too, and that \u201csomething\u201d was the art. The art is neither the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d nor something antiquated; it was pleasing to put it bluntly. \\n\r\nNow, the fact that the art in the show is pleasing it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s one of those arts that immerse into the show after all; the art in the show is a mixture of the old \u2013shown mostly on the scenery- and the new \u2013shown mostly on the character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe palette is amazing ranging from dark oriented colors to bright and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe ART team did a remarkable job.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 7-\\n\r\nOne of the main goals of voice acting is to stimulate and transmit feelings through voice and sounds, sadly the voice acting in this show didn\u2019t achieve such a thin., The voice acting isn\u2019t bad, but it isn\u2019t great, it isn\u2019t transcending and thus it isn\u2019t memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a quote by William Shakespeare that says: \u201cIf music be the food of love, play on\u201d. The context in which the character \u2013Duke Orsino- says this words is because he\u2019s infatuated with Olivia, and she\u2019s not interested in him, so he asks his musicians to play some music, so he can surpass -or \u201coverdose\u201d- his appetite and let such feeling \u2013love- die.\\n\r\nMy point here is that there\u2019s a reason within a soundtrack or the ambient shown in a show, and it isn\u2019t having music for the sake of JUST having music within a show, it is because you want your audience/viewers to experience the feelings of the characters in an \u201cenhanced\u201d way, through music. Regretfully that\u2019s a potential that they couldn\u2019t fulfill, a potential that they couldn\u2019t squeeze right.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 6-\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a thing that I dislike and find boring about short anime shows and it\u2019s the fact that most of them lack something essential in a story \u2013every story- and it\u2019s the character development. Blame it on the lack of time; blame it on the writers or whatever\u2026 If you want a character to be memorable you need to make him or her transcend, and not just by giving him a cool sword or bad-ass armor, I mean by making him/her relate to us the viewers whether by making him mature through the show or change or have some new goals and most importantly by making them have a believe as their foundation, those are the character that are remembered in the hearts of people.\\n\\n\r\nSadly this is the aspect in which the show fails \u2013tremendously if I may add-.\\n\r\nThe characters are well done \u2013yes- and some are cute but nothing else was achieved.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT: 8 & OVERALL: 7-\\n\r\nSo to put things shortly. The show is enjoyable? Yes. It IS original and it has an appealing and easy on the eye art, and it has a sweet \u2013but not amazing nor memorable- soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some \u201cfan-service\u201d focus shown on this show \u2013for those interested in such things-.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWhat happens when you take the writer, director, and voice actors from the beloved series Spice and Wolf and add executive meddling, fan pandering, and have it produced by Studio ARMS? You get...a massive disappointment.\r\nWarning Spoilers!!!\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe human and demon worlds have been at war for 15 years, but the humans have gained the upper hand and an elite squad is sent deep into the demon world to assassinate the Demon King and end the war. However, for poorly explained reasons our main character, who is just named Hero, goes on ahead of his squad to undertake the assassination himself. When he arrives at theDemon King's castle, he learns that the Demon \"King\" is actually a Queen...with G cup breasts. The busty queen doesn't fight back, but instead calmly explains that the war is actually a good thing and far more people would die during peace time from famine and plague as a result of the booming war economy coming to an end. This would be an interesting utilitarian argument similar to the Real Politik espoused by Otto Von Bismarck and Henry Kissinger...if it wasn't a piss poor oversimplification of the original argument that completely ignores reality. \\n\\n\r\nWarning! the following paragraph contains history!!! If you don't like history, skip ahead!\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn reality FAR, FAR more people die of hunger and plague during war time than peace time. The more backwards the setting (like the medieval setting of this series) the more true this is. During the Great African War fought between 7 African nations in the late 1990s, 6 million people died of hunger and disease in just a few years. Although this region has always had famine and plague, this death rate was far higher than ever before or since for that region. One of the worst peace time famines was the Soviet Famine of 1932 caused by forced collectivization and the wildly idiotic farming methods enforced by Joseph Stalin. 7 million people including 4 million Ukrainians, 2 million Kazakhs, and 1 million Russians died of hunger. However, even the brutality of Stalin wasn't as bad as the wartime Soviet famine of 1921. During that famine a shocking 10 million people died as a direct result of WW1 and the Russian Civil War. During a brutal war, all sides tend to use scorched Earth tactics and deliberately destroy farmland to starve the enemy. In addition, all armies involved stole HUGE amounts of crops from the farmers and peasants and gave them nothing in return. In an ass backward medieval setting like Maoyuu, the army would NOT be paying the farmers more money during war time. They would steal all the crops for themselves and give the farmers nothing. That is what always tends to happen when war comes to a non-industrialized country. Another HUGE cause of starvation and plague during war that makes it MUCH worse than peace time is blockade. Nearly the entire city of Athens died of plague and starvation after the Spartans blockaded the city during the Peloponnesian War. During World War 2, 500,000 Greeks, and no less than 5 million Soviets starved to death as a result of the blockade tactics employed by the Germans. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire argument on which this story stands is complete bullshit! When Maoyuu isn't making an idiotic attempt to explain the life saving nature of war, it is talking non-stop about crop production and agricultural theory. This comes across as a completely random tangent that doesn't really add anything to the story. If I wanted farming theory tangents out of nowhere, I would go re-read Anna Karenina thank you very much! (I hope you all heard that last sentence in the \"Cinema Snob's\" sexy voice!) At least the Demon King has foresight and wishes to ultimately end the war when the military industrial complex has been dealt with and peace will be meaningful. She actually has a strategy that is far less divorced from history and logic than some other idiotic anime series I have seen. Can you imagine how stupid it would be if the Demon King thought she could end the war by taking over the Demon and Human worlds and getting everyone to hate her, then having Hero kill her and just assume that a massive power vacuum following the death of a hated tyrant would somehow cause world peace?! Now THAT would be stupid! Fortunately even Maoyuu is a better anime than that!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the Demon King herself is a fairly interesting character, the main male lead \"Hero\" is as boring and generic as hell! What made Spice and Wolf work is that both Holo and Lawrence were complex, interesting characters. You can't have a great, memorable romance if one of the characters is about as interesting as watching paint dry! The other characters besides the main 2 are basically worthless and add nothing to the series. So essentially the entire series is carried on the back of one character: The Demon King. Unfortunately, she is not THAT strong a character and her silly outbursts and fanservice moments often undermine her alleged strategic and inventive genius. She is the world's greatest scientist and military strategist, but she randomly acts like an airhead at random intervals. This doesn't come across as a character quirk like a mad genius, but instead lazy writing that changes the character whenever the situation calls for a comedy moment. I realize what they were going for I guess. Holo was old and wise, but could act childish at times and it was funny. However, Spice and Wolf was a longer series with MUCH better developed characters, so with Holo it felt far more natural and less forced than when the Demon King would have a random comedy moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you NEVER want to see on your anime is \"produced by Studio ARMS\". It is the unholy stamp of death similar to the LJN rainbow on old NES games. The only decent anime ever produced by ARMS was Elfen Lied back in 2004, and the only reason the Elfen Lied staff chose ARMS for the project was out of desperation after a dozen superior animation studios refused to work on it. Unlike Elfen Lied, Maoyuu is not a super risque anime that nearly every studio would refuse. Maoyuu COULD have chosen a vastly superior studio, but actually went with Studio ARMS. I am not a puritanical twat that goes ballistic whenever an anime features nudity or fanservice. However, I do have a basic sense of artistic aesthetics, and I appreciate female characters NOT having tits larger than their heads. I don't want to watch an anime version of a fucking Rob Liefeld comic!!! The director of Maoyuu should have hit the animators with a rolled up newspaper like a dog when he saw the character designs. \"NO!\" NOO!\" If Elfen Lied was made by ARMS and had realistic breast to body ratios, then we know it is possible if you hit the animators enough times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I relentlessly ripped this series a new asshole, I actually don't think it is the worst series in the world. It is NOT a good series and it is a HORRIBLE spiritual successor to Spice and Wolf, but Maoyuu at least has some instances of decent dialogue and tries to tell an unconventional tale with unconventional morals and lessons. It was horribly executed, but I feel like this actually could have been good with less executive meddling and less fanservice bullshit! I see untapped potential here. The soundtrack is also decent and as much as I bagged on the art, it often isn't THAT bad. Overall, this series is very average and deserves an average to mediocre 5/10.",

            "content": "It's a series that had potential, but ruined it by doing too much. \r\n[mild spoilers pertaining to storyline progression and general point-of-view]\r\nA third season of Spice and Wolf is perhaps the most desired adaptation among fans of the franchise. When announcement came through that a similar series, with similar staff members, was going to be released, fans were ecstatic. Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple to live up to the name of the predecessor, and it's even more difficult to satiate an entirely new crowd. Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha suffers from a variety of debilitating features that not only make it a shitty, half-assed 'successor', butan awfully trite,mundane standalone. \\n\\n\r\nMaoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha doesn't have the world's most amazing storyline. In fact, it's relatively archetypal -- the king of demons and the hero of humanity wish to team up to ultimately better the world. Sounds relatively creative right? It's not. But it could have been. We're given two main characters, Maou, and Yuusha [translated to Devil and Hero]. Their names are titular of their roles. During each episode, humanity attains a new invention that may better life [e.g. new farming techniques, agriculture]; and during each episode, a mild time skip is applied [typically a few months]. What does this do? It advances the plot. But does it do anything more than that? Probably not. Is it bad because it's simple? Not necessarily. Is it bad if they advance the plot over developing the characters/mood/every other aspect of the show? Probably. \\n\\n\r\nA certain series revolving around a travelling merchant and a wolf goddess revolved around the characters -- every episode moved at a snail's pace, and the characters were developed accordingly; in Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha, it isn't uncommon for several months to move in one episode. The characters aren't developed. There's a romance between Maou and Yuusha. But the romance between the two are magnetic. They're only together for the storyline. A magnet doesn't need a reason to attract the opposite charge, neither does Maou to Yuusha, and Yuusha to Maou. They're together, but there's no semblance or inclination that would insinuate anything outside of being together for the storyline. Love? What's that. 12 episodes, or several years, resulted in a half-assed display of affection at the end. No discourse implying anything significant, and no actions outside the cursory depicted a sort of love outside of obligation. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha was fantastic? You mean the art and animation during Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha's first episode was fantastic. Arms was tasked with animating the series -- Arms did a really nice job during the former half of the series. The latter half, they kinda just gave up on maintaining consistent quality. Surprisingly, Arms, a studio, known for their integration of ecchi into everything, didn't put that much ecchi into Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha. That's a bright side. How about the soundtrack? The soundtrack's probably one of the best, redeeming features of the series. The track titled 'Beyond the Hill' by Takeshi Hama [composer of the original Devil May Cry soundtrack]would on its own, bump the score up by at least a point. The series contained a fantastic soundtrack, albeit, it wasn't exactly applied that well. The general soundtrack is perhaps one of the few things that Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha does better than its related series. It may not have been used as well [the soundtrack in the former was heavily ambient, but that ambience was integral in developing the mood], but it's certainly noteworthy [the main theme really is good]. \\n\\n\r\nSo, we're given a series with generic characters that are seldom developed, the noble goal to save the world, time skips for plot, alongside a fantastic soundtrack, inconsistent animation, and a predictable, archetypal plot progression. Oh, and don't forget the romance. Everybody loves romance. So to sum it up, we're given a series that attempts to do too much within 12 episodes, that's understandable right? Well, it probably would be if it attempted to do something difficult. Every other development and concept explored in Maoy\u016b Ma\u014d Y\u016bsha isn't exactly novel, or avant-garde; it's not even a rendition of generic concepts. They're really just generic concepts without any sort of application. Economics? Spice and Wolf had more economics within a single episode than this did in 12. The notion that opposite sides often have a lot in common and that they probably shouldn't kill each other? That's clearly edgy and new. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not as enjoyable as it could be to watch because the series tried to do too much. When you introduce a romance, actually develop it. When you attempt to mirror a similar series, at least compliment it. The series doesn't revolve around combat and the mechanics of the world? Then don't dedicate an entire episode to combat. There wasn't enough time to do what we wanted? Then don't do so much.",

So when you watch this series you are more likely to encounter economic dilemmas that intend to solve or ruin people's lives. Whats the point you ask? well for us maybe there is none or maybe they just wanted to show us how hard it was living back then. \r\nAfter this you have a nice romance story evolving on the background of a war that is not based on conquest but on survival. All these while adding various comedy scenesto release some of the tension you've built up until then.\\n\\n\r\nIt has always been a pleasure for me watching strategy based decision turn the tide of a war which seems to happen often, decisions possible only through the courage of many.\\n\r\nAlso seeing many people profit from the little or large schemes they've come up with also provides good amounts of amusement for me only to see them fail miserably or end up unable to enjoy the spoils.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you have a thing for medieval warfare this series is a very good example.\\n\r\nAt certain points I disliked the artwork but perhaps I was asking too much, still I believe we can overlook some flaws for the sake of a good story.\\n",

If you're looking for some grand quest with a cool hero and a funny heroine...keep searching. \r\nThat said, there is a clear plot here. And the characters are totally fun. The hero is the stereotypical fighter with a strong belief in justice and a kind heart. But you love him almost instantly because he's not brash, only a little reckless, and willing to learn whatever he doesn't know. The Demon Queen (the other protagonist) is intelligent, calculating, and strangely naive when it comes to men and relationships. She's totally funny, too, because you never knowwhat she's going to say or do next. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed Spice and Wolf, you'll enjoy this. This fantasy makes you think--about agriculture, economy, politics and what motivates people. But it's entertaining as well. I'm five episodes in and it's fast becoming a favorite. \\n\\n\r\nBut, like I said, if you're looking for an anime where the hero brashly rushes in to slay the dragon and rescue the damsel in distress...yeah, you're probably not going to like it much.

            "content": "Story about the hero who kills the demon king is become classic or maybe mainstream story for all of us, Usually we see this concepts in video games or maybe films. but what if the hero become a partner with demon king itself for the peace of the world?\r\nA short explanation above is maybe enough to describe what this anime about, but if you think this anime was like any adventure romance anime, then you're totally wrong. The story from this anime itself is kinda complex for some people. why? this anime was not about slash-and-kill or lovey-dovey things (its not like SAO), but itsmore deep than that. You will see a lot of dialogue dan less action, so whats so good about this anime if an adventure is less action and more dialogue? for me, is the details for the concept to anime itself.\\n\\n\r\n[contains minor spoiler]\\n\r\nThe meaning of details that i said before is about explaining the whole things that happen in the anime itself, in this anime were focussing on HOW to bring the peace. i give a suppresion on HOW because many of the scene were focussing on this, like about how standard farming practice for boosting the food production can be useful to bring a peace (I am not gonna spoil it why it can like that), its not like any typical adventure action anime which battle is always the best way to bring the peace. If i can compare, then this anime was more like using \"soft\" way than coersive way to bring peace. Its make this anime more \"rich\" than any adventure anime. [end spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nThe course of this story is more proggresing which means its more about the present and not to take many backflash or past of each character and more, the story goes fast (time-skips), and for me its really a good thinking, since it will take many times and hamper the storyline, after all, this anime was an adventure which focussing on \"how to achieve the goal\". But, of course there was a consequence for not bring the past, it will makes us (the viewer) hard to get attached with the main character (as we know, the first impression of the hero (Yuusha) is like a doll for achieving the demon king (Maou) goal, its make the Hero is not so appealing for us) and more,  we didnt really know who our main character is, which make us more harder to get attached. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite of all that potentials, that there is something that makes this anime is become more \"cheapo\", beside of all that serious matters become useless with useless  jokes and unnecessary fanservice (bouncing, any kinds like that) but its forgiveable since as we know ARMS, known as the H-anime and Ecchi anime (Samurai girls and Himawari) and we cant ignore they make some good anime (like Elfen Lied). Its not like i hate fanservice but sometimes this anime was more prominent in Maou's boobs, honestly i more prefer something like Spice and Wolf which is same as like this anime (Maoyuu Maou Yuusha), they more focussing on storyline than fanservices.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art and sound, there isnt something really amazing. Focus on the art first, pale coloring that they used in Maoyuu Maou Yuusha were really present the medieval era, it really blends well with the scenery and the background. But, at the sometimes, people who arent used in medieval setting will find it dull and boring. But for those who had watching something like this before (like Spice and wold) will find this were interesting. and for the sound section, the only one i aware was the opening song \"Yohko - Mukai Kaze\", its a good song and yet its quite attaching.\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime isnt finished airing until i write this review, i cant conclude yet if this anime were good or not, but as far i have seen until now (episode 5) , i find this anime is quite catchy yet i realize this anime was not-for-all-anime since some of people will find it boring since so many dialogues, but i recommend this one for  those who appreciate a good and deep story",

            "content": "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha has an interesting concept. It takes a look at economic and social issues during a medieval themed period, and it focuses on the \"behind the scenes\" sort of events. Again, it's an interesting concept, and at times I really liked it a lot. The ending was very disappointing, and it dropped my opinion of it dramatically. I simply want to warn that this story really doesn't have an ending and will most likely leave you expecting more (notice I didn't say wanting, but expecting). I did like this story (I figured I should say that much). I did look forward to iteach week, and I was intrigued by the concept. I wonder if I was more intrigued by my speculation of where it was going as opposed to where the story actually went. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the basics. It looked good so I can't complain there. The music was ok, not very memorable, but it worked. The voice acting was good (probably one of it's strongest points). I did like all of the basic details, and I don't feel it really let me down in any of these areas. The problem is that it attempted to create a fantasy tale that wasn't a fantasy tale. There were demons, knights, mages, castles, kingdoms, and churches. There was a long standing war that was at the center of this story as well. Holy crusades are talked about during this story. Detach yourself from these facts immediately. They are simply background to what is actually taking place. What you get with Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is a love story between a superhuman and a demon that are attempting to end their war (long term mind you) by correcting the social, economic, and political issues of their time. The methods they choose are the story. It's not much of one, but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the lack of something substantial, this story is interesting. I enjoyed watching the demons introduce new ideas and technologies to a world full of dumbfounded sheep-like people. It had a lot of good moments, but the story was ultimately flawed. I made a lot of speculation during my viewing of the show that probably carried over into my opinion. This is not an extremely exciting nor a game changing anime series. It does have some good things to offer, but do beware that it is filled with a lot of plot holes and bad logic. The potential is there, but it is never fully realized, so I feel it should have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the best part of this show... the characters. So what if it's filled with stereotypical fantasy characters. I liked the characters in this series. I enjoyed the weird love story that was in there too. I wanted to see different events transpire, and I wanted to see a little more of the action, but we don't get too see too much of that. There's a lot of setup and not a lot of execution, but the characters are still fun to watch regardless. \\n\\n\r\nThere's mild relationship humor and some interesting friendships are born throughout the journey. It's filled with character interaction and reaction. It's the reactionary behavior that I enjoyed the most. The self conscious main characters with low self esteem created a sort of fun awkwardness that I thought brightened the show. Without that, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.\\n\\n\r\nI know I have both rued and complimented this series, but my overall feelings are that this was interesting, yet it was very flawed. It is a 7 for me, even though I was left a little confused as to my reasoning. Sometimes liking something doesn't have to make perfect sense, and this series is an example of that for me. With only 12 episodes it's an easy watch, and I do recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nThough I think it's worth watching, it is hard to say who exactly will like it or hate it. Some people will like it because it's different, while others will hang on its many flaws. All in all, I suggest you try a couple of episodes to get a feel for the story, and if you don't like it after the first couple of episodes then you probably won't like it at all. Do expect a lot of dialogue, and do expect to watch more of the mundane than you may be used to.",

            "content": "It goes without saying that life seems more enjoyable when those around you share similar traits, but more importantly, Interests. In anime, many shows of whichever genre they derive from are often formulaic; many of which the stories of each share common and highly similar premises and themes. Unfortunately, this tires many dedicated fans of such genres and leads to a \"I've seen this all happen before..\" Kind of situation when watching or reading one such story.\r\nMaoyuu Maou Yuusha appears to be no more than your typical \"fantasy\" taking place in medieval-ish times with a few hints of modern ideas floating about and incorporated intocivilization. However, my initial thoughts and expectations excitingly shot down and I came to love Maoyuu Maou Yuusha a great deal. While the score may not show it, it is highly enjoyable despite its shortcomings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it all shines.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins in an all too familiar setting of many fantasy-like stories; a Continent/land divided into multiple factions/countries/nations etc. Much to my chagrin, initially, the story did come off as formulaic with some chosen hero ready to fight off the \"evil\" of his world to obtain years of peace to come... \\n\\n\r\nAt least, That's what I thought for the first seven minutes of the first episode...\\n\\n\r\nYes, our story starts with the unison of what seems to defy all preconceptions of good and evil. A hero who comes to behead the \"evil\" Demon king joins her instead. This is where it all gets interesting.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike many officially aired shows I've thus far seen, few have actually depicted the \"evil\" side as not so horrid as they are made out to be. While this idea isn't new, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha takes this premise and refreshingly tells the tale through a more romantic tale of our Hero and a Demon King whose beauty is as pure as the colored Crimson of her whole appearance. The story, instead of solely focusing on the action of things, approaches the viewer with a more complex philosophical (logistics of civilization?) stance on war, reasons for it, and other standpoints you'd not expect. Additionally, the show emphasizes a focus on components that keep civilization going besides war; example being agriculture. Of course for those of you who are in it for the action, you'll find yourself a tad disappointed, but don't worry, it's still there. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is a show that tries to show the viewer all the cogs/gears that make up your view of the demon/human society.\\n\\n\r\nPacing of the show, in terms of speed, seems exponential once momentum starts to take over. Initially, the show is slow paced, trying to establish a setting and differentiating the initial preconceptions of conflict and the \"Good vs Evil\" dealio. After that is established, the show is a tad too fast for its own good, but still paces itself accordingly from the rising action into the climax of the story. If you're not a fan of unforeseen time skips from episode to episode, you might feel a tad uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nMoving along, the story itself, as mentioned before, is unique in its own right, even if the premise has been done before. Admittedly, at times it feels as though too much seems to be happening at once I the later development of the overall plot. At times, I feel the plot got a tad complicated and I didn't understand fully what was going on. On a brighter note, the story has many moving moments and the creativity of the story is almost boundless, and the show isn't obviously predictable nor too outrageous.\\n\\n\r\nThe story wasn't bad, more on the good side of things. It simply can be hard to get into due to common preconceptions of \"evil vs good\" and some other little holes that don't seem to add up, example being an establishment of how the humans view the demons. It is much easier to come into this show with an open mind as  you'll find that the characters and civilization aren't all that relatable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are nothing fancy, nor ugly or dull. The art more or less seems to be a bit half-baked at times, but there are benefits to a simplistic approach in terms of design, detail, and animation. For starters, the show is easy on the eyes, and the characters are still easily identifiable and even attractive. Background wise, nothing is extraordinarily outstanding or horridly misconfigured. The animation is sometimes choppy, but annoyingly so. The art is just a head above average, and arguably, that's all it really needs to be. After all, the art isn't where the show really shines.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\\n\r\nNothing spectacular and memorable comes to mind in the soundtrack nor the character's voicing. The Opening sequence is pretty catchy, and the Ending can be hit or miss. On a brighter note, everything fits the situation, and I really couldn't ask for more since, again, this isn't where the show really shines. Sure, it could have been better, but it could have been far worse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I really wanted more, I wanted to delve into the pasts and the vast experiences that make up how the characters came to be. Our protagonists are well developed to a degree, but I felt a lack of any real significant change in many, this includes Maou and the hero. That said it isn't all that bad even if only fragments of our characters' pasts actually reveals a small degree of the character themselves. \\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, much more emphasis is placed on the story's focus on the necessary components that support and make up the demon and human civilization. Whether it be more beneficial than harmful, the supporting characters and mains themselves serve as symbols that represent each influential component of civilization, so it is arguable that the characters served their purpose. Of course, this isn't true when things get a tad lovey-dovey. It's simply unfortunate that many stories with broad casts seem to suffer familiar consequences.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite my little rants, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha was well worth the watch. I felt a sense of originality and got excited over this fact. The show had components excepted of the fantasy genre; romance and action included, the show tried to portray the best of these while trying to keep the story original and entertaining. To my delight, this was a success and I have no real issues with the show besides the show's episode count which did put me in an awkward mood in the end. Had a more satisfying ending been drawn, this could have gone down as an all time favorite, but alas, the world is cruel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it's well worth a run through. Would I rewatch this? Probably not. If you're looking for something unique and original, you'll find this story to be a delightful one. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a must watch, but It definitely deserves much needed recognition.\\n\\n\r\nHope this was helpful.",

Newer style if you are looking for something old school like older anime art then you are not obviously going to findit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't exactly remember there being something wrong with the sound or so but picking the music for certain part could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nDemon being demon who does good while hero being hero whose task is to fight, nothing else to say\\n\\n\r\nAbout enjoyment, it was marked as a romance, I cannot exactly say it's a romance because they didn't see each other exactly much and during that time hero was just being childish or so, rejecting. So getting that vibe of anime including romance was hard.\\n\\n\r\nBut in general a great anime, teaches new things, mostly economics and equality that difference is part of being unique that fighting is bad for both sides, and that everything is controlled by bigger parties.",

The very idea of a Demon King and a Hero signing an alliance to put an end to the reliance of the world's economy on eternal war was original and interesting. So what did go wrong?\r\nBasically, everything.\r\nThe final result is a unique example of total blandness. This anime is, there's no other way to put it, boring. Horribly so. The characters are generic as they can be, starting with the Demon King, who's got bouncy boobs and is inexplicablyin love with the Hero since when he was a newborn, and continuing with the Hero himself (a walking Deus Ex Machina), the Head Maid, every single villain, and on, and on. The story is aimless: there's a bit of plot but it's all serviceable to the thesis of the show, consisting in demonstrating how feudalism is bound to lose its match against mercantilism/capitalism. This is basically the history of Europe in the 16th century, only much more boring, because every invention which changed our style of life springs in some way from the Demon King, who discovers potatoes, corn, the printing press and gunpowder without breaking a sweat. Things happen because they need to, not because it makes sense; whenever some miracle is needed, either the Hero or the Mage pull off some new convenient power, and overall there's never any sense of struggle. This could be excused if the anime was aiming at teaching some relevant economic concept or putting forward some original, compelling thesis. But it does neither, as the economy is trivial and the thesis is even less interesting. I had to watch this series in order to blog it and by the end I hated every moment of it. Don't watch.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review for anything.  So, wish me luck.\r\nI wasn't sure what to think of this anime upon starting it.  Even though the summary made it out to be pretty serious, there are splashes of comedy in many of the early episodes that some may think are out of place in regards to the overall tone, but I found these to be quite charming.\r\nI found that this anime painted a good image of the world they lived in.  It basically is the dark ages of Europe and it incorporates a lot of things from that time inhistory.  Throughout the series, the world felt very alive.  I really liked how the world would change based on the decisions made by certain characters.  They would often explain what would be the expected result, but sometimes they didn't.  It is at these times when the series becomes very interesting.  Another influence on the world is the great war between humans and demons.  The great war, even though bad, has shown great improvements on the economy of both sides.  \\n\\n\r\nThe war is a sad truth that is difficult to change and the Hero and Demon Lord have a difficult task ahead of them.  They wish to change the world so that it doesn't need the sacrifice of lives to function.  The plans to change the world are very promising, but even a well laid plan won't go as expected.  This is where the show truly shines.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of political intrigue/economics, you should feel right at home watching this.  A lot of time is spent on the happenings of the world and how it changes.  If you are looking for a good romance in a fantasy setting, you should look elsewhere.  It felt a little forced and merely more of a distraction than anything else.  You could almost consider it not a romance, but there is just enough of it to be defined as such.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed watching this.  The world felt very real and the characters were enjoyable.  The story was interesting and made you think a little bit.  The romance was pretty weak, but it doesn't prevent you from enjoying it.",

            "content": "In 'Spice and Wolf' many people try to rip-off Holo and Lawrence, but it inevitably backfires because they aren't as clever as they like to think.  'Maoyuu Maou Yuusha' failed to learn this lesson and tried to do just that... with the exact same result. Inferior to 'Spice and Wolf' in every way, and not even decent on its own, I dropped this badly written wannabe like a hot potato. Stupid potato.\r\n'Maoyuu Maou Yuusha' can be legally steamed on Crunchyroll and the DVDs can be purchased from Sentai Filmworks.\r\n-Story-\r\nIf medieval economics can create a cult hit, why not medieval agriculture? Well, first you haveto understand the basics of agriculture. The central plot is that humanity can't afford to have peace with the demon races, because if the war ended there would be mass starvation, so the Hero and the Demon King have to work together to improve agricultural output. Which might be a feasible premise if it weren't full of more BS than a fertilizer factory. Short version: war means fewer farmers (due to military conscription and recruitment), most of whom are not top-quality workers (because military forces naturally select the youngest and healthiest people), are working to feed more people (more soldiers means fewer farmers) while under constant threat of attack (raids were a central part of medieval warfare- admittedly MMY knows THAT much), and should such a raid come there would be large-scale destruction of supplies, stores, and livestock- leading to food shortages that would cause starvation and disease and FURTHER reduce agricultural output (you can't grow crops if you're too hungry to get out of bed or too sick to see straight). These problems are compounded when farming is as labor-intensive as it was until the 20th century. Go read about the Hundred Years War and see if France had an agricultural boom thanks to all the political chaos, English raids, and wandering bands of out-of-work mercenary bandits. The return of peace would mean the end of Demon attacks and the human soldiers could go back to farming- so how does this mean less food to go around?\\n\\n\r\nAnd even excusing MMY's badly flawed premise, the execution is dreadful as well. Most of the dialogue is shameless info-dumping (the first episode is nearly all one expository conversation), made worse by the fact that Maou (the Demon King) is telling Yuusha (the Human Hero) how the human world works- she goes so far as to describe the basic structure and functions of some of the largest religious and commercial organizations in the land to him (because apparently he never learned that the Church of the Light Spirit is the largest and most influential religious group in his homeland). There are 2 time-skips just in the first 3 episodes alone, creating a disjointed feeling as the show skips from plot point to plot point. And most of the dialogue that isn't expository is cheap jokes about Maou's exceedingly ample bosom (apparently demon culture doesn't consider large-chested women highly desirable, and the fact that human culture does seems to be the one thing about humans Maou conveniently doesn't know) or 'ship-tease' scenarios where Maou and Yuusha almost kiss only to be interrupted by something (they're adults living alone together for MONTHS and Maou clearly wants Yuusha to take her all night long, so why exactly are they still acting like shy 8th-grade crushes?) And what little conflict does appear is almost instantly solved by Maou, so there isn't even meaningful struggle to get attached to. The story is a masterclass in how NOT to hook an audience- I ENJOY medieval history and economics and this plot still couldn't hook me, how bad must it be for the 99% percent who don't share that niche interest? If you absolutely need your medieval agriculture fix just read the 5th US volume of 'Vinland Saga'.\\n\\n\r\n-Art & Sound-\\n\\n\r\nThoroughly mediocre and they're still the high point of MMY. The aesthetic has no glaring faults simply because it settles for being so blandly average, with production values to match (for comparison, 2013 was the year MMY, Attack on Titan, and Psycho-Pass all aired- one of these is not like the others.) The sound is generic as well, the OP, ED, and OST are all standard fare with nothing to distinguish them. I can't complain about the voice actors, but given that this series is English sub only I have little means to judge them.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nTake the most generic, bland, clueless, and aimless male anime character you can think of- he'll be Edward FREAKING Elric compared to Yuusha. He does little more than follow Maou around while she info-dumps on him, at one point even he realizes he has very little to do with what's going on. The story is hinting he'll start doing more things in upcoming episodes, but given his lack of development and motivation they don't promise to be more than empty action scenes to shake things up. His design could have been copy-pasted from any number of fantasy series as he lacks a single unique visual feature. Maou the Demon King isn't any better: a shameless blob of boob-joke fan-service who adores Yuusha for no clear reason, wants peace for no clear reason despite being from a culture that clearly favors continuing the war, and solves everything with an info-dump. The other cast members? Empty cliches. MMY relies on its main two and they stink.\\n\\n\r\nFor comparison to the series MMY was clearly trying so hard to be, 'Spice and Wolf' uses a near-identical set-up and pulls it off beautifully because its main 2 are handled exceptionally well. First off, S&W was balanced. Holo had charisma and special abilities Lawrence lacked (being able to tell when a person is lying is useful for a travelling merchant, and being able to turn into an unstoppable giant wolf has pretty obvious benefits), while Lawrence was far more worldly-wise and his rock-steady personality served as a counterbalance to Holo's negative character traits and mood swings. You saw that they truly needed each other. In MMY Yuusha is effectively useless as Maou has to guide him around his own world. Also, the S&W mains had distinct personalites. Holo would snark and tease as a way of dealing with her own loneliness and to hide her developing feelings for Lawrence- feelings her pride didn't want her to admit. Lawrence was more of a 'straight man' to Holo's outlandish personality, he rarely tries to compete with her in snark-to-snark combat but does like to take the occasional shot just to keep her honest. He hides his own loneliness with silence and doesn't want to admit his developing attachment out fear as he assumes Holo will 'inevitably' leave him. In MMY, Maou is cheap fan-service and Yuusha has even less personality than that. I want to clarify that I'm not 'hating' on the MMY cast, nor am I a S&W fanboy just bashing one show to make my personal favorite look good (I've yet to finish S&W season 2 and am in no hurry to do so), I'm criticizing it heavily because it makes numerous basic character writing mistakes and because there's a clear example of how to make practically the exact same cast dynamic under nearly identical conditions work beautifully.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nBack in Jr. High I had a brief desire to be a ventriloquist, so I bought a book on the subject. One of its tips was \"Open with your 2nd best joke\". A basic rule of good entertainment in any medium is to strike early with a good hook to get the audience interested quickly. All this to say that MMY doesn't open with a hook but with a train wreck. I almost never drop a series, I tend to get hooked fairly easily even if I know the series is objectively nothing special (I completed 'Samurai 7' and 'Romeo X Juliet' for Pete's sake). The fact that I dropped MMY should say plenty. I only stuck around for 3 episodes so that nobody would pull the '3 episode rule' on me, and even if it does somehow manage to get good later that still means MMY will have wasted at least the first 25% of its run time- that's not exactly a positive either.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nA poor man's 'Spice and Wolf'. A VERY poor man's. Story and characters are terribly written, and utterly mediocre production values can't distract from that for a minute. It's clear what MMY was trying to be and it's even more clear that it failed. I can't even recommend this series to people like me who might be interested in its look into medieval farming techniques, never mind a mass audience. Skip it.",

With maybe a two season long show it could have done this, but they were neglected lots of times for interesting, yet half hearted discussions on economics. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nI really like maou yet didn't get to know the character as much as I liked and was left with other things instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nThis show could have been great for me, and was at times, but at the end all it is for me is some good art and character teases that made me want more.",

            "content": "More Demon King anime, how unoriginal, right? Well, this one isn't that unoriginal considering the Demon King is a female and the story has medieval economics.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story for me was basically that it started really good, but then dropped around the end. At first, I was going to rate the story around a 8, because I really liked it. The last 4 episodes bored me to the point that I would just go on my phone and scroll through Instagram or watch some other videos on my laptop. The negatives out of the way, even though the Demon King stories are kind of overused,it still did OK, mainly because this story is also based really early, around the medieval times. Action scenes are mostly around the nameless Yuusha and sometimes it would either be really good or really boring. Even though there's romance in the anime, it isn't very strong as the relationship between Yuusha and Maou started out well, but even though either of them love each other, they still seem like friends from a stranger's point of view. There's harem in the anime, but I think it's 2 or 3 girls that like him. Yes, there's fan-service but that's mostly at the start and the middle. It doesn't affect the anime that much. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty nice, detailed characters and nice animations for the spells and magic used in the anime. The colors look nice and the background had more of a medieval style to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST fit each scene nicely, whether it is an emotional, funny or an action scene. The OP fits the anime nicely but personally, I really like it. The ED gives more of a mystical vibe, but doesn't fit well with the anime. It sounds eerie for an ending of an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've actually never seen an anime where the main character does not have a real name. \\n\\n\r\nYuusha (Hero), is a very kind-hearted character, because even though the biggest enemy of humanity was in front of him, he still didn't kill him. He always suggested plans that wouldn't involve killing anyone, even his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nMaou (Demon King), is a very lovable character, as she also does not want to kill anyone, even if it was HER enemies. She's also very kind-hearted and funny. She reminds me of someone from a different anime, though I can't get her name in my head. Massive boobs and is very caring for Yuusha.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime for a bit but when it started to progress, I stopped liking it. It got really boring for me, though that is my own opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though it was boring for me, you guys might like this anime. If you want to start slowly on new types of anime and slowly moving away from your genres, then this might intrigue you. Would I re-watch this? Sorry, but no.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Maoyuu was one of the anime that I was most excited about, having to read one of the source (manga, someone translate the novel, PLS!!).  It was a twist on old stories with a different theme that really struck a chord in me, so having an anime was like the icing on the cake.\r\nMaoyuu starts with the usual the classic fantasy setting of the Hero on a journey to defeat Maou, whose realm is at war with mankind. It starts at the end as he reaches the castle and enters the final battle, he ended up founding himself in a university introductory class, listeningto Maou as she explains to him about the real state of world. In the end they enter into a contract (practically marriage) to find \u201cthe place behind the hill\u201d, an alternate possibility to bring peace.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so we enter their journey as they help to bring about change in the human and demon world alike, using methods and invention that we, the viewers are no stranger to, education and technology.\\n\\n\r\nThe series acts as in part as a deconstruction of the typical RPG Hero setting, but also breaking into the political, social and economic nature of warfare and development and how this reflects on our history. On both side, humans and demons, was there shown to be unhappiness , inequality and struggle for the denizens and on both side, there are ones who benefit from war and go out of their way to ensure its continuation, for their selfish reasons. It also shows the corrupting nature of hierarchies, as the powerful in the world controls the wealth and dines, while there are dying people who can\u2019t even have a chance.\\n\\n\r\nThe series itself composes of dialogue between the characters, showing the various plans and thoughts of everyone who is a stakeholder in the situation, so everyone, from the small servants to the leaders and how in a sense \u201cthe game is played\u201d by the various factions who wants to achieve their goals. Maou\u2019s plan is to introduce new technology and thinking into the human world in order to improve the lives of the people, this gets on the nerves of others, who sees this as a threat to their rule and invoke war.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are interesting, as they are extremely stereotypical of characters of their kind, yet also somewhat aware of their limitations and they mostly act in ways to add to the story, not to explore themselves. Hero is nearly the a cut out from RPG game, being an idealistic loner who despite having comrades, decided to face Maou alone so that he can save everyone and so that no one has to get hurt. While he himself had noticed that there were discrepancies in the human world and to his role in defeating Maou, he never really thought about it until he meets Maou. Oddly enough, he ended up being quite pacifistic as he would rather reach peace through Maou\u2019s way, rather than using the sword; despite being EXTREMLY OP!!! \\n\\n\r\nMaou herself is a scholar type character, who would probably out-rank modern day hikkis for the time she spent locked away in a room doing nothing but studying, with everything else cater for by the Head Maid, until she decided to become Maou to start her plan to meet Hero. She is extremely wise yet idealistic in her goals and is very serious in her task, she is shown to have a lighter, more humorous and childish side mostly when dealing with Hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, from the Head Maid to the Winter King, are all part of the big story. The Head Maid is the all around helper to Maou that does everything that Maou, can\u2019t, even leading the demon armies and also acts the counsellor to the other characters in the series. The Winter king is the idealistic leader and ally to Maou who realises the abuse of his country and people by foreign nations and sees that Maou can help his country to gain independence  through her knowledge. There are also Hero\u2019s old companions, from the Old Man, Female Knight and Female Magician, each have their own role to play in the story, aid Maou and Hero in various way.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I think that the story touched upon the idea of humanity and different human relation.  This is show mostly through the various points in the series where we saw how demons and humans treat one another and themselves, from conflict to cooperation. It shows that every relationship requires acceptance from both sides and that no dominance or rule can be cast over people without their acceptance and so that\u2019s why revolts start. This is exemplified by Maou and Hero, who belongs to one another, but neither one, is ruled or controlled by the other. \\n\\n\r\nThe series overall acts as a summary of human development that occurred in Europe in the Medieval Age, that went through the Renaissance and even goes close to the Enlightenment, with ideas such as the rights of man, free market, meritocracy, the idea of popular government and even the rejection of universal control of belief by religion and various technological change.\\n\\n\r\nWhile that is all good, the biggest problem the anime has is pacing and explanation of the story, as they had to squeeze a lot of story in just 12 episodes and therefore a lot of parts were cut and made the story seem a bit idiosyncratic, also it may sound boring to tedious to many who don\u2019t like political and economics talk. Also the way the series ends was disappointing to many, even me a bit, but this is due to the lack of source material sadly, which I hope means that the anime will continue if the novel continues, in a year or year I hope.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, while for me there are a lot of similarities that can be drawn from this series and Spice and Wolf, I still don\u2019t feel that the two are comparable. If one only focus on the fact that they both have a theme of economics, then that\u2019s nothing more than breaking the ice of both series. Maoyuu is more of a parody and conversational piece or a sort of long legend rather than an observable story, as its drawing up many similar stories and themes that is time immemorial in human history.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series made it for me with how it made me feel, yes I know that is a bit bias, but this my opinion. The series made me felt the same way the manga did, a good concept that\u2019s inspiring and motivated, as it speaks of the beautiful yet simple ideas of humanity, for love , peace and happiness and places emphasis on education and innovation, something we all usually takes for granted. It made me feel more hopeful of humanity( I was really depressed) as it shows the old spirit and belief we had in a better tomorrow, that we will work and live for it and we refused to be bound by old traditions and power to get to our goal. This reflects so much on our modern world, still sadly enough, even though the series is supposed to depict a world similar to our world few centuries ago.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for listening to my rants, hope that it\u2019s helpful. >(^_^)>.\\n",

            "content": "Inevitably, this anime will be compared to Spice and Wolf, given the choice of voice actor and the plot with economic themes. While there are some similarities, the two series couldn't be more different. S&W has a light plot(microeconomics) with more focus on the interaction(romance) of the two main characters. While Maoyuu have an ambitious plot(politics, liberation, macroeconomics, war), with less emphasis on the two protagonist.\r\nIf you are watching Maoyuu with the expectation of S&W successor, then you'll be deeply disappointed. The romance in Maoyuu are presented in a Rom-Com fashion, which isn't any serious. Instead, Maoyuu's plot involves a reenactment of how catalyst thatrapidly changed our society today played out in a fantasy world where Demons and Humans co-exist. If you are watching Maoyuu with the plot as the focus, perhaps you'll find the series more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 8\\n\r\nThe plot is insightful if you actually know what's going on, but the director skimmed over too many important details. The main story is the Hero wanting to end the War between the Demons and Humans. But there are many more hidden plots. Like the reasons for War(misunderstanding, discrimination, macroeconomics), oppression between nobles and serfs(slaves), how to end war(education, economy). Also the different degree of manipulations going on. From the Central government to the civilian/army/hero, or the merchant to the government, or religion to the civilians.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is ambitious, but poorly executed. The average audience would not understand the connections between each subplots and the main plot. If you haven't read the source material, like myself, you'll have to fill in the connections between each events yourself. That's not how an anime driven by plot should be presented. Sadly, if the series were a 2-course anime, it could have expanded upon many of the subplots, or even a deeper relationship development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound - 7\\n\r\nThe Art is average for a fantasy anime, and the music fits. Some action scenes were nicely animated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nThere are many characters but not enough character development. For example the Merchant had a major role to play in the series, but he wasn't developed enough that the audience could relate or understand his actions in the subplots. The Head Maid never had the development that justified her strong loyalty in the subplot. The Mage never had much screen time, most of her actions were of confusion to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character with a properly developed subplot were the Maid Girl. As it was portrayed early she was born of a serf(slave), and don't have much confident in herself. But under the influence of the plot, she gave a great speech which deeply connected with the audience. If more time were taken to develop the characters, then the plot could also be better understood.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nThe plot was interesting as not many anime touches on the politics of War, revolution, and macroeconomics. But it shouldn't have rushed and assumed the audience could guess the minds of the characters when they weren't developed enough. The interaction between Maou and Hero is pretty enjoyable, though not as good as S&W.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nThe series did not focus on it's strong point which is the plot, but instead tried to compete with S&W on character interaction/chemistry with a generic rom-com relationship. It could have stood out with it's ambitious plot if given more episodes to develop and more action/adventure scenes. Instead it tried to fit a massive plot into 12 episodes. S&W had 13 episodes and it only had two recognizable characters.",

            "content": "Right from the get go I spared no time download this thing after seeing Jun and Ami as the two lead voice acting roles.I'm not kidding, I grabbed a drink and sat the hell down and was watching it in less than a few minutes. Being a huge enthusiast of Code Geass I couldn't wait to see what sort of antics \"Lelouch\" and big breasted \"Kallen\" were going to get into here. Right from the first episode I was guaranteed to watch the next, and this anime does the good job of actually getting you to care.\r\nStory  - 8\r\nI find this anime to havetwo sides of a plot, each catering to it's repetitive audiences. There's the part involved with politics, war, trade, and all that junk, and then there's the parts involving the more inner characters, dealing with their trails and tribulations, getting some light-hearted slice of life which is most enjoyable (in my opinion of course)\\n\\n\r\nIt's really double sided. You may enjoy one over the other, but if you're good on both, than you'll get an even mix of flavor to make this watch and enjoyable one.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the plot I would say is how the protagonist manages to attract his two best female interests in the most adorable way possible. That tingly feeling that you get watching these flirty scenes? You get plenty here.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nI've taken a good break, about a year, from anime before I came back into it, starting with this one and a few others. I still remember promising myself not to give too high of a score to the art category, because even though the standard animes now all have some aspect of amazing art I have to raise the bar.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even with the bar raised, this managed to clear it magnificently. The art is gorgeous. The wheat fields dance and the grass blows in the wind. Background animations are particularly splendid. The character art goes without saying, making service the absolute bomb.\\n\\n\r\nYou gotta draw those demon tits correctly. I'm not a fan of tankers, but it's good are like this that makes it work for me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nMost of you watching an anime for Jun Fukuyama's voice want to hear the deep sexy one he uses in Code Geass as Lelouch. Well, good for you because you'll get it here, along with the lighter voice that still sounds very much like Lelouch. Along with Kallen's voice actor, who joins him in dialogue. I often stare at still pictures of the two Code Geass characters while this anime is on and laugh myself silly.\\n\\n\r\nWe've also got other prominent actors here, but I won't mention them.\\n\\n\r\nWho doesn't want to hear Lelouch stammering in shyness?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nMy fingers are starting to hurt...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great, just see for yourself an tell me that I was wrong. The scum feel like scum and the heroes feel like heroes. Good job, people writing this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nIt got my twenty minutes and I still have more and a fuck to give. Yes, this anime is very much acceptable for viewing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nIT'S STILL A DAMN SHAME THAT IT'S ONLY 12 EPISODES\\n\\n",

            "content": "From a simple perspective, the perspective of one who is simply watching for enjoyment, this anime isn't bad. There were moments that made me giggle, that made me think and analyze the ideas. However, looking deeper, this anime really isn't anything special. Like many others, it has potential, but ultimately failed to develop that. \r\nThe main idea of the story is interesting. The Demon King, the Hero, along with other companions such as the Head Maid and the Female Knight, try to change the world, a world currently plagued with poverty, corruption, war, through education, inventions and schemes. However, much of it is rushed throughthe anime, even the subplots as well. If the anime had been longer, for example 20 episodes, the story would have been properly developed. Not to mention that much of the story contains too many subplots, this whole story doesn't leave a lasting impression. \\n\\n\r\nEqually undeveloped as the story, the characters fail to show change. From the protagonists to the minor characters, they show us their personalities, but most of them are static characters. The Demon King is an intelligent woman who shows kindness to everyone. The Hero is an ultra powerful fighter who shows care towards his companions. For an unknown reason, they fall in love and have mini-love quarrels and small romantic moments. It is finished. Their characters don't change anymore. You would expect that the protagonists are the round characters, but instead the Elder Sister Maid, a supporting character, shows the most change throughout the series. Basically, the characters are by far the weakest point of this anime. That being said, similar to the story, the characters are affected by the fact that the anime itself was rushed through 12 episodes, and again, if the episodes were longer, many things would change for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThinking about other factors, they weren't impressive, either. The art of the characters are acceptable, but the background occasionally feel like I'm watching a poorly done oil painting. The sound weren't good. I don't remember any music that I enjoyed or noticed, but the voice actors were pretty good. They did a good job for the Demon King, the Hero and many other characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, again, if the anime were made longer, instead of rushed through 12 episodes, I feel that it would be much better. There are a lot of weak points in this anime, but nonetheless I somewhat enjoyed it. Hardcore anime viewers, lower your expectation and watch it purely for enjoyment. Otherwise you won't like this anime too much.",

            "content": "I have watch too many animes that i criticize too much, i forgot why i love it in the first place and the joy it brings after. This anime reminds me of that feeling. Although each of us has our own opinion that sometimes we tend to compare and criticize which one is best but we literally miss some important things like how did you relate and what lessons did you get from watching it. I believe, in my own opinion, weither if its good or bad it has something unique to offer for they are all not the same. Like us people each ofus have some different taste. A piece of advice coming from one conqueror to another id like to say don't force yourself to like an anime you'll just bleed and die.\\n\\n\r\nMaoyuu is somewhat similar to the anime i watched before ( i won't mention it to avoid spoilers) although same in someways but not quite similar, the PLOT is utterly different, that's why i enjoyed watching it. Its like watching harem animes though always the same stuff but you still enjoy watching it even if its utterly redundant (who's guilty here? Don't deny it! You F'n pervert! Liars go to hell! Jk! XD). The plot of this anime goes like this; a Demon Queen made a contract or should i say they got married  (well not literally, but it feels like it) with her enemy \"The Hero\". What was the deal? Help her to cleanse the world from violence and corruption. Now, come to think of it whoah! A Demon proposing peace, quite interesting i must say but not like any other demon this demon has big oppais! Yes, the HERO has been tamed and has been tempted  by HUGE oppais oooppps spoiler xD). At first episode it got my attention because it is quite unique although vague but as i progress in each episode it began to shed some light as they tackle different struggles like political, war, poverty, education, discrimination, business, economics and ofcourse looooooveeeeeee with a lil bit of fan service (the fan service is actually cute and sexy as always but not extreme). This anime is quite heavy in terms of dialogue so it is not recommendable to those who don't like to listen in such long verbal discussions such as these, but if you like Monogatari Series then we're on the same boat. Given all that, by the end of the day what's important is what you've learned from it and how it affects you personally.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters; this anime has many characters with different backgrounds, but the most interesting characters are the maids due to their past lives as slaves and how they freed themsleves from such cruel reality their story is actually moving, watching them grow and learn from their new masters is quite lovely and now they have a true purpose. Come to think of it i they're the only ones who has a clear background. \ud83e\udd14\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation; talk about quality all the way! Wow! Kodus to those who put all the effort and hardwork! Great job! This type of art animation is the bomb for me, i lolololove it! Love those big round eyes, i also love the colors (are those water colored backgrounds? GJ!) the characters and backgrounds looks so lovely.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: wow! I have to compliment the ending song. Listening to it feels like i'm in a trance! Quite mesmerising.\\n\\n\r\nJust so you know all of this is just my point of view, every one of us has some taste different to each other with different opinions. As for me i gave this Anime a 10/10 because in my book it is Excellent and hopefully i pray to Anime jesus through his divine mercy he deems it worthy enough to grant this a second season. Ciao!",

I would just like to say that sometimes i'ts getting difficult to follow their dialogues, and you feel like you're not intelligent enough to understand anything (might just be me though..)\r\nThe art is wonderful, in HD it's just a pleasure to watch.\r\nI'm not really good to express my feelings in words, especially in English, but I feel that this anime is underrated in MAL andthat you should check it out. \\n\r\nIf you don't like the first 3 episodes, I would allow you to drop it, it's not meant for you.",

            "content": "There's a somewhat infamous textbook that's used to teach Discrete Mathematics in some colleges called \"Discrete Mathematics With Ducks\". It sounds silly, but the premise is effective: if you pour raw information at a person it can bore or overwhelm them, but if you mask it in metaphor it can be a lot easier to understand. \r\nMaoyuu Maou Yuusha is the \"Discrete Mathematics With Ducks\" of anime. It explains the importance of some really boring historical innovations like the use of potatoes and dual currency economics by making them elements in an engaging story. If you were reading a history book on the importance ofpotatoes for sustainable population growth you probably wouldn't care much, but if you're watching a show where the development of potato agriculture is of literal life or death importance for your favorite character(s) you're much more inclined to pay attention and the lesson sinks in better.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the importance of this show is (at least in my opinion) the lessons being taught and not the story being told, the story itself doesn't do anything new; it uses the most generic plot imaginable (humans and demons locked in a fantasy war that could be taken straight out of any fantasy MMO made in the past 20 years) and even goes to the effort of making the characters and countries anonymous [fun fact, they don't say a single proper noun in the entire duration of this show, that I noticed]. The main character is named Hero not because the writers are lazy but to remind you that he as an individual doesn't matter, he could be any character in any setting and these lessons would still be relevant. If they made the characters and settings any more unique than they are you might lose track of the lessons being taught. In fact, this blatant simplicity of setting is the most unique part of the show! I don't think I've ever seen a show intentionally make itself generic and it is a wonder to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow all that talk about the setting and plot being generic might make you think this show is boring, so let me be clear. This show is NOT boring. It moves at a casual pace, but I became more attached to some of the support characters in this show than I have in any show I've seen in years. In my opinion this show displayed more meaningful character growth in one season than Naruto has in its entire run. The few sword fights are gorgeous, the speeches are gripping, and the romance is heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, they used a technique that I've only ever seen before in Gankutsuou (though it is much more tasteful here) where they seem to have overlayed patterned texture filters on a lot of the objects, and a lot of the backgrounds are painted in a very interesting way... Sort of like thick watercolor, I guess. They kept with historically accurate drawing techniques for the scripture pages shown in the credits, in the maps, and in a few other places where they're applicable. It's not the most gorgeous anime I've ever seen, but it gets a full 10/10 for originality. The voice-acting is at least on  par with other animes. Though it never really blew me away I'm not exactly a connoisseur of Japanese voice-acting, so maybe it's wonderful and I just didn't notice.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is educational, entertaining, and just a delight to watch. I completely recommend it.",

            "content": "Summary: The biggest compliment I can give an anime adaptation is that it makes me want to read the source material. This is without a doubt the case for Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. Instead of going into a long winded review I'll put together a quick highlight the pros and cons and who would enjoy this.\r\nPros:\r\nExcellent Art - this is a good looking anime with unique character designs and set pieces.\r\nExcellent Sound - The soundtrack was diverse and solid. The voice actors were also spectacular (Akeno from Dxd's voice actress plays a minor role, to give you the kind of talent they got for this anime).\r\nFantasticstory - There is romance, adventure, politics, trade, war, philosophy. It isn't as deep as something like Legend of the Legendary Heros; it tends to be fairly up beat.\\n\r\nInteresting Philosophy - This anime is what I would consider extremely pro capitalism. You might not get that from the surface but digging in deep you see the Merchant as a strong central character who is using his \"greed\" to spread wealth and prosperity to the world. Only through this trade are most of the conflictssolvable.\\n\r\nCute love story - The Demon King and Hero have a really cute love story. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nLack of resolution - The story stops kind of abruptly... clearly this was meant for a season 2 that never same.\\n\r\nHaremish? - The Hero is loved by several female lead characters and even though they aren't annoying about it that angle kind of detracted for me. Should have been Demon King and Hero and the other female leads should have only been friends.\\n\r\nEpic plot unfolding that got cut short - I guess I'll never really know who the Magician was or what she was all about. She seemed really interesting but you can tell she would be a major part of season 2 and now I'll never know. This is WAY worse in Legend of the Legendary Heros but the cut off story is annoying here as well. \\n\\n\r\nWho will like this:\\n\r\nIf you want a nice 1 season anime that deals with medieval times you can't go wrong with this one. Politics, romance, religion, fighting, demons/humans... it is an interesting premise. If it inspires you then read the light novel; there is an epic and fantastic story in here if you give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10 / Art 9/10 Sound 8/10 Character 8/10 Enjoyment 8/10 Overall 8/10",

            "content": "This show is enjoyable to watch, but it is plagued by two things. Firstly, it does not develop the relationship between the Hero and Demon King.When they separate there is no thought about them staying separated or any source of conflict to drive the story. You know they are going to be reunited and everything will go back to normal. Secondly, it is plagued by the beta male MC trope in a lot of shows that hinders character development. This show attempts to do something very similar that  Spice and Wolf does, but does not do it as well. The story, plot, and essentiallythe show is driven by the Demon King. The Hero plays a very sideline role even though the story focuses on him. Their exchanges boil down to the Demon King proposing or doing something to which the Hero response by blushing, stammering, or generally avoiding the question.\\n\\n\r\nIf it developed the relationship between the Demon King and Hero better while improving the exchanges by having the Hero respond seriously or with some sort of witty comment instead of blushing or stammering this show would easily improve at least a whole point on the average ranking.",

            "content": "Maoyuu Maou Yusha is an anime about economics and a war between the realm of demons and the realm of humans,where \"The Human Hero\" decides that he wants to end the war by killing \"The Demon King\" ,finishing the war in the most swift way possible.However when he reaches the palace of \"The Demon King\" he dosent find an powerfull demon hell bent on destroying the world,but instead he finds a beautiful red-haired girl whit the same age as him(i would assume).The girl tells him she is \"The Demon King\" and kiling her off would not end the war and even if that would happenthe results would be devastating for both the human and the demonic world,because war makes the economy work better ,makeing the aristocratic circles of both sides rich and ending the war would create starvation for the countries who only had the power to wage war and no land that could be cultivated.In the end both agree they have to unite their forces in order to change the world to a state where stopping the war would bring more beneficies than continuing it.\\n\\n\r\nStory:8\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a twist on an generic tale whit a bit of an economic elements to it and also whit a romantic subplot whit the 2 main characters(or even an romantic triangle if u will,but it dosent play that much of a role in the story).The story is quite original,whit the only thing similar story to it for the economic element is \"Spice and Wolf\",but i will talk about the similarities between these two later and who did it better IMO latter.Also this show has a few pasing problems whit various time skips that can be as long as 1 year.(note :the time skips of SAO didint bothered me at all while the time skips here are quite bad)\\n\\n\r\nMusic:8\\n\\n\r\nThe music quite soothing and very atmospheric but nothing that will distract and something that will make u more imersed in the series ,so it dose a good job at it.I will give it an 8 because the music itself is not groundbreaking or epic but then again this kind of story dosent need epic bombastic orchestras to hype the viewer as there are no grand battles,(exept 1 but its not that grand),so it is just fitted for the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:7\\n\\n\r\nI personaly dont care that much about the animation,as long as it is watchable and dosent hurt my eyes.So i will give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\\n\r\nThe caracters are not spectacular ,exept the \"The Demon King\",but they are likeable enough and the male MC is not bland but even if he was,he dosent appear that much in the show,anyway.There is also a scene whit one of the maids who serve the \"The Demon King\" that is very touching and the courage of the girl was very inspirational,so inspirational that she basicly stopped a public execution.Also there is a thing that allways bothered me about the male MC in this show.In the first episode he dosent seem smart at all,judgeing by how he never realised that he was used by his ppl for prolonging the war and convincing him that the demons are evil,while in the latter parts he seems to suddenly gain logic deduction and extreme auto-control,despite him abandoning his team to kill \"The Demon King\" in the begining.Also u might observe i keep refering to the caracters as \"The Demon King\", the male MC and the maid,well this is because the caracters themselves have no names which is interesting,but u might not observe during the show because of how imersing the atmosphere is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\\n\r\nOk so here i usualy write about certain things in the anime that are a bit particular for the anime and of course of my enjoyment.I enyojed this anime very very much to be honest,this is my Spice and wolf,and IMO is way better due to the fact that this show realise the thing that makes an anime about economics good is the charming red haired sexy MC and her interactions whit their respective partners ,not the economics.\\n\r\n  I keep hearing that this anime has more fanservice than Spice and wolf and is more extreme,but dont be afraid ,the boobs gimic is just that,a gimic and dosent play an important role nor dose it distract,but it sure can be seen as a flaw for those who seek superficial flaws and stop on the smallest ones and make them to seem big.\\n\r\n During the events of this show \"The Demon King\" keeps creating certain things that would make one wonder how can the demons not win in a matter of weeks when our femele MC keeps inventing this new tehnologies,some even military as seen in the last episode,but dont worry all the tehnology in the world cant hold up to the imense power of the \"Hero\".But that dosent explain the new tehnologies,well if u pay attention \"The Demon King\" has acces to a certain royal library that has stories(where she also gained the idea of teaming up whit the \"Hero\" ) and other books,some even tehnical i would assume, from diffrent worlds.",

            "content": "This is defiantly up there in my favorite fantasy stories that takes itself seriously maybe one of my favorite fantasy stories overall.\r\nThe show is good but suffers from certain things. With one being a bigger problem. But the show does have genuinely have good episodes that have good writing and good characters. The premise of the story itself is pretty good in its own right. \r\nGonna label the things wrong with this here. \"SPOILERS AHEAD\" \r\n. The story itself is good. But the pacing tends to be to fast at times or to slow. Mostly the former. We have the hero just accepting becoming aservant to the Demon King. Was explained why but at the end of the day i don't think one serving of tea is long enough for anyone to change the opinion on a sworn enemy that they've been fighting.\\n\\n\r\n. This does have the issue of the character obviously being in love with each other but never actually admitting it or doing anything about it. Sure near the end there does seem to be a understanding of their feeling for each other. But for an audience member this tends to be some that will annoy me and i know some others. While thankfully they didn't have any weird sexual scenes right at the start of the show.\\n\\n\r\n. This is the only other issue i feel big enough to bring up and this is the biggest issue of them all. The story sets up all these other stories and gives you a hint of a bigger battle happening soon and characters that you don't get to see much but you want to see a lot more later on. Only issue is that this is a 12 episode Anime with no other Season coming out. This means that everything you've seen isn't gonna be resolved and we're not gonna even see the main characters kiss, We haven't even seen them tell each others names. For the entire show everyone refer's to them as Hero, Demon King, Scholar. This is the biggest issue and is the only thing preventing me from giving it a higher score. If this was continued and the story came to an actual close this could be deserving of an 9 or 10. But unless that happens its gonna be sitting at a 8 for me. \\n\\n\r\nWhile i did mention those Three big issues don't think that is big enough that people shouldn't watch this. Sense i for the most part have already said why its a good Anime i'm not gonna go into a list of why it's good. But i will leave one other fact. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters we are introduced too near the start that seem nothing more than throw away characters actually come back near the end and play a fairly big role for the ending too happen.",

However, I think that's all you really need to see and I don't want to watch the rest, not that it's bad, in fact it's quite the opposite\r\n      It ended in a wave of possibility and explained the scenario pretty well, threw in a bit of fan service, some comedy, but remained generally captivating throughout. I liked the ending of the episode most of all because it left allot ofpossibilities for where the show can go. I thought about the episode for a good 30 minutes thinking about different ways it could go and how the story could turnout and allot of them were really quite fantastic. In terms of the reality of the future of the show, I'm not quite so sure. But just this one episode and the way is was played out really got me thinking about things in the show  and was generally more interesting and enjoyable then many other entire series I've seen in the past, without having more than 25 minutes of content in it. Maybe I'm just having a weird day, but maybe then again I'm not, either way, go check this show out and who knows, you might just think twice about trusting a review ever again.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Sidetone:First Review)",

However, this anime compensates for this by bringing in new inventions that never existed before like soda or guns within a 12 episode frame. \r\nThe story is great, with a somewhat original story and it includes some of my favourite genres, such as magic and fantasy, but I just felt a little bored by itat the start. It doesn't have the right ending, either. You can't just stop the anime during a war without having a true ending yet. If you're going for that, then add another season! \\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing; not very colourful, but it will do. The 'brightness' of the anime fits pretty well for the setting of the story. However, it would be better if the magic abilities used were more brighter and colourful,  too. \\n\\n\r\nThe music's fine, I guess. I wouldn't really say it's good or bad. However, the intro reminds me of the 2nd season of SAO (Sword Art Online). The way the song ends in the intro isn't how I would expect it to sound while listening to it. (More like lower pitched sound instead of high pitched 'Saa...')\\n\\n\r\nI like the uniqueness in the characters' personalities. However, I would like to see more of a backstory of the mages as well as the other heros. \\n\\n\r\nI like an anime where thinking, magic and strategy is involved. Therefore, I found this anime pretty enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very good anime. I hope this anime can have an actual ending, either by specials/OVAS or another season.",

            "content": "In a war against demons, a hero rises to fight and defeat the Demon Lord and bring peace to the land. However, the Hero is made to realize that demons are just like humans and not all of them are bad. To see what is beyond the hill of conflict between humans and demons - that is the proposal that the Demon Lord has conveyed to the Hero. With that in mind, they formed a contract in order to end the war with neither victory nor defeat. And we see from this anime how their plan progressed as well as the challenges they encountered.\r\nOverall, itwas a good anime although it did not really stand out much... And that is what was bad about this anime!! It was an anime with a very good story and setting which could have made it a masterpiece. However, even with that, this anime ended up being an average series with nothing special really leaving your mind behind just because the story was not told well.\\n\\n\r\nI should not have expected anything grand from a company that mainly did hentai and ecchi anime. But this just shows how bad a story teller the director was. Even if you consider the higher-ups not having a care about this series and just giving limited budget to it (so it was just given 12 episodes) as if it was just a filler for a season, the director should not have pushed through on compressing the story into 12 episodes! Unlike some other novels/games/manga, Maoyuu is a series that has many dialogues and could have been good for one episode per chapter (or at least do not try compressing two whole chapters in one episode!).\\n\\n\r\nI felt like the director was conveying the story like \"This happend. That happened. This also happened. Then that happened... Okay, we go to the romantic scene!:D And now this happened next. Then that happened...\" Honestly, I was okay with them focusing on the romance between Hero and Demon Lord and it was good. But why discard (or rather, just spoonfeed) all the other good parts? Why not express them properly so the audience could appreciate them? Every series has its own pace and they should have followed that. This is one of the best examples of a series going bad because of fast pacing. People often complain about slow pacing but this is just as bad!\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands as an anime itself, while the fast pacing is obvious, it is still a good series to watch. The art and music wasn't bad. It was just really the pacing that downgraded it from being a great anime it was supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs an adaptation, it fails miserably. While almost all adaptations are not as good as their original, this particular anime really took away its best parts. If anyone here only watched the anime, please spare some time to try out the novel or the manga. You will definitely appreciate it.",

            "content": "Maoyuu Mao Yuusha: An Economically Sound Series\r\nWhen I first heard about this series, I had mixed reactions. The first thing that caught me off-guard was that this series was being produced by Arms, an animation company profoundly known for their hentai and ecchi series. Although, I guess I shouldn't have considered that a turn-off considering a few of their non-ecchi/hentai series that they produced are Elfen Lied and Genshiken...and those two series turned out alright. The other thing that caught my attention was it was being directed by Takeo Takahashi. Takahashi is mostly known for producing hentai, but one of his most profound direction worksis the classic series Spice + Wolf. So I asked myself, would Maoyuu Maou Yuusha follow in the same footsteps as Spice + Wolf? Or would this series be just yet another typical ecchi that goes more the way of Words Worth than Spice + Wolf?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer that first question is, yes and no. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha does follow the same structure of Spice + Wolf in regards to its economical and political views. In fact, a great deal of this series focuses heavily on the economics and political affairs of a medieval setting. Maou is similar to Holo in a lot of ways as she uses her wit and wisdom to try and create a more harmonically peaceful world, through means of creating new farming systems and practical inventions. However, where this series varies from a series like Spice + Wolf is it's character focus. Spice + Wolf had a very strong focus on it's two lead characters Holo and Lawrence, so much so that there is very little development with any of the supporting characters. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha on the other hand takes a much different approach. While Maou and Yuusha are the \"stars\" of the show, all of the supporting characters play an intricate role in the series. To understand this, we need to know what this series is about.\\n\\n\r\nMaoyuu Maou Yuusha takes place in a fictional medieval setting. There is a war going on between the humans and the demons, each of which is from a different realm. The Hero of the humans (Yuusha) goes to the demon realm to slay the Demon King (Maou), but becomes sidetracked when he encounters the Demon King. He discovers that the Demon King is actually a beautiful woman that doesn't want war and even offers to sacrifice her life if Yuusha is so determined to take it. Yuusha hesitates to do so and Maou explains to him what she plans to do in order to end the war between humans and demons, as well as a plan for making the human realm a better place. She asks Yuusha to join her and assist her with her endeavors. The two seem to share an attraction with each other and agree to assist each other in a grand scheme to better humanity through agricultural and economical growth. The series is quite remarkable on how it handles the issues of agriculture, economics, politics, religion, and war; especially with how intricate these factors are when it comes to the plot. I found it to be the strength of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI also found the animation to be quite good as well. This series is extremely similar to Spice + Wolf with its key animation and character design. Judging from the plot of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, I found that to be an excellent decision considering it sets the mood for a medieval plot quite well. The music seemed to fit the theme of the series fairly well, and I'll have to admit I applaud Takeshi Hama's work on it, because he's not a very experienced composer when it comes to anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weaknesses for Maoyuu Maou Yuusha had a few obvious snags. The first being Maou and Yuusha's relationship being somewhat forced. After the first episode, Yuusha's actions don't make a whole lot of sense, especially considering how Maou is forcing herself on him on a whim. The other being that their relationship seems to receive little explanation or development throughout the series. Going back to Spice + Wolf, it isn't like Holo and Lawrence where the two develop a relationship over time through their adventures. This seemed to be an immediate attraction. Another thing that stood out to me was the time skips. This series goes through A TON of time skips as it progresses. However, if you didn't pay much attention to the series, you wouldn't notice that. This series doesn't seem to label or display settings, so you could become a little lost as to where this series is at in its setting if you're not paying close enough attention. My third gripe is the pacing and focus of the plot seems a little confusing throughout the first half. It doesn't make itself very clear as to what sort of series we are going to be in for. With how this series advertises itself, I thought this was going to be like a Spice + Wolf that puts its focus on its two leads' development as well as show the economic aspects of the series. The latter half becomes anything but as the two leads spend a lot of time separated from each other and it becomes more about political and religious corruption, war, and the role economics plays on it. To be honest, it seemed like this series suffered from a bit of an identity crisis.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with that being said, I was actually okay with this not being a carbon copy of Spice + Wolf. I actually liked the overall focus being on the plot and the entire cast rather than just the two leads. I found the messages this series was trying to portray to be quite interesting and informative. While the messages behind this series were strong, I found the actual character development to be a bit on the weak side and the relationship development between the leads to be somewhat confusing. I have noticed a few people complain about the pacing, but I'd disagree. The pacing is quite similar to Spice + Wolf, it's slow, but it's methodical and serves a purpose with its pace. To tell you the truth, I think where this series needed to improve was split up its focus. I found the series should've done more to develop the two leads more early on and then get into the intricacies of the world and the supporting staff. Call me crazy, but I found the pacing of the actual plot to be too fast. It needed to put a little more focus on its characters and a little less on its plot. Although, it's hard to fault the series for that though, in my opinion, the plot is outstanding and the strongest part of this series.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I found this to be a pretty good break back into actual series development for Arms. They hadn't produced a \"normal\" anime since 2004 so I felt this was a pretty decent break back into the anime industry. I was originally going to give this series a 7, but I found the series did a really good job of building its characters up throughout the last 1/3 of the series. It even got me to forgive the lack of development between Maou and Yuusha early on. I know I've been beating the Spice + Wolf comparisons like a dead horse, but I'd highly recommend this series if you liked Spice + Wolf. Don't get me wrong, it's not a carbon copy...but it really has the same feel in a lot of ways. It's romance is weak by comparison, but if you look at the bigger picture of the series, it seems to fair well. I do hope we will see a continuation for this series in the future because it is well set for a second season and there is still a lot it can do with it's plot and character development.",

If you want to know what the story about read the summary or other reviews about this anime.\r\nWhat I Like:\r\n- The storyline\r\nmost people find themselves hard to understand what the story are about (all my friends seem so) but no for me. Maybe because I've played tons of RPG and strategy games that I can easily grasp what this anime tries to convey from the first two episodes.\r\n-The soundtracks\r\nthe soundtracks help me immerse myself into the 'world' for this type of anime. As how the soundtracks for RPG games are very important, as well as this..wellyou got what I mean.\\n\r\n-The art\\n\r\nThey looks nice. Quite an eyecandy. That useless meat.. O_O''\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Dislike:\\n\r\n-The character\\n\r\nThe main character, Yuusha. What the hell man? You are TOO DAMN STRONG. It is like an online MMORPG character, with all the stats and skills are maxed! Even might gone over 9000! If the character is too strong, the would be less emotional feels when watching the anime.\\n\r\nFor example, if you play a game, but the character is too strong that even an enemy would die from a single slash, that would be boring, isn't? \\n\r\n-The ending\\n\r\nI did like the storyline, but a storyline with a bland ending would ruin the story. There are still more plot holes that need to be filled. Also, the story feels like it was rushed. I did not read the novel but that's how I feel when watching the last 3 or 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWell there are also some other things that should be mentioned, but I think most of the reviewers would already pointed it out. And I'm too lazy to write it.\\n\r\nOverall I feel like it needs second season to fill the plot holes, or if not I would not be satisfied.\\n\r\nThe same feeling when I had finished watching Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu. Almost the same type, setting and storylines with this anime. But the fucking cliffhanger ending made me raged for days =_=''.",

The unfortunate thing for this anime is that it is not nearly long enough.   What could have been spanned over 24 episodes is crushed down to 12, and because of this the stories development and flow suffers. \r\nThere is a lot going on in this anime at any given time.  You\u2019ll find that there is as many as three major plot lines going on at once.   Really felt like they tried tocut up a good story to make it fit into the time frame of a single season.  Which is kind of disappointing considering there is major character development happening with several characters all at once over the course of a couple episodes.  You\u2019re left wondering what the hell happened to certain characters and how they suddenly developed or what happened to them to cause them to change. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the art\u2019s good, the sounds good and the overall enjoyment of the show is good.  However, because so much got packed down into 12 episodes it kind of ruins a good chunk of the anime.  There\u2019s a lot of disappointment for me on how certain characters became the way they are at the end, what happened to cause certain events, and why the hell certain characters were played as important key notes in the anime only to get a few minutes of airtime and no answers to their story.

It's a political intrigue centered on a helping a country stuck in a war machine improve it's condition, and not depend on war for it's economy. The show touches on agriculture and economy, so it is a bit educative.\r\nThe main characters are not seen often, as they are working behind the scenes. I wish they expanded more on their motivations and history. The way they are referred to by nouns rather by names gives an idea how they are not the main focus. \r\nThe two main characters are fairly quirky. The Hero is positively overpowered, butdoesn't think much of it and only uses his powers when appropriate. The Demon King is the leader of the demons, but contrary to expectations of the in-world characters, is selfless and deeply humanitarian.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character duo have a heart-warming chemistry, i wish they had shown more of them together, the light-heartedness is what drawn me in at first but it was pretty lacking in all but the few first episodes as they went their separate ways for errands.\\n\r\nThe side-characters felt mostly forgettable. It's part of the narrative style of only touching superficially characters, as the focus is more on the story than the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art & sound were adequate.\\n\\n\r\nI felt like there was a lack of information in some parts, and superfluous details in other places.

            "content": "Note: I have not read the novels nor the manga before I watched the show, so I would like to believe that my opinion is unbiased and holds some truth.\r\nI stumble upon this anime as many call this the \"successor\" of Spice and Wolf (S&W), one of my all time favorite. And after marathoning it in one sitting, I have to say that Maoyuu Maou Yuusha doesn't quite reach the standard that S&W had built for itself.\r\nThat being said, this is certainly an enjoyable anime even though it is not quite as good as S&W, it does have the elements of what makes S&W great.\r\nStory:\r\nBasicallythe summary, it may sound innovative but it feels very cliche as the protagonist simply agreeing to whatever the heroine has to say. Though they made up for it with turns of events after turns of events. However, it feels very rushed, as they only have 12 episodes, also the ending was unclear, it's kind of hinting at the idea of a season 2 but I don't think we'll be getting one anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSimply visually appealing. It's as simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt has great art, but the sound that runs in the background doesn't quite match what my eyes are looking at. It's not necessary that you have happy soundtrack during an intense moment or a sad scene, but more like, it doesn't really match up with the great art style it has. Also, both the opening song and the ending song doesn't compliment the anime at all (especially the ending).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat is generic is generic, we have an overpowered protagonist who is 90% muscle and 10% brain. Who somehow learns how to use that part of him half way through the series. And then we have our heroine, who is 100% brain and can seemingly do anything by herself except those of her daily necessities, of course, then falls in love at first sight with our \"hero\" and demand him to be hers.... come on, we can do better than that. More importantly, their relationship status doesn't seem to have changed in any ways, and I do not see any sort of character developments either. On top of that, there were also many background characters which we know nothing about, especially those from the hero's party (mage and old man). The only character with any real development is the Winterland's young king and the big sister maid. Also one more thing, lack of names for the characters....? Not a very smart idea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nNot a bad anime, right concept and idea, acceptable execution and too little development for characters who are supposed to be the main cast.\\n\r\nIt's a pretty serious anime if anything, but it is quite enjoyable, not as good as S&W but if you are trying to learn some real time economics and politics, this is the right place. And of course, if you miss Lawrence and Holo, then maybe you can find some consolation as I had, just a little though.",

It has great animation (BOOOOOOBS) and changes things up a bit by putting a large focus on... economics and learning. If you love Spice and Wolf like I do, you'll find something to like here. OH THE JOYS OF ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION DURING TIMES OF WAR.\r\nAs forthe cast.... how could I forget such characters such as the Hero, the Demon King, or even female knight... no, I did not forget their names that is really what they go by in the show. No one actually has a \"name\" in this story. There's romance in here among characters but nowhere near enough to bring a tear to your eye. A \"That's a nice moment\" at most.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really see much of an improvement in a 2nd season unless the story really diverges from how it flows now. If you're really interested in this series I would suggest reading the light novel instead. Scenes and moments have a little more impact when there isn't a time constraint. Imo I found it to be much better.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha.\r\nReading the words education really scared me off at first sight. I'm ashamed for saying so, but it was also why i left it to rest before even considering it a anime valuable to watch.\r\nAlthough the first episode is extremely.... Cheesy, it rolls into a story that's amazing to follow. Why? Well, simply because they make the story very, very believable due stable and realistic ''regulations''.\r\nWhat i'm trying to say? What i'm trying to say is that almost every action anime is based on one or more protagonists which are not envolved with the politics and the situation globally over the country.\r\nIn Maoyuumaou Yuusha these problems are shown as it's in reality likewise to happen. not enough food for the people, beliefs which put down free will, differences in people and language, and ofcourse Merchandising.\\n\r\nI didn't know a anime could be as much fun to watch as it's educational, with the swordplay added. Well done, Arms. It's unique due the fact that all characters do not own a specific name, but have their roles as their calling names.\\n\r\n'\"Hero, Demonking, Knight, Mage, Mercanery, merchant'', and so on. The plot is very well written en thought out, And doesn't contain any scene that's not necessary to the story.\\n\\n\r\nIn our nature, we always think we are the ones who are right. who are the ''good'' ones. but in war, no one is good or bad. it's just what side you're on.\\n\r\nand in this anime, it's shown so formidable how wrong you can be. not only, it shows how a war really is helt. how the politics work in consideration of merchandise and the roles \\n\r\nof the people with belief in god. It contains life lessions, and it contains the lighthearted comedy and romance that makes most smile.\\n\r\nIt's good anime. it doesn't stand out in a theme, but more in it's more realistic explaination on matters. it doesn't skip the reasons or the work in the background.\\n\r\nit's not standing out in action, in romance, comedy or drama, but in it's output on reality, even though the world is completely fiction.\\n\r\nFor some this might not be the anime as it will attract a smaller group of people, but just because of this dare it succeeded in it's goal.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe art, frankly, fits the theme just right. it's not oversketched but misses it's details just where they can be left out.\\n\r\nBesides, it's alot better then their previous work, Elfenlied. It's a bit dissapointing though since they did perform really well in Hagure no yuusha estetica (especially with the female scenes).\\n\r\nThe backgrounds though, are amazing. they are true artforms in my opinion. besides those, the effects and lightplay are sparkling from the screen, which really makes me forget about the sometimes\\n\r\nshallow eyes.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nstory\\n\r\nThe Story is so well constructed and told, i'm really amazed about it. It switches well between it's lighthearted themes and knows the moments to get serious. What is so special about this, is that the protagonists really search for a bond with the other characters as they are needed for reaching that world peace. Unlike the random anime where they practically fall out of the air in the protagonist's life.\\n\r\nThere aren't any lame interruptions in the scenes and the story knows some pretty intense emotional-buildups. It's unique setting and relation to the real time world just gives the story an extra impact on the watcher,\\n\r\nwhat makes the anime just so much more entertaining to watch.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nsound\\n\r\nlet's start with the opening: One of the best energetic opening theme's i've heard in a long time. \\n\r\nThe music themes trough the anime just smoothly fit the story, with the themes slowly pulling you deeper into the plot.\\n\r\nWhat i adore is the voice acting. it's very well performed, but what else would you expect from the voice actors of Code Geass and Jiraiya himself?\\n\r\nThe music effects are perfectly synched and do not lack or fall behind, what is really rewarding for the watcher.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\ncharacters\\n\r\nWhat i really, really like, is the fact that every character in the anime has a very important role in the plot AND change in personality quite a bit.\\n\r\nTo make such thing happen you need alot of background script and rewriting to actually get this done. There's been alot of effort in making this anime a good story \\n\r\n, making a huge impact on the watcher who follows the whole story and understands the interactions and reasons of their acts.\\n\r\nyou do not get any background story at all, but that's good; if you get a background story, there would be personal grudges and the goal of the anime would fail. it's about a war which has to be stopped, not personal grudges that only causes a winner in the war.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment\\n\r\nHard to admit; i really enjoyed this anime, especially because i've learnt from a anime that was supposed to be a way to relax; and i did relax, while learning. It's got everything, really. Romance, education, comedy, little bit of ecchi, action, politics, drama and supernatural. Pick your favorite!\\n\r\nBut to keep it decent and short (so many **** complaints that they are too loooooooong -_-) if you have 4 hours of time, just watch this anime.\\n\r\nit's worth it time and you'll learn something from it, too.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nscores\\n\r\n_________________________\\n\r\nart: 8\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\noverall: 8\\n\r\n_________________________\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review. i'll see you next time ;)\\n\r\n- Zumorito",

            "content": "people out there must be wondering about this anime and all its concepts.......\r\n  the story of this anime is pretty funny and commercial when it starts off. but everything is slow moving and it has to do more with war and deal and merchants more than romance. sure theres a dash here and there where the demon king so called is all over the hero and the knight as well and many other girls but that's like only for a minute or 3. other than that the story was really slow and would make a great movie if it were put intoreality movies for war but overall it still a nice story but its only confusing if you don't listen to the conversations sooner or later youll be like why the fuck is he wanting to fuck her or something like that -_-...... jk\\n\\n\r\n  the art style of this anime is also a popular type of drawing that could keep viewers eye level to a satisfaction point to where it keeps the viewer interested. the art is very contrast and modern so its very well done and the backround is pretty standard scenes but it almost as if you were staring at an oilpaniting of a castle or forest so I guess its pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\n  the characters here are all pretty complicated but some of them are well shown well only for those who are the main focus of the anime but it has too many characters to introduce in 12 episodes so your probrably wondering who the fuck was that blue guy sitting on the thrown like a gay blue pile of shit surrounded by more blue piles of shit but anyways that's not the main focus here but overall the main characters are the focus here so I guess it okay. to add on the demon kings personality is very somewhat -_-....... vulnerable. I mean she almost gave into the blonde hair guys seductive moves when she totally belonged to the hero which made me want to slap the shit out of her but that my opinion eheh ^_^\\n\\n\r\n  Thank you for reading this. if this is your first time reading welcome and I will be posting more reviews throughout my stay here or my time here well of course I have to watch anime and if this is not your first time reading one of my reviews then thank you for following me ^_^",

And then it just quits. If this is any perspective: I found the anime and watched it the year it came out. I watched the last episode, but didn't realize that it was the end. I forgot about it, but returned to \"finish\" it 2 years later, only to be thoroughly disappointed by how badthe ending was.

            "content": "There is a common problem, that old demon series shared: The battle through the countless pawns to get to the final boss, the demon king and defeat this evil monster. This concept is nowhere near interesting because the outcome can be predicted after the first episode. Instead of a 2D approach of this topic, this show decides to rather expand on the aspect, that demons have feelings and are an intelligent life form too.\r\nThe series starts with a hero, who is supposed to be the strongest human, striving to defeat the demon king in order to end the war. Instead of finding an overpowered evilbeing, that reeks of power, he finds a female demon king, who wants his help because she wants a peace, in which everybody can live. After she convinced him of her reasons, they join forces and travel to a town, where they settle down.\\n\\n\r\nWhile they are in this town, they make their first attempts to tackle the problems, that arise from war and peace. Because the demon king is a smart one, she is able to create several inventions and establish a stable trading. The townspeople look up to her and thus she takes some of them as students. Although they have a weak characterization, they contribute to the story later on and aren't tossed away, attributing to one of the strong points of the series. Several wars occur and become fiercer to the end with economy playing a central role. These aspects make up for a rather refreshing story.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, the story introduces a very low amount of them. We have our two protagonists, the Yuusha (other names aren't mentioned)[hero], who is the strongest one in history, but seems to be caring and very emotional as well, and Maou (neither another names mentioned) [demon king], who is very smart and strives for peace and a bearable life for both sides. While Maou gets a good deal of characterization because she is featured in most episodes and is the center of the economy aspect, which dominates the screen time, Yuusha seems to be forgotten over time and doesn't have a lot of screen time and characterization. He uses some spells here and there, but his character is mostly in the background and doesn't get a lot of attention.\\n\\n\r\nAnother characters, who get a great deal of attention, are the Onna Kishi (no other names mentioned) and the maid, who is picked up in the first episodes. Their thoughts and struggles are shown in the series and are developed throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite of all the positive aspects, the series has major problems, that aren't resolved. One is the relationship between Maou and Yuusha, which is really underdeveloped and dodged by Yuusha's travels for missions. Not only that, but their relationship seems to grow out of nowhere (especially from the side of Yuusha), skipping important points of it.\\n\\n\r\nYuusha is another problem I have. I know that Maou is the center of the plot. But that isn't a reason to disregard Yuusha's character development and dismiss the strength he has. He seems to be capable to do everything and shows no kind of weakness in terms of strength. The series desperately tries to show certain thoughts of him, but fails nonetheless in the end and is like a machine in the end. Even the maid has more development.\\n\\n\r\nAnother weakness is the pacing of the story and the end. It's fine to go into detail with several topics like economy, war, human traits, but if you don't conclude the story and its topic, you have failed. And this is what happened with this series. The major focus on many topics leads to an unsatisfying conclusion. The war between the demons and humans isn't over, the female mage isn't properly characterized even though she plays a role as well (we know next to nothing about her) and the conflict in the country is left open too. Dodging the central topic of the anime is a way to leave the story open and to not think about a proper way to deal with it. This problem contributes to a major degree as to why my score for story is really low even though it seems to be appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of the series is okay. The animation is not really noticeable and average, but the music made up some of my joy. It manipulates some scenes to be really good to watch and matches the topics of the anime. While it was not great, it contributed to a proper exposure of the story.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the points I made, I can give a recommendation with a warning. This anime has a very slow pace and can be pretty hard to swallow at times. The presentation, while being okay, is no big deal either. If you're fine with a mix of topics revolving about war and economy and don't want an end, where all questions and topics presented in the anime are resolved, then you should give it a try. Otherwise, it will probably be disappointing and boring because there is next to no action.",

It has great animation, music and sound. (reminds me of the anime: Spice and Wolf)\r\n3. very suspenseful, I feel like I want to watch more after every episode.\r\nIt's unfortunate it's skips a lot of the action sequences.\r\nIt's mostly told in the perspective of \"events\" rather than the norm and the story is not laid out  (in other words, they don't just tell you this this and this, the characters would talk to each other and you wouldfigure it out)\\n\\n\r\nBut this should not stop you from checking this out! If you someone who enjoys magic, fantasy MMORPG games and anime, I am sure you can enjoy this one. \\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend!\\n\\n\r\nMy name is Vincent Law and I approve this review.\\n",

            "content": "I've been wanting to watch this anime since it started but i don't enjoy waiting weekly for a episode so i put it off until it was finished but then still only recently watched it. I'm a big fan of anime with romance in it which put Maoyuu Maou Yuusha above plenty other anime that i want to watch but i felt really let down upon finishing it. \r\nFrom the start, the first episode got me hooked and i put a little ending in my mind of how i would like it to turn or or what i expect it to turn out like. Evenwith this outcome set within my mind i would be happy with someone similar but like that dream which it should be called now was crushed. I'm not saying that the anime was bad but i'm saying that it could of been improved in certain areas. \\n\\n\r\nFor starters the romance within Maoyuu was poor when compared to others whether this was deliberate or not had a impact on the overall quality in my eyes. However i'm not saying i wanted something completely perverted or something that had kissing scenes left right and center but something that had a kiss in every few episodes and a strong romantic bond between the two characters. Within the first 4 episodes i found the romance to be good and looked like it would set a path out for the rest on the anime but this was destroyed and lend to the demolition of my little dream. (SPOILERS) When Yuusha travels to the demon realm in order to initially find the mage i was expecting something that would last a episode or two at most but i found my self at the point of breaking something because he was within the demon realm for more that two episodes and when he finally came back he left again.\\n\\n\r\nThis felt like it destroyed the relationship that was built up between Yuusha and Maou. I could continue with the point of romance but i'm not but instead focus on the middle section of the anime which is Yuusha searching for the mage but then ends up with him cleaning up a city and in that i mean sorting out all the soldiers that are causing trouble. Since i watched each episode back to back it felt like he became a supporting character for a chunk on the anime. However this lead to a good story build around Maou which i found quite interesting which healed the wound slightly. \\n\\n\r\nSince this bit was me ripping into the story i will finish it off with the ending which i wont spoil but was something that felt like watching an episode of something and it feels like its half way through and then suddenly credits cut in and its finished and your like... What??? Is it... Done??? This put the final nail in the coffin for me. In terms of endings it wasn't bad and I've seen worse and like many endings this left the series open for a sequel.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the characters i'm going to comment on the main two being Yuusha and Maou. Starting with Yuusha, for me his face and personality didn't go together. For starters he's a hero so for his face i was expecting something a tad more serious which could of been done with a tweak to his eyes but however with his personality it still wouldn't fit so in reality i'm not an expert on character development and creating so i will leave it there.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character being Maou i found to be good as everything about her fit for me with the way she looks, her personality and a nice voice to go with it. However like many main female characters she does posses a slight advantage over other females within the breast department (That sounded a lot better in my head) Which in certain anime bother me (Not saying i'm not a fan of big breast) but within Maoyuu they weren't emphasized like in many other anime which completed the character that is Maou. \\n\\n\r\nNow... well... i watch anime for the story and only the story so i don't pay too much attention to the art or sound so i cant give a solid review on them but it i where to put something down about the art it would be that it looked nice as there's many different styles that can be used to portray different things which i'm not going to go into detail with as i will probably confuse my self. Same with the sound i found that a sufficient amount of sound effects and back ground music that where used to good use and the intro song was quite nice unlike the ending sound which i found really annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the overall score  i gave it a 7/10 when taking the story etc into account however i gave it a 9/10 for enjoyment as surprisingly i enjoyed the anime and i'm glad that i got round to watching it. \\n\\n\r\nFinally and truly finally the anime in all, would be better suited if it was 20+ episodes long instead on 12 so they could really express and fit more detail into some of the scenes and parts of the story. To all those who have taken their time to read this don't be put off as you will probably still enjoy it and is a anime that should be watched if your someone like me.\\n",

Unlike some of the previous animes I have seen, it seems like time progressed relatively fast in these twelve episodes.\r\nStory & Characters:  I really loved the story for this show.  I don't want to reveal any spoilers, so I won't.  xD  The story moved along quite well, and I feel that the characters just made this show perfect.  I loved their personalities, and I wish there was more to this show (I don't know anything about the manga, so I don't know if there would be enough materialfor a sequel).\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:  I watched this anime a couple of months ago, so I don't remember all the music.  But, I loved the art for this show.  I've never enjoyed watching the old animes because of their art.  But, that's another story.  xD\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series a lot!  I consider this a masterpiece, but that is my opinion.  Some people may have different interests than I do.  My proposal is that you watch this anime.  You can decide for yourself whether you like it or not. \\n\\n\r\nAll I have left to say, is that I hope there is a sequel...  The ending leaves me wanting more.  I guess that's the only con for me.  xD",

I am slightly disappointed at the lack of time the two actually spend together and the constant focus on everything besides the 2 main characters. Granted, I like the economics and politics of the show, but it felt over-saturated. Japanese anime tend to have a rushed final episode leaving a lot of loose ends because they follow a manga or novel. This is no different. I doubt it will get a season 2 to resolve anything as this came out in 2013. All in all, it was decent. But the lack of any true romance or kissing between the 2 maincharacters is a real bummer for me since I like anime with a strong romance sub-genre.",

            "content": "Short and flawed but definitely interesting. I was swithering a bit between a 6 and a 7, but watching MMY was enjoyable on the whole, so I thought I'd be nice and round up.\r\nI give it a lot of credit for really delving into the politics and economics of a fantasy world in a way I don\u2019t think I've seen in any other anime. Having a front row seat to a feudal/medieval fantasy society being dragged into the renaissance by an outside influence was extremely compelling. \r\nUnfortunately while the overall plot was interesting and the characters themselves were perfectly charming, there wasn\u2019t a whole lotof development going on in the latter department. The central romantic subplot is set up in a very interesting way in the first episode (actually I think the first episode in isolation might almost stand as a single shot OVA in its own right), but ends up feeling really half baked. The stereotypically anime \u2018will they/won\u2019t they\u2019 thing it juggles for 12 episodes comes off as bizarrely juvenile considering the surprising maturity of the political stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIn general with the characters, the fact nobody has a name and everyone is just referred to by their occupation or title\u2026 Eh, I think I see where the author of the original novels was going with that and maybe it works better there, but I think it just ends up putting a weird barrier between the characters and the audience. There's a reason almost every fish out of water robot/alien/mutant/AI/demon/whatever character gets at least a short scene or subplot about choosing or being given a human name. Proper names have significance for identity, not just for basic identification.",

            "content": "Ahhh, Maoyuu. I originally watched this thinking it was a romance anime (what can I say? I'm a sucker for enemies turned lovers). I was pleasantly surprised when the romance soon wasn't the foreground anymore. This anime has a very Spice and Wolf feel to it. Especially Maou, she is crazy analytical, she wants to end the demon-human war, but not by decisive battles, she wants it to come to a negotiated close. She doesn't necessarily want one victor over the other. It's quite clear, her intentions. Her character is amazing, she may be a woman who is very bouncy, but she's also very intelligent!The character development of the \"Older Sister Maid' was absolutely fantastic. (Reference to episode 9-won't say more because spoilers) Maoyuu feels like a nice change to common fantasy animes that can get too caught up in their lore, it then feels almost lethargic. This one takes a different stance that feels very refreshing. The battle scenes are super op, the main ones at least, but that didn't bother me too much since Maoyuu doesn't rely on that. There is one battle scene in particular I really enjoyed and pretty much erased the OP factor, even if only for a bit. The story did feel rushed in some areas, but with something like this getting 12 episodes that's almost a given. I really wish this would have gotten a season 2. They could've done so much with it.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Maoyuu Mao Yuusha. I expected a bit more from this show. I think it's rather well done for the most part, but I feel a little let down.\r\nThe story has a strong foundation. We start the show with a war between humans and demons. One man called Yuusha splits from the other in his party to take on the demon lord on his own. When he arrives he finds its a woman and she loves him and wants to bring an end to the war through improving the world. Many of the early episodes are the heroand the demon lord getting to know one another and begin to influence the world at the very basic level. The scope of their schemes begins to grow larger as the show grows and it seemed like it would have come to a finish by the end of the show(it does not).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is dated but great. The soundtrack is pretty good and the voice acting is top notch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seemed like they would be more interesting. Maou is very intelligent and is trying to change the world through inventions and ideas being put forward. She has a girly side too, even having pillow with Yuusha on it. Yuusha is extremely over powered. He isn't very smart and is mostly a pack mule and convenience. \\n\\n\r\nThere are several more supporting characters so I wont list them. The characters each get plenty of time and the world they try to build around them does seem to be interconnected. That being said it feels a little bland. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime alright, like I said earlier I feel like I left empty handed. The story had a strong premise and I do believe it could have been really great if they were not constrained by 12 episodes. However it feels choppy, one moment its a fantasy show, the next we have politics, but we never dive into either realm deep enough to be interested. It feels like we are sitting between two foot pools just laying out feet in each and never exploring either more than that. The characters were also flat, nothing really sparked me as impressive or interesting. The dialogue that also happens that the show clearly wants you to feel attached to is also kinda fuzzy and roundabout. It's not hard to understand what they are saying, it just feels like \"sound and fury, signifying nothing\". \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Not bad, not particularly great either. Kinda bland, doesn't explore either of its themes deep enough to be interesting. Dialogue is vague and feels to have little importance.",

There's some magic and teleportation in the mix. \r\nOver all, biggest regret is how short it is...12 episodes is simply not enough for everything that happened there..they needed at least 26...some character backgrounds, prequels detailing war, action filled episodes... and most of all...this anime feels unfinished...Ihope they make a second season...\\n\\n\r\nStill, with all these huge imperfections, why did I give such a high ranking? Because this anime is very unique. It basically talks about humans vs demons fight, and bringing peace and equality to their realm, but not through Tengen Toppa, Guran Laggan, bolstering of badassery (although main protagonist could probably easily do that) but through careful usage of economics, politics, agriculture, medicine, education and negotiation tactics. In other words, here, reality is primary and magic and fantasy is secondary, the behind-the-scenes view of the war was the most important part here, and I felt like magic was completely unnecessary...and main protagonist's friends...just existed to patch sometimes broken storyliine...in other words...this anime had phenomenal potential to be the best thing ever...and if they continued the way it was for the first episode- it very well might have...kind of reminds me of outlaw star's disappointment after the first 2 episodes...meh...",

The main character is simple and consistent as well as the Demon Lord. There's really nothing special in this show but it handles its characterizations verywell to deliver a strong feeling of belonging to a community and trying to fit into society. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a fantasy slice of life.",

It deals with economic and philosophical changes in a middle age style world.  The character names bother me because they are nothing more than job titles, people actually use these as names: Merchant, Hero, Soldier, Female Knight, Mage.\r\nThe protagonist is an overpowered character who does his best not to use his powers.  He is also the annoying type of male character who is easily flustered by and scared of women.  Thereis a bit of fan service, but nothing extreme or frequent.\\n\\n\r\nThis show will not be enjoyed by everyone and it's a bit difficult to determine previous shows that might indicate someone would like this.

            "content": "The basic premise of this anime is a fantasy world, where humans and demons are at war, the demon king convinces the legendary hero to instead form an alliance to end the war in a more peaceful way. While there is some jiggling from time to time, the fanservice isn\u2019t really the focal point of any one episode, so if you\u2019re looking for less plot, you might want to check out Senran Kagura instead. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is mostly about the economics of the anime\u2019s setting, a world very similar to the middle ages in Europe except that there is also the fantasy element ofthe demon realm being accessible. There is also a romance element between the Hero and the Demon King (and a bit of a love triangle later on).\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t names for the characters, per se. Each character is named what they are, like Hero (Yuusha), Demon King (Maou), Female Knight (Onna Kishi), Head Maid (Meido Cho), and so on. From what I understand, this is because the light novels on which the anime is based are written like a play. In any case, I really enjoyed this anime because there\u2019s a lot of politics and economics and for some reason, stuff like that interests me. If you\u2019re not a fan of those types of subjects, you might not like it much.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \u201c\u5411\u304b\u3044\u98a8\u201d (Mukaikaze) by YOHKO is pretty good, though her voice is a little high pitched for me, personally. My favorite characters are Hero, Demon King, Female Knight, Head Maid, and Big Sister Maid.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope there\u2019s a second season.",

            "content": "If there's a show comparable to what Maoyu offers up, it would have to be Spice and Wolf. Like Spice and Wolf, Maoyu delves into complicated affairs on aspects to a medieval world and explores the chemistry between the male and female leads of the series. In the case of Hero and Demon King, both are trying to resolve the conflict between both demon and human kingdoms to prevent all-out war from breaking out and setting up a scenario where both sides would resolve their issues and benefit from it. While this premise would seem to spin on the idealistic side with what our twoleads are attempting to do, the show adds a refreshing twist to it in the fact that both characters know that their goal is a very difficult one to achieve thanks to how elements within the societies of both humans and demons play out thus they will have to carefully plan things out to make their ideal scenario a reality. This results in the two accomplishing differing goals to lay the foundation for their reality: Demon King becomes an adviser to the ruler of a kingdom and offers up various areas of knowledge such as educating commoners and cultivating methods while Hero tries minimizing conflict between the two races with his powerful abilities in magic and combat. The series also does fairly good in establishing its world as it explores the imperfections to both human and demon society with slavery, oppression and corruption among those in the wealthy and religious. Only issue on the plotting end is the lack of proper resolution for the series.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the plot and world building, characterization is a bit of a mixed bag in Maoyu. Unlike the chemistry between Holo and Lawrence, there isn't as much prominent focus on building up Hero and Demon Lord's relationship as the plot gets more of the focus here thus the chemistry isn't anywhere as dynamic or interesting. The anime even tosses in a half-assed attempt at making humor off a love triangle with our leads and Female Knight at points within the show which is just as underwhelming as the show's efforts to convince you in buying Demon King and Hero's bond. Because the show spins their bond as being \"destined\" and we get no fleshing out of Female Knight's bond with Hero, the romantic implications aren't too convincing here. On the plus side, some of the supporting characters in the series get their fleshing out to show how the current society affected them and what eventually drives them to oppose their faction's way of doing things.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is a high quality one with vivid scenery, detailed character designs and having nicely animated sequences with battles and showing off supernatural elements like magic and spirits. The music does its part to complement key scenes mixing light and tense tracks, but nothing in particular stuck out with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Maoyu offers up an engaging plot and solid world-building in exploring the challenges Hero and Demon King face in trying to accomplish their goal to unify their sides. The so-so characterization and lack of a proper ending are minor bumps in what is otherwise a decent fantasy/ education/ action title.\\n",
