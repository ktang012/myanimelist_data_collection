            "content": "Higashi no Eden (or Eden of the East however you want to call it) is a new anime series produced by Production I.G, and it was one of the most anticipated series of the Spring 2009 season. After quite an impressive trailer before the anime aired, I just knew I had to watch this show which looked like it had a lot of promise. Did it live up to my expectation? Read ahead to find out.\r\nStory: \r\n+ This anime definitely brings a very interesting plot.\r\n+ The level of mystery and suspense will leave the viewer wanting more every episode.\r\n+ Definitely one of the most refreshingstories in recent seasons.\\n\\n\r\n- Its is only 11 episodes long, a very uncommon number for an anime.\\n\r\n- The ending leaves you with a cliffhanger that the movies are expected to resolve.\\n\r\n- Because of the # of episodes, plus the announcement of 2 movies. The anime ending does not feel like it brings any closure to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Fantastic art in both characters and backgrounds throughout the anime.\\n\r\n+ Very artistic animations for both the Opening and Ending themes.\\n\r\n+ There is really nothing bad to say here, this anime brings some nice eye candy to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Very good OP and ED songs. They are really cool to listen to.\\n\r\n+ The soundtrack is also really good, complimenting some scenes really nicely.\\n\r\n+ The voice acting is solid through the series, specially for Akira.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n+ Takizawa Akira is main driving force in terms of character in this anime. He is pretty much the only one who constantly shines.\\n\r\n+ Other Selecao members are all unique and different in personalities, and are also very interesting people and have some good development (as short as some may be).\\n\r\n+ Akira is as mysterious as a character as he is likeable, he doesn't take things TOO seriously and also provides some good comedy.\\n\\n\r\n- Saki, despite being likeable, just doesn't seem to contribute much to the overall plot despite being a main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime was highly entertaining, despite ending in a cliffhanger it left me wanting more every episode and it would never feel boring. With the movies set to bring a conclusion to the anime, I can't wait to see them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Higashi no Eden proves to be a very enjoyable and entertaining anime which brings some rather unique and interesting plot that will be able to keep your interest from its unique 11 episode run. However because the series itself is not complete without the movies, the ending might feel a little underwhelming to some. Regardless, this anime surpassed my expectations and its a fantastic show to those looking a solid plot, likeable characters, beautiful visuals, and enjoyable music. I highly recommend people try this anime out, I dont think you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF THE SERIES AND THE TWO MOVIES**\r\nAfter watching the first few episodes of Eden of the East (a.k.a Higashi no Eden), I was extremely impressed and very excited. I thought I had found a compelling mystery anime with lovable characters, a great storyline, and fluent animation. I couldn't wait to see what Eden had in store, so I sat through the entire series and both of the movies in a huge marathon. You want to know what it all amounted to? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The storyline of this anime goes absolutely, positively NOWHERE at any point in any of the movies orepisodes and gives the phrase \"dragging it out\" an entirely new definition. This is one of the most disappointing anime I've ever seen simply because it gets you so excited with it's engrossing beginning, and just plateaus for the remaining 90% of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nSynopsis:  A man wakes up outside the White House stark naked with a gun one hand, a cell phone charged with 8.2 billion yen in funds in the other hand, and no memory of who he is or how he got there what so ever. The man, who goes by Takizawa (even though It's not his real name), goes on to find out that he is involved in a game in which he and twelve other contestants were given 10 billion yen and told to \"Fix the country\". He meets a girl named Saki and together they go on an \"adventure\" (if you can even call it that\u2026) to discover Takizawa's past. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes, this is a compelling concept. Additionally, Takizawa jumps off the screen as a charming character with tons of personality and Saki (Takizawa's love interest) seemed like she would develop into a likable character. I thought Eden couldn't go wrong with so many stellar pieces in place. Well, it did. Very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe #1 problem with Eden is that the plot never builds into anything significant or exciting, with the exception of the end of the series portion of Eden, which was entertaining, but certainly not worthy of being considered a true climax. After that moment, nothing happens. Literally nothing. There are a few new developments that never lead anywhere, the contestants of the game start to get narrowed down, but that doesn't lead anywhere, and worst of all, the promising relationship between Saki and Takizawa doesn't lead anywhere! In the first couple of episodes, I absolutely fell in love with these characters! They had personality, they had chemistry, and they were unique! You want to know what it all built up to? Absolutely ZILCH.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings us to the ending of the anime, which I won't spoil, but to summarize my feelings on it; it sucks. There are happy endings, sad endings, and there are bad endings. Bad endings are the endings that just leave an unfilled void in your soul; the unmistakable feeling that everything you just watched has been for absolutely nothing. That is the kind of ending that Eden has.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I haven't mentioned the plotholes yet. For instance; there is one scene where a character sprouts wings and flies away. Yep, just for no apparent reason. It is never explained, it is never mentioned again, and it is the only supernatural thing that takes place in Eden. Those are the kind of plot holes we are dealing with here. It's hinted at that this could have been a hallucination but that honestly just raises even more questions if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the story to Eden had huge potential and capitalized on next to none of it. Wildly disappointing.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the highlight of the anime. Everything is pleasant to look at and the animation is always fluent.  I liked the animation style quite a bit. It never really has a chance to shine though, thanks to the general lack of action and climatic/exciting scenes, which a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is unique and pleasant to listen to. Eden also has one of my favorite EDs ever. The voice acting is pretty good in both versions, but I'm not crazy about Saki's voice actor in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe only two characters worth talking about are Takizawa and Saki.\\n\\n\r\nTakizawa, as I mentioned earlier, really stands out in the beginning of the anime as a charming character overflowing with personality. He is a great protagonist for the most part, and he receives a fair amount of character development, but he remains disappointingly static throughout the anime and his personality can only make up for so much. I liked Takizawa a lot, but he just feels like another wasted opportunity.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSaki, as I also mentioned earlier, is Takizawa's love interest. She seemed like she could develop into a great character with a distinct personality but guess what? It never happens! Are you sensing a theme yet? She ends up being a stereotypical female character who is just sort of... there. She seems to be gradually written out of the show, in fact. The relationship between these two is built up more then anything else in the show, and that makes it all the more disappointing when even that ends without giving the viewer an ounce of payoff or satisfaction what so ever.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that these are the only two characters worth mentioning and both of them are disappointments is all the information you need to infer that Eden's characters fall flat in yet another, lets say it together this time, (ALL: Wasted Opportunity!)\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair ,there are a couple decent side characters, but none of them are relevant enough to the plot or entertaining enough to take the time to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nEden of the East left a disgusting taste in mouth. It builds you up and builds you up and builds you up only to have no payoff at the end (or any other point) what so ever. It is a colossal waste of potential and I really can't recommend watching anything past the 11 anime episodes, if even those. It may as well of ended there, because the true ending is about as satisfying as if it had just ended after the episodic portion of anime; no closure and no real climax.",

            "content": "After seeing a score of 8.22 and skimping through reviews lauding Higashi no Eden for its intricate and unique plot, I decided to give it a try. I was also looking for more anime with a theme similar to Zankyou no Terror and one of the recommendations was HnE.\r\nSo, an anime with tags like \"Drama, Romance, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Mystery\" and a \"whopping\" score of 8.22 for only 11 episodes? I was so excited at the prospect of watching a real gem of an anime, and thought I couldn't possibly not like this series. I would surely be in for one hell of a ride!\r\nDear Lordwas I wrong... Though it was one hell of a ride, I rode straight into a big pile of disappointment and feelings of betrayal. No doubt the first episode looked promising; the story looked like it could develop in so many interesting ways, but then it almost felt like the show's shot callers did a complete 180 and decided to ruin HnE in the utmost cruelest way. I had to check multiple times if I was indeed watching the right anime. Was I losing my sanity? How could that many people think so highly of this show and I can't even bring myself to watch the 3rd episode? Was I missing something? For sure I'm missing something! I'll just keep watching; the story is bound to get better soon, that's why it got so many rave reviews. I forced myself to watch the other episodes, but when I reached episode 8, I could no longer bear it. I felt like if I watched any longer, no amount of watching reruns of my favourite animes could ever erase the memory of having watched HnE.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (3/10) could have been amazing. But after episode 1, the show kept adding so many other elements to the story, that in the end I was still not sure what the central theme was. There were also some real head scratching scenes which made me doubt if this show shouldn't add the genre \"magic\" to it. As for comedy? Besides Akira's public display of nudity in episode 1 (which would catch anyone off guard imo), I couldn't even muster a meek smile for the supposedly \"funny\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\n*****SPOILERS\\n\r\n1. A complete stranger comes up to you and asks for your pants? Sure, just hand them over. The police asking people to see their wieners in order to identify them? Sure, just drop your pants.\\n\r\n2. So 10 missiles strike Japan and not one single victim was killed? Uh, sure... I guess that... could've, might've happened?\\n\r\n3. A magic phone that grants your every request? ... I think I might've missed the \"Magic\" tag for this show somewhere.\\n\r\n4. White zombie like creatures that come out of broken electronic equipment and start hugging the MC? I guess I might've missed the \"horror\" tag somewhere as well.\\n\r\n5. A character who gets off by kidnapping rapists/sex-offenders and then cutting off their Johnnies? And she's almost killed over 20.000 men? Oh, and she was chosen as one of the 12 people who were supposed to lead the nation in the right path? But then the male MC decides that he could save this psychopath by having sex with her? Uh... I think I lost it. *****\\n\\n\r\nHowever, besides the story being a complete disaster, the animation and sound of HnE weren't bad. The animation and most of the soundtrack (6/10) in my opinion, were more suited to a romance/slice of life themed story than the Sci-Fi heavy themed HnE. I believe that the relationship between story and art is dynamic: if a story is great, even if the accompanying art is not up to par, the story will find a way to shine. And vice versa: if the art is great, even a mediocre story will get praise. But in HnE's case, the disconnection between the art and story was too obvious.\\n\r\nAnd the animation for the OP was well-done: it really gave me this \"anarchy, democracy\" kind of feel. Traitor!!!! Biggest misleading OP animation I've ever encountered...\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's delivered solid performances; none of them sounded off and voiced their characters well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters (3/10), of the main duo, Akira is the more interesting one. Who wouldn't think that after he made such a grand entrance? I thought he'd turn out to be the \"always smiling and charismatic but actually a real dark personality\"-type of character; boy was I disappointed. In the end, he was all charm and nothing else: no fighting skills (damn you for baiting me with the Jason Bourne reference), no amazing analytical skills, nope, none, nada.\\n\r\nSaki, our main female lead, only has one selling point: cuteness. But being cute can never be the only trait of a character when she's supposed to be the heroine of the story. I kept hoping she would do something, anything to contribute to the story (as awful as it was) other than gawk and blush at Akira. If you like heroines like her, than be my guest and enjoy HnE.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, I forgot. There was one thing I really enjoyed from HnE though, and that was Akira's dog. If it wasn't for the dog, the score for enjoyment (3/10) would have definitely gone down.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, HnE in the beginning was like a mouth watering steak; then someone decided that all elements of the food pyramid need to be included in the dish and they added bread, lettuce, bananas, strawberries etc and served it up. In the end, it gave me a bout of diarrhoea I won't forget so easily. Well, at least I enjoyed the OP (and to a lesser extent the ED) while I was relieving myself.\\n",

            "content": "For as long as I can remember, anime of the mystery genre have proven creatively stale. As a rule, trying to find a gratifying mystery is an ordeal much like rummaging for haute couture in a dark, creaky charity shop that smells faintly of mothballs. Foremost amongst the dust-caked offerings, Darker than Black collapses into a morbid mess; low-grade Fantastic Children keeps things cheap and cheerless; and the snail-paced Ghost Hound dulled my senses to such an extent that I never saw its middle episodes.\r\nHow delightfully reassuring, then, to discover Eden of the East; this, unlike the aforementioned failures, begins on a much higher barof quality. In fact, tapping into the hot topics of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, information technology, marginalized geek subculture, and subversive conspiracy theories, it accomplishes an astronomical level of relevancy to its early twenty-first century audience that\u2019s both rare and difficult to pull off. Like Akira emerging from a background of Cold War paranoia, Eden of the East manages to capture the Zeitgeist of disenfranchised youth of the millennium and repackage it into a fascinating adventure that anyone can enjoy. Instead of loudmouthed biker brats trying to prevent the apocalypse, there are spotty middle-class misfits with too much HP trying to save Japan from itself.\\n\r\nThe sequence of events may be ambiguous, with the script hardly pausing to explain how they connect with each other, but the pace remains satisfyingly steady. Strangely enough, like watching a master illusionist at work, the confusion contributes to the enjoyment. The series withholds tantalising facts until the last possible moment and glosses over its meandering mystery with generous handfuls of charisma.\\n\r\nIn truth, the first half of the show elicits the kind of spine-tingling rapture that only comes along once a decade when viewers inadvertently stumble upon a confident masterpiece. I could see it already \u2013 breathless fans hailing Eden of the East as the second coming of Death Note, the easy five-star ratings flying from reviewers\u2019 fingertips, and a live-action movie so popular it even makes it as far as British cinemas by 2015!\\n\r\nAll I can say is enjoy the magic while it lasts. Inevitably, Eden of the East overreaches and certain contortions of the plot midway stretch viewers\u2019 suspension of disbelief to untenable limits. At first there is a clever chase sequence highly reminiscent of Light and L\u2019s interplay in Death Note, where the mysterious hero Akira tries to save the day with the help of Juiz (a voice on his phone which grants his every wish). For whatever reason, just at that key juncture, the show follows up with a scene of such crippling farce that, despite later rationalization, it spells a stunning loss of momentum. After that, there\u2019s a long period of rushed explanations, sluggish suspense, and one or two twists desperately in need of more coherent setup.\\n\r\nFans expecting easy-to-grasp developments and a neat conclusion will end up disappointed. However, for conspiracy theorists and generally anal fans who like to pore over minute details and debate exact wordings for weeks after a show is over, this will prove quite the feast.\\n\\n\r\nEven in that age (2009) of knock-off CGI and dime-a-dozen action sequences, Eden of the East\u2019s visuals warrant some respect. The style may not be up to much, but cityscapes, monorails, museums, cars, and streets have rarely looked this good. The quirkiest aspect is the combination of hamster-cheeked characters with hyper-realistic, superbly detailed backgrounds. Although this sounds intuitively incompatible, the quality of animation is consistently high and melds everything together nicely.\\n\\n\r\nApart from a catchy opening theme sung by the established Brit-rock band, Oasis, and some excellent American voice acting during the early episodes, Eden of the East\u2019s soundtrack remains effective but wholly unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters, only Akira Takigawa leaps off the screen with his incredible effervescence. Turning up at the White House naked with a gun in his first scene certainly makes him memorable, but his charm extends beyond mere gimmicks. Akira\u2019s development reveals a fascinating duality in his personality, which ensures he is at once easy to like and teasingly difficult to grasp. His whimsical nature belies an underlying quick mind and a surprising level of gravity, the latter of which manifests itself in the messianic themes surrounding him (obvious statements that he\u2019s Saki\u2019s \u2018prince\u2019, his supposed massacre of 20,000 NEETs, the occasional deadpan expression etc). He\u2019ll delight and entrance in turn, and he\u2019ll do it seemingly without much effort.\\n\r\nEveryone else, unfortunately, gets caught in the whirlwind of his mystery without any opportunity to make their own mark. The good news is that the supporting cast, being ordinary people with ordinary problems, generally behave within the familiar boundaries of reason. Regrettably, this means that, when thrown into Eden of the East\u2019s extraordinary circumstances, they become like headless chickens \u2013 alarmingly useless. At some point, I began to wonder how many more times I\u2019d have to watch Saki mope after Akira, worrying about his terrible secrets without being able to help uncover them. Her behavior is always understandable, of course, but also off-putting for being redundant.\\n\r\nApart from that, the gaggle of weak antagonists impedes any attempt at emotional investment. The most carelessly developed individual has to be that purple-haired femme fatale whose morbid behavior is as caricatured as her looks. Being the only female of note other than the mediocre Saki, I found her constant prancing in underwear and high heels a horribly patronizing and silly portrayal. Truly, does being psychologically disturbed always have to mean being half naked? Other antagonists introduced later simply look boring, are underdeveloped, or generally don\u2019t do much of note. Viewers will keep watching simply to find out the answers to the questions set at the beginning, and not because they will care about the conflict of interest.\\n\\n\r\nI find this a very difficult anime to recommend without caveats. Objectively, I recognize Eden of the East\u2019s great achievements; brandishing an arsenal of treats, including an innovative mystery that doubles as social commentary and Akira\u2019s magnetic characterization, it will exceed expectations on first impressions. On the other hand, I feel underwhelmed by the experience. Somehow, the show misses its mark, becoming a rambling setup for the anticipated movies with convoluted themes and tenuous explanations. Nonetheless, the fact remains \u2013 for a fresh and nail-biting reinterpretation of the mystery genre (even if short-lived), Eden of the East rivals the monumental favorites on the market of that date.",

            "content": "\"The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power\". Such is a quote from one of Shakespeare's plays, and it is found in the opening credits of the anime.\r\nWhat would a person do, if they had a cellphone charged with ten billion yen, and the ability to call a strange person to do whatever you wished for, for a certain payment? What would a person do with that kind of money?  The main character is in possession in such a cell phone, but he has no idea just why, as he has lost his memory.\r\nHigashi no Eden is a very interesting anime.It doesn't follow any previously-seen anime conventions, clich\u00e9s or stereotypes. Indeed, it is more like watching a action/mystery movie or two put into a TV series format. Of note is that it is not adapted from any other media, which allows the animation company to unfold themselves freely, and it shows; original anime usually has more uncommon pacing, and they tend to bring about a fresh element or two to them. Higashi no Eden brings many. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't all that easy to follow at times. It's not a bunch of it, but some points makes you want to stop and double-turn, just to make sure you got what they went on about, an example being how a group of characters suddenly went into talking about a concept we hadn't really heard of before, like we were supposed to do, or at least have some kind of background knowledge of it. Nothing the average viewer won't catch on to quickly, though. To repeat myself, apart from some few, smaller issues here.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is a highly interesting male lead, and fortunately he does not grouse or whine too much about his amnesia; most characters who do that end up becoming bland angst-vessels with no real depth. Rather, he is cool and level-headed, heading into any situation and tackling any news with stoic ease. He cares for those around him, and while he now and then seems ambigous, especially when it comes to what he has done , in essence he's a good person with a kind heart.\\n\\n\r\nOn th sidelines is a cute young woman with the name of Saki. Morimi Saki. She accidentally ends up both meeting and befriending him during a trip to the US; and also tagging along with him back to Japan. They develop a quite interesting relationship, and as a couple have a lovely chemistry. Admittedly her character isn't as interesting as Akira's, but that might just be personal preference speaking.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the mains, you have two-or-so groups of people and a few other supporting characters, whom obviously suffer a bit from the lack of screen-time, being more role-fillers than anything. Still they prove to be quite interesting characters, and especially compelling is the so-called Selecao, the people who have received the special cell phones; to see and experience what these induvidials have done with the power they have been granted. A few of the episodes fall into the formula where an episode or two is used on their past, what they have done with their power and a small plot event leading to Akira getting to know some more about this game the Selecao are a part of.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of Higashi no Eden is its beauteous animation. It is clear-cut and detailed, with soft edges and gentle strokes. The backgrounds are all made in a gentle water-colored fashion, yet there is impressive effort put into lighting effects, the smaller details and reflective surfaces in particular. Be it a mirror in an elevator, the glassy floors of an airport, or any other such surface, they are all done with meticulous care. The character designs are a tad on the simple side however, but are still made with a flawless touch and are aesthetically pleasing. As a final touch, the ending credits are done with a rather unusual type of animation; paper animation.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the strong suit is the soundtrack and voice acting of the show. The background muysic, while not always apparent, has a lot of themes for any occasion; the more upbeat and jazzy themes, with some more thriller-esque, suspenseful lines rolling behind them, the outright creepy tunes, and of course the more laid-back music for those occasions. The opening theme Falling Down, performed by the well-known English rock band Oasis, is a peculiar song with an interesting, almost psychedelic feel over it and the lyrics. The ending theme is not very spectacular, bar perhaps some itneresting lyrics. Of course, on mustn't forget the spectacular insert song Reveal the World, which is always an experience to listen to (and which lyrics are found in the opening sequence of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn all one can say that Higashi no Eden is, for an anime, a rather interesting venture into something one ight not have experienced when watching an anime before. To quote myself, it is more like a movie or two put into a series format. It also piques the attention of some interesting themes, regarding what one would do given the money and means to accomplish pretty much anything if they really wanted. While nor a focal point of the series, it provides at least some appetizers for thought.",

            "content": "This is a perfect example of the all to familure anime falterings of having a good concept but failing completely to execute it. While the story it self is good enough to keep you interested it never really seems to go anywhere. Hopefully the movies to come will shed some more light on this but judging this as a complete series it is majorly lacking. The story starts off with a series of interesting questions and circumstances that are begging for an absolution, but few answers are ever provided and the few they do offer up just lead to more unanswered questions. You might aswell stop watching after episode 1 because the story line isn't going to get all too much clearer to you, and you'll be left asking yourself the same questions at the end of the series that you did at the end of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8- Character design is rather poor and childish but the texturing and animation is outstanding. This is a great example of CG blending with traditional animation that looks great. Some of the most interesting art in the series can be found in the ed, really original concept they used there. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9 The main girls voice is a bit on the annoying side but other than that no real complaints, this is one of the best intro songs I've heard and it really does well in summing up the themes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6- You never really grow to care for any of the characters in this. With the exception of the male lead most characters are typical and bland, and the main intrigue of the male lead is the fact that he has no memories. The main girl comes across as whiny and pathetic with out any strengths of her own aside from her looks. Undeveloped love story angles, which would have been fine not to develop if they hadn't started on that path and then just seemed to forget about it by the next episode.  There repeated use of the term 'Johnny' to refer to a penis comes off as childish and silly, in some instances it's made to be taken this way, but in other, more serious parts of the show, such as threatening to rip off ones 'Johnny' and a character that has never been treated right by any ones 'Johnny' and needs to be loved by a good 'Johnny' just comes across as bad and makes it almost impossible to take the scenes seriously. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7 For the most part I sat through this waiting impatiently for the next episode to find out the answerers to the questions raised previously, but since those answerers never came apparently it was all in vein. So while it did keep my interest for awhile, it wasn't much more than a disappointing let down in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6- I had some enjoyment while watching it but I can't particularly recommend this to anyone. Hopefully the movies (or perhaps second season?) will help to actually finish the story that they did a good job in creating. If taking this as a complete series, it fails, but as an opening to a series it could have alot of potential.",

            "content": "Eden of the East is an anime in which I have never seen the likes of before. The plot is strange, the characters are strange, and the humour is strange - but somehow it all works. Brilliantly. But first of all, I should say this: if you're a really big fan of fan service, harems, hardcore romance, hardcore action, and/or gore, then this is not the series for you. If you like plot, character development, catchy music and brilliant animation/art then read on.\r\nSTORY- 9/10\r\nFor one thing, although the plot has a bit of a fantastical element to it, it reflects what is going on inthe world today. It shows the dark and corrupt side of society, but at the same time shows it with a kind of hope for the future. It's a sad, yet warm series.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. I should explain just what is going on first. One thing about this series is that you don't know what is really going on; you can speculate, but innately, there's this sense that something bigger and more amazing is happening. It's this intrigue that first drew me.\\n\\n\r\n----begin plot summary----\\n\r\nSo, as you already know, this guy wakes up in Washington, in front of the white house, naked and carrying a pistol and a phone. A phone loaded with 8.2 billion yen in electronic cash. But...he has no memory of who he is. There he meets a girl about to go back to Japan after visiting as a grad trip, and decides to go back with her if only because he doesn't know what else to do.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you don't know (if you haven't watched the series yet). When he turns his phone on, a mysterious woman named 'Juiz' calls him and says that she is his concierge, that he is the ninth Selecao (forgive the spelling if it's wrong). We'll fast forward here, but eventually he finds out that there are twelve people picked by a Mr. Outside to be 'messiahs'. They are each given 10 billion yen and the simple instruction to \"save Japan\"; added to that, apparently it was his idea to erase his memories in the first place and bet on a whole new persona.\\n\\n\r\nIf you run out of money and Japan still isn't 'saved', then one of the twelve, named the Supporter, will kill you. Likewise, if you keep spending the money uselessly or for selfish reasons the same will happen. Only Mr. Outside knows whom of the twelve is the Supporter. Basically, you can get away with anything - just ask Juiz and she'll do it for you somehow, anytime you want (as long as you tell her). Bribes, murder, you name it. Added to that, there are some crazy Selecao out there; they truly encompass the entire spectrum. \\n\\n\r\nSo far we've met Akira who doesn't know who he is but is involved with several bombings in Japan and who wants to win the game, a murderer, a doctor, a detective, another one who is also directly involved with the bombings, a businessman and one who hasn't touched his money and only wants the game to end. The last three believe that they have found out who Mr.Outside is and are working together. I won't give away anymore, but that's the gist of it. I've heard that this plot is similar to the Bourne series. \\n\\n\r\n----end plot summary----\\n\\n\r\n*Important Note* However, if you think this is a purely a political story from how it sounds so far (reminiscent of those famous Gundam series), think again. The atmosphere is distinctly different; not as callous and involves the audience, the common people, much more.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to classify this series. It's mystery, romance, horror maybe, and a bit of slice-of-life. Maybe not so much with the horror; as I said earlier, this series has its serious moments but on the whole it looks on the bright side of things. Both moments blend together very well with the pacing to make you feel like you're there along with the characters, even if it is confusing at times. Suffice to say, the plot is great and keeps you guessing, unlike lots of other anime where you can just predict from the start what's going to happen for the rest of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, the plot makes you think, and it's definitely not self-absorbed because it deals with issues in the world today. Although the series has ended, it kind of seems incomplete (which disappointed me) because there's a movie on the way which likely concludes the entire thing more completely, so we have to wait for that now too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters. Hm. I will talk in depth about the two main characters. For me, I think Akira (the main character - the naked guy) is the one who has truly drawn me. He is very unique, but he's kind of dazzling - his personality is so vibrant and even though he's in a tough situation where anyone else would have completely broken down, he still makes jokes and just acts like himself. He does have a minor freak out, but it's more funny than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSaki, the girl, is the other main character. She's rather shy, but I think she and Akira work well together. She kind of stabilizes him I think and is the one who always seems to believe in him even when her friends start thinking he's a terrorist. It is really a compliment when I'm not annoyed with an anime girl - she seems realistic as in not too shy to the point of being ridiculous, not too naive to the point where I want to bash her head, and not too tough that she's difficult to approach.\\n\\n\r\nMost anime portray girls as being on these opposite extremities, and thankfully Saki is in the middle, which is where most people are.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves do seem very real and compelling. That and their interactions are one of the stronger elements in Eden of the East, and if you're all for character development, then go for it.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION- 9/10\\n\r\nAs for the art or animation style, if you liked the character designs in Honey and Clover, they are very similar. I think the same person made them. There's one word I would use to describe it: sweet. Not sweet as in 'sick', but sweet in that it's very gentle and pretty. The only thing I dislike about it is the nose; there's just something weird about it, especially the shadow at the bridge of the nose which looks like a bandaid in some scenes (in the picture provided by this website for Akira, you can see it). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality itself is very smooth and consistent, with beautiful bright colours and wonderful scenery. Some backgrounds look like they're painted, and in particular the water is drawn beautifully. The most outstanding moments are at dusk or when it's just become night. Overall the animation is excellent and you can definitely tell it's a recent series. Of course, this is expected from Production I.G (one of my fav studios).\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND - 8/10\\n\r\nThe music score is very unique - I would say it suits the anime because it's kind of funky, a lot of it has an English/Americanish feel which contributes to the whole wordly feeling to the anime because the series also retains many Japanese elements. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is English and rock/jazz (band is called Oasis, if you like them), and the ending is similar but in Japanese. During the show it replays these songs sometimes, but there's a lot of classical music as well, of course. Admittedly, the ending song has grown on me because I think it suits the series well. Personally the rest of the music is not really my thing, but even I have to admit that it suits the moods and the scenes, lending a great backdrop to everything and fleshing out the feelings invoked by different scenes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series immensely despite the somewhat anti-climatic ending (which leads up to the movie). Definitely one of the best in 2009 so far. It's a breath of fresh air if you're tired of harems and cliches, but once again if you're really into action then this isn't the series for you. This is plot and character driven, and is thought-provoking. It's also very easy to follow, because the subs come out really fast after the raws come out (either the day of or the day after), and it can be found basically on any anime website and even youtube. I recommend  because they update new episodes right away and it's easy to navigate, with only a few popups here and there.  is also good.",

            "content": "One day, in 2011, a Japanese university student by the name of Saki Morimi is visiting America. When she throws something into the Whitehouse courtyard, the security guards quickly start questioning her... but she is quickly granted a distraction by our protagonist, Akira Takizawa, who has appeared outside the Whitehouse completely naked, with a phone in one hand and a gun in the other, and absolutely no recollection of who he is or how he got there.\r\nSaki lends him her coat, but quickly comes to realise that she left her passport in there, causing her to chase after him. Meanwhile, Akira finds a large amountof weapons at his apartment, along with several fake IDs. As the series progresses, Akira finds out that he is part of a group called the Selecao, who have each been granted an enormous sum of money, and a phone connected to somebody called Juiz who will use this money to carry out any command they are given. Their cause is to use this money to save Japan.\\n\\n\r\nAs you've probably noticed by this point, the premise of this series is absolutely bonkers, and in the best way possible. It comes across as anime's take on American spy thrillers, and pulls it off with ease. For example, a notable part of this series is their aversion to Engrish, not counting that spoken by the Japanese characters when in America. Instead, they hire actual American voice actors to play the American roles. This is, of course, only one facet of the genius put into this show's production. Watching it, it's very obvious that Production I.G. absolutely spared no expenses in making this series. The animation is absolutely top-notch, along with a distinctive art style that will be familiar to fans of Honey And Clover, whom it shared a character designer with. It's also worth noting that the opening and ending themes are both extremely impressive. For the opening theme, they use Falling Down by Oasis, which not only flaunts the massive budget they had on this, but also adds heavily to the multicultural chic the show uses. This is set over an animated sequence with a visual style that would make Steve Jobs cream his shorts if he saw it. The ending theme, while less notable music-wise, uses a very distinct style, using a stop-motion sequence made using papercraft.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this makes Eden of the East all the more disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem that appears comes up about halfway through the series, and that would be that Juiz is ridiculously overpowered. You can basically ask Juiz to perform pretty much any command, and it will magically happen. Now, in of itself, this isn't the problem. The issue isn't what she can do so much as how she does it. The ways in which the commands are executed are simply ridiculous. For one example, upon command, a truck is to be brought down to block the path. Rather than, say, a sniper shooting out the wheels, the truck falls apart. No explanation as to how this is done is ever given. It falls apart of it's own accord because somebody paid out a large sum of money for it to happen. And sadly, this isn't even the most nonsensical use of Juiz's abilities, though to name any worse uses would be to give out enormous spoilers. The ending, for example, features a mind-breakingly stupid use of it that provides a completely asinine plot twist that had no foreshadowing whatsoever, and doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. The Juiz concept does get put to good use on numerous occasions, mind you. One sequence, for example, is reminiscent of the back-and-forth mind games presented in Death Note, and is used just as well as they were there, which makes it a shame that it isn't put to such good use more often.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the \"Save Japan\" concept is underused. On a few occasions we see the other Selecao and their ideas for how to save Japan, and these are actually very good, but overall we just don't see enough of them. These ideas, and the stories behind them, are one of the more interesting parts of the series, but we only really see it happen on two occasions, most likely due to the painfully short 11-episode runtime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another disappointing part of the series. Most of the cast are just completely uninteresting, especially Saki. The only truly interesting character in the series is Akira, but he isn't exactly great either. While he's far from a bad character, he's anything but impressive. Part of his problem is that he is permanently happy. The only side we ever see to him is an all-smiles personality with absolutely no depth of emotion. Of course, being constantly happy isn't exactly a bad thing, but it's hard to get attached to a character who seems completely one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I think this entire series would have been better in almost every way if it had just been longer. 11 episodes simply isn't enough time for a series this ambitious, which is probably why two movies have been produced to follow it up. I have yet to see the movies, but nonetheless it seems nigh impossible for them to properly fix the series' faults. At best, they may give some development to the characters, but as late as that it seems like a poor idea. Really, it would have been better if there had simply been about 4 more episodes in the middle of the series. This would have given them time to make the characters more interesting and fleshed-out, shown the ideas behind the remaining Selecao, and come up with more interesting ways to use the abilities of Juiz, then Eden of the East could have been truly fantastic. Instead, it comes across more as a collection of great ideas that weren't properly realised.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: I weep for the lost potential this series has. If we're lucky then the movies will pick up some slack for it, but there's no way it'll fix everything.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 10/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "Eden of the East, or Higashi no Eden, is one of the newest ventures of Production I.G, most notably accredited for producing such masterpiece series\u2019 as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Just like the majority of Production I.G\u2019s other series\u2019, Eden of the East does not disappoint, and its intriguing and unique blend of a gripping storyline and well built suspense which leaves the viewer clamouring for more at the end of every episode, cements its place as a well needed forerunner in the modern mystery/suspense genre. \r\nThe plotline is very interesting and is revealed at a well managed pace, and this pacingcreates the many moments at the end of each episode which leave the viewer wanting more and more from the series. However, the ending is somewhat abrupt, and does not really provide any full closure to the series itself \u2013 but when it is factored in that the series\u2019 ending is actually presented in two extra movies, this \u2018ending\u2019 can be forgiven for its somewhat sudden stopping point. The intricacies of the story and the unfolding of the plot are very complex and rewarding to the viewer when uncovered, most of the time giving new questions to the viewers with each revelation. The character development is also handled well \u2013 Akira Takizawa, being the main character, of course has the most detailed development of the characters, but it is arguable that his actions practically push the plot entirely throughout the series, and his endearing personality and the hook of the mysterious events surrounding his past make him into an incredible main protagonist. Being a source of many different film references that he mentions frequently throughout the series also gives him a sense of realism that not many other protagonists can match, allowing the viewer to further understand his character.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Akira Takizawa\u2019s well developed personality, the female protagonist, Saki Morimi, does not match up as well. Granted, she does provide a plethora of interesting character interactions between her and Akira, along with her interactions with other characters. However, due to the progression of the plot, Saki, despite being a character that is likable due to her sudden involvement in Akira\u2019s world, she doesn\u2019t seem to do much at all to the plot itself, and it almost seems as if her entire characterisation results in her simply running around after Akira, rendering her character somewhat useless. Saki\u2019s friends are also not particularly developed, but this is not required, as they only serve as another viewpoint to Akira\u2019s and the other Selecao\u2019s actions throughout the series, occasionally providing their own support and launching their own investigations into the actions of Akira, giving them a surprising amount of depth for side characters. The Selecao members themselves are almost as interesting as Akira himself as far as character development goes \u2013 it is clear that each Selecao is radically different from each other, and have their own motives for their participation, be them benign or malicious. In fact, even though several of the Selecao members do not appear for more than one or two episodes each, they are developed quite well, and provide a great contrast to the actions of Akira, serving as a good selection of what could loosely be referred to as \u2018antagonists\u2019, but the reality of the each Selecao member\u2019s individual motives are much more complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction of this series is extremely well done, with both the character designs and the backgrounds handled efficiently, creating a real sense of detail and distinctiveness throughout, applying especially to the characters \u2013 their designs fit their character personalities excellently overall. The animation for both the opening and ending sequences is also very unique and stylish, with special commendation going to the creation of the ending sequence, which must have used a lot of paper to produce. Even the segments in which there are CG, it tends to blend in with the backgrounds and the other elements of the environment so well that it is difficult to notice \u2013 a very commendable feat.\\n\\n\r\nAudio in this series is also another element in which this series shines \u2013 the OP and ED themes are very fun to listen to, and also contribute well to the theme and progression of the series.  The lyrics of the OP and ED themes, notably, are very relevant to the events of the series as well, specifically \u2018Falling Down\u2019 by Oasis. Even the background score is very well designed and fit very well to the situations in which the individual tracks are presented in. Voice acting is generally very well done, and the performances bring out the personalities of the characters, from the civilians to the Selecao, extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is very enjoyable to watch, and the ending begs for the viewer to watch the movies to close the curtains on the storyline once and for all, and that is something I almost certainly will be doing. My final rating of 9/10 sums up very well the incredible combination of fantastic, well paced and gripping storytelling, the detailed and unique artwork, the amazing soundtrack and the well developed characters throughout the series. The one point deducted can only be attributed to a perhaps weak offering in Saki\u2019s characterisation and a fairly inconclusive ending, although the presence of the movies as a follow-up production practically invalidates the latter point. Anyone who is looking for the next great modern mystery and suspense series, you will do well to find better than this gem of an anime.\\n",

            "content": "2 episodes have shown and yet this anime has yet to fail me, for 2 episodes I'm quite impressed that Kamiyama Kenji has left us wanting for more, For an anime that actually runs on plot, This is quite an impressive feat, Only a few have achieved this, On the other hand, It's by Production I.G., A studio that has yet to fail the most of us.\r\nStory-wise, Eden of the East relies on it's plot more than anything else, Unlike most anime that relies on moe(like K-ON, Lucky Star etc.),fanservice(Queen's Blade) or Manliness(Sengoku Basara, Gurren Lagann), Eden of the East attracts viewers through it's story,It actually leaves you to speculate about the recent episodes you've seen, Which is(or very) rare for anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also amazed that the show doesn't even try to force itself to the viewers, While we see K-On forcing moe on our thoughts to like it(Lol Mio), EotE thrives on simplicity, Saki may be bland, but she's not as retarded as most moe characters we see in anime these days, Also, The show's protagonist(Akira, Aka IX) is quite commendable himself, Although The show has left us to wonder what power lies in his Johnny, He actually has a great personality for a protagonist, Not to mention a good knowledge about classics to boot(Taxi Driver Ftw).\\n\\n\r\nI'm also impressed with the shows awesome soundtrack, If the OP song fails you, I doubt the OP animation will, You may not be a fan of Oasis, But that doesn't mean you have to disregard a great opening just because you hate the song, The ED doesn't fail to deliver as well, An awesome song from a great band and not to mention the creative approach they did to make it look good, What's not to like?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eden of the East is a promising series, I've yet to be disappointed and i believe that you will probably experience the same thing as well, All i can say is, Enjoy the show.",

            "content": "Eden of the East came out of nowhere in the Spring 2009 season - with no works preceding it, not many people knew exactly what to expect, and with only 11 episodes, there were questions as to how one could possibly explore such an ambitious plot successfully.\r\nLuckily for all of us, however, Eden of the East, even with its brevity, managed to set itself apart, providing a winning combination of engaging characters, unique plot, and surprising depth to present itself as one of the best shows of the season, perhaps of the year so far.\r\nPLOT: 9/10\r\nWith only 11 episodes, the show pulled off a ratheramazing feat - not once did the story ever feel rushed, and not once did it feel like there was too much information packed into too small of a package. Starting off with the \"amnesiac hero\" vibe that gave The Bourne Identity series its teeth and plot hook, things unfold at a rapid pace, wasting no time diving into the conspiracies of \"Careless Monday\" and the overlying game of the Selecao as the 12 competing individuals employ their own methods to \"save\" Japan.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the meat of the story is presented quite well, explaining things at a level that gives you what you need to understand at the time and nothing more, yet still leaving enough dangling that you're actually anxious to watch the next episode, just waiting to see where the next puzzle piece fits. There were a few places where I would have liked to see a bit more explanation, but with the series not actually over yet I'll reserve judgement, as there's still plenty of opportunity for them to be answered when the two movies come out.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Eden of the East were admittedly a bit of hit and miss. The main male protagonist, Takizawa, was a hit from the minute you saw him in the buff - his charisma and quirky nature made him instantly likable. Many of the Selecao and side characters, for their brief screen time, were also engaging and personable. The female protagonist Saki, however, was a rather generic character - her only purpose in the show seemed to be as a vehicle for romantic tension between her and Takizawa, and after the plot abandoned most of that tension in the first few episodes in favor of the overlying plot, she was quickly pushed to the background, her role quickly overshadowed and outshined by almost every other person on the cast. In short, she was rather forgettable, and not much important to anything, at least in my opinion - I can't really think of many places in the story after about episode 3 where she couldn't have been removed without any ill effect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nNothing bad to say about this - the animation was very clean and well detailed, especially in terms of scenery - some of the shots of the city, especially at night, were downright gorgeous. The characters themselves were done by Chika Umino of Honey and Clover fame, so the similarities were instantly identifiable - my only complaint about this style would be some of the emotion representations, such as the \"angry swirl\" above the head (if there's a name for this style, I'm unaware of it D: ) - these seem better reserved for more comedic moments than were existent in Eden, and thus oftentimes felt out of place. There were also some times where the character designs seemed slightly inconsistent, but definitely nothing deal-breaking. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED for Eden were great - I'm not a huge fan of Oasis, but I found myself digging \"Falling Down\". In terms of background music, I really didn't find myself noticing much, being too engrossed with the story, but there were definitely no moments where I was like \"wow, that's ridiculously pretty/awesome\" or \"wow, that's ridiculously inappropriate/bad\", so the whole thing sort of washes neutral.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEden of The East was a pleasant surprise, and with two movies coming out over the course of the next year, I'm already impatient about finding out what's going to happen next. At 11 episodes, it won't waste much of your time, and you won't regret the ride at all.",

            "content": "Returning to Eden of the East was a little scary, as it always is to return to old favourites you\u2019re not sure will still hold up. A year or two later after the TV series proved to be favourites amongst critics and fans, two sequel movies came out. They were originally intended to be part of the original airing run but had to be cut out to fit into the TV airing. Those movies were not so well received. They\u2019re not actively bad per se. In fact I\u2019d call the second one actually quite good. But almost everyone was so lukewarm on the movies thatEden of the East, so highly regarded a year previously, suddenly dropped off everyone\u2019s radars and I barely see it talked about today. So much of Eden is its potential. With the knowledge that it doesn\u2019t deliver, I was not sure whether it would hold up at all.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out it totally does hold up. The story of a man randomly showing up in front of the White House naked with nothing but a gun and a phone with 8 billion yen on it is still as brilliant an opening gambit as ever. That whole opening scene is still right up there as one of my all time favourites. A frustrated college graduate travels to the White House to throw pennies at it, trying to get into the fountain but can\u2019t reach, while also feeling a little unimpressed now that she\u2019s there and it seems much smaller. An underlying frustration on the part of the youths of Japan and trying to find the centre of where that all comes from leads to her throwing pennies at the White House. It\u2019s clever, it\u2019s funny, and it says a lot about what the show is trying to do right there (also random other note: I just visited the White House last week so of course I threw a penny at it. Surreptitiously of course so I didn\u2019t need a random naked dude to rescue me).\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East is centrally about frustrated college graduates stuck without a job and wondering who to blame or what they can do. How the baby boomers fucked up the country but young adults today are not sure whether there\u2019s more they should be doing. It\u2019s fitting then that the main character is some vintage jeans, overcoat wearing hipster. What\u2019s more remarkable is how well they pull him off as a genuine human being while also being something close to a saviour. I didn\u2019t remember how much the show leaned on Takizawa Akira being modern day hipster Moses, saving the NEETs by transporting them all naked on giant freighters to Dubai. If done badly Takizawa could have come off like Tatsuya from Mahouka: A smug, self-important godlike character the writers spend the whole show sucking his dick. Takizawa instead feels like a human who had the messiah label thrown upon him unwillingly. He\u2019s incredibly angry at the whole Noblisse Oblige shtick he\u2019s been given and wants nothing more than to punch the person who gave him that role in the face.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an area Eden of the East is weak on. The animation and directing is fantastic. Despite its very heavy, deep themes, it never loses its sense of humour. It\u2019s an actively very witty show with fun characters. It never stops being a cartoon with its goofy reactions. The humour doesn\u2019t detract from its messages and story, which shows the general strength of the writing. The characters all feel suitably human and unique. No Yuji Everylead the Bland in sight and they all serve their own purpose in the story. The music is great, OP ED and insert music. It\u2019s also generally cool with Takizawa sporting a black turtleneck sweater with trenchcoat and actually making it work. With its random references to Taxi Driver and Jason Bourne, it\u2019s something you could quite happily show to a Normal and say \u201clook at this hot cool anime stuff\u201d without having to explain away anime bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything works as well as it wants. The whole Johnny snipper arc is a little haphazard. But it attempts much more than 99% of anime that I can forgive the small problem for a much more fascinating broader picture. And as I said earlier, there\u2019s no one area that keeps cropping up as a problem in a directing/animation/overall production point. The only real issue is it doesn\u2019t end completely with the TV series and you\u2019re left with the movies. But upon finishing my rewatch of the TV series, I came totally to terms with that. I don\u2019t need the movies. I don\u2019t need to see the end. The first Matrix movie isn\u2019t ruined as a spectacle by itself because the sequels exist. You don\u2019t feel angry because it didn\u2019t finish its story. That\u2019s how I feel about Eden of the East.",

            "content": "\u201c Noblesse Oblige, Please continue being a messiah.\u201d\r\nEven though it was one of the shortest anime to air recently, Production I.G. produced another excellent and satisfying anime again!\r\nThe story of Eden of the East is very creative. It reflects the current political and economical situations we are in today. Terrorists, NEETS, missile attacks and 9/11 shows that Eden of the East wants us to relate its story to what is happening in the real world. Aside from the realism that it presents, it also has its own share of mystery and suspense that adds up to the twists and turns of the story. Even thoughit is a political-type of anime, there\u2019s also a dash of humor so as not to make the atmosphere heavy and also to balance the complex plot.\\n\\n\r\nComprising of 11 episodes, the series was able to present an excellent pacing, revealing the puzzle pieces neither too quickly nor too slowly. At first we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, soon we learn about the Selecao game, and Mr. Outside. Later, the origin of the missile attacks is revealed, and finally Takizawa\u2019s identity. It manages to present the pieces smoothly without confusing the viewers. It also didn\u2019t bombard viewers with too much information in a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art and animation, Eden of the East excels. The character designs are simple and stands out. Backgrounds are very detailed. Computer graphics used in the series for the missiles, phones etc\u2026 blended well with the regular animation. High budgeted animation was definitely given for this series. As for the sound, the OP song is very modernized, and its meaning suits the theme/message of the anime. The ED song is cool to listen, it slightly resembles the OP of Honey and Clover (in terms of visuals). The voice acting is solid and matches the attitude of the characters well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting. Takizawa, being a mysterious protagonist, is not your usual, angsty or \u201cdark\u201d bishounen. On the contrary, he is very likable because he is cheerful and emotionally stable despite having no recollection of his past. Saki is likable as well, although she\u2019s just your ordinary shoujo who usually gets into abnormal situations and doesn\u2019t seem to contribute much to the anime. The other casts are unique especially the Selecao. They are very interesting, each having his/her own stand in changing the world. The casts as a whole are more realistic than animeish and tend to stay away from expected anime archetypes. Most of them were given short but good character developments.\\n\\n\r\nDespite ending in a cliffhanger, it\u2019s still very entertaining that left me wanting for more episode after another. Because the movie isn\u2019t up yet, the ending might be a bit unusual or unsatisfying for some. Nonetheless, it brings us a very unique and interesting plot, and a message that reflects our society today. I highly recommend this series to those who are looking for a different view of politically and realistic themed anime plus well-rounded characters coupled with superb animation and music.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all, Eden is an anime geared towards a more mature audience who pays attention to details.\r\nYou must not expect a typical shonen/shojo/moe based anime.\r\nThis anime is one of the most well made series I have seen in a long time. \r\nFirst off, the summary of the show may be a turn off and doesnt tell you much about the show. Here is my attempt at a summary without too many spoilers.\r\nTakizawa Akira is a Selacao, a player in a game, where the goal is to save Japan using 10 billion yen and a cell phone with \"magic powers\". Having erased his memory, hemeets Saki and as thier relationship grows, he tries to find out his past and what his purpose is as a Selacao.\\n\\n\r\nStory: the plot is so well planned out. You are led from episode to episode, where you learn new plot developments every time. It is complex, and requires thought. In the end, it is so satisfying and you want to see more. It is hard to describe the story without giving any of it away.\\n\\n\r\nArt: beautiful art and animation, especially during the ending scenes. Not your typical pretty boys/moe girls either. There are a lot of scribbled out body parts in the show, it can get a bit annoying sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: the OP and ED are wonderful songs. Although the background music is subtle throughout the series, the music in the last episode was EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the characters made the show for me. over the series, you see the characters grow and develop, love and hate, show remorse, and you feel so close to the characters. One theme touched on over the show is the current state of youths in Japan..... it is depicted so well, and you feel connection. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 20/10. I coudlnt wait to see the next episode every time and you learn to LOVE the characters. The show is confusing at times, but thats what makes it so good. If you want some brainless anime, dont watch this show. It wouldnt be worth it at all.",

            "content": "After reading rave reviews on today's title, Eden of the East, I decided to take a few days to see what all the fuss was about. The first episode opens as Saki stands in front of the White House, launching stones from outside the fence onto the open greens. The police promptly accost Saki, but she is saved by an unknown man, running around naked while waving a gun. The story then follows their adventure back to Japan and into his history which has been erased from his memory. To complicate matters, he has been gifted a cellphone that connects to a woman who cangrant any wish a human could dream of, requiring only that the wisher uses his funds to become the \"savior of the world.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can certainly understand the initial appeal of this series--a title full of average-looking, everyday folks caught in a mysterious battle usually signals a story saturated with magic realism that depends less on sensationalism and more on depth and criticism to wow its audience--I have to say that Eden of the East quickly fell into the usual traps. Much like Speed Grapher(2005), which promised to offer a more mature take on corruption and government, Eden of the East sets up a strong, interesting plotline but was both too short and too slow-paced to follow through on its promise. One strand of the story looks at a cruel serial killer who seems somehow connected to the mysterious cellphone and stumbles with what I can only describe as mediocre and stereotypically shallow execution. The ending, which was clearly meant to ensue in utterly epic proportions, fell flat, both plot-wise and visually. Meanwhile, a story like Eden of the East that struggles fiercely to become a masterpiece, typically warrants dynamic and creative directing; needless to say neither was present as far as I can see.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all its shortcomings, Eden of the East still ranks above average in its enjoyability and execution. The ED and OP were quite enjoyable, and I can clearly tell that production hired very interesting creative directors for both sequences. The voice acting, while unspectacular, demands little criticism. The animation was purposefully \"just decent\" though I would have enjoyed better camera angles and choreography. Furthermore, with just 13 episodes, it's worth the time to watch if you are interested in a series that doesn't fall as close to the stereotypical drivel that we are used to by now. Many viewers may even attribute more depth and better execution to this series than I have.\\n\\n\r\nA timeless masterpiece this is not, but Eden of the East can still be very enjoyable. It's brevity, though damaging to the overall execution, certainly still makes it worth watching on a Saturday afternoon. If you are looking for a better series from Kenji Kawayama though, this one is DEFINITELY not representative of his talents (see Seirei no Moribito or Ghost in the Shell).\\n\\n\r\nwritten for Minitokyo's Newsletter: MT-Maigetsu",

            "content": "With any open-ended question, there are various approaches that can be taken to reach an answer. The thing is, there isn\u2019t always a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer. People have different perspectives, beliefs, and personalities that may all contribute to the answer that feels most correct for each of them. \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d explores this idea by asking its characters the vague and overbroad question: \u201cGiven the resources, how would you improve a nation for the better?\u201d Eleven people that are chosen by the mysterious Mr. Outside are each given ten billion yens to carry out their plans to improve Japan. Each of them, with different beliefs, backgrounds,and occupations, attempts to \u201csave\u201d Japan from all its lies and corruption in his or her own way. Although some players end up shifting their focus to achieving their own personal goals, other players, including the protagonist Takizawa Akira, actively try to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to improve Japan.\\n\\n\r\nCurious to find out what kind of philosophical clashes would occur between the characters, I got onboard the \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d train with high hopes and anticipations. Unfortunately, this anime eventually became a train wreck piled up with plot holes, unanswered questions, and undeveloped characters (even with its two sequel movies). Above all, however, the most frustrating thing about this show was that the core question was never explored too well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that I disliked the anime. On the contrary, it is one of the more memorable ones that I have seen thus far. From the start, the anime immediately catches the viewers\u2019 attention with its distinct art style resembling that of Studio Ghibli films. Then the opening song, \u201cFalling Down\u201d by Oasis, captivates the viewers in a state of complete trance. Not only the opening song, but also the whole soundtrack is phenomenal in general, especially the insert song, \u201cReveal the World,\u201d with its soulful vocals and jazzy feel. Overall, the aesthetic and auditory components of the show blew me away at first glance and those alone were enough to keep me watching. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, however, I was more so interested in the different philosophies and ideas that characters had towards fixing a nation. Unfortunately, \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d is the classic case of an overambitious story that fails to follow through after making a grand entrance. The following paragraphs explore the issues of \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d as a whole:\\n\\n\r\n(Some of the following paragraphs might contain minor spoilers, so please skip if you don\u2019t want to spoil the show for yourself. The following paragraphs will cover mostly the first season, but also mention the two movies)\\n\\n\r\n1) An overambitious story with unambitious characters: \\n\r\nThe stage is set with 11 different people all trying to improve Japan in their own ways, but the story ends up narrowing the stage to essentially two people, the \u201cpolitician\u201d and the \u201cdreamer.\u201d All the other players more or less become irrelevant to this \u201cgame\u201d because they had little to no interest in improving Japan. That set off the first alarm to me \u2013 I would have expected all 11 people to be well developed and thoroughly explored in terms of their personalities and personal beliefs. However, the first season ends with introducing about seven players, only four of whom received the most spotlight. In addition, once I learned that some players have no ambitions to improve Japan, they became so irrelevant that I thought it would have been better if the show had not introduced them in the first place. I would rather have had the anime place more focus on its two main players, instead of trying to forcibly insert other players into the plot and end up muddling it even more. \\n\\n\r\n2) Little to no character development: \\n\r\nBecause of the scale of the story, the anime neglects the development of its core characters. The female protagonist, Morisami Saki, seems like a promising character in the first episode because of her cheerful and lovely personality. She garners more attention when she falls in love with Takizawa Akira when they meet one day almost by fate. However, this love relationship between the two becomes tepid real quick and lingers on like a flickering light for the rest of the series. What\u2019s worse is that Saki is seen as nothing more than Takizawa\u2019s \u201chelper\u201d after the first episode, and every scene that she is in thereafter is her either worrying about Takizawa or being gloomy and helpless.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Takizawa, who confuses me more and more as the anime goes on. His amnesia at the start of the show was a nice set up for the anime to develop him as he slowly learns more about himself. However, the anime fumbles around too much and Takizawa doesn\u2019t learn about himself until the end. As a result, Takizawa comes off as a scatterbrained protagonist who seems to know what he\u2019s doing but half of the time he wings it. Hence, I never knew whether I should support Takizawa because he doesn\u2019t explain what he tries to do half of the time and he never strongly affirms to what kind of a nation he wants to build until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nWith the two main characters undeveloped, the supporting cast of characters is even less developed. Namely the \u201cEast of Eden\u201d crew, a group in charge of an image recognition software, this group of characters can best be described as \u201cmonotonous.\u201d They are always around to help Takizawa fulfill his noble goal of helping Japan, but their presence is rarely a welcome sight and thus their efforts seem underwhelming. Also, their range of emotions is limited to being gloomy, serious, or mildly humorous, so that made the characters dull and uninteresting. Overall, the little to no character development is what ultimately made this show surprisingly bland.\\n\\n\r\n3) Plot holes and unanswered questions: \\n\r\nThis show is full of them, even with 11 episodes and two movies. The amount of plot holes and unanswered questions eventually reaches a point in which the show tries to take the easy way out by explaining everything at once. The first season sets up for this disastrous scriptwriting because it leaves so many unanswered questions for the two following movies to answer. As a result, the two movies are filled with mostly dialogue and events trying to explain everything, thus preventing the story from moving forward. Even if the second movie ended more or less wrapping up everything, the ending is still somewhat forced, rushed, anticlimactic, and underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nTo end, \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d was definitely one of the most memorable anime I\u2019ve seen because of its aesthetic and auditory components. However, the show fails follow up on its overly ambitious and potentially philosophical story because of its plot holes, unanswered questions, and undeveloped characters. Considering Kenji Kamiyama\u2019s other esteemed works, this show definitely deserved better but ended up getting the short end of the stick.\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\r\nOverall: 6.8/10\\n",

            "content": "Eden of the East\r\nJAP title : Higashi no Eden\r\n(Yes, I did not give this anime a score of 10 or 9. Go ahead, press the \u2018Not Helpful\u2019 option without even reading the review.)\r\nThere, now hopefully, the fanboys are out of the way.\r\nAlright, I walked in with high expectations for this one. I had read so many rave reviews about this particular show and though I would give it a shot. Was I satisfied? \r\nOnly one way to find out\u2026\r\n[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\r\nEden of the East puts forward a superb concept: letting a bunch of people, with a ton of money, play a game to\u201csave\u201d their country. This creative story is very refreshing and has and the direction has a Hollywood-like feel to it. With such a mysterious plot and an amnesiac protagonist, this anime should be brilliant shouldn\u2019t it? Well, it is, but not as brilliant as it COULD have been. Although overall, the anime is absorbing, poor characters, inconsistent pacing and logical inconsistencies prevent this anime from being a masterpiece. The animation, especially the detailed backgrounds, is fantastic and one of the best I have ever seen and reflects on the high production values. The OP was very cool, with a chic video and a solid English song, while the ED was good in its own right. The anime starts with a bang and ends with a much bigger and more satisfying bang. Sadly, the anime is quite disappointing in the episodes in between as the show tries to incorporate more genres like shojo and psychology into it and this leaves the viewer with a rather confused state of mind. And considering the whole show is only 11 episodes, this was a fatal mistake. The last few episodes were exhilarating, intelligent and were a smooth build up to the movies, but even these fantastic episodes are not enough to compensate for the irregular first half. Eden of the East is a show with so much potential, that on paper, it is a blockbuster, but in reality, it is quite a letdown. It\u2019s a wonderful anime, make no mistake about that, but it\u2019s just that it feels like winning 100$ in a 1,000,000$ lottery. \\n\\n\r\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s put you into the protagonist\u2019s shoes:\\n\\n\r\nYou are a Japanese man who is currently outside the White House and you just realized that you are completely naked. (You sort of look like Mowgli from Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book btw).  You have a slick mobile in one hand and on the other, you have a gun. You have no idea who you are, why you are outside the US President\u2019s office, how you got there or when you got there. Basically, you have lost your memory of all past incidents. What will you do?\\n\\n\r\nAlright, fine. Let\u2019s assume you somehow obtain the information that the cell phone in your hand is actually a very special one.  It has 10 billion yen charged in it and it can grant any wish. You are also told that you need to save Japan using this money and the phone. If you do not, you will be killed. There are 10 others just like you and the same conditions apply for them. Once again, the same question arises: What will you do?\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I absolutely loved this story. It was totally fascinating and I was looking forward to watching it as soon as I read the synopsis. This was like the anime version of a Bourne film mixed with The Condemned (the Steve Austin movie). Did the story live up to my expectations? It most certainly did. It had me hooked from episode one to eleven and I can\u2019t really pinpoint the reason for this anime\u2019s engaging storyline. Maybe it was the mysterious aura that surrounded it. Or maybe it was the amnesic protagonist. However, the story was the one place, other than the animation of course, where I was fully satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has an overall dark mood around it. Although the main characters prance about cities carelessly, you do feel a certain anxiety in the atmosphere as you are constantly wondering what is going to happen next. And for maintaining this nervous atmosphere, which for some strange reason reminded me of Darker than Black, throughout, Production IG deserves a lot of credit.\\n\\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for the plot though. There were several plot holes and some mistakes were just dreadful. For instance, the studio employed professional English voice actors for the Americans, something that is not often done. A very welcome choice, nonetheless. Yet, these American locals, who are introduced as people who speak only their native language suddenly comprehend Japanese. Honestly, how do the cops overcome the language barrier in a matter of minutes? And are they trying to tell me that some Washington cab drivers know Japanese while some do not? \\n\\n\r\nWhile we are on the topic of cops, here again, Production IG makes some pretty stupid errors trying to recreate the Washington DC police force. After all the homework they did trying to get the background of DC right, they could\u2019ve spent a bit more time on the creative aspect, as the intelligence level of cops is below zero and their tolerance level is ridiculously high. Although I\u2019ve never been to DC, I really don\u2019t think the cops monitoring the White House will allow a naked Asian guy carrying a pistol to get away. Hell, the first thing they do in these sort of situations is call for backup. Apparently that didn\u2019t strike the creative team, but it struck me, a guy who watches a lot of Hollywood flicks. Also, another instance of cop insanity, is when a police officer requests a guy to drop his pants to verify his \u201cJohnny\u2019s\u201d identity. Apparently, his Johnny is more recognizable than his face. There are logical inconsistencies all over the place and this sort of ruins the mood occasionally.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER START]Also, the anime tries to be as realistic as possible in the start, with the Death Note-like approach, but as the series goes on, you see supernatural elements brought into play. I mean, it starts off with a guy and a girl struggling to outwit the police, but in the middle of the series, a character sprouts wings and jumps out of the windows. I\u2019m not kidding. Oh, and the wings were black. EDIT - I heard this was due to \"graphics\" and it was all just an illusion. I dunno how that works, but hey, when there's a visual search engine that tells you about a piano with just a cellphone image of its foot, then I guess anything's possible.[END SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nAfter slandering the creative team there, I\u2019ll move onto the department that has completely outdone itself \u2013 the animation department. The animation was freakin awesome. The backgrounds were perfect and were extremely detailed. Both Washington DC and Japan have been done really well. Transition is smooth and there is an overall fluidity. A perfect ten for this department. The character designs were a little unique as well. The heads and the legs were pretty disproptionate and although this may usually make for ugly characters, the coloring and the dresses of the characters suit them so well that this minor flow is easily overlooked. Saki looks a bit chubby, in the cute way, which is something most anime artists don\u2019t do and her skin has a certain gloss to it. Kudos again! Certain chibi animations did feel out of place though.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio department has done a great job too. The OP, Falling, is done by British band, Oasis. I am a huge Oasis fan and I love their music and this track was no exception. It was a cool song that is certainly iPodable. The video for the OP was very creative too, with random messiah sayings propping up all over the screen and the liberal use of the color pink. Very good presentation. The ED too, was very innovative, with paper characters and a stop-motion animation. The vocals were decent. As for the background score, it was your usual set of instrumental pieces which get the job done. Neat work by the sound dudes :D !\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, well, shallow. I know people all over the world love Akira, but to be honest, I really don\u2019t see why. Sure, he plays cool, especially in the end, but he really isn\u2019t all that much of an interesting a character. He maybe occasionally smart, but he hardly shows any emotions. This might not have been a problem if the show tried to be just a thriller, but Eden of the East tries to be more than that and that\u2019s where it falls flat. It tries to add some shojo romance, some chibi comedy and some psychology stuff too. And in the end, there is one cook too many and the broth is spoilt. I often felt confused in the middle of the episode as I was unclear on what genre this anime wanted to fit in. The side characters are totally boring and you will most probably forget their names and their faces when you start watching a new anime. One word I know I won\u2019t forget is Johnny. (In case you didn\u2019t get it already, Johnny is a dick. Very tasteful, huh?)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Saki, the \u201cmain\u201d character, does nothing to justify her role. All she does is whine about Akira or look downcast, like her puppy died. Oh, and since this is an anime, her parents are dead.\\n\\n\r\nThere were several references to Hollywood films, which I liked. But don\u2019t worry; most of the films are the big hits, so I think you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re talking about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eden of the East is a great anime that wastes its potential due to poor plot design, average characters and irregular pace. Although this is a love it or hate it anime, I somehow manage to fall right in the middle. Agreed, some parts were just silly and could\u2019ve been done away with, but the show also contains a lot of scenes that I found exciting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI heard the movies are awesome, so I\u2019ll get to watching that right away !\\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom-line:\\n\r\nThis is a hard anime not to recommend due to the varying impact it has. So, I think you should definitely check this out. I can guarantee it won\u2019t be a total waste of your time.\\n",

You follow the main character Akira Takizawa, who has wiped his memory and is now in process of trying to figure out his previous reasonings for it. The plot is interesting with a suspense to keepyou wanting more. However, since it was only 11 episodes, the ending sort of leaves you with a cliffhanger, to be followed up by the 2 movies following it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe main characters consist of Akari Takizawa and Saki Morimi, the woman who becomes wrapped in the mystery with Akari as he begins figuring things out. Akari himself is a great character, who is quickly likeable, being lighthearted at times and serious at other, doesn't take things that seriously, while being funny and a little witty all at the same time. His mysterious past, amnesia, and his random knowledge of film references all are a part of his character. He basically is the star of the show, advancing it along. Saki on the other hand is a bit bland, who does have some good interaction with Akari and the others, but seems more like someone dragged onto the ride (which she basically is). The supporting cast do their job well enough, with good chemistry between one another. The other Selecao members all have different personalities and backgrounds, which provides an extra bit of interest to the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nI'd say great overall, the opening and endings were very well done, and the character design looked good, although not super polished, they were fine. The backgrounds and setting all looked great and animation was smooth. No real qualms from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Falling Down\" by Oasis suited the theme of the anime very well, even though it wasn't designed for the anime. Good pick by the producers. The ending was also good. The background themes and sounds were crisp and clean throughout the anime, and suited the scenes they were in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a solid anime with many good points going for it. It's a nice short anime to get into as it really grabs your attention early, although the fact that it is followed by 2 movies afterwards seems a little strange. \\n",

            "content": "On a trip to the United States, college student Morimi Saki stumbles upon an odd sight. Of all things, she meets a naked Japanese man, armed with a handgun. As she learns, this man has no idea who he is, or how he got there, and all that he can really remember are films, save for which one his personal favourite was. Soon, it becomes apparent that Takizawa Akira, as he is now going by, is a lot more than he first appears, as he finds out that he may have been part of a terrorist act committed in Japan. Then, he only gets evenmore shrouded in mystery with the presence of an odd phone; which he is told possesses ten million yen, and all that he is told to do with it, is to continue to be a Messiah.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on the surface, this premise is interesting enough, albeit a little silly. The show starts strongly, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay that way. Although it's genuinely funny at first, the jokes quickly grow stale. The drama almost never works, because of a bit of silly dialogue that makes you want to laugh rather than take it seriously, there are plot holes left and right, especially towards the end, and speaking of the ending, it's silly. It feels really rushed and doesn't make much sense at all. \\n\\n\r\nReally, this is just a perfect example of an interesting premise with poor execution. This could have been something great, but it falls sadly short. You can feel the potential this series had, but it really blew it. It's just too bad when this happens, it really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, well, a bit shallow. Okay, really shallow. Takizawa's air of cool is interesting, and he's fun to have around, but for most of the series, the man doesn't show any emotion. He isn't well developed, and when they try to develop him, it's very sloppy, and makes him come off as annoying. Saki never really goes through any changes in the series aside from the fact that she changes who she has a crush on. By the end of the series, she's still as helpless and ignorant as she was in the beginning. Some of the minor characters in the show, such as Satoshi, Ryou, and Yuusei appeared to be really interesting, but because of the series' short runtime, were never given the chance to develop properly, and the show really suffers from it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are good things about Eden of the east, though, and one of them is the animation. It's smooth, and well done, without any CGI affect that plague many recent anime to throw it off. The landscapes are all beautifully drawn, and full of life. The character designs are a mixed bag, some being incredibly detailed, and some being very simple, but it usually works.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Eden of the east is usually pretty unremarkable except for maybe one or two pieces. The rest are entirely forgettable. That cannot be said about the opening theme, though, or, at least the English version of the song. (To clarify, the Japanese version has an opening with English vocals, and probably due to licensing issues, the English version has the opening with Japanese vocals.) The English version of the song is sung by the British band \"Oasis\". It is incredibly catchy and fits very well with the animation. This, unfortunately, cannot be said about the Japanese version of the song. The Japanese version is sadly, uninspired and doesn't fit well with the opening animation at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in Eden of the east is great in both languages, but the Japanese version really went the extra mile here by hiring English-speaking voice actors to play English-speaking characters. There isn't any cringe-worthy 'Engrish' here!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eden of the east is a bag of sadly wasted potential. It has some interesting characters, and the plot can be exciting\u2026 when it wants to be. The payoff, though, is wholly unsatisfying. Great animation, and an awesome opening can't really make up for all the series, unfortunately, did not do right.",

            "content": "Eden of the East was a show that had a strong start - introducing a pair of instantly likeable characters that had excellent chemistry, solid direction, and hints of an interesting and highly complex plot. Unfortunately, the rest of the series was not capable of fully realizing the potential that this series had, leaving a rather mediocre package.\r\nThis show is first and foremost a mystery, and much of the series is dedicated to finding out who exactly our main character (Takizawa) is, as well as the details of a game that he is taking part in. For such a series, the plot is of utmostimportance, as a mystery will never be truly satisfying if the reveals turn out to be weak or have little impact. Unfortunately, despite a compelling and promising start, the show fails to deliver, never leading to a truly satisfying climax. There are also many twists which are ridiculous and not well explained. At the end of the series, many plot threads are left unanswered, and a certain character makes a unfathomably ridiculous decision - all so that the series can have a sequel in the form of two movies. Thus, the series does not work well as a standalone as it lacks closure, and unfortunately, the movies do not solve the problem either, somehow managing to butcher the ending even further.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the leads in this show are great, and they are highly enjoyable to watch. I mentioned earlier that the connection between Saki and Takizawa was instantaneous and they had great chemistry, and that remains true throughout the series. The dialogue between them is great, and their interactions are without a doubt the high point of the series. Takizawa is a great character - having a highly excitable personality which is amazing to watch, and interesting approaches to problems that crop up. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, another problem crops up here - our characters never really grow. The two of them, despite seeming like excellent leads at the start, mostly remain static throughout the series. It is a little difficult to elaborate on what I mean without going into spoilers, but let's just say that some questionable decisions are made, and Saki's role in the story is never really clear.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the leads, although some of the characters seem interesting, they are never really given the room to grow and develop. This is probably due to the short run time of series, which results in most of the screen time being allocated to Takizawa and the plot.\\n\\n\r\nStill, despite the failings of the narrative, it cannot be denied that Eden of the East is a highly enjoyable show. It is well-produced, having great animation and an excellent soundtrack, and is always nice to look at. Even though the plot does feel ridiculous at many points, it is still a show that is rarely boring, and one that I enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a massive disappointment. The writing is lackluster at best, and the show feels as if it tried to do too much with too little time. The movies that follow this series do not remedy that problem either - they do not conclude well, and manage to waste a ridiculous amount of screen time on things that are not central to the plot. Even though the show still remains enjoyable due to the many antics and twists, it is one that is a mere shell of what could have been. Would still recommend it as it is worth a watch, but it would be wise to not expect much out of the show.",

            "content": "Higashi no Eden (or Eden of the East however you want to call it) is a new anime series produced by Production I.G, and it was one of the most anticipated series of the Spring 2009 season. After quite an impressive trailer before the anime aired, I just knew I had to watch this show which looked like it had a lot of promise. Did it live up to my expectation? Read ahead to find out.\r\nStory: \r\n+ This anime definitely brings a very interesting plot.\r\n+ The level of mystery and suspense will leave the viewer wanting more every episode.\r\n+ Definitely one of the most refreshingstories in recent seasons.\\n\\n\r\n- Its is only 11 episodes long, a very uncommon number for an anime.\\n\r\n- The ending leaves you with a cliffhanger that the movies are expected to resolve.\\n\r\n- Because of the # of episodes, plus the announcement of 2 movies. The anime ending does not feel like it brings any closure to the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n+ Fantastic art in both characters and backgrounds throughout the anime.\\n\r\n+ Very artistic animations for both the Opening and Ending themes.\\n\r\n+ There is really nothing bad to say here, this anime brings some nice eye candy to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n+ Very good OP and ED songs. They are really cool to listen to.\\n\r\n+ The soundtrack is also really good, complimenting some scenes really nicely.\\n\r\n+ The voice acting is solid through the series, specially for Akira.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n+ Takizawa Akira is main driving force in terms of character in this anime. He is pretty much the only one who constantly shines.\\n\r\n+ Other Selecao members are all unique and different in personalities, and are also very interesting people and have some good development (as short as some may be).\\n\r\n+ Akira is as mysterious as a character as he is likeable, he doesn't take things TOO seriously and also provides some good comedy.\\n\\n\r\n- Saki, despite being likeable, just doesn't seem to contribute much to the overall plot despite being a main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime was highly entertaining, despite ending in a cliffhanger it left me wanting more every episode and it would never feel boring. With the movies set to bring a conclusion to the anime, I can't wait to see them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Higashi no Eden proves to be a very enjoyable and entertaining anime which brings some rather unique and interesting plot that will be able to keep your interest from its unique 11 episode run. However because the series itself is not complete without the movies, the ending might feel a little underwhelming to some. Regardless, this anime surpassed my expectations and its a fantastic show to those looking a solid plot, likeable characters, beautiful visuals, and enjoyable music. I highly recommend people try this anime out, I dont think you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW OF THE SERIES AND THE TWO MOVIES**\r\nAfter watching the first few episodes of Eden of the East (a.k.a Higashi no Eden), I was extremely impressed and very excited. I thought I had found a compelling mystery anime with lovable characters, a great storyline, and fluent animation. I couldn't wait to see what Eden had in store, so I sat through the entire series and both of the movies in a huge marathon. You want to know what it all amounted to? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The storyline of this anime goes absolutely, positively NOWHERE at any point in any of the movies orepisodes and gives the phrase \"dragging it out\" an entirely new definition. This is one of the most disappointing anime I've ever seen simply because it gets you so excited with it's engrossing beginning, and just plateaus for the remaining 90% of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nSynopsis:  A man wakes up outside the White House stark naked with a gun one hand, a cell phone charged with 8.2 billion yen in funds in the other hand, and no memory of who he is or how he got there what so ever. The man, who goes by Takizawa (even though It's not his real name), goes on to find out that he is involved in a game in which he and twelve other contestants were given 10 billion yen and told to \"Fix the country\". He meets a girl named Saki and together they go on an \"adventure\" (if you can even call it that\u2026) to discover Takizawa's past. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes, this is a compelling concept. Additionally, Takizawa jumps off the screen as a charming character with tons of personality and Saki (Takizawa's love interest) seemed like she would develop into a likable character. I thought Eden couldn't go wrong with so many stellar pieces in place. Well, it did. Very wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe #1 problem with Eden is that the plot never builds into anything significant or exciting, with the exception of the end of the series portion of Eden, which was entertaining, but certainly not worthy of being considered a true climax. After that moment, nothing happens. Literally nothing. There are a few new developments that never lead anywhere, the contestants of the game start to get narrowed down, but that doesn't lead anywhere, and worst of all, the promising relationship between Saki and Takizawa doesn't lead anywhere! In the first couple of episodes, I absolutely fell in love with these characters! They had personality, they had chemistry, and they were unique! You want to know what it all built up to? Absolutely ZILCH.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings us to the ending of the anime, which I won't spoil, but to summarize my feelings on it; it sucks. There are happy endings, sad endings, and there are bad endings. Bad endings are the endings that just leave an unfilled void in your soul; the unmistakable feeling that everything you just watched has been for absolutely nothing. That is the kind of ending that Eden has.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I haven't mentioned the plotholes yet. For instance; there is one scene where a character sprouts wings and flies away. Yep, just for no apparent reason. It is never explained, it is never mentioned again, and it is the only supernatural thing that takes place in Eden. Those are the kind of plot holes we are dealing with here. It's hinted at that this could have been a hallucination but that honestly just raises even more questions if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the story to Eden had huge potential and capitalized on next to none of it. Wildly disappointing.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is probably the highlight of the anime. Everything is pleasant to look at and the animation is always fluent.  I liked the animation style quite a bit. It never really has a chance to shine though, thanks to the general lack of action and climatic/exciting scenes, which a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is unique and pleasant to listen to. Eden also has one of my favorite EDs ever. The voice acting is pretty good in both versions, but I'm not crazy about Saki's voice actor in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe only two characters worth talking about are Takizawa and Saki.\\n\\n\r\nTakizawa, as I mentioned earlier, really stands out in the beginning of the anime as a charming character overflowing with personality. He is a great protagonist for the most part, and he receives a fair amount of character development, but he remains disappointingly static throughout the anime and his personality can only make up for so much. I liked Takizawa a lot, but he just feels like another wasted opportunity.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSaki, as I also mentioned earlier, is Takizawa's love interest. She seemed like she could develop into a great character with a distinct personality but guess what? It never happens! Are you sensing a theme yet? She ends up being a stereotypical female character who is just sort of... there. She seems to be gradually written out of the show, in fact. The relationship between these two is built up more then anything else in the show, and that makes it all the more disappointing when even that ends without giving the viewer an ounce of payoff or satisfaction what so ever.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that these are the only two characters worth mentioning and both of them are disappointments is all the information you need to infer that Eden's characters fall flat in yet another, lets say it together this time, (ALL: Wasted Opportunity!)\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair ,there are a couple decent side characters, but none of them are relevant enough to the plot or entertaining enough to take the time to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nEden of the East left a disgusting taste in mouth. It builds you up and builds you up and builds you up only to have no payoff at the end (or any other point) what so ever. It is a colossal waste of potential and I really can't recommend watching anything past the 11 anime episodes, if even those. It may as well of ended there, because the true ending is about as satisfying as if it had just ended after the episodic portion of anime; no closure and no real climax.",

            "content": "After seeing a score of 8.22 and skimping through reviews lauding Higashi no Eden for its intricate and unique plot, I decided to give it a try. I was also looking for more anime with a theme similar to Zankyou no Terror and one of the recommendations was HnE.\r\nSo, an anime with tags like \"Drama, Romance, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Mystery\" and a \"whopping\" score of 8.22 for only 11 episodes? I was so excited at the prospect of watching a real gem of an anime, and thought I couldn't possibly not like this series. I would surely be in for one hell of a ride!\r\nDear Lordwas I wrong... Though it was one hell of a ride, I rode straight into a big pile of disappointment and feelings of betrayal. No doubt the first episode looked promising; the story looked like it could develop in so many interesting ways, but then it almost felt like the show's shot callers did a complete 180 and decided to ruin HnE in the utmost cruelest way. I had to check multiple times if I was indeed watching the right anime. Was I losing my sanity? How could that many people think so highly of this show and I can't even bring myself to watch the 3rd episode? Was I missing something? For sure I'm missing something! I'll just keep watching; the story is bound to get better soon, that's why it got so many rave reviews. I forced myself to watch the other episodes, but when I reached episode 8, I could no longer bear it. I felt like if I watched any longer, no amount of watching reruns of my favourite animes could ever erase the memory of having watched HnE.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (3/10) could have been amazing. But after episode 1, the show kept adding so many other elements to the story, that in the end I was still not sure what the central theme was. There were also some real head scratching scenes which made me doubt if this show shouldn't add the genre \"magic\" to it. As for comedy? Besides Akira's public display of nudity in episode 1 (which would catch anyone off guard imo), I couldn't even muster a meek smile for the supposedly \"funny\" scenes.\\n\\n\r\n*****SPOILERS\\n\r\n1. A complete stranger comes up to you and asks for your pants? Sure, just hand them over. The police asking people to see their wieners in order to identify them? Sure, just drop your pants.\\n\r\n2. So 10 missiles strike Japan and not one single victim was killed? Uh, sure... I guess that... could've, might've happened?\\n\r\n3. A magic phone that grants your every request? ... I think I might've missed the \"Magic\" tag for this show somewhere.\\n\r\n4. White zombie like creatures that come out of broken electronic equipment and start hugging the MC? I guess I might've missed the \"horror\" tag somewhere as well.\\n\r\n5. A character who gets off by kidnapping rapists/sex-offenders and then cutting off their Johnnies? And she's almost killed over 20.000 men? Oh, and she was chosen as one of the 12 people who were supposed to lead the nation in the right path? But then the male MC decides that he could save this psychopath by having sex with her? Uh... I think I lost it. *****\\n\\n\r\nHowever, besides the story being a complete disaster, the animation and sound of HnE weren't bad. The animation and most of the soundtrack (6/10) in my opinion, were more suited to a romance/slice of life themed story than the Sci-Fi heavy themed HnE. I believe that the relationship between story and art is dynamic: if a story is great, even if the accompanying art is not up to par, the story will find a way to shine. And vice versa: if the art is great, even a mediocre story will get praise. But in HnE's case, the disconnection between the art and story was too obvious.\\n\r\nAnd the animation for the OP was well-done: it really gave me this \"anarchy, democracy\" kind of feel. Traitor!!!! Biggest misleading OP animation I've ever encountered...\\n\\n\r\nThe VA's delivered solid performances; none of them sounded off and voiced their characters well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters (3/10), of the main duo, Akira is the more interesting one. Who wouldn't think that after he made such a grand entrance? I thought he'd turn out to be the \"always smiling and charismatic but actually a real dark personality\"-type of character; boy was I disappointed. In the end, he was all charm and nothing else: no fighting skills (damn you for baiting me with the Jason Bourne reference), no amazing analytical skills, nope, none, nada.\\n\r\nSaki, our main female lead, only has one selling point: cuteness. But being cute can never be the only trait of a character when she's supposed to be the heroine of the story. I kept hoping she would do something, anything to contribute to the story (as awful as it was) other than gawk and blush at Akira. If you like heroines like her, than be my guest and enjoy HnE.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, I forgot. There was one thing I really enjoyed from HnE though, and that was Akira's dog. If it wasn't for the dog, the score for enjoyment (3/10) would have definitely gone down.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, HnE in the beginning was like a mouth watering steak; then someone decided that all elements of the food pyramid need to be included in the dish and they added bread, lettuce, bananas, strawberries etc and served it up. In the end, it gave me a bout of diarrhoea I won't forget so easily. Well, at least I enjoyed the OP (and to a lesser extent the ED) while I was relieving myself.\\n",

            "content": "For as long as I can remember, anime of the mystery genre have proven creatively stale. As a rule, trying to find a gratifying mystery is an ordeal much like rummaging for haute couture in a dark, creaky charity shop that smells faintly of mothballs. Foremost amongst the dust-caked offerings, Darker than Black collapses into a morbid mess; low-grade Fantastic Children keeps things cheap and cheerless; and the snail-paced Ghost Hound dulled my senses to such an extent that I never saw its middle episodes.\r\nHow delightfully reassuring, then, to discover Eden of the East; this, unlike the aforementioned failures, begins on a much higher barof quality. In fact, tapping into the hot topics of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, information technology, marginalized geek subculture, and subversive conspiracy theories, it accomplishes an astronomical level of relevancy to its early twenty-first century audience that\u2019s both rare and difficult to pull off. Like Akira emerging from a background of Cold War paranoia, Eden of the East manages to capture the Zeitgeist of disenfranchised youth of the millennium and repackage it into a fascinating adventure that anyone can enjoy. Instead of loudmouthed biker brats trying to prevent the apocalypse, there are spotty middle-class misfits with too much HP trying to save Japan from itself.\\n\r\nThe sequence of events may be ambiguous, with the script hardly pausing to explain how they connect with each other, but the pace remains satisfyingly steady. Strangely enough, like watching a master illusionist at work, the confusion contributes to the enjoyment. The series withholds tantalising facts until the last possible moment and glosses over its meandering mystery with generous handfuls of charisma.\\n\r\nIn truth, the first half of the show elicits the kind of spine-tingling rapture that only comes along once a decade when viewers inadvertently stumble upon a confident masterpiece. I could see it already \u2013 breathless fans hailing Eden of the East as the second coming of Death Note, the easy five-star ratings flying from reviewers\u2019 fingertips, and a live-action movie so popular it even makes it as far as British cinemas by 2015!\\n\r\nAll I can say is enjoy the magic while it lasts. Inevitably, Eden of the East overreaches and certain contortions of the plot midway stretch viewers\u2019 suspension of disbelief to untenable limits. At first there is a clever chase sequence highly reminiscent of Light and L\u2019s interplay in Death Note, where the mysterious hero Akira tries to save the day with the help of Juiz (a voice on his phone which grants his every wish). For whatever reason, just at that key juncture, the show follows up with a scene of such crippling farce that, despite later rationalization, it spells a stunning loss of momentum. After that, there\u2019s a long period of rushed explanations, sluggish suspense, and one or two twists desperately in need of more coherent setup.\\n\r\nFans expecting easy-to-grasp developments and a neat conclusion will end up disappointed. However, for conspiracy theorists and generally anal fans who like to pore over minute details and debate exact wordings for weeks after a show is over, this will prove quite the feast.\\n\\n\r\nEven in that age (2009) of knock-off CGI and dime-a-dozen action sequences, Eden of the East\u2019s visuals warrant some respect. The style may not be up to much, but cityscapes, monorails, museums, cars, and streets have rarely looked this good. The quirkiest aspect is the combination of hamster-cheeked characters with hyper-realistic, superbly detailed backgrounds. Although this sounds intuitively incompatible, the quality of animation is consistently high and melds everything together nicely.\\n\\n\r\nApart from a catchy opening theme sung by the established Brit-rock band, Oasis, and some excellent American voice acting during the early episodes, Eden of the East\u2019s soundtrack remains effective but wholly unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters, only Akira Takigawa leaps off the screen with his incredible effervescence. Turning up at the White House naked with a gun in his first scene certainly makes him memorable, but his charm extends beyond mere gimmicks. Akira\u2019s development reveals a fascinating duality in his personality, which ensures he is at once easy to like and teasingly difficult to grasp. His whimsical nature belies an underlying quick mind and a surprising level of gravity, the latter of which manifests itself in the messianic themes surrounding him (obvious statements that he\u2019s Saki\u2019s \u2018prince\u2019, his supposed massacre of 20,000 NEETs, the occasional deadpan expression etc). He\u2019ll delight and entrance in turn, and he\u2019ll do it seemingly without much effort.\\n\r\nEveryone else, unfortunately, gets caught in the whirlwind of his mystery without any opportunity to make their own mark. The good news is that the supporting cast, being ordinary people with ordinary problems, generally behave within the familiar boundaries of reason. Regrettably, this means that, when thrown into Eden of the East\u2019s extraordinary circumstances, they become like headless chickens \u2013 alarmingly useless. At some point, I began to wonder how many more times I\u2019d have to watch Saki mope after Akira, worrying about his terrible secrets without being able to help uncover them. Her behavior is always understandable, of course, but also off-putting for being redundant.\\n\r\nApart from that, the gaggle of weak antagonists impedes any attempt at emotional investment. The most carelessly developed individual has to be that purple-haired femme fatale whose morbid behavior is as caricatured as her looks. Being the only female of note other than the mediocre Saki, I found her constant prancing in underwear and high heels a horribly patronizing and silly portrayal. Truly, does being psychologically disturbed always have to mean being half naked? Other antagonists introduced later simply look boring, are underdeveloped, or generally don\u2019t do much of note. Viewers will keep watching simply to find out the answers to the questions set at the beginning, and not because they will care about the conflict of interest.\\n\\n\r\nI find this a very difficult anime to recommend without caveats. Objectively, I recognize Eden of the East\u2019s great achievements; brandishing an arsenal of treats, including an innovative mystery that doubles as social commentary and Akira\u2019s magnetic characterization, it will exceed expectations on first impressions. On the other hand, I feel underwhelmed by the experience. Somehow, the show misses its mark, becoming a rambling setup for the anticipated movies with convoluted themes and tenuous explanations. Nonetheless, the fact remains \u2013 for a fresh and nail-biting reinterpretation of the mystery genre (even if short-lived), Eden of the East rivals the monumental favorites on the market of that date.",

            "content": "\"The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power\". Such is a quote from one of Shakespeare's plays, and it is found in the opening credits of the anime.\r\nWhat would a person do, if they had a cellphone charged with ten billion yen, and the ability to call a strange person to do whatever you wished for, for a certain payment? What would a person do with that kind of money?  The main character is in possession in such a cell phone, but he has no idea just why, as he has lost his memory.\r\nHigashi no Eden is a very interesting anime.It doesn't follow any previously-seen anime conventions, clich\u00e9s or stereotypes. Indeed, it is more like watching a action/mystery movie or two put into a TV series format. Of note is that it is not adapted from any other media, which allows the animation company to unfold themselves freely, and it shows; original anime usually has more uncommon pacing, and they tend to bring about a fresh element or two to them. Higashi no Eden brings many. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn't all that easy to follow at times. It's not a bunch of it, but some points makes you want to stop and double-turn, just to make sure you got what they went on about, an example being how a group of characters suddenly went into talking about a concept we hadn't really heard of before, like we were supposed to do, or at least have some kind of background knowledge of it. Nothing the average viewer won't catch on to quickly, though. To repeat myself, apart from some few, smaller issues here.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is a highly interesting male lead, and fortunately he does not grouse or whine too much about his amnesia; most characters who do that end up becoming bland angst-vessels with no real depth. Rather, he is cool and level-headed, heading into any situation and tackling any news with stoic ease. He cares for those around him, and while he now and then seems ambigous, especially when it comes to what he has done , in essence he's a good person with a kind heart.\\n\\n\r\nOn th sidelines is a cute young woman with the name of Saki. Morimi Saki. She accidentally ends up both meeting and befriending him during a trip to the US; and also tagging along with him back to Japan. They develop a quite interesting relationship, and as a couple have a lovely chemistry. Admittedly her character isn't as interesting as Akira's, but that might just be personal preference speaking.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the mains, you have two-or-so groups of people and a few other supporting characters, whom obviously suffer a bit from the lack of screen-time, being more role-fillers than anything. Still they prove to be quite interesting characters, and especially compelling is the so-called Selecao, the people who have received the special cell phones; to see and experience what these induvidials have done with the power they have been granted. A few of the episodes fall into the formula where an episode or two is used on their past, what they have done with their power and a small plot event leading to Akira getting to know some more about this game the Selecao are a part of.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of Higashi no Eden is its beauteous animation. It is clear-cut and detailed, with soft edges and gentle strokes. The backgrounds are all made in a gentle water-colored fashion, yet there is impressive effort put into lighting effects, the smaller details and reflective surfaces in particular. Be it a mirror in an elevator, the glassy floors of an airport, or any other such surface, they are all done with meticulous care. The character designs are a tad on the simple side however, but are still made with a flawless touch and are aesthetically pleasing. As a final touch, the ending credits are done with a rather unusual type of animation; paper animation.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the strong suit is the soundtrack and voice acting of the show. The background muysic, while not always apparent, has a lot of themes for any occasion; the more upbeat and jazzy themes, with some more thriller-esque, suspenseful lines rolling behind them, the outright creepy tunes, and of course the more laid-back music for those occasions. The opening theme Falling Down, performed by the well-known English rock band Oasis, is a peculiar song with an interesting, almost psychedelic feel over it and the lyrics. The ending theme is not very spectacular, bar perhaps some itneresting lyrics. Of course, on mustn't forget the spectacular insert song Reveal the World, which is always an experience to listen to (and which lyrics are found in the opening sequence of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn all one can say that Higashi no Eden is, for an anime, a rather interesting venture into something one ight not have experienced when watching an anime before. To quote myself, it is more like a movie or two put into a series format. It also piques the attention of some interesting themes, regarding what one would do given the money and means to accomplish pretty much anything if they really wanted. While nor a focal point of the series, it provides at least some appetizers for thought.",

            "content": "This is a perfect example of the all to familure anime falterings of having a good concept but failing completely to execute it. While the story it self is good enough to keep you interested it never really seems to go anywhere. Hopefully the movies to come will shed some more light on this but judging this as a complete series it is majorly lacking. The story starts off with a series of interesting questions and circumstances that are begging for an absolution, but few answers are ever provided and the few they do offer up just lead to more unanswered questions. You might aswell stop watching after episode 1 because the story line isn't going to get all too much clearer to you, and you'll be left asking yourself the same questions at the end of the series that you did at the end of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8- Character design is rather poor and childish but the texturing and animation is outstanding. This is a great example of CG blending with traditional animation that looks great. Some of the most interesting art in the series can be found in the ed, really original concept they used there. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9 The main girls voice is a bit on the annoying side but other than that no real complaints, this is one of the best intro songs I've heard and it really does well in summing up the themes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6- You never really grow to care for any of the characters in this. With the exception of the male lead most characters are typical and bland, and the main intrigue of the male lead is the fact that he has no memories. The main girl comes across as whiny and pathetic with out any strengths of her own aside from her looks. Undeveloped love story angles, which would have been fine not to develop if they hadn't started on that path and then just seemed to forget about it by the next episode.  There repeated use of the term 'Johnny' to refer to a penis comes off as childish and silly, in some instances it's made to be taken this way, but in other, more serious parts of the show, such as threatening to rip off ones 'Johnny' and a character that has never been treated right by any ones 'Johnny' and needs to be loved by a good 'Johnny' just comes across as bad and makes it almost impossible to take the scenes seriously. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7 For the most part I sat through this waiting impatiently for the next episode to find out the answerers to the questions raised previously, but since those answerers never came apparently it was all in vein. So while it did keep my interest for awhile, it wasn't much more than a disappointing let down in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6- I had some enjoyment while watching it but I can't particularly recommend this to anyone. Hopefully the movies (or perhaps second season?) will help to actually finish the story that they did a good job in creating. If taking this as a complete series, it fails, but as an opening to a series it could have alot of potential.",

            "content": "Eden of the East is an anime in which I have never seen the likes of before. The plot is strange, the characters are strange, and the humour is strange - but somehow it all works. Brilliantly. But first of all, I should say this: if you're a really big fan of fan service, harems, hardcore romance, hardcore action, and/or gore, then this is not the series for you. If you like plot, character development, catchy music and brilliant animation/art then read on.\r\nSTORY- 9/10\r\nFor one thing, although the plot has a bit of a fantastical element to it, it reflects what is going on inthe world today. It shows the dark and corrupt side of society, but at the same time shows it with a kind of hope for the future. It's a sad, yet warm series.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. I should explain just what is going on first. One thing about this series is that you don't know what is really going on; you can speculate, but innately, there's this sense that something bigger and more amazing is happening. It's this intrigue that first drew me.\\n\\n\r\n----begin plot summary----\\n\r\nSo, as you already know, this guy wakes up in Washington, in front of the white house, naked and carrying a pistol and a phone. A phone loaded with 8.2 billion yen in electronic cash. But...he has no memory of who he is. There he meets a girl about to go back to Japan after visiting as a grad trip, and decides to go back with her if only because he doesn't know what else to do.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you don't know (if you haven't watched the series yet). When he turns his phone on, a mysterious woman named 'Juiz' calls him and says that she is his concierge, that he is the ninth Selecao (forgive the spelling if it's wrong). We'll fast forward here, but eventually he finds out that there are twelve people picked by a Mr. Outside to be 'messiahs'. They are each given 10 billion yen and the simple instruction to \"save Japan\"; added to that, apparently it was his idea to erase his memories in the first place and bet on a whole new persona.\\n\\n\r\nIf you run out of money and Japan still isn't 'saved', then one of the twelve, named the Supporter, will kill you. Likewise, if you keep spending the money uselessly or for selfish reasons the same will happen. Only Mr. Outside knows whom of the twelve is the Supporter. Basically, you can get away with anything - just ask Juiz and she'll do it for you somehow, anytime you want (as long as you tell her). Bribes, murder, you name it. Added to that, there are some crazy Selecao out there; they truly encompass the entire spectrum. \\n\\n\r\nSo far we've met Akira who doesn't know who he is but is involved with several bombings in Japan and who wants to win the game, a murderer, a doctor, a detective, another one who is also directly involved with the bombings, a businessman and one who hasn't touched his money and only wants the game to end. The last three believe that they have found out who Mr.Outside is and are working together. I won't give away anymore, but that's the gist of it. I've heard that this plot is similar to the Bourne series. \\n\\n\r\n----end plot summary----\\n\\n\r\n*Important Note* However, if you think this is a purely a political story from how it sounds so far (reminiscent of those famous Gundam series), think again. The atmosphere is distinctly different; not as callous and involves the audience, the common people, much more.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to classify this series. It's mystery, romance, horror maybe, and a bit of slice-of-life. Maybe not so much with the horror; as I said earlier, this series has its serious moments but on the whole it looks on the bright side of things. Both moments blend together very well with the pacing to make you feel like you're there along with the characters, even if it is confusing at times. Suffice to say, the plot is great and keeps you guessing, unlike lots of other anime where you can just predict from the start what's going to happen for the rest of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, the plot makes you think, and it's definitely not self-absorbed because it deals with issues in the world today. Although the series has ended, it kind of seems incomplete (which disappointed me) because there's a movie on the way which likely concludes the entire thing more completely, so we have to wait for that now too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters. Hm. I will talk in depth about the two main characters. For me, I think Akira (the main character - the naked guy) is the one who has truly drawn me. He is very unique, but he's kind of dazzling - his personality is so vibrant and even though he's in a tough situation where anyone else would have completely broken down, he still makes jokes and just acts like himself. He does have a minor freak out, but it's more funny than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSaki, the girl, is the other main character. She's rather shy, but I think she and Akira work well together. She kind of stabilizes him I think and is the one who always seems to believe in him even when her friends start thinking he's a terrorist. It is really a compliment when I'm not annoyed with an anime girl - she seems realistic as in not too shy to the point of being ridiculous, not too naive to the point where I want to bash her head, and not too tough that she's difficult to approach.\\n\\n\r\nMost anime portray girls as being on these opposite extremities, and thankfully Saki is in the middle, which is where most people are.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves do seem very real and compelling. That and their interactions are one of the stronger elements in Eden of the East, and if you're all for character development, then go for it.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION- 9/10\\n\r\nAs for the art or animation style, if you liked the character designs in Honey and Clover, they are very similar. I think the same person made them. There's one word I would use to describe it: sweet. Not sweet as in 'sick', but sweet in that it's very gentle and pretty. The only thing I dislike about it is the nose; there's just something weird about it, especially the shadow at the bridge of the nose which looks like a bandaid in some scenes (in the picture provided by this website for Akira, you can see it). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality itself is very smooth and consistent, with beautiful bright colours and wonderful scenery. Some backgrounds look like they're painted, and in particular the water is drawn beautifully. The most outstanding moments are at dusk or when it's just become night. Overall the animation is excellent and you can definitely tell it's a recent series. Of course, this is expected from Production I.G (one of my fav studios).\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND - 8/10\\n\r\nThe music score is very unique - I would say it suits the anime because it's kind of funky, a lot of it has an English/Americanish feel which contributes to the whole wordly feeling to the anime because the series also retains many Japanese elements. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is English and rock/jazz (band is called Oasis, if you like them), and the ending is similar but in Japanese. During the show it replays these songs sometimes, but there's a lot of classical music as well, of course. Admittedly, the ending song has grown on me because I think it suits the series well. Personally the rest of the music is not really my thing, but even I have to admit that it suits the moods and the scenes, lending a great backdrop to everything and fleshing out the feelings invoked by different scenes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series immensely despite the somewhat anti-climatic ending (which leads up to the movie). Definitely one of the best in 2009 so far. It's a breath of fresh air if you're tired of harems and cliches, but once again if you're really into action then this isn't the series for you. This is plot and character driven, and is thought-provoking. It's also very easy to follow, because the subs come out really fast after the raws come out (either the day of or the day after), and it can be found basically on any anime website and even youtube. I recommend  because they update new episodes right away and it's easy to navigate, with only a few popups here and there.  is also good.",

            "content": "One day, in 2011, a Japanese university student by the name of Saki Morimi is visiting America. When she throws something into the Whitehouse courtyard, the security guards quickly start questioning her... but she is quickly granted a distraction by our protagonist, Akira Takizawa, who has appeared outside the Whitehouse completely naked, with a phone in one hand and a gun in the other, and absolutely no recollection of who he is or how he got there.\r\nSaki lends him her coat, but quickly comes to realise that she left her passport in there, causing her to chase after him. Meanwhile, Akira finds a large amountof weapons at his apartment, along with several fake IDs. As the series progresses, Akira finds out that he is part of a group called the Selecao, who have each been granted an enormous sum of money, and a phone connected to somebody called Juiz who will use this money to carry out any command they are given. Their cause is to use this money to save Japan.\\n\\n\r\nAs you've probably noticed by this point, the premise of this series is absolutely bonkers, and in the best way possible. It comes across as anime's take on American spy thrillers, and pulls it off with ease. For example, a notable part of this series is their aversion to Engrish, not counting that spoken by the Japanese characters when in America. Instead, they hire actual American voice actors to play the American roles. This is, of course, only one facet of the genius put into this show's production. Watching it, it's very obvious that Production I.G. absolutely spared no expenses in making this series. The animation is absolutely top-notch, along with a distinctive art style that will be familiar to fans of Honey And Clover, whom it shared a character designer with. It's also worth noting that the opening and ending themes are both extremely impressive. For the opening theme, they use Falling Down by Oasis, which not only flaunts the massive budget they had on this, but also adds heavily to the multicultural chic the show uses. This is set over an animated sequence with a visual style that would make Steve Jobs cream his shorts if he saw it. The ending theme, while less notable music-wise, uses a very distinct style, using a stop-motion sequence made using papercraft.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this makes Eden of the East all the more disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem that appears comes up about halfway through the series, and that would be that Juiz is ridiculously overpowered. You can basically ask Juiz to perform pretty much any command, and it will magically happen. Now, in of itself, this isn't the problem. The issue isn't what she can do so much as how she does it. The ways in which the commands are executed are simply ridiculous. For one example, upon command, a truck is to be brought down to block the path. Rather than, say, a sniper shooting out the wheels, the truck falls apart. No explanation as to how this is done is ever given. It falls apart of it's own accord because somebody paid out a large sum of money for it to happen. And sadly, this isn't even the most nonsensical use of Juiz's abilities, though to name any worse uses would be to give out enormous spoilers. The ending, for example, features a mind-breakingly stupid use of it that provides a completely asinine plot twist that had no foreshadowing whatsoever, and doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. The Juiz concept does get put to good use on numerous occasions, mind you. One sequence, for example, is reminiscent of the back-and-forth mind games presented in Death Note, and is used just as well as they were there, which makes it a shame that it isn't put to such good use more often.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the \"Save Japan\" concept is underused. On a few occasions we see the other Selecao and their ideas for how to save Japan, and these are actually very good, but overall we just don't see enough of them. These ideas, and the stories behind them, are one of the more interesting parts of the series, but we only really see it happen on two occasions, most likely due to the painfully short 11-episode runtime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another disappointing part of the series. Most of the cast are just completely uninteresting, especially Saki. The only truly interesting character in the series is Akira, but he isn't exactly great either. While he's far from a bad character, he's anything but impressive. Part of his problem is that he is permanently happy. The only side we ever see to him is an all-smiles personality with absolutely no depth of emotion. Of course, being constantly happy isn't exactly a bad thing, but it's hard to get attached to a character who seems completely one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I think this entire series would have been better in almost every way if it had just been longer. 11 episodes simply isn't enough time for a series this ambitious, which is probably why two movies have been produced to follow it up. I have yet to see the movies, but nonetheless it seems nigh impossible for them to properly fix the series' faults. At best, they may give some development to the characters, but as late as that it seems like a poor idea. Really, it would have been better if there had simply been about 4 more episodes in the middle of the series. This would have given them time to make the characters more interesting and fleshed-out, shown the ideas behind the remaining Selecao, and come up with more interesting ways to use the abilities of Juiz, then Eden of the East could have been truly fantastic.

            "content": "Eden of the East, or Higashi no Eden, is one of the newest ventures of Production I.G, most notably accredited for producing such masterpiece series\u2019 as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Just like the majority of Production I.G\u2019s other series\u2019, Eden of the East does not disappoint, and its intriguing and unique blend of a gripping storyline and well built suspense which leaves the viewer clamouring for more at the end of every episode, cements its place as a well needed forerunner in the modern mystery/suspense genre. \r\nThe plotline is very interesting and is revealed at a well managed pace, and this pacingcreates the many moments at the end of each episode which leave the viewer wanting more and more from the series. However, the ending is somewhat abrupt, and does not really provide any full closure to the series itself \u2013 but when it is factored in that the series\u2019 ending is actually presented in two extra movies, this \u2018ending\u2019 can be forgiven for its somewhat sudden stopping point. The intricacies of the story and the unfolding of the plot are very complex and rewarding to the viewer when uncovered, most of the time giving new questions to the viewers with each revelation. The character development is also handled well \u2013 Akira Takizawa, being the main character, of course has the most detailed development of the characters, but it is arguable that his actions practically push the plot entirely throughout the series, and his endearing personality and the hook of the mysterious events surrounding his past make him into an incredible main protagonist. Being a source of many different film references that he mentions frequently throughout the series also gives him a sense of realism that not many other protagonists can match, allowing the viewer to further understand his character.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Akira Takizawa\u2019s well developed personality, the female protagonist, Saki Morimi, does not match up as well. Granted, she does provide a plethora of interesting character interactions between her and Akira, along with her interactions with other characters. However, due to the progression of the plot, Saki, despite being a character that is likable due to her sudden involvement in Akira\u2019s world, she doesn\u2019t seem to do much at all to the plot itself, and it almost seems as if her entire characterisation results in her simply running around after Akira, rendering her character somewhat useless. Saki\u2019s friends are also not particularly developed, but this is not required, as they only serve as another viewpoint to Akira\u2019s and the other Selecao\u2019s actions throughout the series, occasionally providing their own support and launching their own investigations into the actions of Akira, giving them a surprising amount of depth for side characters. The Selecao members themselves are almost as interesting as Akira himself as far as character development goes \u2013 it is clear that each Selecao is radically different from each other, and have their own motives for their participation, be them benign or malicious. In fact, even though several of the Selecao members do not appear for more than one or two episodes each, they are developed quite well, and provide a great contrast to the actions of Akira, serving as a good selection of what could loosely be referred to as \u2018antagonists\u2019, but the reality of the each Selecao member\u2019s individual motives are much more complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction of this series is extremely well done, with both the character designs and the backgrounds handled efficiently, creating a real sense of detail and distinctiveness throughout, applying especially to the characters \u2013 their designs fit their character personalities excellently overall. The animation for both the opening and ending sequences is also very unique and stylish, with special commendation going to the creation of the ending sequence, which must have used a lot of paper to produce. Even the segments in which there are CG, it tends to blend in with the backgrounds and the other elements of the environment so well that it is difficult to notice \u2013 a very commendable feat.\\n\\n\r\nAudio in this series is also another element in which this series shines \u2013 the OP and ED themes are very fun to listen to, and also contribute well to the theme and progression of the series.  The lyrics of the OP and ED themes, notably, are very relevant to the events of the series as well, specifically \u2018Falling Down\u2019 by Oasis. Even the background score is very well designed and fit very well to the situations in which the individual tracks are presented in. Voice acting is generally very well done, and the performances bring out the personalities of the characters, from the civilians to the Selecao, extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is very enjoyable to watch, and the ending begs for the viewer to watch the movies to close the curtains on the storyline once and for all, and that is something I almost certainly will be doing. My final rating of 9/10 sums up very well the incredible combination of fantastic, well paced and gripping storytelling, the detailed and unique artwork, the amazing soundtrack and the well developed characters throughout the series. The one point deducted can only be attributed to a perhaps weak offering in Saki\u2019s characterisation and a fairly inconclusive ending, although the presence of the movies as a follow-up production practically invalidates the latter point. Anyone who is looking for the next great modern mystery and suspense series, you will do well to find better than this gem of an anime.\\n",

            "content": "Eden of the East came out of nowhere in the Spring 2009 season - with no works preceding it, not many people knew exactly what to expect, and with only 11 episodes, there were questions as to how one could possibly explore such an ambitious plot successfully.\r\nLuckily for all of us, however, Eden of the East, even with its brevity, managed to set itself apart, providing a winning combination of engaging characters, unique plot, and surprising depth to present itself as one of the best shows of the season, perhaps of the year so far.\r\nPLOT: 9/10\r\nWith only 11 episodes, the show pulled off a ratheramazing feat - not once did the story ever feel rushed, and not once did it feel like there was too much information packed into too small of a package. Starting off with the \"amnesiac hero\" vibe that gave The Bourne Identity series its teeth and plot hook, things unfold at a rapid pace, wasting no time diving into the conspiracies of \"Careless Monday\" and the overlying game of the Selecao as the 12 competing individuals employ their own methods to \"save\" Japan.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the meat of the story is presented quite well, explaining things at a level that gives you what you need to understand at the time and nothing more, yet still leaving enough dangling that you're actually anxious to watch the next episode, just waiting to see where the next puzzle piece fits. There were a few places where I would have liked to see a bit more explanation, but with the series not actually over yet I'll reserve judgement, as there's still plenty of opportunity for them to be answered when the two movies come out.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Eden of the East were admittedly a bit of hit and miss. The main male protagonist, Takizawa, was a hit from the minute you saw him in the buff - his charisma and quirky nature made him instantly likable. Many of the Selecao and side characters, for their brief screen time, were also engaging and personable. The female protagonist Saki, however, was a rather generic character - her only purpose in the show seemed to be as a vehicle for romantic tension between her and Takizawa, and after the plot abandoned most of that tension in the first few episodes in favor of the overlying plot, she was quickly pushed to the background, her role quickly overshadowed and outshined by almost every other person on the cast. In short, she was rather forgettable, and not much important to anything, at least in my opinion - I can't really think of many places in the story after about episode 3 where she couldn't have been removed without any ill effect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nNothing bad to say about this - the animation was very clean and well detailed, especially in terms of scenery - some of the shots of the city, especially at night, were downright gorgeous. The characters themselves were done by Chika Umino of Honey and Clover fame, so the similarities were instantly identifiable - my only complaint about this style would be some of the emotion representations, such as the \"angry swirl\" above the head (if there's a name for this style, I'm unaware of it D: ) - these seem better reserved for more comedic moments than were existent in Eden, and thus oftentimes felt out of place. There were also some times where the character designs seemed slightly inconsistent, but definitely nothing deal-breaking. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED for Eden were great - I'm not a huge fan of Oasis, but I found myself digging \"Falling Down\". In terms of background music, I really didn't find myself noticing much, being too engrossed with the story, but there were definitely no moments where I was like \"wow, that's ridiculously pretty/awesome\" or \"wow, that's ridiculously inappropriate/bad\", so the whole thing sort of washes neutral.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEden of The East was a pleasant surprise, and with two movies coming out over the course of the next year, I'm already impatient about finding out what's going to happen next. At 11 episodes, it won't waste much of your time, and you won't regret the ride at all.",

            "content": "Returning to Eden of the East was a little scary, as it always is to return to old favourites you\u2019re not sure will still hold up. A year or two later after the TV series proved to be favourites amongst critics and fans, two sequel movies came out. They were originally intended to be part of the original airing run but had to be cut out to fit into the TV airing. Those movies were not so well received. They\u2019re not actively bad per se. In fact I\u2019d call the second one actually quite good. But almost everyone was so lukewarm on the movies thatEden of the East, so highly regarded a year previously, suddenly dropped off everyone\u2019s radars and I barely see it talked about today. So much of Eden is its potential. With the knowledge that it doesn\u2019t deliver, I was not sure whether it would hold up at all.\\n\\n\r\nTurns out it totally does hold up. The story of a man randomly showing up in front of the White House naked with nothing but a gun and a phone with 8 billion yen on it is still as brilliant an opening gambit as ever. That whole opening scene is still right up there as one of my all time favourites. A frustrated college graduate travels to the White House to throw pennies at it, trying to get into the fountain but can\u2019t reach, while also feeling a little unimpressed now that she\u2019s there and it seems much smaller. An underlying frustration on the part of the youths of Japan and trying to find the centre of where that all comes from leads to her throwing pennies at the White House. It\u2019s clever, it\u2019s funny, and it says a lot about what the show is trying to do right there (also random other note: I just visited the White House last week so of course I threw a penny at it. Surreptitiously of course so I didn\u2019t need a random naked dude to rescue me).\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East is centrally about frustrated college graduates stuck without a job and wondering who to blame or what they can do. How the baby boomers fucked up the country but young adults today are not sure whether there\u2019s more they should be doing. It\u2019s fitting then that the main character is some vintage jeans, overcoat wearing hipster. What\u2019s more remarkable is how well they pull him off as a genuine human being while also being something close to a saviour. I didn\u2019t remember how much the show leaned on Takizawa Akira being modern day hipster Moses, saving the NEETs by transporting them all naked on giant freighters to Dubai. If done badly Takizawa could have come off like Tatsuya from Mahouka: A smug, self-important godlike character the writers spend the whole show sucking his dick. Takizawa instead feels like a human who had the messiah label thrown upon him unwillingly. He\u2019s incredibly angry at the whole Noblisse Oblige shtick he\u2019s been given and wants nothing more than to punch the person who gave him that role in the face.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an area Eden of the East is weak on. The animation and directing is fantastic. Despite its very heavy, deep themes, it never loses its sense of humour. It\u2019s an actively very witty show with fun characters. It never stops being a cartoon with its goofy reactions. The humour doesn\u2019t detract from its messages and story, which shows the general strength of the writing. The characters all feel suitably human and unique. No Yuji Everylead the Bland in sight and they all serve their own purpose in the story. The music is great, OP ED and insert music. It\u2019s also generally cool with Takizawa sporting a black turtleneck sweater with trenchcoat and actually making it work. With its random references to Taxi Driver and Jason Bourne, it\u2019s something you could quite happily show to a Normal and say \u201clook at this hot cool anime stuff\u201d without having to explain away anime bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything works as well as it wants. The whole Johnny snipper arc is a little haphazard. But it attempts much more than 99% of anime that I can forgive the small problem for a much more fascinating broader picture. And as I said earlier, there\u2019s no one area that keeps cropping up as a problem in a directing/animation/overall production point. The only real issue is it doesn\u2019t end completely with the TV series and you\u2019re left with the movies. But upon finishing my rewatch of the TV series, I came totally to terms with that. I don\u2019t need the movies. I don\u2019t need to see the end. The first Matrix movie isn\u2019t ruined as a spectacle by itself because the sequels exist. You don\u2019t feel angry because it didn\u2019t finish its story. That\u2019s how I feel about Eden of the East.",

            "content": "\u201c Noblesse Oblige, Please continue being a messiah.\u201d\r\nEven though it was one of the shortest anime to air recently, Production I.G. produced another excellent and satisfying anime again!\r\nThe story of Eden of the East is very creative. It reflects the current political and economical situations we are in today. Terrorists, NEETS, missile attacks and 9/11 shows that Eden of the East wants us to relate its story to what is happening in the real world. Aside from the realism that it presents, it also has its own share of mystery and suspense that adds up to the twists and turns of the story. Even thoughit is a political-type of anime, there\u2019s also a dash of humor so as not to make the atmosphere heavy and also to balance the complex plot.\\n\\n\r\nComprising of 11 episodes, the series was able to present an excellent pacing, revealing the puzzle pieces neither too quickly nor too slowly. At first we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, soon we learn about the Selecao game, and Mr. Outside. Later, the origin of the missile attacks is revealed, and finally Takizawa\u2019s identity. It manages to present the pieces smoothly without confusing the viewers. It also didn\u2019t bombard viewers with too much information in a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art and animation, Eden of the East excels. The character designs are simple and stands out. Backgrounds are very detailed. Computer graphics used in the series for the missiles, phones etc\u2026 blended well with the regular animation. High budgeted animation was definitely given for this series. As for the sound, the OP song is very modernized, and its meaning suits the theme/message of the anime. The ED song is cool to listen, it slightly resembles the OP of Honey and Clover (in terms of visuals). The voice acting is solid and matches the attitude of the characters well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting. Takizawa, being a mysterious protagonist, is not your usual, angsty or \u201cdark\u201d bishounen. On the contrary, he is very likable because he is cheerful and emotionally stable despite having no recollection of his past. Saki is likable as well, although she\u2019s just your ordinary shoujo who usually gets into abnormal situations and doesn\u2019t seem to contribute much to the anime. The other casts are unique especially the Selecao. They are very interesting, each having his/her own stand in changing the world. The casts as a whole are more realistic than animeish and tend to stay away from expected anime archetypes. Most of them were given short but good character developments.\\n\\n\r\nDespite ending in a cliffhanger, it\u2019s still very entertaining that left me wanting for more episode after another. Because the movie isn\u2019t up yet, the ending might be a bit unusual or unsatisfying for some. Nonetheless, it brings us a very unique and interesting plot, and a message that reflects our society today. I highly recommend this series to those who are looking for a different view of politically and realistic themed anime plus well-rounded characters coupled with superb animation and music.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all, Eden is an anime geared towards a more mature audience who pays attention to details.\r\nYou must not expect a typical shonen/shojo/moe based anime.\r\nThis anime is one of the most well made series I have seen in a long time. \r\nFirst off, the summary of the show may be a turn off and doesnt tell you much about the show. Here is my attempt at a summary without too many spoilers.\r\nTakizawa Akira is a Selacao, a player in a game, where the goal is to save Japan using 10 billion yen and a cell phone with \"magic powers\". Having erased his memory, hemeets Saki and as thier relationship grows, he tries to find out his past and what his purpose is as a Selacao.\\n\\n\r\nStory: the plot is so well planned out. You are led from episode to episode, where you learn new plot developments every time. It is complex, and requires thought. In the end, it is so satisfying and you want to see more. It is hard to describe the story without giving any of it away.\\n\\n\r\nArt: beautiful art and animation, especially during the ending scenes. Not your typical pretty boys/moe girls either. There are a lot of scribbled out body parts in the show, it can get a bit annoying sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: the OP and ED are wonderful songs. Although the background music is subtle throughout the series, the music in the last episode was EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the characters made the show for me. over the series, you see the characters grow and develop, love and hate, show remorse, and you feel so close to the characters. One theme touched on over the show is the current state of youths in Japan..... it is depicted so well, and you feel connection. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 20/10. I coudlnt wait to see the next episode every time and you learn to LOVE the characters. The show is confusing at times, but thats what makes it so good. If you want some brainless anime, dont watch this show. It wouldnt be worth it at all.",

            "content": "After reading rave reviews on today's title, Eden of the East, I decided to take a few days to see what all the fuss was about. The first episode opens as Saki stands in front of the White House, launching stones from outside the fence onto the open greens. The police promptly accost Saki, but she is saved by an unknown man, running around naked while waving a gun. The story then follows their adventure back to Japan and into his history which has been erased from his memory. To complicate matters, he has been gifted a cellphone that connects to a woman who cangrant any wish a human could dream of, requiring only that the wisher uses his funds to become the \"savior of the world.\"\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can certainly understand the initial appeal of this series--a title full of average-looking, everyday folks caught in a mysterious battle usually signals a story saturated with magic realism that depends less on sensationalism and more on depth and criticism to wow its audience--I have to say that Eden of the East quickly fell into the usual traps. Much like Speed Grapher(2005), which promised to offer a more mature take on corruption and government, Eden of the East sets up a strong, interesting plotline but was both too short and too slow-paced to follow through on its promise. One strand of the story looks at a cruel serial killer who seems somehow connected to the mysterious cellphone and stumbles with what I can only describe as mediocre and stereotypically shallow execution. The ending, which was clearly meant to ensue in utterly epic proportions, fell flat, both plot-wise and visually. Meanwhile, a story like Eden of the East that struggles fiercely to become a masterpiece, typically warrants dynamic and creative directing; needless to say neither was present as far as I can see.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all its shortcomings, Eden of the East still ranks above average in its enjoyability and execution. The ED and OP were quite enjoyable, and I can clearly tell that production hired very interesting creative directors for both sequences. The voice acting, while unspectacular, demands little criticism. The animation was purposefully \"just decent\" though I would have enjoyed better camera angles and choreography. Furthermore, with just 13 episodes, it's worth the time to watch if you are interested in a series that doesn't fall as close to the stereotypical drivel that we are used to by now. Many viewers may even attribute more depth and better execution to this series than I have.\\n\\n\r\nA timeless masterpiece this is not, but Eden of the East can still be very enjoyable. It's brevity, though damaging to the overall execution, certainly still makes it worth watching on a Saturday afternoon. If you are looking for a better series from Kenji Kawayama though, this one is DEFINITELY not representative of his talents (see Seirei no Moribito or Ghost in the Shell).\\n\\n\r\nwritten for Minitokyo's Newsletter: MT-Maigetsu",

            "content": "With any open-ended question, there are various approaches that can be taken to reach an answer. The thing is, there isn\u2019t always a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer. People have different perspectives, beliefs, and personalities that may all contribute to the answer that feels most correct for each of them. \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d explores this idea by asking its characters the vague and overbroad question: \u201cGiven the resources, how would you improve a nation for the better?\u201d Eleven people that are chosen by the mysterious Mr. Outside are each given ten billion yens to carry out their plans to improve Japan. Each of them, with different beliefs, backgrounds,and occupations, attempts to \u201csave\u201d Japan from all its lies and corruption in his or her own way. Although some players end up shifting their focus to achieving their own personal goals, other players, including the protagonist Takizawa Akira, actively try to find the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to improve Japan.\\n\\n\r\nCurious to find out what kind of philosophical clashes would occur between the characters, I got onboard the \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d train with high hopes and anticipations. Unfortunately, this anime eventually became a train wreck piled up with plot holes, unanswered questions, and undeveloped characters (even with its two sequel movies). Above all, however, the most frustrating thing about this show was that the core question was never explored too well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that I disliked the anime. On the contrary, it is one of the more memorable ones that I have seen thus far. From the start, the anime immediately catches the viewers\u2019 attention with its distinct art style resembling that of Studio Ghibli films. Then the opening song, \u201cFalling Down\u201d by Oasis, captivates the viewers in a state of complete trance. Not only the opening song, but also the whole soundtrack is phenomenal in general, especially the insert song, \u201cReveal the World,\u201d with its soulful vocals and jazzy feel. Overall, the aesthetic and auditory components of the show blew me away at first glance and those alone were enough to keep me watching. \\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, however, I was more so interested in the different philosophies and ideas that characters had towards fixing a nation. Unfortunately, \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d is the classic case of an overambitious story that fails to follow through after making a grand entrance. The following paragraphs explore the issues of \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d as a whole:\\n\\n\r\n(Some of the following paragraphs might contain minor spoilers, so please skip if you don\u2019t want to spoil the show for yourself. The following paragraphs will cover mostly the first season, but also mention the two movies)\\n\\n\r\n1) An overambitious story with unambitious characters: \\n\r\nThe stage is set with 11 different people all trying to improve Japan in their own ways, but the story ends up narrowing the stage to essentially two people, the \u201cpolitician\u201d and the \u201cdreamer.\u201d All the other players more or less become irrelevant to this \u201cgame\u201d because they had little to no interest in improving Japan. That set off the first alarm to me \u2013 I would have expected all 11 people to be well developed and thoroughly explored in terms of their personalities and personal beliefs. However, the first season ends with introducing about seven players, only four of whom received the most spotlight. In addition, once I learned that some players have no ambitions to improve Japan, they became so irrelevant that I thought it would have been better if the show had not introduced them in the first place. I would rather have had the anime place more focus on its two main players, instead of trying to forcibly insert other players into the plot and end up muddling it even more. \\n\\n\r\n2) Little to no character development: \\n\r\nBecause of the scale of the story, the anime neglects the development of its core characters. The female protagonist, Morisami Saki, seems like a promising character in the first episode because of her cheerful and lovely personality. She garners more attention when she falls in love with Takizawa Akira when they meet one day almost by fate. However, this love relationship between the two becomes tepid real quick and lingers on like a flickering light for the rest of the series. What\u2019s worse is that Saki is seen as nothing more than Takizawa\u2019s \u201chelper\u201d after the first episode, and every scene that she is in thereafter is her either worrying about Takizawa or being gloomy and helpless.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Takizawa, who confuses me more and more as the anime goes on. His amnesia at the start of the show was a nice set up for the anime to develop him as he slowly learns more about himself. However, the anime fumbles around too much and Takizawa doesn\u2019t learn about himself until the end. As a result, Takizawa comes off as a scatterbrained protagonist who seems to know what he\u2019s doing but half of the time he wings it. Hence, I never knew whether I should support Takizawa because he doesn\u2019t explain what he tries to do half of the time and he never strongly affirms to what kind of a nation he wants to build until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nWith the two main characters undeveloped, the supporting cast of characters is even less developed. Namely the \u201cEast of Eden\u201d crew, a group in charge of an image recognition software, this group of characters can best be described as \u201cmonotonous.\u201d They are always around to help Takizawa fulfill his noble goal of helping Japan, but their presence is rarely a welcome sight and thus their efforts seem underwhelming. Also, their range of emotions is limited to being gloomy, serious, or mildly humorous, so that made the characters dull and uninteresting. Overall, the little to no character development is what ultimately made this show surprisingly bland.\\n\\n\r\n3) Plot holes and unanswered questions: \\n\r\nThis show is full of them, even with 11 episodes and two movies. The amount of plot holes and unanswered questions eventually reaches a point in which the show tries to take the easy way out by explaining everything at once. The first season sets up for this disastrous scriptwriting because it leaves so many unanswered questions for the two following movies to answer. As a result, the two movies are filled with mostly dialogue and events trying to explain everything, thus preventing the story from moving forward. Even if the second movie ended more or less wrapping up everything, the ending is still somewhat forced, rushed, anticlimactic, and underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nTo end, \u201cHigashi no Eden\u201d was definitely one of the most memorable anime I\u2019ve seen because of its aesthetic and auditory components. However, the show fails follow up on its overly ambitious and potentially philosophical story because of its plot holes, unanswered questions, and undeveloped characters. Considering Kenji Kamiyama\u2019s other esteemed works, this show definitely deserved better but ended up getting the short end of the stick.\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\r\nOverall: 6.8/10\\n",

            "content": "Eden of the East\r\nJAP title : Higashi no Eden\r\n(Yes, I did not give this anime a score of 10 or 9. Go ahead, press the \u2018Not Helpful\u2019 option without even reading the review.)\r\nThere, now hopefully, the fanboys are out of the way.\r\nAlright, I walked in with high expectations for this one. I had read so many rave reviews about this particular show and though I would give it a shot. Was I satisfied? \r\nOnly one way to find out\u2026\r\n[ 1 MINUTE REVIEW ]\r\nEden of the East puts forward a superb concept: letting a bunch of people, with a ton of money, play a game to\u201csave\u201d their country. This creative story is very refreshing and has and the direction has a Hollywood-like feel to it. With such a mysterious plot and an amnesiac protagonist, this anime should be brilliant shouldn\u2019t it? Well, it is, but not as brilliant as it COULD have been. Although overall, the anime is absorbing, poor characters, inconsistent pacing and logical inconsistencies prevent this anime from being a masterpiece. The animation, especially the detailed backgrounds, is fantastic and one of the best I have ever seen and reflects on the high production values. The OP was very cool, with a chic video and a solid English song, while the ED was good in its own right. The anime starts with a bang and ends with a much bigger and more satisfying bang. Sadly, the anime is quite disappointing in the episodes in between as the show tries to incorporate more genres like shojo and psychology into it and this leaves the viewer with a rather confused state of mind. And considering the whole show is only 11 episodes, this was a fatal mistake. The last few episodes were exhilarating, intelligent and were a smooth build up to the movies, but even these fantastic episodes are not enough to compensate for the irregular first half. Eden of the East is a show with so much potential, that on paper, it is a blockbuster, but in reality, it is quite a letdown. It\u2019s a wonderful anime, make no mistake about that, but it\u2019s just that it feels like winning 100$ in a 1,000,000$ lottery. \\n\\n\r\n[ 5 MINUTE REVIEW ]\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s put you into the protagonist\u2019s shoes:\\n\\n\r\nYou are a Japanese man who is currently outside the White House and you just realized that you are completely naked. (You sort of look like Mowgli from Disney\u2019s The Jungle Book btw).  You have a slick mobile in one hand and on the other, you have a gun. You have no idea who you are, why you are outside the US President\u2019s office, how you got there or when you got there. Basically, you have lost your memory of all past incidents. What will you do?\\n\\n\r\nAlright, fine. Let\u2019s assume you somehow obtain the information that the cell phone in your hand is actually a very special one.  It has 10 billion yen charged in it and it can grant any wish. You are also told that you need to save Japan using this money and the phone. If you do not, you will be killed. There are 10 others just like you and the same conditions apply for them. Once again, the same question arises: What will you do?\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I absolutely loved this story. It was totally fascinating and I was looking forward to watching it as soon as I read the synopsis. This was like the anime version of a Bourne film mixed with The Condemned (the Steve Austin movie). Did the story live up to my expectations? It most certainly did. It had me hooked from episode one to eleven and I can\u2019t really pinpoint the reason for this anime\u2019s engaging storyline. Maybe it was the mysterious aura that surrounded it. Or maybe it was the amnesic protagonist. However, the story was the one place, other than the animation of course, where I was fully satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has an overall dark mood around it. Although the main characters prance about cities carelessly, you do feel a certain anxiety in the atmosphere as you are constantly wondering what is going to happen next. And for maintaining this nervous atmosphere, which for some strange reason reminded me of Darker than Black, throughout, Production IG deserves a lot of credit.\\n\\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for the plot though. There were several plot holes and some mistakes were just dreadful. For instance, the studio employed professional English voice actors for the Americans, something that is not often done. A very welcome choice, nonetheless. Yet, these American locals, who are introduced as people who speak only their native language suddenly comprehend Japanese. Honestly, how do the cops overcome the language barrier in a matter of minutes? And are they trying to tell me that some Washington cab drivers know Japanese while some do not? \\n\\n\r\nWhile we are on the topic of cops, here again, Production IG makes some pretty stupid errors trying to recreate the Washington DC police force. After all the homework they did trying to get the background of DC right, they could\u2019ve spent a bit more time on the creative aspect, as the intelligence level of cops is below zero and their tolerance level is ridiculously high. Although I\u2019ve never been to DC, I really don\u2019t think the cops monitoring the White House will allow a naked Asian guy carrying a pistol to get away. Hell, the first thing they do in these sort of situations is call for backup. Apparently that didn\u2019t strike the creative team, but it struck me, a guy who watches a lot of Hollywood flicks. Also, another instance of cop insanity, is when a police officer requests a guy to drop his pants to verify his \u201cJohnny\u2019s\u201d identity. Apparently, his Johnny is more recognizable than his face. There are logical inconsistencies all over the place and this sort of ruins the mood occasionally.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER START]Also, the anime tries to be as realistic as possible in the start, with the Death Note-like approach, but as the series goes on, you see supernatural elements brought into play. I mean, it starts off with a guy and a girl struggling to outwit the police, but in the middle of the series, a character sprouts wings and jumps out of the windows. I\u2019m not kidding. Oh, and the wings were black. EDIT - I heard this was due to \"graphics\" and it was all just an illusion. I dunno how that works, but hey, when there's a visual search engine that tells you about a piano with just a cellphone image of its foot, then I guess anything's possible.[END SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nAfter slandering the creative team there, I\u2019ll move onto the department that has completely outdone itself \u2013 the animation department. The animation was freakin awesome. The backgrounds were perfect and were extremely detailed. Both Washington DC and Japan have been done really well. Transition is smooth and there is an overall fluidity. A perfect ten for this department. The character designs were a little unique as well. The heads and the legs were pretty disproptionate and although this may usually make for ugly characters, the coloring and the dresses of the characters suit them so well that this minor flow is easily overlooked. Saki looks a bit chubby, in the cute way, which is something most anime artists don\u2019t do and her skin has a certain gloss to it. Kudos again! Certain chibi animations did feel out of place though.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio department has done a great job too. The OP, Falling, is done by British band, Oasis. I am a huge Oasis fan and I love their music and this track was no exception. It was a cool song that is certainly iPodable. The video for the OP was very creative too, with random messiah sayings propping up all over the screen and the liberal use of the color pink. Very good presentation. The ED too, was very innovative, with paper characters and a stop-motion animation. The vocals were decent. As for the background score, it was your usual set of instrumental pieces which get the job done. Neat work by the sound dudes :D !\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, well, shallow. I know people all over the world love Akira, but to be honest, I really don\u2019t see why. Sure, he plays cool, especially in the end, but he really isn\u2019t all that much of an interesting a character. He maybe occasionally smart, but he hardly shows any emotions. This might not have been a problem if the show tried to be just a thriller, but Eden of the East tries to be more than that and that\u2019s where it falls flat. It tries to add some shojo romance, some chibi comedy and some psychology stuff too. And in the end, there is one cook too many and the broth is spoilt. I often felt confused in the middle of the episode as I was unclear on what genre this anime wanted to fit in. The side characters are totally boring and you will most probably forget their names and their faces when you start watching a new anime. One word I know I won\u2019t forget is Johnny. (In case you didn\u2019t get it already, Johnny is a dick. Very tasteful, huh?)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Saki, the \u201cmain\u201d character, does nothing to justify her role. All she does is whine about Akira or look downcast, like her puppy died. Oh, and since this is an anime, her parents are dead.\\n\\n\r\nThere were several references to Hollywood films, which I liked. But don\u2019t worry; most of the films are the big hits, so I think you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re talking about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eden of the East is a great anime that wastes its potential due to poor plot design, average characters and irregular pace. Although this is a love it or hate it anime, I somehow manage to fall right in the middle. Agreed, some parts were just silly and could\u2019ve been done away with, but the show also contains a lot of scenes that I found exciting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI heard the movies are awesome, so I\u2019ll get to watching that right away !\\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom-line:\\n\r\nThis is a hard anime not to recommend due to the varying impact it has. So, I think you should definitely check this out. I can guarantee it won\u2019t be a total waste of your time.\\n",

            "content": "\"Noblesse oblige I pray for your continuing service as a savior\"\r\nWith great power, comes great responsibility ~Uncle Ben\r\nHigashi no Eden (translated to Eden of the East) is a short 11-episode mystery/action with an intriguing premise that basically begins en media res, leaving the viewer wondering what is going on at the beginning as the action unfolds.\r\nStory: \r\nBasically the story begins after previous major events that are revealed over time. You follow the main character Akira Takizawa, who has wiped his memory and is now in process of trying to figure out his previous reasonings for it. The plot is interesting with a suspense to keepyou wanting more. However, since it was only 11 episodes, the ending sort of leaves you with a cliffhanger, to be followed up by the 2 movies following it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe main characters consist of Akari Takizawa and Saki Morimi, the woman who becomes wrapped in the mystery with Akari as he begins figuring things out. Akari himself is a great character, who is quickly likeable, being lighthearted at times and serious at other, doesn't take things that seriously, while being funny and a little witty all at the same time. His mysterious past, amnesia, and his random knowledge of film references all are a part of his character. He basically is the star of the show, advancing it along. Saki on the other hand is a bit bland, who does have some good interaction with Akari and the others, but seems more like someone dragged onto the ride (which she basically is). The supporting cast do their job well enough, with good chemistry between one another. The other Selecao members all have different personalities and backgrounds, which provides an extra bit of interest to the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nI'd say great overall, the opening and endings were very well done, and the character design looked good, although not super polished, they were fine. The backgrounds and setting all looked great and animation was smooth. No real qualms from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Falling Down\" by Oasis suited the theme of the anime very well, even though it wasn't designed for the anime. Good pick by the producers. The ending was also good. The background themes and sounds were crisp and clean throughout the anime, and suited the scenes they were in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a solid anime with many good points going for it. It's a nice short anime to get into as it really grabs your attention early, although the fact that it is followed by 2 movies afterwards seems a little strange. \\n",

            "content": "On a trip to the United States, college student Morimi Saki stumbles upon an odd sight. Of all things, she meets a naked Japanese man, armed with a handgun. As she learns, this man has no idea who he is, or how he got there, and all that he can really remember are films, save for which one his personal favourite was. Soon, it becomes apparent that Takizawa Akira, as he is now going by, is a lot more than he first appears, as he finds out that he may have been part of a terrorist act committed in Japan. Then, he only gets evenmore shrouded in mystery with the presence of an odd phone; which he is told possesses ten million yen, and all that he is told to do with it, is to continue to be a Messiah.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on the surface, this premise is interesting enough, albeit a little silly. The show starts strongly, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay that way. Although it's genuinely funny at first, the jokes quickly grow stale. The drama almost never works, because of a bit of silly dialogue that makes you want to laugh rather than take it seriously, there are plot holes left and right, especially towards the end, and speaking of the ending, it's silly. It feels really rushed and doesn't make much sense at all. \\n\\n\r\nReally, this is just a perfect example of an interesting premise with poor execution. This could have been something great, but it falls sadly short. You can feel the potential this series had, but it really blew it. It's just too bad when this happens, it really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, well, a bit shallow. Okay, really shallow. Takizawa's air of cool is interesting, and he's fun to have around, but for most of the series, the man doesn't show any emotion. He isn't well developed, and when they try to develop him, it's very sloppy, and makes him come off as annoying. Saki never really goes through any changes in the series aside from the fact that she changes who she has a crush on. By the end of the series, she's still as helpless and ignorant as she was in the beginning. Some of the minor characters in the show, such as Satoshi, Ryou, and Yuusei appeared to be really interesting, but because of the series' short runtime, were never given the chance to develop properly, and the show really suffers from it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are good things about Eden of the east, though, and one of them is the animation. It's smooth, and well done, without any CGI affect that plague many recent anime to throw it off. The landscapes are all beautifully drawn, and full of life. The character designs are a mixed bag, some being incredibly detailed, and some being very simple, but it usually works.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Eden of the east is usually pretty unremarkable except for maybe one or two pieces. The rest are entirely forgettable. That cannot be said about the opening theme, though, or, at least the English version of the song. (To clarify, the Japanese version has an opening with English vocals, and probably due to licensing issues, the English version has the opening with Japanese vocals.) The English version of the song is sung by the British band \"Oasis\". It is incredibly catchy and fits very well with the animation. This, unfortunately, cannot be said about the Japanese version of the song. The Japanese version is sadly, uninspired and doesn't fit well with the opening animation at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in Eden of the east is great in both languages, but the Japanese version really went the extra mile here by hiring English-speaking voice actors to play English-speaking characters. There isn't any cringe-worthy 'Engrish' here!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eden of the east is a bag of sadly wasted potential. It has some interesting characters, and the plot can be exciting\u2026 when it wants to be. The payoff, though, is wholly unsatisfying. Great animation, and an awesome opening can't really make up for all the series, unfortunately, did not do right.",

            "content": "Eden of the East was a show that had a strong start - introducing a pair of instantly likeable characters that had excellent chemistry, solid direction, and hints of an interesting and highly complex plot. Unfortunately, the rest of the series was not capable of fully realizing the potential that this series had, leaving a rather mediocre package.\r\nThis show is first and foremost a mystery, and much of the series is dedicated to finding out who exactly our main character (Takizawa) is, as well as the details of a game that he is taking part in. For such a series, the plot is of utmostimportance, as a mystery will never be truly satisfying if the reveals turn out to be weak or have little impact. Unfortunately, despite a compelling and promising start, the show fails to deliver, never leading to a truly satisfying climax. There are also many twists which are ridiculous and not well explained. At the end of the series, many plot threads are left unanswered, and a certain character makes a unfathomably ridiculous decision - all so that the series can have a sequel in the form of two movies. Thus, the series does not work well as a standalone as it lacks closure, and unfortunately, the movies do not solve the problem either, somehow managing to butcher the ending even further.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the leads in this show are great, and they are highly enjoyable to watch. I mentioned earlier that the connection between Saki and Takizawa was instantaneous and they had great chemistry, and that remains true throughout the series. The dialogue between them is great, and their interactions are without a doubt the high point of the series. Takizawa is a great character - having a highly excitable personality which is amazing to watch, and interesting approaches to problems that crop up. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, another problem crops up here - our characters never really grow. The two of them, despite seeming like excellent leads at the start, mostly remain static throughout the series. It is a little difficult to elaborate on what I mean without going into spoilers, but let's just say that some questionable decisions are made, and Saki's role in the story is never really clear.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the leads, although some of the characters seem interesting, they are never really given the room to grow and develop. This is probably due to the short run time of series, which results in most of the screen time being allocated to Takizawa and the plot.\\n\\n\r\nStill, despite the failings of the narrative, it cannot be denied that Eden of the East is a highly enjoyable show. It is well-produced, having great animation and an excellent soundtrack, and is always nice to look at. Even though the plot does feel ridiculous at many points, it is still a show that is rarely boring, and one that I enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is a massive disappointment. The writing is lackluster at best, and the show feels as if it tried to do too much with too little time. The movies that follow this series do not remedy that problem either - they do not conclude well, and manage to waste a ridiculous amount of screen time on things that are not central to the plot. Even though the show still remains enjoyable due to the many antics and twists, it is one that is a mere shell of what could have been. Would still recommend it as it is worth a watch, but it would be wise to not expect much out of the show.",

            "content": "Though not exactly a foray into the unknown, Eden of the East does just enough to make it unique and memorable. Combined with near perfect technical execution, Eden of the East is a solid anime.\r\nI was already thoroughly impressed with Eden of the East after about five minutes into the first episode. There is this cool edgy feel to it as soon as you start watching. The series begins in Washington D.C. when Morimi Saki (cv. Hayami Saori) meets a stark naked Takizawa Akira (cv. Kimura Ryohei). The first thing that really stood out was the conspicuous lack of engrish. Production I.G. seemed to havethe good sense to cast people who actually speak English for the American background characters. While this takes away from the hilarity factor, it adds a sense of realism to the series. Contrary to shows like Baccano! where everyone speaks Japanese despite being 1920\u2019s Americans in New York, the distinctive language barrier adds a sense of internationalism.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a short 11 episodes, Eden is paced extremely well, leaving the viewer excited for what\u2019s going to happen next, but not drawing a plot over too many episodes. Characters are in abundance and each character, even relatively minor ones, have distinctive personalities and objectives. A highlight of East of Eden is the very earthy, intriguing yet realistic relationship between the two protagonists: Saki and Akira. Akira is off on his own adventures and investigating the reason and mysteries behind the other wielders of that magical phone. While Saki\u2019s curiosity of the origin of this mysterious boy leads to an intresting plot structure of Akira investigating other people like him, and Saki investigating Akira. The other Selecao (people with money phones) each have different agendas and wildly different personalities, including a hedonistic corrupt detective and a sadistic serial killer.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, Eden is very strong. This anime addresses concepts like terrorism or security in a manner that is easily related to by today\u2019s society. Feelings of duty, service, and power are all addressed on several levels. Eden of the East often contains striking imagery to reinforce thematic or plot elements. The anime centers around a key phrase known as noblesse oblige, the concept that with great power and prestige come even greater responsibilities. The actions and demeanor of various Selecao provide very fruitful deep analysis into many meanings, variants, and interpretations of the concept.\\n\\n\r\nAs said earlier, Eden of the East is nearly perfect technically. The background art and animation looks superb. English rock band Oasis provides the music for the opening theme with their single Falling Down. Noel Gallagher\u2019s striking vocals fit perfectly with an incredibly unique and eyecatching opening sequence that makes the OP the iconic feature of the series. school food punishment\u2019s ending theme is also very good. While character design is not the most appealing thing in the world, its subdued, almost bland nature almost seems to fit the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Eden of the East is exactly what it brands itself as, an action mystery thriller with bits of humor thrown in and sci-fi elements. Not much is actually resolved at the end of the series and the last episode will leave you with tons of questions unanswered. Movie sequels have already been announced. It\u2019s not exactly groundbreaking or genre-defining, but it\u2019s exactly what it bills itself as.",

            "content": "I knew it wouldn't be long until my next review, as I started this halfway through Ergo Proxy, and so that's one pro/con straight off the bat - this is a bite-sized anime with only 11 episodes! Despite that, I personally think the anime didn't feel rushed and so let us segway into the full review of Higashi no Eden, or Eden of the East:\r\nStory - If my opinion means anything, this opinion may deter you from watching this but I don't think that's fair, I think the show is still good but the story is certainly the weakest link in the show. I realizesaying this I'm likely going to get a letter soon from a collection of you on MAL saying I should burn/rot etc, but allow me an explanation. Know what I said earlier, how I said the show doesn't feel rushed? You'd think that would mean, in my opinion, I thought everything was well explained right? Well, that's my main problem. You're still scratching your head halfway through at the characters, even some new ones getting thrown in right at the end, and they're all really well explained, and I commend that. However, the main characters motive, a certain organizations purpose and motive, the other characters linked to both the main character and said organization, VERY disjointed, there was no real cohesive storyline despite the fact these characters and the organization are essentially THE PLOT OF THE SHOW. For saying it's about missile attacks in Japan, there's no real tension either. Now, to combat this, I watched Zankyou no Terror (which I think I reviewed and highly recommend, whether I did review the show or not) before Eden of the East, and both shows have VERY similar plots, and so this may have spoiled the plot for me as I may have sub-consciously thought I was just watching the same show by a different art team, but I dunno. Either way, it's still enjoyable if not always easy to follow. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Thankfully, for the shows creators, it's fans and myself (for the hate I'm likely to get for the above), the story is certainly the only real weak link. The art is gorgeous. No Cowboy Bebop or Dragon Ball (I think everyone can appreciate hand-drawn art styles), but it's certainly a looker. It really conveys whatever it's try to depict, whether that be Saki (the girl on the cover) and her cute face, or the architecture of Tokyo, it's all very colourful and clean. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound is great too. Not as good as the visuals, but still well implemented. For me not saying there's much tension, there's actually some very tense, but also action-type music, where it's needed, but then there's also calmer interludes and rifts and such as it's needed. So it's very well implemented as well as just being, or should that be sounding, good. The opening is by Oasis (yes, \"Wonderwall\" Oasis) and the closing theme is just as calming, by a Japanese artist. All very very nice. 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - So, to quickly rattle them off (by second name for convinience):\\n\r\nSaki, Takizawa, Mr Outside, Kazoumi, \"Sis\" (don't know real name, either it's not said or my memory), Ohsugi, Kasuga, Katsuhara, Shiratori, Mononobe, Kondo and \"Panties\", or Itazu. I'm gonna give a quick bio of each so strap yourself in:-\\n\\n\r\nSaki is in America studying in her last year of university. She's sweet, cute, kind and forms a bit of a love triangle between herself, Takizawa and Ohsugi. And she starts to fall for Takizawa, when she makes her return back to Japan after graduating. It's not shown them having a relationship, but it's certainly implied she has feelings for him. She's likeable if not a bit bland.\\n\\n\r\nTakizawa is the real protagonist, being linked to the aforementioned organization, and he has a phone given to him by this organization which allows him to do whatever he wants, along as he has the funds (he has over a billion yen, so essentially for such a short run-time this means the power is limitless). Sounds interesting, but with the plot being so disjointed in my opinion, it doesn't work as well as it could have.\\n\r\nMr Outside is implied to be the head of said organization, but he's not seen much, if at all, I can't exactly remember. He's only really there as a goal for Takizawa to work towards, as he repeatedly says he'd love nothing more than to punch Mr Outside in the face for setting up this game (said game being the plot, so won't be mentioned as NO SPOILERS) so take that as you will.\\n\r\nKazoumi, Sis, Ohsugi, Kasuga and Katsuhara form a group that, well, I don't particularly understand there purpose. They're goal is to help the thousands of NEET's (people not in education, employment or training) that rose out of the aftermath of the missile strike (this is the only spoiler, it's in the bio, and it's needed for context), but other than that I don't see any purpose. Kazoumi is the straight-talking thinker of the group, Sis I actually thought was the mother of either Kazoumi, Kasuga or Katsuhara (as the former two look in their twenties, and Katsuhara looks between 12 and 15) but she's just another part of the group, Ohsugi is litreally just there to be jealous of Takizawa and Saki (oh, and Saki is with his group as well, again this isn't explained), Kasuga is the comic relief character and Katsuhara is the cute one, but also, how did my friend describe his sister... The typical mardy teen? Because that's how I'd likely describe Katsuhara as well. Oh, and she's a tech wizard. Basically the fan favourite because a) she's a loli and b) she's a computer geek.\\n\r\nRight, to quickly rattle off the rest - Shiratori is also in possession of a phone that can grant her any wish, same restrictions as those placed on Takizawa apply, and is there just for conflict. It's implied she was abused in the past as her \"trait\" is chopping off rapists and murderers \"johnnys\". I'm sure all the males, and a lot of you females, know what a \"johnny\" is. Moving swiftly on...\\n\r\nMononobe is revealed in essentially the penultimate episode, don't really see his point, he just wants Takizawa's phone so he can have more money, and therefore more power. Kondo is a detective and has exactly the same motive as Mononobe and then there's \"Panties\", so called because he lost his pants at school and ever since being stripped has been a shut-in since. I won't reveal his purpose as it's rather integral to the plot, but he's your typical shut-in. All in all a big cast for such a short show, and most rather likeable. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, should you give 3-4 hours of your life for the show? Had the show been any longer, I would've had to have a long think about it, but for such a short run-time what are you really missing by giving up 3-4 hours? And for as bland and disjointed as the plot and some characters can be, you care for these guys. There's a philosophical message Saki rattles off in epsiode 9 or 10, possibly even the final episode, and while it's the same thing you've heard countless times, (something about how Takizawa isn't evil even though he fired the missiles, this is the only other spoiler don't worry!) it actually really spoke to me about humans and their good nature, at times. So yeah, if there are other shows you think you'd enjoy much more, watch them first, but if this interests you, the characters are interesting enough and the art and sound are great and certainly good enough to fill this bite-sized show. I award a credible 7/10.",

            "content": "I haven't watched the movies yet so this review will solely be about the anime. Higashi no eden has a very interesting plot. Whoever says that this anime is a rip off of Mirai nikki he has just seen only the first three episodes. Those two anime shouldn't even compared. While Higashi is not as mindfuck and violent as mirrai nikki is way smarter. But still even though it had a unique plot it still missed that something that didn't manage to make me love it. Also it leaves a lot of unanswered things so you have to watch the movies to have a completeanswer I guess (I haven't seen them yet as I said before). The animation is amazing especially for a 2009 anime. The OST's were pretty good especially the one in the last episode.  But the song that stood out was the opening with very fluent English lyrics and full of meaning. The ending was catchy with some beautiful visuals. Also the voice acting was pretty good with very good dialogues  The character section was really weird especially the two protagonists Saki and Akira. The anime is centered between those two characters while all the others are staying in the margins of the plot. Those two have an amazing relationship right from the first episode but I didn't like the fact that apart from the protagonists the anime doesn't care a lot for the minor characters with one or two exceptions). Overall I wouldn't say that I loved this anime but I didn't hate it either. It was an interesting story that if the creators tried a little bit more it would have been really interesting.",

            "content": "This show really... gets on my nerve. I had to watch all the way to the last episode (11th) to find out the \"truth\" behind all the mysteries set up across 10 episodes. That is when all my enjoyment vanishes as the \"truth\" is literally \"naked,\" empty, and stupid. This anime is really a lame implementation from the inspiration of the American movie Paycheck (2003).\r\n----------------------------\r\nStory: (SPOILER)\r\nA powerful old guy, called Ato Saizou or \"Outside\" (this is a Japanese pun), after being diagnosed with terminal cancer set up a big game by selecting 12 youngsters, giving each 10 billion yen, and a \"magic\" cellphone to savethe country (Japan) in their own way. The 12 players are called Selecao - the country's Saviors. The 12th player is appointed as a Supporter, who supervises the other 11 and is obliged to kill them in case one of the four conditions is met.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist, called Takizama, is the Selecao No. 9 who erased his own memory (in a mysterious way, supposedly thanks to the magic cellphone) before the time the anime starts. He appeared in front of White House, naked, and met a Japanese girl called Saki. They managed to get back to Japan with help of the magic cellphone by calling an omnipotent female concierge called Jitz, which is in fact a super computer concealed in a secret facility. \\n\\n\r\nTakizama with help of Saki and her companions begins to collect pieces of memories by returning to his home and seeking for other Selecao to ask them questions. He was supposed to be involved in an event called Careless Monday - when Japan was assaulted with missiles but had no causalities - and the disappearances of 20,000 NEETs (no education, employment & training). Everything comes to a showdown at the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"truth\" is: There were one self-claimed Selecao No. 1 who wanted to take the helm of the game maker Outside and win the game. One of his two allies - No. 10 Yuki - was the one behind Careless Monday. He wanted to launch missiles to kill all NEETs who were supposed to be a drag to the country's economy. However Takizama saved all those NEETs by... playing antagonist to gather them all in one place, naked, to CROWD-SOURCE a way to prevent the missile impact. However, immediately after that, he was bashed by the NEETs themselves because their action to resist the missiles made them lose everything... As a result, Takizama... sent them all to Dubai (!) and erased his memory of being \"betrayed\" by those NEETs. When he had partly recovered his memory, listened to the second missile plan from No. 10 and his gang, he once again gathered the NEETs to prevent it.\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nThe four stupidities in the Story:\\n\r\n1-MEMORY LOSS SHIT: Takizama had to play antagonist (so that he is later on bashed) to gather all NEETs in one place (this is considered to be an act to prove to No. 10 that these NEETs ain't useless beings at all) even though there's just no need to act like that. As a result of his being bashed by the NEETs later on, he was so sad, or disappointed, or having some fuked up feeling, that he had to erase his memory.. (this line of reasoning was explained by the female protagonist in around 2-minute span. Replay that whole episode several times but that's all she gave for the reason of Takizama's memory loss... bullshit, isn't it)\\n\\n\r\n2-CROWD-SOURCING SHIT: The only thing he did when all NEETs were summoned was to say out loud \"I want you guys to post the best way to bring the missile down directly on the [Eden] website.\" What comes right after is that a range of anti-ballistic missiles launchers appear and shoot down No. 10's missiles AND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE THANKS TO THE NEETS' PROPOSALS JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE MISSILE LAUNCHING!?!? \\n\\n\r\n3-PLANNING SHIT: Takizama has lost all his memory but still manages to prevent the second missile assault because... he was told by the one who launches the missiles himself!!! No. 1 took him to meet No. 10 and told him about the plan, knowing the Takizama had opposed them once before. They told him about the plan without a slightest intention to drag him to their side.. they just told him so that he could ruin their plan the second time... At the end when all the missiles were shot down, these stupid planners appeared, signed, said some nonsense, then disappeared...\\n\\n\r\n4-ENDING SHIT: Well, the three SHITS above make the WHOLE ending. After the last missile is shot down, Takizama made the last request to Jitz that he wants to become the \"King\" this time rather than pretend to be antagonist like last time... Then the anime concludes... THIS IS UTTER STUPID-NESS!\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\r\nOk, I admit I did enjoy this anime for the first episodes since it is, as well said, a good experimental anime for this kind of memory loss mystery. It also has nice art, nice sound, nice flow, no more no less. I'm looking for their future production but I can't bring myself to watch this SHIT again! If you like it? Fine. But if you LOVE it? You are truly stupider than a NEET.",

            "content": "Higashi no Eden(Eden of the East) it a magnificent foray into a world of enigmatic intrigue the likes of which I can't remember seeing since Serial Experiments Lain.  The opening sequence itself opens the way for questions and the thirst for information right off the bat, reminding me of the opening from Neon Genesis Evangelion.\r\nThroughout the series you are basically confronted with confusing information left and right, leaving you to glean what you can from what is given.  Afterwards you are left pondering this information as you watch, actively trying to decipher it for yourself.  Though there is a need for abit of practical sleuthism on your part.  If you don't read the entries in the cellular phones, you will still be stuck scratching your head after the \"end\".\\n\\n\r\nEven with this, you are never left bored.  There is always more information forthcoming, or just a simple curveball that leaves you wondering.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected with Production I.G. at the helm, the visuals are beautiful.  The imagery alone makes this series worth picking up.  And Kenji Kawaii(Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Death Note, Fate/stay night, GitS, etc) has once again put together a great score that flows perfectly with the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I would rate this series very highly, especially when compared to the rather low quality of this season.  A definate gem, and a must-see for anyone who doesn't require non-stop action(simply for the sake of having it), or gratuitous fanservice.  If you enjoyed the mysterious segment of series such as Lain, Evangelion, .hack//Sign, etc this is a must see.",

            "content": "WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nWhat do we need to for ruling this world?\r\nAn army? A high education or maybe have a royal background? No... it is all wrong. What we really need is a cash and the tool which will help us with distribution of it...\r\nBut is the 10 billions yen enought to do so? Higashi no Eden is trying to ask this question during the 11 episodes. The new meaning of \"noblesse oblige\" was just born. But is there any of those random \"noblesse\" feel the responsibility of \"obelige\"? \r\n=Storyline= \r\n\t12 totally diffrent people... 12 saviours-to-be... one supporter, one winner... sounds a like some kind ofreality show. In fact it is pretty similar to those shows... but instead of cameras and microphones we have mobiles containing some letters and cyphers... and cyphers hardly ever lies...\\n\r\nSo if we compare high amount of money that belongs to the people that are just not the saint ones... yeah it equals a brutal and viloent massacre, the rat race and fast action included :D And what we have in the Higashi no Eden? The beginning of anime- totally rocks and makes watcher just curious how the story of a naked young man from Washington DC will end... Police, collection of passports, full armed closet... yeah it is fascinating and Bond-films like! But it is only a beginning and it can fool us... In fact this anime serves us a 11th episodes of cautionous stalking and then in last two episodes suddenly everything comes to the sunlight!\\n\r\nWell we can weight it down on the main character amnesia, but... generally whole series looks rather like a long prologue than a first season of anime. So the ones who like fast action, car chases, intense firing, can be disappointed... But before those will skip this anime... look around! Today the most powerful force is information and the most powerful weapon is the information plus the tool to share it with someone... And that very essence is shown in Higashi no Eden!\\n\r\nAnother think that I just must mention is the other subplots, like love plot in Higashi no Eden... Again, 11 episodes is not enough to even highlight it on account of that the main plot had a problems to fully spread... So I didn't saw the movies connected with Higashi no Eden yet and I don't know what is shown there, but... I guess that Saki need to be patient if she want to get closer to her prince ;)\\n\r\nSo, for me the first season is too short, the action is like a snail, but that doesn\u2019t mean this anime is not good. On the contrary, the unanswered question is making us more and more curious\u2026 Who is supporter? Who is Johnny? Is the rapists \u201cinterests\u201d safe? Is anyone can be a prince or king of county this days? ;) \\n\\n\r\n=Climate&World=\\n\\n\r\n\tThe greatest advantage of Higashi no Eden is it\u2019s climate. The big conspiracy, corrupted people, intimidated society, terrorist attacks\u2026 Sounds familiar? :) Yes, it is the very same world we are living in now! \\n\r\nAs they saying \u2018the devil is in the details\u2019 and you know what? I just love this \u2018devil\u2019 ^^ Because the details can make the even anime world more realistic. Prove? Look at the first episode closely\u2026\\n\r\nThe Washington DC is so\u2026 American! The voices of people, the streets and and and (my favorite \u2018devil\u2019 :D) the military like shoes that Takizawa found in his apartment\u2026 Yeah, those are U.S. Army model called \u201cPanama\u201d that were used in Vietnam War\u2026 Yes\u2026 just a little detail but look how thrilling it is for such realistic freak like me XD \\n\r\nNot to mention the refers to the real films like \u201cThe Bourne Trilogy\u201d or \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d  and many, many others. \\n\r\nBut fear not Japanese Fans! After first ep. we are going to our beloved world of subways, huge highways, big corporations and workaholics ^^ And the motive with abandoned shopping center\u2026 just epic!\\n\r\n\tBut what really impressed me in Higashi no Eden\u2019s climate is the case of NEET\u2019s\u2026 This is the first time I met such a term and I thought it was created for anime ^^ (how foolish I were! XD) So I searched internet a little and\u2026 NEET\u2019s are no longer the guy, who cannot fit to the modern society\u2026 Today they are generating a huge financial problem for all governments around the world! So\u2026 the NEET\u2019s can become an dangerous weapon in bad hands\u2026 plus they are well-trained in the art of Information Technology\u2026 they can even stop the missile attack ^_- And if such a website like Higashi no Eden would really exist (well\u2026 actually we have facebook\u2026XD) I would feel uncomfortable\u2026 I could be only hoping that my pic wouldn\u2019t became a \u201cwanted one\u201d like Takizawa\u2019s :P\\n\r\n\tOh! I almost forgot the main feature! The cell phones\u2026 I guess most, if not all of us, who\u2019ve seen this anime, would like to be owner of SELECAO mobile\u2026 and I\u2019m not talking about those money on account (but it would be a pleasure too ^^) but the awareness of having such a cool stuff\u2026 \\n\r\nSo magnetic and scary appearance of those phones was perfectly shown in the scene in which out weird SELECAO member that loves cigars (and something else :P), was floating with a pair of the black wings and instead of the sword or other stuff which perfectly fits such apocalyptic-like situations\u2026 she is holding this thrilling phone\u2026\\n\\n\r\n=Characters=\\n\\n\r\nAkira Takizawa\\n\r\nA couple of words about characters\u2026 let\u2019s start from Akira! Yeah, he is a smart and cheerful guy with eternal carefree attitude. He is so exudes with charisma, that people on the streets are even giving him their own garment instead of escaping from the young exhibitionist :P But on the other side of the coin we have a guy with huge sense of altruism, who suffers from what all such good person suffer in our sad world\u2026 He was betrayed by the those who he helped :/ But he was so intelligent to that he choose to erase his memory rather than spectacularly finishing life :) In emo-times committing suicide is very trendy XD \\n\r\nSomeone can say he is a trifler too much but\u2026 for me he is a good actor. Even when in pain, he can smile and keep going\u2026 even when broken, he can stand up again and help others once again... Plus he is a gentleman and have a good manners\u2026 perfect material for husband and Saki knows this ;D So in one sentence: He is very motivating one!   \\n\\n\r\nSaki Morimi\\n\\n\r\n\tA shy but simultaneously brave girl, who thinks that White House is a center of the world XD Why brave (not to say stupid :P)? Which girl would have a nerve to throw a coin to the garden of the most secured house on the Earth and go alone with a guy, who was chased by police and going all naked? :) Any volunteer there? :P\\n\r\nMorimi might look like a typical girl, but actually she is a strong woman. Loosing her parents, living on a credit of her sister and trying to do an emancipation, she dream to breakaway from the world that surround her. She is a romantic one, dreaming about the prince\u2026 And who can give her all that? A prince himself! She believes in uncreated story of Akira and help him instead of people who are full of suspicions about him\u2026 I don\u2019t know maybe she is naive or\u2026 maybe she\u2019s pure heart is whispering to her to trust Takizawa? But before answering that questions in ourselves just look at the power of the real \u201ctrust\u201d \u2026 look that this \u201ctrust\u201d can make others to stand up again and fight\u2026\\n\r\nIn one sentence: a pure loving-girl!\\n\\n\r\nOthers\\n\\n\r\n\tWell generally there wasn\u2019t time to get to know other characters properly. The corrupted detective is dieing too fast and I regret it \u2018cause he could be a nice rival for our courageous Akira. Other SELECAO are not better. The cigar-perv woman is the plot which would be (I hope) solved in the future, missile-guy is just a puppet\u2026 a doctor with a vision, also killed\u2026 but wait\u2026 there is those two\u2026 The clever government bureaucrat who almost crack the nut of all game\u2026 yeah this plot and his story should be spreaded more! Merciless, concrete perfectionist. A rising main bad character ;)\\n\r\nAnd the last of SELECAO\u2026 the guy who didn\u2019t even spend a single yen from his account, but using limousine for transportation\u2026 yeah very suspicious.\\n\r\n\tInstead of SELECAO we have other typical, boring family members, typical jealous-boy and (not that typical XD) friends of Saki. So, old and experienced woman (:P), a leader without leadership skills and a closet guy :) Add to this a cute nerdy Micchon (\u201cI\u2019m not Micchon..\u201d :D) and the panties-named genius and you have a full kaleidoscope of personalities! I like Especially Itazu\u2026 the perfect example of a underestimated talent, who is sacrificing his health for the mental causes\u2026 And of course there is a 20 000 NEET statists with cellphones without wears XD Yeah they are like zombies ;) \\n\r\n\tGenerally those characters have (or had :P) potential, and I hope their plots will be spreaded in the future too!\\n\\n\r\n=Summary=\\n\\n\r\nGreat drawn anime with also great potential which will be fully used in the future\u2026 Worth of attention and gives us a lot to think after seeing the last episode\u2026 thinking about this damn society system in which many talents are wasting , thinking about how single pure heart can affect a broken man and thinking what people are able to make when they are driven to the wall\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nSorry for any grammar mistakes and so on, and so on...\\n\\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my lovely kitty, who is my anime guru >^_^< nyan nyan!",

However, it's way too early for judgement. But from what I saw, this is one of the 2 animes this Fall 2009 season that I'm looking forward to every week.\r\nWhat really absorbed me to this anime is the OP. This is the best OP for this season bar none. I can't really explain but it has a very very post-modern feel in it. Did I mention that the OP was from Oasis called \"Falling Down\".  TheED is no pushover either, it's also unique and is the best ED for the season.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East has a very shounen-esque feel but I believe from the first episode that the anime will be told in the perspective of the lead female character so it will probably appeal more to the female half of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nAgain.

The first few episodes provide an extremely good platform to flesh out the details. However, the core, the performance as it is suffers nothing short of a catastrophic collapse.

Sakialways seemed that she is that female monkey that helps the main character in the movie The Planet of the apes.Indeed the bodies of the characters looked pretty life-like but their faces...plain creepy.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound : 10-\\n\r\nThe sound was incredible,the voices were always great and they felt realistic for the most part.You could really see the emotions in their voice and both the intro and outro songs seemed great to me.\\n\\n\r\n-Character : 9-\\n\r\nThe characters were all well-defined, their behavior was normal and there were no moments in which a character develops illogically fast ,a problem that's pretty normal for anime(We're looking at you Bleach).\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment : 8-\\n\r\nI can't say it really glued me to the screen but it kept me interested until the end so I'd say I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall : 8-\\n\r\nIt's definitely a good anime and it's definitely a must-watch especially if you like mystery/survival game types.",

            "content": "I've seen plenty of survival game anime and watching another one didn't really impress me, but somehow, Higashi no eden had a different feeling. The whole kill or be killed thing wasn't the main ideea of the series. It was something much deeper: the feeling you have power but don't use it for yourself, on the contrary, to help others. That's pretty much why I find this anime quite original in many points of view.\r\nStory: 9\r\nBeginning with the story, like I said it's not a very inspired one. Main character Takizawa Akira finds himself naked in the middle of Washington with no memories where hemeets Morimi Saki, a fourth-year collage girl. In the following episodes they return to Japan, hoping that Akira will get his memory back. However, what comes next is much more complicated as he learns that he is involved in some kind of a game where he has 8 billion yen to \"save Japan\". \\n\\n\r\nThings tend to become hard to follow due to the fact that the most important things are left unsaid until the very last episode. On the other hand, that's one of the good parts of the anime because it makes you want to watch episode after episode. But if it's not \"the game\" the main idea, then what is it? Personally, I think the anime teaches us that good people still exists. The plot is focused on rediscovering Akira's self who chose to have his memory erased not because he had done something bad, but because ha had been hurt by the people he saved. And I'm gonna stop here because I don't want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI found the art very similar to the one in Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Characters have simple features but very distinctive, not many detalis being included. Compared to the characters, the environement looks much better, but still designed in this simple but fine manner.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending are ok. Same for the voice of the characters and the rest. I don't have any negative remarks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nTakizawa Akira is undoubletdly the one who makes the series so great. Like many other main characters he has this tricky appearance, making the impression he always knows what he's doing. He never loses himself no matter the circumstances and always puts others' selves before his own. I always apperciate a good character development and I would have given this section a 10 if it hadn't been for Morimi Saki.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Akira goes through a lot of things (he finds out he saved the world once but took the blame on him for destroying it just to protect the people he cared about and then he erased his memory in order to let go of the pain and start over), Saki does nothing at all. Basically, her contribution to the plot is nearly 0. Oh, yes. They kiss once, but that's everything they have in common. Of course, Akira slowly falls in love with her and so does she but the action is so focused on Akira himself that their relationship becomes insignificant. However, I can't criticize this too much because in the end, the anime is not just a slice of life-romance-drama anime. It is an action-mystery genre, not to mention some peple would find it quite violent. So despite the synopsis, which looks like the beginning of a romance anime, the series is not about that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nWith so many genres gathered in a 11 episode anime and so many confusing things and thoughts, I really enjoyed it. It was both sad and happy, full of action and funny moments, covered in mystery and having all these wrapped with a romance ribbon. So why I rated it 9?\\n\r\nThe end was such a disappointment! The whole atmosphere where Akira saves the world once again is wonderfull indeed but when the last episode ended I was like \"Ok. So?\" I felt like I was looking at a flower ready to blossom but then it wilted. I know the movies are the sequel but seriously, this is not how a series should end, leaving the viewers with an empty feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nDespite the flaws, Higashi no eden is one of the best animes I have watched but I expected more. Akira is an outstanding character but he overshadowes the other ones. The last episode is the key of the anime but the end left me speechless in both a good and a bad way.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I highly recommend it to anyone. There's a little bit of every genre, all gathered in a very harmonious approach.",

            "content": "What would you do with 10 Billion dollars, in order to save your country?\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nHigashi no Eden is a roller coaster ride of suspense and comedy. Set in a world so similar to ours but at the same time, almost fictional. 11 missiles strike Japan, in some of the major cities. The catch is, no one was hurt. This day, Careless Monday, is forgotten by everyone nearly months after. \r\nTheres Saki, a girl caught throwing coins over the gate at the White House, Washington DC. She is rescued by Akira Takizawa, a boy butt naked, with a strange phone with 8,200,000,000 yen in digital cash,a gun, and no memories. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes on a suspenseful whirlwind of events as Akira tries to recover his memories. 11 people are chosen to be the \"Saviors\" of Japan, and given 10 billion yen to do so. They are being dragged into a deadly game, and whoever fails at this game, will be killed. \\n\\n\r\nThe game is being controlled by a mysterious man named Mr. Outside, a woman on the other end of the phone, Juiz, who will comply with any request you have, such as killing people or telling a ambassador to say \"Uncle\". and the Supporter, who is also one of the 11 Sele\u00e7\u00e3o. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is the type where you have to figure some thing outs for yourself. They do not explain everything until almost the final few minutes, and you should be able to figure the mysteries out one at a time. Its very suspenseful and will have you up on the edge of your seat even at the final moments. It does have it's comedy, which takes up a good part of the series, but that does not weaken the suspense of it. There were parts where I thought my heart would burst out of my chest, because it was pounding so hard. Never before have I been sucked into an anime like that before. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is left WIDE open, partially because there are two movies to be aired, leaving you wanting more and stuck with a few unanswered questions. I'm seriously looking forward to those movies, hoping they are twice as good as the TV series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the character designs, being a big fan of Chika Umino and her art style. (She created Honey and Clover.) The character designs were simple, but complex enough to have their own looks. The backgrounds and detail of machinery (Such as the planes, Missiles and the trains) was amazing, and very well done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe background music MADE this show the suspense series it was. Creepy and hear tracing songs brought me to the edge of my seat! The music reminded me of really suspenseful episodes of CSI, NCIS and BONES and having the BGM play with serious explanations, felt like the situation was far worse then I first imagined. The sieyuu chosen to play these parts were PERFECT. They knew how to play serious and comedic roles, like Akira. HE went from happy tone to serious tone in split seconds. Kimura played him perfectly and I cant see anyone playing him better than that. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, Falling Down by Oasis, was one of my favorite songs some time ago. And I was really happy and surprised to hear it as an ANIME opening song. It was perfect for Higashi, the lyrics fit the show so well, it was like it was written JUST for the series. I loved the ending too, School Food Punishment has wonderful songs, and Futuristic Imagination fit perfectly with the feeling of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I highly disliked was the Sound Effects, like foot steps. Every-time they were walking outside, the characters still sounded like they were walking on a wooden floorboard. It annoyed the hell outta me and That is why I gave it a 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only characters you really want to pay attention to are Akira and the other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o. Akira has the most character development, since the entire story line is him recovering his lost memories and finding just who the hell he really is. The other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o play an important part in helping Akira regain his memories and move the story along. Akira provides the series with comedy that lightens it up a bit, then later brings us to the edge of our seats as he learns something new and terrifying about himself. He grows up a little and its not very CLEAR, but he also may have fallen in love too. So many things need to be answered, which brings me back to the movies yet to be released. \\n\\n\r\nI was disappointed with Saki's character. I could see her doing so much MORE in the story line, but all she was good for was giving Akira something else to focus on.. Or that's how it seemed. Her role in the actually story confused me, and I didn't see there to be an actual need for it. Ohsugi provided us with some mystery as he went on to figure things out about Akira that others couldn't, again, bringing in more suspense. As for the other side characters like Onee, Micchon and a few others, I can see them as being important roles, also figuring out things about Akira that he couldn't on his own. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some characters worth not seeing, like Juiz was great when she was kept in the shadows, and Mr. Outside who is NEVER seen. It added mystery to the already mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI freaken loved this series because of how suspenseful it was. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat, and JUST when I thought something would happen it didn't, making my heart jump out of its chest, or I would breathe with a sigh of relief. The music gave me goosebumps for HOURS and I would have weird dreams. This show isn't exactly SCARY just very... Deep and heart racing. I was sucked in from the first episode and I wanted more and more, so I tried to finish it as fast as I could. Now I kind of regret going so FAST because I have to wait forever for the movies, which will clear my millions of questions up. I understood it for the most point, since I'm good at figuring mysteries out and CSI stuff, but the way the story was told left important details out, and they really don't explain what Akira DID in the last 15 seconds of the actual finale. \\n\\n\r\nI'm beginning to wonder if he did what I think we did. If he did... I'll break something. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will NOT regret watching this show one bit.",

            "content": "Eden of the East is my third favourite anime of Spring '09 and is an anime that I would reccomend to everyone (ok, not everyone... shounen-only fans probably won't like this).\r\nStory: The story of Eden of the East is its strongest element. It is unique, exciting,, humorous  mysterious, touching, is a good representation of modern World and its social status and life style and may even make you think about the things it represents. The spotlight is given to Japanese NEET's, their reasons for being NEET's and their place in society.\r\nArt: The art of background is detailed and beautiful. The scenes of surroundings willoften cause a lose of breath.\\n\r\nHowever, the character designs don't look good to me. They often don't fit with the background, many characters are forgettable in looks and emotions they are supposed to show sometimes look weird.\\n\r\nHowever, I saw that many peoplel ike the character designs so I guess that the above comment is just my taste thus I will give it an 8 rather then a 7.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Because of the art style, animation is fluid and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: While I didn't notice the sound most of time, there were some scenes where it improved the current atmosphere thus I gave it a high grade.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While the plot is great, the only truly deep character is Akira (tough even he could have been developed in a better way). Others have very little depth or they didn't get enough spotlight (not surprising since the cast is large and there are only 11 episodes here.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Trying to predict what will happen, trying to understand what is happening, trying to find answers on the questions you got just an episode before and good humour make this an enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: One of the best series in Spring '09 which might have gotten a higher score if it were a bit longer (yes, I know that there will be (or are, depends on when you read the review) movies, but we are speaking about the series here) thus getting time to further develop other characters and make the relationship between Akira and Saki deeper.",

            "content": "One of the more complex series I've seen recently, Eden of the East is definitely a breath of fresh air with all of the cookie-cutter anime that have been released in the past few years. Created by Kenji Kamiyama, people have been fawning over this anime since its release in 2009. But what is it about the series that makes it so unique? Is it the subject matter? Is it the characters? The series definitely has a lot going for it, but there are just a few nagging issues that keep this series from being the best that it can be. \r\nAs a quick aside,yes, I am aware of the two movies, but this is a review of the series independent of said movies.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East definitely has the most unique character introduction I've ever seen. The main character, Akira Takizawa, wakes up in Washington, D.C. in the nude with just a gun and a cell phone charged with 8.2 billion yen. He ends up saving a girl named Saki Moirmi from arrest, and manages to get back into Japan with her. In the interim, the country has fallen victim to a missile attack known as \u201cCareless Monday.\u201d Takizawa wants to find out where he came from, who he was, and why he has been given such financial means. Along those same lines, Takizawa finds out there are others like him, all with their own motivations, and cell phones loaded with cash, with the enigmatic Juiz there to always fulfill a request, no matter how insane it might be. If the person has the money, she'll do it. The web of conspiracy theories slowly reveals itself: who is behind the Careless Monday attacks and why would they want to destroy Japan?\\n\\n\r\nThe stars of the show are definitely Takizawa and Morimi, with the two making for an interesting couple, but it's definitely more of a \u201cprince/damsel in distress\u201d dynamic between them. Jason Liebrecht gives a fairly subdued performance as Takizawa, but it works because his character is always Joe Cool\u2014he doesn't lose his temper, he doesn't make a scene unless he has to, and he's always calculating, looking for the best way to get what he needs. Leah Clark is the precocious Morimi, who is dragged into a situation she didn't ask for, but is drawn to Takizawa and is always looking to help. There is a budding romance between the two of them, but it definitely feels forced in the early parts. Luckily, it shows up intermittently, without being too much of a distraction.\\n\\n\r\nWith an excellent setup and interesting characters, Eden of the East has a lot going for it right off the bat, but the problem is the show's lack of length. Clocking in at only 11 episodes, they try to cram in as much of the story as they possibly can, and for the most part, they're successful. However\u2014similar to Mnemosyne\u2014there just isn't enough time. Unlike Mnemosyne though, the story doesn't take a nosedive in the last half. It just gets a little crazy and requires full attention (and maybe a re-watch) to understand all the big reveals, which I won't spoil here. Also, I have taken issue with the ending, which just wraps everything up too neatly, and it doesn't set up the first movie very well. Also, for a series this short, the pacing could have used some work.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I can say about Eden is that it nails the artistic side of anime. The animations and character modeling are very well-done, at times making you think this is an OVA, and not a television series. As such there is no dip in the quality of animation, as is common in anime as they get closer to the end. The characters also look a little less Japanese than most models I've seen, but I can't shake the feeling that Morimi (and a few other characters) looks like a frog.\\n\\n\r\nA standout area of the animation are the locales, which are lovingly rendered. The opening scenes in Washington are amazing, and the rest of the locales look like you're really there. This is a highly atmospheric anime that does everything possible to draw you into its world. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly forgettable...with the exception of the opening and ending themes. I don't know, maybe it's because you hear them so much, but the ending theme (futuristic imagination by school food punishment) deserves special mention because it has one of the most unique ending sequences I've seen. It was so good that I actually watched the clean ending, something I have never done. It seriously needs to be seen to be believed.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Eden of the East is a great series, but has some hangups that keep it from being all that it can be. With a good but unsatisfying ending, characters that seem to come and go, and a story that borders on convoluted, it balances out the excellent art style and intrigue that pervade the series. Again, Eden of the East is great, but it isn't the transcendental anime that many seem to think it is.",

            "content": "This won't be a long review, just a concise and direct one.\r\nBalance of power. A longstanding issue to humanity since the first civilization was born. In this story, the writer wants to express how humanity can actually very easily be persuaded to change their opinions regarding something just out of convenience and general conditions and situations.\r\nPlot wise, this kind of genre has not been a smooth road for much of series trying to tackle down the problem. However, when we visit Higashi no Eden, we can actually see how the balance of power works in this series.\r\nIt opens up and introduces us to a ratherawkward pairing of Morimi Saki -- a common conformist folk who just happens to be on a college graduation trip -- and Takizawa Akira -- a young man who seemingly has no memories of himself whatsoever and appearing naked, on top of that. This kind of opening rather lightens the atmosphere so as to not being dark and mysterious from the beginning, however, it does not quite convey what the writer wanted to express about the storyline. The first episode, specifically the first half, is almost a make-it-or-break-it point for quite a lot of audiences. In this series, the introduction to the main problem was a bit late, coming near the end of the first half, and being quite vague about it. Fortunately, nearing the end of the first episode, the status quo is revealed more readily to the audiences.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the series, we are going on a trip with Saki and Akira being mainly trying to recover Akira's memories, why he wiped his memories himself, and amidst the calamity due to other Selecaos' activities, happens to be able to save countless civilians. These particular patterns continue until the end of the series where ultimately Akira was able to save the day, again. In our viewpoint, the main plot somehow needs more dynamicity. However, we must also point out that the writer was able to presents a compelling morals, such as how being honest, caring, and helpful is actually one of human's innate traits. And to said that this was executed rather finely and in an efficient and timely manner.\\n\\n\r\nNearing the end, we learn more about the game, its rules, creators, and expected outcomes. Also, we learn how different people with drastically differing view of the government act respectively to their ideals. Also, we learn of the characters involvement or dis-involvement along the way. With the ending states that Akira somehow requested to be the king of the country, it has a caveat that it, in itself, is actually a cliffhanger and does not fully resolve at least the aforementioned main issue in the series. With this, we conclude the review on the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we would like to go over the intra- and inter-characters developments, especially focusing on several implied details. Character wise, Akira is one of the most developed character story, however, only being chronologically developed from now onward, without ample information regarding the backward flow. This may or may not appease the audiences as the story itself starts after Akira wiped his own memories.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have Morimi Saki, somehow being designated as the \"companion\" of Akira, due to the fact that even when she frequently appears, her character wasn't developed as quite even to match Akira's. The variances are becoming more palpable nearing the end of the series where Saki even portrayed as being late with grasping the situations. However, we would like to redirect our attentions to read between the lines. The two characters, Akira and Saki, they clearly exude the atmosphere of liking each other quite deeply, even sharing their (presumably) first kiss. This kind of atmosphere exist whenever they are together, and this actually contributes both to the positive and negative aspect of the ending, which we will discuss shortly.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, other side characters are being developed quite amply, in accordance to their respective capacities. This also applies to other Selecaos development. In fact, they are not under- or over-developed, being in just quite the right amount.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we arrive at our discussion regarding the ending. We clearly see that Akira saves the day once again and requested that he appointed as the king of the country. In our viewpoint, however, this is a cliffhanger as we can't actually know for sure what being a king of the country has afforded Akira. Fortunately, we see that in the end, no character is left behind and each one of them actually contributed to the progress of the story, one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Higashi no Eden is a must to watch, but also be forwarned that it may confuses the audiences at first, and left hanging until finishing all the episodes AND the three movies. The technicality, visual, and audio aspects are all very good and well composed. The soundtracks are a good listening material.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, it remains as a fresh material, able to reinvent itself after several times, and still being relevant to the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nWe hope that you enjoy this review, do share your thoughts, comments, and even ramblings.\\n\r\nBest regards.",

            "content": "After many recommendations and (forceful) encouragements from my friend to watch Higashi no Eden, I finally gave in and decided it was worth watching. At first, like with all anime, I felt that it was too boring and that I should drop it, which is what I ended up doing. after a while I came back to this anime to finish watching and by the 10th episode I was like \"why the f*** did I not watch everything\" but once I finished it I then thought of it with less fondness due to the ending, which I would like for the creator of the animeto expand upon, since I have no intention of watching the two movies. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe first episode was the best starter to any anime I have ever seen which made me want to see more, even though the next episodes made it boring. As I advanced through the episodes I noted that there wasn't much action for the people that like action anime, and that there wasn't enough emotions for those who like meaningful anime with emotions. However, after understanding the problem behind the phones it made me curious how someone could make Japan a perfect country using money. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nThere are those animators that draw fat little people that just make me want to turn off the computer and never turn it on again, and there are those that make every single person look perfect with sharp cheekbones and other features. This anime has it balanced, meaning that the main characters were (of course) close to perfect since we have to see them every episode, while the ordinary person looked like an average person that is just living his life. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 \\n\r\nI'm really picky about sound and I would say that the intro track was nice and made me want to hear it again and again, as opposed to the anime I'm currently watching. I gave it a six because I'm a music freak and fellow musicians might understand my partial disappointment with the songs and melodies chosen for this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 \\n\r\nI seriously didn't get what was up with this guy, he came up with a great idea for an anime, and then he gave it two people without a personality. For example, at the beginning, when Yuki meets Takizawa, she acts like a complete robot, doing everything he asks her to do, and then somehow falls in love with him, even though all evidence is to suggest that he is a terrorist. Takizawa on the other hand would randomly yell out random phrases whenever he was surprised, and when half the country depended on him to do the right thing, he just says, nah, I'll just release these 2,000+ people into the streets of Japan so that they try and find me. and possibly kill me and thousands of innocent citizens. I don't know if that argument sounds rational, but that was my impression of him. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 \\n\r\nEven though I really loved the concept of the story, the anime was still really boring due to the lack of activity, in the first few episodes while the guy is trying to figure things out. Those first few just ruined it all for me. and later, closer to the end, the whole story just ended too suddenly, in only a few episodes the whole conflict was resolved before I could even understand what the conflict was (well, I did understand it enough ATM, I'm not THAT retarded).  \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, if you don't have any anime you really want to watch, or you just want something to pass the time, this is a good anime for that, but if you want to sit down and plow through the episodes, I wouldn't exactly recommend this.\\n",

In an industry that thrives on the same old humor, love stories, and fight scenes it was nice to see something that wasn't exactly like every other anime you've seen. The moment the first episode starts in Washington D.C. you had no idea what was going to happen next. I like that. Eden of the East was adventurous, following an oddly confident man with amnesia. You go along for the ride as he tries to discover his pastand the troubles that he'd gotten himself into. \\n\\n\r\nEden of the East is pleasantly unpredictable. All of the characters are likable and it questions the limits of human kindness. It's just like a Hollywood mystery. And the fact that it's only 11 episodes makes it more like a long movie rather than a show. You'll want to watch the entire thing in one sitting. Buy it, rent it, I don't care. Just so make sure that you see Eden of the East.\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nLet me start off by saying that it's pretty slow, it's not until the last three or so episodes until things begin to take off. Fortunately, this anime can be finished in just a few hours so pace shouldn't be much of an issue. As you read in the synopsis, this show has a pretty unique story line, the build up to the climax of the final episode is indeed a satisfying trip. The story also gives you a feel of \"what would I do in that situation?\" being an anime you actually think about after finishing it. Of course, the story isn't complete withoutseeing the two movies so make sure you watch them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the best thing about this anime. The protagonist, Akira Takizawa has this bold and charismatic feel to him that helps gradually make him your favorite character. This anime also has this whole \"who is the real bad guy\" feel to, making certain characters do something one episode and than something completely opposite the next. As well as, humorous characters who like to take serious things rather lightly. There is also this mystery to one of the characters, not knowing his true motives until the very end. Though there maybe a wide variety of different characters. Takizawa's actions will make you only want to see him,see what he's doing and how his actions will affect the future plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the character art falls short. It's not necessarily that I don't like it, but I feel like they could of made it better. The scenery on the other hand is beautiful, the contrast is prefect and the sunsets almost look real. The voice acting was good, no irritating characters and not much nasal pitched characters, that goes for the dub as well. The sound affects were also a plus. The cars and chatter echoing in the background actually gave it very metropolis type vibe.\\n\\n\r\nLasting Appeal:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show deserves a 9.5. The art falls short but is well compensated by the characters and story. It is a show that will keep you interested with dialogue rather than action, with also a subtle romantic conflict throughout the series. The script is well thought out and keeps the watchers in anticipation. The finale has a nice ring to it as well as a killer performance of Reveal The World by Brenda Vaughn playing in the distance. Higashi No Eden is short, sweet, funny and only inches away from perfection!",

The plot in very mysterious and not that complicated , in a good way. Something i have to say is that you shouldn't watch this anime unless you are at least 13 years old. The story in very creative and not something you would usually think of. The art is really good and so are the graphics. The sound depends on where you watch it is incredible. The characters are very believable which makes you like the animeeven more. I have only watched 9 episodes and all were enjoyable. I would give this anime 10+.

            "content": "\u201cIf you were suddenly given immense power and obligation to change your nation for the better, what would you do?\u201d\r\nEden of the East is primarily a thought provoking, vicarious, full-scale twisted game of right and wrong, society, abuse of power, responsibility and conspiracy. We are made to think of how everything that Eden of the East throws at us is somehow strangely connected; (The mysterious Selecao, the anonymous \u2018Supporter\u2019, Mr. Outside, the missing 20,000 neets, the careless Monday missile attacks, Takizawa\u2019s lost memories) the audience is given substantial information and in our minds to try and solve the furtive puzzles, and in doing so, tryto distinguish how the grand scheme of things will eventually pan out.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost immediately, Eden of the East has a huge initial impact, it drags you in, entices you from the get-go, the sense of ambiguity and enthusiasm to find out who the main characters are, and why they are there; especially the character Takizawa Akira, the fact that he is introduced with no memory of his past, completely unclothed, yes naked! Whilst blatantly waving a gun in one hand and holding a weird-ass phone in the other. To top it off he is also in front of the Whitehouse occupied by security. It just instantly screams out its individuality, quirkiness and a sense of what you\u2019re going to expect. If that somehow does not draw you in, then of-course the hilarity of the other random mishaps that occur, also does. (A casual stranger randomly giving half naked Takizawa his trousers, Takizawa calmly removing his jeans to show a female officer his genitals! xD) That should at least hold your attention in some form and all this is just the first episode!\\n\\n\r\nThis sets us up with a respectable base for the plot; the storyline is absolutely unique, the premise is very intriguing with the sense of unpredictability along the way, as well as the twists and turns that keep you glued to your seat, whilst giving out just enough information each episode for you to take in and ponder, concurrently preventing from donating excessive information that would spoil the mystery of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes onto the next point, pacing. The pacing of episodes seems to vary; with slow paced starts and faster more revealing conclusions to episodes; this gives a great structure to leave the audience wanting more. As well as this the atmosphere continually switches back and forth from serious to nonchalant, keep it both solemn and light-hearted at the same time; this links in with the decent ranging soundtrack it has, which also is able to successfully create a plausible atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a relatively short in length, a credible amount of character development is shown, particularly for the two main characters. (Saki; innocent, likeable and charming and Takizawa; quirky, mischievous and optimistic) They have engaging chemistry together predominantly in the early parts of the anime. We get to know them quite well without ever losing the sense of mystery behind the plot and Takizawa\u2019s past. In connection with this, Takizawa\u2019s fascinating ability to always remember films, although losing his memory xD, was a particular aspect of his character I really liked; this ties in with the regular references linking to films (To name a few; Taxi Driver, Bourne Trilogy, Dawn of the Dead, Kate and Leopold etc etc). In some ways Eden of the East starts off similar to \u2018The Bourne Identity\u2019, which is a film cleverly, referenced during the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect I truly adored was the fluid animation; what we get is the vibrant colour schemes, convincing detailed scenery of each location and occasional CG, overall giving it high quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough with its vast amount of positives, there are little things I disliked. Though I think development for its two main characters is sufficient enough; I would like to have known more about its supporting characters. I think the length of the series undeniably had a part to play in this. In addition to this field, the uselessness of Saki in relation to the actual plot really bothered me also. (I also hated Ohsugi xP) \\n\\n\r\nIn many ways I think it had unleashed potential. It could have been better than it actually was, as it should of expanded on the endless ideas and inklings the initial plot might of had; perhaps better direction could of made it into a more enhanced thriller or whether the length of the series had a hand in this? I\u2019m just hoping the movie sequels will have a superior explanation of the unanswered questions and how it left off.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it unquestionably feels like the ending is slightly abrupt and unfulfilling, the pros certainly out-weigh the cons with the actual outline of the storyline making the overall difference as it causes the audience to contemplate the situations, choices and responsibility of the characters, and coherently places yourselves in their position. Its quite good-quality entertainment anime with boundless possibilities of the budding plot make it a highly recommendable series to watch.\\n",

            "content": "\"If you won't save me, please don't waste my time.\"\r\n--Oasis - Falling Down (OP for Eden of the East)\r\nMost of the discussion of Eden of the East (Higashi no Eden) focuses on it as an atypical mystery/romance with likable and interesting characters which is nevertheless brought down by its comparatively weak plot that never really delivers on the suspense it builds up. I agree with this assessment, but that isn't what got my attention when I watched this series. In Eden of the East, I saw a surprisingly eloquent show about millennials (Generation Y) and how we try to find our places in this world.I'm going to focus on this aspect of Eden of the East in this spoiler-free review.\\n\\n\r\nMany of both the protagonists and antagonists portrayed in Eden of the East find themselves somewhat lost in a world that doesn't quite seem like it was made for them. Saki's lack of direction in her life prevents her from getting a job after graduating from university. Her friends' attempt to build a startup, but it suffers from a lack of funding and interest. Ohsugi is the only young character shown to have gainful employment, and he feels out of place at his job. A sizable amount of characters proudly self-identify as NEETs (not in education, employment, or training) and don't consider themselves to be a part of society. Even some of the antagonists use their isolation from society as a justification for violent actions. Conversely, characters over thirty seem more a part of their society, but believe it can be changed and improved. However, these older characters don't consider those younger than them in their plans to reform Japan into something greater, once again, making the younger characters feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East feels very much written not merely for millennial anime viewers (I'm going to avoid the term otaku due to its negative connotations in Japanese), but feels like it was written about them! Many characters use the internet extensively, and imageboards in particular play a role in the plot. Memes form a major part of how information is transmitted and older characters ignore or do not understand these memes. The terrorist attack, Careless Monday, is focused on much less than people's reaction to it, a possible reference to the generation shaping (in the United States, at least) terrorist attack, 09/11. Both of these events passed by very quickly, but discussion of them never stopped. Finally, the characters in Eden of the East feel like cooler version of millennials. The young people portrayed in the show come off as stylish and thrive off making pop culture references. Even the geekiness of the characters only seems to boost their charm, especially shown by a hikkikomori who uses his computer skills and internet savvy in a badass fashion. It was unusually easy for me to put myself in the place of the protagonists, greatly increasing the immersion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East itself feels like a show built around the exclusion of young people from society and the passive protest many of us do as a result. The characters don't start massive street protests or foment violent revolution like The Sect from Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, but that merely highlights differences between millennials and baby boomers (Jin-Roh is probably set in the late 1960s or early 1970s). Instead, the characters either passively sit on the sides of society, refusing to participate or they commit terrorist acts alone with little outside support. I think it's quite telling that the older Selecao focus on making society more orderly while younger Selecao focus on making it more chaotic, reflecting differences between our generation and that of our parents. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I end this review, I should also briefly discuss other good things about Eden of the East. Its early episodes create a very interesting world that I felt very drawn into. Its romance aspects are surprisingly well done, especially since I tend not to like how anime handles them. I liked how the romance focused on a young woman not quite sure of herself rather than the cliched anime example of a young man not quite sure of himself. Even though in real life, I'm a straight guy, I could easily see why Saki likes Akira and I found him to be a very compelling character. Eden of the East also did a good job of creating interesting antagonists with striking motives for their actions. Lastly, the English dub of the series is very well done and does a good job of making the social criticism discussed earlier feel very relevant to a Western audience. There's quite a bit to like in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Eden of the East is that, like others before me have said, it never quite delivers on its promises. I got a strong sense that the characters were all dissatisfied with the current state of Japanese society, but these same characters don't have any good way to change it (a common criticism of millennials!) I would say Eden of the East is character driven, rather than plot driven, but the characters really don't change much throughout the series. Even the movies, which progress at a much faster pace don't seem to change the characters a lot. I agree with other reviewers here on MAL that nothing feels like it changes over the course of the story. Throughout the show, I had this sense that the creators were trying very hard to say something, but they couldn't quite get it out. While I suppose this prevents the show from coming off as preachy, it also leaves it feeling imcomplete and empty. I wrote this review to avoid plot spoilers, but I wonder if knowing the entire plot changes anything about one's enjoyment of the show. \\n\\n\r\nDespite an unusual narrative focus and notable imperfections, Eden of the East has spawned imitators. Durarara!! adopts protagonists who are stylish young men and women that clearly watched more than a few anime series in their day. Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) builds a life and death plot around super powered cell phones held by people with wildly differing views of themselves and the world around them. Zankyou no Terror uses terrorist acts as a way to highlight problems in society. Each of these shows takes a different direction than Eden of the East and they do it with different degrees of success, but if you liked one of these three shows, consider watching Eden of the East and see what you think of the similarities.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Eden of the East isn't far off from being a masterpiece, but the parts it is missing take a lot away from its impact. I liked Eden of the East quite a bit, but I like the above discussed social criticism quite a bit more than the plot or characters, leaving the show feeling a little gimmicky. If you found the first two-thirds of this review very compelling, I think you would enjoy Eden of the East for its commentary on postmodern society. Also, consider watching this show if you liked any of the above mentioned anime that adapted ideas from it: Durarara!!, Mirai Nikki, or Zankyou no Terror. I guess the last thing I want so say here is that before I watched Eden of the East, I felt that there are no works of fiction that adequately describe the lost feeling so many people around me have. Unfortunately, after watching Eden of the East, I still feel the same way. Thanks for reading and I hope you liked my review!\\n\\n\r\nAddendum: I think it's worth noting that I was born in 1991, so I am part of the millennial generation portrayed in Eden of the East. Lastly, as long as this review is, I feel like I missed some major things like the references to Shakespeare, vaguely relevant lines from Christian spirituals, the messianic aspects of Akira, and the color schemes used. I wasn't quite sure how to include them so I didn't discuss them at all. Some time in the future, I may delve into these a little. I get a bit too wordy with these things. :)",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nHere's something to ponder for a couple moments. Anime is partly loved so greatly from me because just how different it feels from other mediums. Anime has a unique feel to it, from the tsunderes, to the nonsensical shounen power ups, to the fact that everything must always revolve around a highschool. You find stories you couldn't anywhere else, for example, I firmly believe that anime like Gurren Lagann, Bakemonogatari or even Clannad just wouldn't work if they weren't anime, the overall zaniness, insanity, cliches, and weirdness of the medium allow certain things to work where in other forms of entertainmentthey would just be viewed as... well just freakin' weird. And don't get me wrong, anime is freakin' weird, but sometimes when there is so much of this weirdness, it starts to lose the appeal, and almost feel repetitive.  When I start to feel this way, I can turn to one of three things. Firstly, I could just stop watching anime for a bit and watch American television. That's never going to happen though, so secondly, I could turn to anime's downright deranged side and see how much weirdness I can take. Or lastly, if I don't want to be scarred by what I might see, I could turn to anime like the topic of this review: Eden of the East, an anime that tackles a kind of story that anime usually just doesn't go for. If anything, Eden of the East feels like something that would be produced over here in the West, but through a great premise, a good taste for music and a fantastic first few episodes, Eden of the East pulls it off. Well, almost pulls it off. \\n\\n\r\nSo, before plot and characters and all that, let's talk about the show's background shall we? The original creator of Eden of the East and the director of its anime adaptation is Kenji Kawayami, and he hasn't been around the industry that much, but his most notable accomplishment is handling the script and directing Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. The script for Eden of the East was actually written by three people, which is a little odd, the first and most prominent being Dai Sato, who was the head writer of both Eureka Seven and Ergo Proxy, as well as writing the script for Wolf's Rain. The second writer was Shoutarou Suga, writer of Isshuukan Friends(which admittedly I haven't seen but looks really good), and the third Naohiro Fukushima, who... um... wrote the ninth episode of Eureka Seven AO, and pretty much that. Which isn't encouraging. Animation is by the highly prestigious Production I.G, who have created some of the best looking anime of all time, for example, Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex and Guilty Crown. More recently though, they've been up to things such as Psycho-Pass, Haikyuu, and of course, co-producing with Studio Wit on a little known anime that goes by the name of Attack on Titan. And lastly, Eden of the East aired from April 10th to June 19th in 2009, and is only 11 episodes. Now, onto the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIn November of 2010,  an unheard of act of terrorism was committed in Japan. Ten missiles were launched from an unknown source and with no time to react to them, land squarely in the middle of Japan's largest cities. But shockingly, a miracle occurs, and though all ten missiles find their targets, somehow not a single person is harmed. With this amazingly low number of casualties, Japan moves on practically forgetting the incident entirely, which has come to be known as \"Careless Monday\". A few months later after this fateful event, we meet our main character: a young woman named Saki Morimi, who is amazingly not in fact a highschool student, but a senior at university, on a graduation trip with a group of friends in Washington D.C. However, as she stands in front of The White House(and throws something onto the front yard), things become very bizarre, as after she is questioned for throwing said thing over said fence, she is saved by a charming man named Akira Takizawa. The thing is, he is stark naked, holding a gun in one hand, and a cellphone in the other. After Akira takes off suddenly, Saki follows him to the airport, and learns a few things. Firstly, that cellphone has about 8 billion dollars on it, just sitting there, and another thing, Akira doesn't appear to remember anything about who he is or how he ended up outside The White House in the first place. Also, after using that cellphone to speak with a mysterious woman named Juiz, Akira learns that he is one of 12 \"Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\" and begins to realize that he might be more involved with the events of Careless Monday than he could possibly imagine, and that the money that is currently sitting in his phone is only one step in an elaborate plot that must be completed by all 12 Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, a plot that will ensnare all of Japan, either \"saving\" it, or destroying it. And then, with these great plot-points and ideas, Eden of the East proceeds to commit a cardinal sin of the mystery show that it is, and plays it safe.\\n\\n\r\n     OK, so this is a little complicated, so stay with me a minute. First of all, I don't want to give away too much about the story. The reason why the first few episodes of Eden of the East work so well is that the questions it presents are very interesting, and the anime doesn't give you too much information too fast. It's only till about episode 4 that you actually start getting the full view of the plot, and since I consider the actual main idea of Eden of the East's plot to be actually really, really, good, this is easily the best part of the series. But here's the two big problems that kill this idea as quickly as it is raised. The first problem is what I've already stated, the series plays it safe(I'll explain what I mean), and maybe this would be tolerable in the series, since tons of anime start to fall on typical tropes and cliches as they go on, but there is one particular reason why it doesn't work here. The actual plot of Eden of the East is one of the most ambitious I've seen in anime for a long time. Once the main idea falls into view, you start to realize that it opens the possibility for a lot of other cool ideas, a huge amount of brilliant scenarios, as well as the ability for the show to dip into as many themes as it could possibly want, but it just doesn't. Here's what I mean by playing it safe. I'll keep the exact reason they have this money or who gave it to them vague, but all Sele\u00e7\u00e3o have this massive amount of money, and slightly different views of what completing their biggest mission actually looks like. This would, you'd think, set the stage for a set of very interesting battles between Sele\u00e7\u00e3o with clashing ideologies, both in themes, as both sides are presented and you work that brain of yours, and action-wise, as two people with an ungodly amount of money and power take their battle throughout all of Japan. However, this never really happens, besides a distinct point in the series when Akira is battling Sele\u00e7\u00e3o XI, as they both manipulate traffic to stop one another from reaching their destination, and yeah, that was pretty awesome, I just wish it had happened more than a grand total of once in the show. Sure, Akira does go toe-to-toe with a couple more Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in the show, but it's never within the complicity that the show is capable of, which really just baffles me. They obviously know just how far they can go with this idea, again, another reason why the beginning of the show works so well is that the other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are faceless entities that could be doing who knows what, maybe manipulating the world's economy or something, but the people we actually do get to meet are painfully boring in their objectives. And when they are trying to do something interesting, namely the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o at the very end of the show, it doesn't really make a lot of sense from a logical standpoint as their motivations are never really explained. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, most of these issues most likely stem from the show's second big problem, is it soooo rushed. Eden of the East is a mere 11 episodes, and all the problems that come with that materialize here beautifully. Again, the plot is extremely large-scale, and since we still need to fit in our ending, and still have that four-episode introduction which was is so vital to both atmosphere and intrigue, that leaves about four or five episodes. Five episodes to.... establish the other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o and their motivations, build up and develop our two main characters, explain Akira's amnesia and how it relates to Careless Monday, explain Careless Monday, and introduce all of the supporting characters, such as the other members of Saki's small business: \"Eden of the East\", and why is that business important enough to be the show's namesake? Well, it needs to explain that too. So, you know, all things considered, the anime could have handled things a lot worse than it did. This thing could have easily been 26 episodes, but amazingly, the show crams basically the structure of everything it needs to into the anime, but that's the thing, everything is crammed in, so there is no space left for elaboration or even context of certain things. You know, maybe rushed isn't quite the right word. I found the show's pacing to be fairly nice, it's more like the show decided to not try and stuff all of the story into the show and more focus on vast amount of things it needed to handle already.This might be more of the reason why vast portions of the story are left unexplored, and yes, I do know that there are two follow-up movies to Eden of the East that supposedly explain the rest of the plot, but since they are both supposedly really bad, I haven't got around to watching hem yet, and besides, this is a review of the series exclusively. \\n\\n\r\nBefore we move onto characters, I want to explain my mixed feeling on the ending of the anime really fast. There's a lot of things to like about the last few episodes. Several interesting revelations are unraveled, and the urgent tone starts to break into the series. However, the last episode of Eden of the East is always a weird one for me. The episode itself is perfectly fine, but then a certain thing happens. I won't say what, but let's just say it is something completely out of nowhere and silly that really made me wonder whether I was supposed to be taking this seriously. The anime didn't appear to have an answer, and then proceeded to confuse me even more by having the very last scene of the anime be kind of amazing. Seriously, when that jazz starts playing it's like...\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the characters of Eden of the East is no matter how likable or interesting some of them may be, the sheer number of them prevents us from getting to know, well any of them. All we get is the fast version, and in some cases that is enough, but for our two main characters, it just doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nI'll guess I'll start with our \"main heroine\" Saki, but why do I put heroine in massive quotation marks? Well, as I thought more about her and rewatched certain parts of the anime for the purposes of this review, I began wonder whether she actually needed to be here at all. Saki is a normal woman put into this strange situation, but while superior anime might have these changes develop the average joe into something awesome, whether it be time constraints or that maybe Kenji Kawayami simply never had any aspirations for her character, Saki remains bland as they come for the entire series. She doesn't even really initiate anything within the plot, often only ending up in the middle of things because of dumb luck or sheer luck. In other words, the reason she's involved with this story is because the plot calls for it, and you know, if you're going to go through lengths to keep her in this story, you could try to do something with her. Granted, they do at least try to develop her character by throwing in an unexpected turn in her psyche, but literally the second I considered this new information and realized it might be good character development, they resolve it instantly. Like literally, a second later, and it's never brought up again. Seriously, why even bring it up at all then?\\n\\n\r\nNext is our other main character Akira Takizawa, and I guess he's a little more interesting. He enters the plot the charming and charismatic type, and pretty much exits it that too. He's not quite as bad as Saki I suppose, he at least does have a personality and plot relevance, but he so little developed it's hard to give his character much credit. Oh, yes, he has his mysterious past and all, but it never really goes anywhere in developing him as much as it does forwarding the plot, and when he does break his nice-guy persona and try to act serious, well, good effort but it is really nothing any of you haven't seen before. I like his character, don't get me wrong, but in terms of complexity he is almost as bad as Saki.\\n\\n\r\n And yeah, that's everyone character-wise. No really. Everyone else is either not given the time, the effort, or the light of day to worthy of mention. The rest of Saki's small company doesn't contribute much character wise even if they do have small plot relevance, as they include: Hirasawa: the one who adjusts his glasses, Onee: the big sister, Katsuhara: the annoying kid super-genius, Kasuga: the one nobody cares about, and Osugi: Saki's secondary love interest who doesn't stand a freakin' chance. Even if we turn to the other Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, again, time gets in the way of knowing them better. Hell, half the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o don't even show up in the show, and as I've stated, the ones we do meet don't half much to them. However, I will give special mention to Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Number XI, who gets focus in the middle of the series, and actually makes quite a big impact, getting motivation(hinted or not), a cool personality, and a back-story I want to know more about. Also, this is the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o that Akira battles using traffic, and again, their little mind-game was pretty cool as it lasted.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes turning to animation, I have pretty high standards. I.G, as I've already stated, have made some of the most aesthetically pleasing anime of all time, and are probably the most high quality animation studio out  there besides of course ufotable, and maybe Kyoto Animation. And while their work on Eden of the East isn't anywhere close to being their best, it's much better than most anime out there. It may have something to do with Eden of the East being an original material and thus an untested product with no fan base. If you look at it that way, it begins to make a little more sense why Eden of the East looks so different compared to other I.G anime. First, no, the animation quality is nowhere near bad. If I had to put it on a scale, it would fall somewhere slightly above average. The show always has these amazing backgrounds. Eden of the East very much goes for more the realism of the animation spectrum, the character designs are usually never really too exaggerated, Saki's design being a prime example of this, she actually looks a real person. I also think this realistic style helps in the aspect that I mentioned at the beginning of this review, how Eden of the East goes for a story that most anime wouldn't, so departing from the style of most anime seems appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I noticed about Eden of the East's OST is how relaxed it is. It seems kind of odd at first that most of the first few tracks are almost elevator music, but hey they work as background music just fine. Another thing I need to give credit for is how ranged the music actually is, and the number of instruments being used. Such songs like \"Juiz\" and \"The Game\" are so far cries from one another. This is to be expected though, as the soundtrack was produced by the  Kenji Kawai, the  Higurashi no naku koro ni OST, as he also composed the soundtrack for that anime. A pretty awesome soundtrack at that. Eden of the East might not be quite as good as that, but there is plenty to like. Namely, the OP: \"Falling Down\" by the American band Oasis is the best song of the anime, soothing and classy at once, with fantastic use of colors and multiple animation styles being used as the same time. The ED: \"Futuristic Imagination\" by School Food Punishment. is only notable because it has a kick-ass drum, and also the animation style used for it is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. The last song I want to highlight is the song \"Reveal the World\", a jazzy song that plays during the last scene of the anime, and is partly why I love that scene so much. It's just... strangely fitting, for both the show, as well as the part it was played, and I just love it when a song can do that. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is Eden of the East worth watching? Yes.  For all the shortcoming in the characters, and the untapped potential of the plot, it can't be denied that Eden of the East is a very intriguing anime. It might be mostly because of the strong start, but there was never one time I wanted to stop watching and not learn what would happen next, even as I checked off boxes on my clipboard of cynicism.  And as much as I complained about the characters, it's not that I don't like them as much as I just recognize they aren't that good as characters, which bring us back to the old Complexity vs. Likability argument. So here's my big statement for the show, which will hopefully convince you to watch it despite all these problems I've listed. It's not so much that Eden of the East is a bad anime, as much as it could have been so much better. There are worse problems to have. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I'm sorry, but no illusion is that elaborate. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "I feel like this is a weird case where I didn't think this anime was all that complete but I still really enjoyed it? Or, not enjoyed it exactly, but I was intrigued. \r\nThe story itself was a little bonkers. I got the basic idea of what was happening, but the purpose and grandeur of it all was kind of lost on me. There's still more story left to tell in the following movies, but I feel like it still could've been explained better in this story. A lot of it was left for the viewer to infer, such as the character's exact motivations aswell as the overall conspiracy of the anime. To some, having a story that you have to fill in yourself might be interesting, but it felt a little bit rushed and overlooked to me. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the parts of the story that we did see were really interesting. It brought up some points about politics and individual senses of justice that were really intriguing. The characters were sort of weak, in my opinion. Like I said, their motivations weren't really all that clear-cut, though the story didn't seem to need a lot of character development. I think that it would've given the story something extra, though, had it focused more on the main character's origins rather than his future efforts and conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't expect from this anime was humor. Obviously, it isn't a comedy, but the lighthearted humor that freckled the anime kept it from getting to groggy given the heavy subject matter. I guess you could say the balance and pacing in this anime was really well done. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really think of what else to say about this anime because, like I said, it wasn't that it was bad or that I had to force my way through it, but it didn't leave a huge impression. In the end, I think the story was done a bit halfheartedly, but the actual premise almost makes up for it with sheer intrigue. If you're even a little interested, maybe give it go to see if it's your thing. I'm on my way to the subsequent movies to see if my grievances will be addressed. If they are, this anime may have some serious potential.",

Except for the somewhat chipmunk-looking faces of the characters\u2026 The art, otherwise can be said to be spectacular, if not the best.\r\nNow, you see, this anime does not really fall in my genre, save for the fact that it has a little bit of romance in it and it is somehow labeled as comedy. The pace may appear to be rather slow but I\u2019m always patient when it comes to watching slow anime.\r\nI likethe idea of the story as a whole and I particularly love Takizawa Akira for his spontaneity and boldness. He looks too much like that guy in Honey and Clover and his character seems to be quite similar but he sometimes reminds me of Ryuuzaki or L.Lawliet, better known as L from Death Note, perhaps for wearing white shirt and having messy black hair. Just charming.\\n\\n\r\nAh. I digress. Sorry. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP is great and it perfectly suits the anime. Even its ED is creatively made, with characters from the anime being paper cutouts. I enjoy the fact that they actually used real Americans for the voices of the Americans in the anime. Ano keitai mo suki de, kakkoii kara. The technology of the mobile phone seems impressive too. (Yes, impressive enough to lead to the manufacturing of the real mobile phones.) \\n\\n\r\nAnother factor that separates this anime from many others is the obvious fondness of nudity and penises (\u201cJohnnies\u201d as they affectionately call them) but mostly to be poked about as a joke, rather than to arouse any sexual attention, which I find intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Higashi no Eden is a new flavor added to my collection, and I\u2019m way too excited to watch the promised movies. Honestly can\u2019t wait.\\n",

Not only is it completely fresh and original in feeling, but the entire show is also incredibly fast paced and keeps you guessing from episode 1. If you like shows that will keep you on the edge of your seat and relatable characters in untreatable situations then I think you'll love this anime.  \r\nThough at first I wasn't too bit on the style of the art work I grew to love it. I think it fits the way the story is filmed and kind of gives it an 'almost real'and slightly futuristic feel.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. I had no idea that Oasis was the band that played the opening theme until the music video came out for it. This anime actually has surprisingly good English... (when they're in Washington DC) though it still sounds a bit funny.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all really interesting...especially the Selecaos. Takizawa Akira is one of the most interesting characters I've seen in an anime in a long time and I was really impressed with how they pulled off a light-hearted guy who had no idea who he was. I also liked the nerdy \"Pantsu\" and the cute Saki-chan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a 10 because I feel like its one of those series you could watch a dozen times and always feel like you'd seen something new. I'd reccomend this one to anyone. It's a great new anime for 2009!",

            "content": "EDIT AS OF 9/1/2011: This review has been updated to reflect my thoughts on the Japanese dub and both movie sequels. This covers everything Eden of the East-related\r\nEden of the East, or Higashi no Eden, is a series that began as an eleven-episode tv series created by Kenji Kamiyama, the director of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and developed by Production I.G. It is followed up by two movie sequels. I had the chance to sample this series on Funimation.com not too long ago. Just based off of that sampling, I went ahead and bought the series on blu-ray, and I'm glad Idid. This series is a Tom Clancy-esque thriller of the highest caliber.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nA girl named Saki Morimi is touring Washington D.C. when she encounters a strange young man who is completely naked, holding a revolver in one hand, and a cell phone in the other. The man claims that he doesn't know who he is, nor can he remember anything, except for Hollywood movies strangely enough. Saki gets inadvertently pulled into his escapades. She finds out that he is Akira Takizawa, a man on the run from Japanese authorities. Not only that, he is a Selecao, one of 12 chosen few who is armed with a cell phone connected to a 10 billion yen bank account. With it, he can contact a woman named Juiz who can basically make anything happen.\\n\\n\r\nIt's much more complex than that, but the story of Eden of the East is highly engrossing, intelligent, and taut. There is absolutely no filler of any sort; every scene serves a purpose. But there is also great mystery too: who are the Selecao? How did they come into possession of their almighty phones? Is Akira really a wanted terrorist? And why was he exposing his \"Johnny\" in D.C.? The only downside is by the end of the second movie, I found a plot hole. I can't go in detail about it, since I would be giving away crucial plot points, but there is something that wasn't properly explained. Because of this, I deducted my original story score of 10 to a \"mere\" 9. Nonetheless, there are no pacing issues here, no padding, no fanservice that feels out of place, and I also liked the endings (all three of them), and for that, I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is superb. No off-models shots anywhere, and if you watch it on blu-ray, you can appreciate just how sumptuous the background art is. There is some CGI used, and sometimes, it's jarring when used alongside hand-drawn illustrations, but other times, it looks great. The character designs are good. Some of the female characters, like Saki, look more like they belong in a Miyazaki movie than a Production I.G. series, but most of the characters have a distinct appearance, and they do their part. But seriously, watch this on blu-ray on a 1080 monitor; I guarantee that your eyes will have an orgasm. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is . . . okay, I guess. It punctuates more serious moments, but it's nothing special. The first episode on blu-ray plays Falling Down, a song by Oasis, in the opening sequence; it's a pretty cool song, and a perfect theme for a show like Eden of the East. However, Funimation could only license Falling Down for one episode; the replacement for the other episodes is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nI first saw this in English, and I can say that the English dub is satisfactory. The characters sound their part. A few of the minor characters give off a few unenthusiastic line reads, but otherwise, it's really good. However, there is a shout-out I must give: Jason Liebrecht as Akira. He. Is. Brilliant. In the role. He is pitch-perfect as the hero. It's his best performance, I think. I have also sampled the Japanese dub. Akira doesn't sound as good, but some other characters sound better; Saki sounds right in both dubs. I support both dubs; it really boils down to whether you prefer subs or dubs. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization:\\n\\n\r\nThe show only runs for 11 episodes and two films, so you won't get the depth from, say, a show like Eureka Seven, but the characters are well-defined. Akira is laid-back and confident, which is a contrast to Saki, who's more low-key in comparison. The other Selecao all have their own motives and personalities, and Saki's friends, who play an important role as the series progresses, are all charming and interesting in their own way. To quote tvtropes dot com, there are no \"Scrappies\", or characters that you end up hating for the wrong reasons. Everyone and everything is well-written. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWow. After seeing Darker Than Black, Ponyo, and Clannad earlier this year (of 2010, even though the recent edits are dated 2011), I didn't think I'd see another anime this year that I'd give a 10. Boy, was I wrong. Eden of the East is engaging, witty, insightful, perfectly paced, and overall a highly fun and enjoyable series to watch. It's shows like this that remind me why I love animation. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're bored of all the tiresome high school comedies and formulaic shonen series that have dominated anime for the last few years, then give Eden of the East a shot. It's a refreshing breath of fresh air, and solid proof that creativity in anime isn't dead yet.",

            "content": "If you asked people to describe the story of Higashi no Eden (Eden of the East), they would probably say something along the lines of \u201ca story about twelve individuals called Sele\u00e7\u00e3o who have been given the task to save Japan from it\u2019s current state and is has some great moments talking about socioeconomic issues. Personally, I disagree. I would describe it as a story about roughly forty-thousand Japanese \u201cJohny\u2019s\u201d. If you watch the show, I guarantee you will understand what I am talking about. That said, I believe Higashi no Eden is a show that everyone should watch because it has some great characters,touches on some important issues, and can be absolutely hilarious and thrilling at the heights of it\u2019s surrealism. \\n\\n\r\nHigashi no Eden is a show in which I have taken an immediate liking to the main characters, Akira Takizawa and Saki Morimi. Akira is an extremely charismatic character and that becomes apparent as he asks a stranger on the streets of Washington DC for a pair of pants and that person hands his over. Saki Morimi meets him while she is in DC. She is immediately fascinated by the way Akira acts, and due to circumstance they return to Japan together. This is the start of their relationship. One great thing I found is that their relationship felt real and not that stereotypical as many anime tend to have. \\n\\n\r\nEden of the East manages to talk about some socioeconomic issues during the length of its eleven episodes. These range mainly on the rise of the NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training). Many Millennials are living with their parents and not joining the workforce. This has become an increasingly worrisome in countries such as Japan. There are many reasons for this, one being that the Baby Boomer generation currently happens to hold many of the higher level work positions. This results in the Millenials being stuck in lower tier jobs as they can\u2019t find ones that fit their degree. This barrier in the job market is partially why NEET\u2019s are more prevalent than ever before. This has made NEET\u2019s seem like a burden on society but Higashi no Eden shows that they can still be useful. There are many instances in this show where NEET\u2019s band together through the internet to save people from disasters, an example of this is them establishing an emergency evacuation operation to save people from being killed by missiles. Higashi no Eden is a show about a generation that wishes to make something of themselves but is denied by the paradigms that have been set in place by the generations before them. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the socioeconomic aspects of the show were great in my opinion, the most enjoyment I had watching this show was when it shows how absurd and surreal it could get. Watching roughly twenty-thousand naked men get off a boat and rush for their cell phones is something I don\u2019t think I could ever forget. Unfortunately though, not everything is executed well in Higashi no Eden. The show can sometimes be a half-baked experience as some episodes can be downright boring to watch. The show also features a cast of secondary cast of characters which are important to the show and it\u2019s themes, but take up way too much time just sitting around and talking. To add to this, the story has a death plot going on in as whichever Sele\u00e7\u00e3o manages to save Japan first lives while all of the others die. This was much too convoluted and sometimes barely makes any sense. Also, due to their only being eleven episodes, the ending of the anime is bad, and the two movies that follow up right after end up being even worse. Still, I was happy I watched them.\\n\\n\r\nHigashi no Eden is a show that has some excellent characters, talks about socioeconomic issues relating to NEET\u2019s, and is masterful with it\u2019s surrealism, the shows falls apart sometimes under the weight of a convoluted death game plot and characters which got too much screen-time. Ultimately, Higashi no Eden was an enjoyable experience that I would recommend to everyone.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 (Good)\\n",

            "content": "I came to watch Eden of the East after seeing it on a number of \"most underrated anime\" lists. Several of my personal favorite series are a bit off the beaten path and likely fall into the \"underrated\" category so I'm definitely open minded with this kind of thing. Ultimately, while I certainly didn't dislike the show, I definitely wasn't ever wowed either and what I watched felt above average and nothing more.\r\nArt-\r\nThe art felt, like most of the show, above average to me. It wasn't ever ugly but it wasn't ever gorgeous either. The animation was smooth and never choppy and I have neitherhuge qualms nor huge praise for the visual elements of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good- better than above average but worse than very good- and the music really didn't stand out to me at all. Nothing made my ears bleed, but no individual song on the soundtrack felt especially great or memorable for me and there's nothing I want to add to my playlist after the fact. The intro and outro songs felt very average and cookie cutter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe base premise is fairly unique and intriguing and I was interested in it from the early going and it kept my interest throughout its short ride. However, this anime is by no means free of plot holes, conveniences or outright unexplained story elements.\\n\\n\r\nA common problem I've cited numerous times in other reviews with 12 ish episode anime (in this case 11) is a lack of proper character development and/or a lack of answers to critical plot elements simply due to lack of time and this anime is yet another victim of this epidemic. I'd argue that only the lead character approaches being properly developed (and doesn't even make it the full way there) and everyone else, including the female lead, have a long way to go. 11 episodes is simply not enough time to properly develop a medium sized cast of characters within the spectrum of relevance.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also leaves a lot of important questions unanswered, has a rushed and super convenient ending and overall lacks of sense of resolution to many parts of the plot. Without doing further research outside of the anime itself viewers will never know whether Mr Outside is alive or dead, who The Supporter is (if there is one at all), who the other never shown Selecao are, what the fate of Selecao number 1 is, how Juiz is able to fulfill some of the seemingly impossible requests it's able to fulfill, etc. For me this simply wasn't satisfactory. I'm not a manga reader and don't want to have to look things up in order to find answers- the anime should provide them for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWatching Eden of the East I was never bored or feeling like I was going to fall asleep but I was never on the edge of my seat dying to know what was going to happen next either. Other than being a tad rushed as a whole, as the show is only 11 episodes, this anime is generally free of pacing issues and there aren't any blatantly slow and boring stretches. For the most part I enjoyed what I watched, but only at the \"Hey this is pretty decent\" level as opposed to \"Wow this is amazing!\". It's a show I'm glad I watched once but would have very little interest in watching again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nAbove average- no more and no less- in almost every category, Eden of the East is a decent show worth taking a peek at when you've got a night in with no plans, but temper your expectations. Glad I watched but wouldn't want to watch again.\\n\\n\r\n+Interesting base premise\\n\r\n+Average or above average in all categories- doesn't blatantly fail at anything\\n\r\n+Reasonably paced/engaging\\n\\n\r\n-Many unanswered plot points/lack of resolution\\n\r\n-Average or above average in all categories- doesn't particularly excel at anything\\n\r\n-Lack of character development\\n\r\n-Forgettable and generic soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 6.5\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6",

The storyline is somewhat accurate to a realistic depiction of human behaviour and I personally appreciate that above romanticizing and idealizing human behaviour.\r\nArt: 10/10  I enjoyed the unique animation style and felt the art was definitely above average.\r\nSound: 10/10 Loved the atypical soundtrack! Great soul tracks thatmade my roommates ask me \"Are you still watching anime?\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 there wasn't a single moment where I questioned any character's motives or actions, everything was fairly plausible and every character brought a unique presence to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 I couldn't stop watching! definitely worth a marathon session.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt slightly lacking for me, yet I also appreciated the lack of a neatly packaged fairy tale ending.\\n\\n\r\nI'm currently recommending this to all my friends as it struck me as a truly unusual and fantastic anime!",

Like how the series begin in america, the whole naked thing, missiles launches and many more. I thought this would gonna be good, being the whole plot similar to Zankyou no Terror which I enjoyed the most. But sadly, failed to do so. After putting the main characters into a game is the only downside of this series. It would be better if they change the plot to a terrorist thing, like japan vs US involving nuclears and missiles. Lol. The whole cellphone thing is interesting and amazing. Butthe game is just stupid. My ratings are: The story is just medicore for me, I have watch so many death games and I'm not in the mood to watch more of it - (7/10). The art is so good, like how the animate USA is so good. It would be better if the whole setting would be in america. But nothing amazing about the whole animation - (8/10). The sound is great, the op/ed too. I like it. But again, nothing special -(9/10). The character is good. Not too bad, not too good. But the main mc is just some ordinary cool guy. Nothing special again - (9/10). Overall, the whole series is good as it was originally be - (8/10)",

She does nothing the whole series. \r\nStory/PLOT: It makes hardly any sense. It reminds me of an episode of Pokemon where the bad guys are terribly stupid and give their plan away, literally. The main guy smiles too much so it pretty much means he's fail-proof in every episode.You'll see what I mean after EP. 1\r\nSounds: It was pretty good except for the intro, which is an English emosong.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was alright except the characters looked a bit too bland. The main character even had a guy who looked just like him, I thought it was his brother or clone or something but apparently no one noticed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: None really. They didn't really explain anything in detail so it was hard to follow.",

            "content": "Eden of the East is unlike any anime I have ever seen before. I think this may be because it is a mature mystery/suspense series that is very well written- I really cannot think of another anime show that fits in such a genre.\r\nThe show begins with a amnesic young man waking up in Washington D.C. with nothing but a gun in one hand and a cell phone in the other. I DO mean literally nothing else- the guy is butt naked. No worries though, everything that needs to be censored is. The man meets a college senior named Saki Morimi, and the show continueson from there. It turns out that Takizawa is a part of a very dangerous game, and the mysteries continue to pile up as the show progresses. Eden of the East really reminded me of the Jason Bourne movies in terms of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI think the plot, as well as some very likable characters, is what really makes this series shine. The story is exceptionally well written, keeping the viewer from wanting to know more about the game. Cliffhangers at the end of episodes just add to the incredible suspense. I wish I could say more about the plot, but I fear that as a mystery show that would result in spoilers. There are some significant themes in the show, such as the use of power, politics, and technology. It really makes for a very interesting combination.\\n\\n\r\nI also thought the art was superb. Character designs are simple but in my opinion extremely effective. Some of the background art even caught my eye while watching.  This is a beautifully animated anime. The music was good, although the only memorable tunes I found were the opening and closing songs, as well as a song during the climax of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to add a note however: this show is rated TV-MA for a reason. Sexual themes and violence are quite apparent in the show and really really should not be watched by younger viewers. The scene that sticks out most in my head for being inappropriate concerns a serial killer: and kids don't need to be exposed to that.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a new anime to watch that breaks the confines of your traditional anime fare, this is the show. I really cannot think of anything else like it. The ending however seems rather abrupt- it isn't even feel all that open ended. It becomes apparent that if you want to see the end of the story you are going to have to watch the upcoming movies. Which means I'll be waiting awhile for my English dub...\\n\r\nA definite recommendation!",

            "content": "What if you playing a game where the objective was to save Japan? The only thing you have in order to do this was a cell phone with 10 billion yen. You can spend it any way you want, but you have to use it for the above objective. If you don\u2019t use the money or if you run out and have not won the game, then you die. Would you wanna play?\r\nEden of the East is a Psychological/Romance/Mystery anime written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama. It originally was produced by Production I.G. Studio and was licensed by Funimation. There are eleven episodes total withtwo novels released after the anime. Three films were released as well between September 2009 and March 2010.\\n\\n\r\nOn November 22, 2010, ten missiles strike against uninhabited areas of Japan, claiming no victims. This apparent terrorist act is referred to as \"Careless Monday\" and disregarded by most people. The series begins three months later, with a young Japanese woman named Saki Morimi visiting Washington D.C. as part of her graduation trip. When she gets into trouble, a mysterious Japanese man, who introduces himself as Akira Takizawa, helps her through it. The man appears to have no memory and is completely naked, carrying only a gun and a cell phone charged with 8.2 billion in digital money.\\n\\n\r\nThe look of the series and the animation is rather well done. There was no laziness or lack of budget to cause problems with this series and that is easily noticeable. Though at some points, the animation doesn\u2019t quite fit the original look, but it\u2019s only used for comic effect rather then calling it lazy. The story is good too. For the most part, you\u2019re following Takizawa, trying to figure out who he is, and what organization he\u2019s a part of. There are few things that escape the realm of explanation, and this series is going to leave you with questions in the end, but not unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAfter I watched this series the first time, I told my friend about it. When I did he said to me, \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty much like the Bourne movies.\u201d And, yes, in some ways it is. The main male character has no memory of who he is or what he has done before losing those memories. He also works for a secret organization bent on some purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly well developed, Takizawa being the best. Then again, the series is pretty much all about him and his journey to find out who he is. Saki is developed decently, sometimes you don\u2019t completely understand why she does certain things but, she is a good companion to Takizawa. The rest of the cast has small bits of development here and there, key word being small.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the running joke of the series. It\u2019s fine for a few episodes and can be funny when referred to, but by the time you get to the forth or fifth episode it\u2019s just annoying and completely. I am, of course, talking about the \u201cJohnny\u201d gag. It\u2019s called by no other name but Johnny. Not penis, not dick, not wood. Johnny. There\u2019s even a character in the series who is called the \u201cJohnny Hunter\u201d. She hunts down rapists and..... Yeah...... Are you seeing the problem? I understand that the series wanted to have some thing that makes people laugh, but referring to a male\u2019s genitally as Johnny, ALL THE TIME, is just plain stupid. Unless you\u2019re into stupid things like that which, in that case, you will absolutely love it.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that this is a review on the Japanese version, but I am going to mention the English dub for a second. I only watched part of an episode that was posted on YouTube. And all I have to say is that Takizawa and Hirasawa were tolerable in the ten minutes I managed to watch it. Everyone else didn\u2019t seem like good fits. Again, this was just based off one episode. The entire series might have had characters partnered with good voice actors that I didn\u2019t take a look at. But for this review, I would stick with the Japanese version. Pretty much cause I\u2019m a sucker for this version.\\n\\n\r\nThe end result is Eden of the East being a good visual anime with some kinks here and there along with a real good story that takes another story, tweaks it, and makes it very interesting. There is more to the story with the movies that were released during the fall, so the story doesn\u2019t end with more bombing and more memory loss. No, the fun has just gotten started. Hopefully, they\u2019ll resolve some of the plot points in the movies.",

However in my opinion it is also not a GOOD anime. The story was a very interesting idea but it was extreemely rushed and not done very well at all, this could be attributed to the fact that the anime was barely 200 minutes long. No complaints on the Ost's or artwork as they were both up to par for me atleast. To me the only likeable character was Saki, and that was only to a degree as she was fairly shallow, most of the other characters are eithier assholes or just plain and unmemorable. If this was done right it could really have been a masterpiece of anime. Alas because of the characters and underdeveloped story i can only give this a 6 as it was quite mediocre.",

            "content": "Higashi no Eden is a spectacular anime with a memorable storyline, active characters and splendid art. It's more action than romance, but the romance between Saki and Tak is clear. Every moment in the anime was there for a reason, and it was tied up nicely at the end. I'll definitely be watching the additional movies as soon as possible. \r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story was memorable because of the action, comedy and romance within it. It was mysterious as to Tak's background, and as the anime went along you followed his journey to get his memory back. I've never seen a plot quite like this,and it was kind of very political too. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as you watch the first episode, its clear that effort and skill was put into every image. I saw some stills and promotionals of this anime, and seeing them made me want to watch it, and I'm glad I have.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nI watched this with english subtitles, however a dubbed version is available. Every noise was amazingly clear and realistic. Also, the soundtrack was lovely - very fitting to every scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character fit perfectly in this anime and you loved every one. The characters backstories are (once again) made with a lot of effort and creativity. Everyone has a story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that I enjoyed this anime, due to its constant scores of 10, but I'm not just being over generous - I really do believe that this is one of the best animes of all time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 (of course!)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is perfect for guys and girls, for the ones looking for action and the ones looking for a bit of a laugh (and a bit is all you get, mind you, as the anime is very serious.). Definitely a must for all - however, there are scenes that young people should not see (young meaning little kids), in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n* I totally got hooked on the introduction and credits little sequences! Whoever made them are pure genius! The intro gets you pumped for the story, and the credits were just so creative. definitely dont skip it!",

            "content": "Eden of the East is a political mystery thriller from acclaimed director Kenji Kamiyama. Kamiyama is no stranger to political thrillers, with the now legendary Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex under his belt. However, in Eden of the East, he brings an inviting warmth and looseness scarcely found in political thrillers. With a plot that resembles a Robert Ludlum novel than GitS: SAC, Eden is a unique and refreshing take on the genre in the world of anime.\r\nSaki Morimi is visiting Washington D.C. on a trip to celebrate her graduation from University. She is about to enter the work force, having a workinterview scheduled as soon as her intended return time to Japan. This plan gets derailed when she meets a naked man with no possession besides a gun and and cellphone, and no memory of who he is, in front of the White House. She give her his jacket to cover up and they part ways, however, as it turns out her passport is in the jacket and she misses her flight. Meanwhile, the man has finds the apartment room he has apparently been staying at, just to find that he has many aliases and passports, and that he might be a terrorist. He also finds out his phone has an insane amount of money credited on it. After being tracked down by Saki, he decides to go by the name Akira Takizawa, and together they return to Japan. There Takizawa begins to investigate his past, one which may or not involve recent missile strikes on the country and the disappearance of 20,000 people; while Saki finds herself becoming more and more involved with this mystery man.\\n\\n\r\nHere is a premise that just hooks the audience immediately. Having a main character that is enigma even to himself is a simple but brilliant narrative quirk. As a viewer, you find yourself craving the truth behind his identity. His past is interesting to say the least, involving a twisted game set up by the faceless Mr. Outside, in which the constants have to \"save\" Japan with the 10 billion yen given to them, and any who fail to reach this first, or uses the money for personal reasons will be eliminated. However, this is just the tip of the show's mystery. Even as bits and pieces of his past are relieved, it is never made clear what exactly is Takizawa's role in the bizarre events that have taken place in Japan until late in the series; leaving the viewers in the dark and dying to know the truth.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this intrigue with the main character is not not the only thing going for the show, not by a long shot. The story reaches much further and into some very interesting issues. The Japan depicted in this anime is a county in disarray, trying to recover from a disastrous incident. The show does a fine job capturing the understated desperation present in this kind of atmosphere, and what people are willing to believe in such times. It also effectively portrays young adults struggling to find a place in, or rebel against, society and how they have the power to reshape it. Ultimately, the series shows what people are capable of once they band together. Admittedly, these themes are somewhat diluted my the mystery story centering around Takizawa, having less punch than they should have and leaving a few loose ends on the mystery-side, but for the most part they come together very well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes Eden of the East stand out from other political thrillers is its characters.Their presence is far more inviting than the rigid, distant military-types found in GitS:SAC. Takisawa has a loose and relaxed personality, rather than the cold and deliberate character he easily could have been. This actually works for the best, as his unique personality makes him incredibly likable, and has the audience genuinely invested in him. Saki also has a charm of her own, and is the perfect face for the generation just entering the work force. Both are a joy to watch whether they are together or apart. The rest of the colorful cast is just as interesting. The other participants in Mr. Outside's game, called Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, each have there own interesting intentions with the 10 billion yen they have been granted, some with grand schemes to reshape the country and win the game, others with more personal endeavors. Even Saki's group of NEET friends is a collection of likable personalities, each with their own quirks.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, Eden's visuals are some of the finest visuals you will see in a TV anime series. Kamiyama's works have all been known to look fantastic, and Eden is no exception. The backgrounds depict the busy city streets of New York and Tokyo, as well as many other locations, in stunning detail. Taking in the scenery is a joy all of its own. Even more notable, however, is the show's use of softer looking character designs, more typical of a slice-of-life than a political thriller. This may seem like an odd choice, but it is surprisingly less jarring than one would expect, actually the character designs fit the show perfectly. The designs give the characters an expressiveness and charm that would not be achieved by a harder, more realistic look. You can just see Takizawa and Saki's personalities shine through their facial expressions and body language. The visuals here are simply the best that can be expected of a TV series. Likewise, the music here is incredibly well composed and superbly used. Whether the music is absent in a scene, or sounding the greatness of a scene, Kamiyama's use of it is always appropriate and brings the out the full effect of the scene. The only thing that can be said against the sound here is that it does not quite reach the level of integration of music and story that Cowboy Bebop, Princess Tutu, and very few others do.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell from its first episode that Eden would be something special. With a refreshingly new take on its genre, the show definitely delivered on its early promise. While it is probably too light for hardcore political thriller fans, it is more accessible to a wider audience, one of the few shows that can claim near-universal appeal. And as for any loose ends the show has... there are two squeal movies to fill that void.",

It is a very creative story line, in a very unique save the world or destroy it trying sort of manner.

However do not let that discourage you, there are plenty of twists, and new things thrown at you around everycorner.

            "content": "Higashi no Eden is an anime that is built up from its great plot. It starts off as what seems like a romance comedy but slowly eases you into its more serious plot. This is what I have concluded from the 9 episodes I have watched up until now.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story revolves around a boy named Akira Takizawa and a girl named Saki Morimi who find themselves in an akward position in front of the White House in Washington D.C.. I enjoy that the story takes on the problems that reflect the real world and it sets up the show for its scenario based aroundAkira having to do something to change the Japan for the better.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is great, by looking at the animation you can tell the animators had a more than average budget. The characters are well drawn but I believe the scenery is where the show comes to life, not slaking in animations of big cities or crowds the animators deserve praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is very good despite having a odd opening and ending. The opening is a english song \"Falling Down\" by oasis not too often does an anime pick an english song for their opening but it is a very fitting opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the things I enjoy about this anime. Akira is a very much fitting and unique protanganist for the series, his humor and up beat additude brings balance to the serious nature of the plot. Saki compilments Akira well being that she is shy and more cautious. I think most of the characters are interesting but in means of character development, other then Akira, i find it a bit lacking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThe show is very much satisfying on an the level of enjoyment because with so many anime in recent time only having to offer fanservice and romantic cliches this anime has so much more to deliever with its great plot and characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nOverall this is probably one of the best anime to come out of 2009 and is very much worth a look if you are looking for an anime that is dictated by a great plot. However with all the developments in the story it is nerve wrecking wondering if they with will be able to give this series a satisfying ending with the last two episodes, whatever the case you will probably find me reviewing the series by the time it ends.",

            "content": "Upon reading the synopsis I was a little intrigued, but I was a little mislead in what this story was. I thought it would be some little romantic comedy of sort, but I never expected it to be such an enjoyable story. It is one of those series that is so unique yet so stereotypical that it comes out of left field and hits you in a good way. I would say that this is a must see, and do not delay like I did. It is not what you expect it to be, it is so much more.\r\nThe story starts out as the synopsissays, but let me expand on the first minute or two that they told you about. A Japanese girl visits America and is in front of the White House. A naked guy appears holding a cell phone in one hand and a gun in the other. He has had his memory erased. He sort of saves the girl, and the girl gives him a couple items of her clothing (jacket, scarf.. but oddly his \"johnny\" is still hanging out). The guy runs off but her wallet is in the jacket. Now you know the first five minutes of this story. From there it involves their relationship, the mystery of why his memory was erased, and what the heck is going on with this crazy phone of his. He's involved in some sort of crazy game where a few individuals have billions of dollars and with one phone call can have whatever they want to happen... happen. There's the story with no spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nIt's eleven episodes of mystery and mayhem, but it's done in such a wonderful way. There is a love story in there, but this isn't about the love story. The main character is so charming and charismatic that even with no memories he wings his way through his odd situation. The supporting characters are all interesting in their own ways as well. The story and characters are all well developed, and it gives just enough without over explaining or over exposing things that it shouldn't. Even the music played a great part in the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like interesting stories with a few twists here and there then you should definitely check this out. It's not a chick flick. It's not a fan service anime series either. It's a well made, brilliant at times, but well told story that anybody can enjoy. Unfortunately the ending is left open, but they do announce that 2 movies will follow. I will be checking out these movies but this review is just for the 11 episode anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThis i s a must watch. Don't hesitate.",

            "content": "Overall 8/10\r\n----\r\nHigashi no Eden is a fabulous series that breaks out of the typical anime flair.  The plot captivates you making you want more and more. I enjoyed it tremendously, the plot which it situated was close to the era I live in helped to build a sense of familiarity to it and I was able to relate well to the problems and complains that the characters voiced out in this series.  Highly recommended for people who enjoy a little more thinking in their anime.  \r\nStory 10/10\r\n------\r\nThe plot is gripping and makes you wonder who is the real one behind everything.Nothing is too small a detail for Higashi no Eden.  Unlike some animes that may feel paper and the escape feels too convenient, Higashi no Eden's plot is too well written to feel that way.  It leaves you wondering whether such things may possibly happen.  It starts off running at full speed with its perfectly timed little comical breaks when things get too tense.  This anime has nothing to compare to it for it started off as an anime.  There is no disappointment that the anime was not able to live up to the manga version.  It is not fantasy and neither is it too sci-fi, as it is close to the era that I lives in, I was able to relate easily to the things they mention in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nThe drawing style is typical and nothing to boost.  It is drawing in a little comical style that suits well to the plot and their comical moments.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nIn all honesty, Higashi no Eden's soundtrack was what drew me to watch it.  Not that I was a big fan of Oasis (who sang the cover song for Higashi no Eden), but many good animes have a good soundtrack.  Higashi no Eden is no exceptional to the this.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nCharacter development was stark in this anime.  The characters generally do not evolve with the anime and mostly stay as it is when it first appears.  Despite this, Higashi no Eden did tried to expand the characters and give them a little more depth to the reasons why they act in that manner.  However it was the outstanding plot that balanced what it lacked.\\n",

            "content": "Eden of the East is certainly a refreshing anime that has a really interesting premise. I had expected a sci-fi/action/mystery genres anime before I watched this show. I was surprised to find that this show has minimum sci-fi and action elements. Despite this, I was still impressed with the show.\r\nThe storyline is solid and inventive, and has some plot twists that keep the audience entertained in every episode. The show is presented in a laid-back atmosphere. In fact, too laid-back for a show that has a lot of suspense in the beginning. The true strength of this show is not mystery or suspense, though, butthat it deals with many issues that are relevant to our world today. For example, this show portrays how young people nowadays have difficulty integrating into the society. \\n\r\nOverall, the story is well done, but do not expect an epic conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. Definitely watch Eden in 720p. The sound, though, is lacking in many ways. The OP and ED are just ... bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generally well portrayed. Akira Takizawa, the protagonist, is one of the coolest anime characters that I have seen. He has incredibly charisma, a laid-back attitude about everything, an unshakable confidence in himself, and balls of steel. This one character defines this show. However, while some characters are likable, there are many others that are annoying, shallow, or not developed enough. \\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed this show. This show has a lot of \"situational comedy\", for which I define as comedy that only makes sense in context of the plot and arises from plot development. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\\n\r\nStory & Art: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter & Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: don't forget to watch the 2 Eden movies after finishing the TV series if you liked this show. The 2 movies are essentially the conclusion for the TV series. Don't expect the movies to be spectacular, though. \\n\\n\r\n*this review has been rewritten",

            "content": "If you were given a phone which had 10 Billion on it and were asked to change the world, what would you do? \r\nWhile I'm sure at least some people would first buy the Playboy Mansion and then go on to throw the biggest party in the universe, the answer given by the characters of this wonderful series would do something completely different but about two times more awesome.\r\nStory:\r\nAll Saki Morimi wanted to do was to throw a quarter into the fountain in front of the white house in Washington D.C. and make a wish. Of course, she didn't expect that the police wouldn't taketoo kindly to her intrusion. Then again, she didn't expected to find a naked guy wielding a gun and a phone with 8.4 Billion Yen on it.\\n\\n\r\nTo say anymore than that would be to spoil one of the greatest stories I have seen in recent years. It has mystery, it has action, it has romance, comedy, amnesia. It has everything you would love to see in a thriller movie. What's also good is that Eden of the East, throughout both the series and the movie, takes this opportunity-filled foundation and builds a wonderful narrative that mostly tries to avoid the cliques which no-one likes.\\n\r\nAmnesia is more than just a viewer-friendly add-on, adding a crucial plot element that if it wasn't there, would drastically alter the stories events.\\n\r\nThere is romance and comedy, but it isn't the main focus and instead develops the characters, main and supporting, putting them in a favorable light.\\n\r\nIt's hard to describe the story without spoiling it, but I just have to say that if you love intrigue on a nation-wide scale and a world where the seemingly impossible can be made possible, with many twists and turns, you will love Eden of the East.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\r\nWhile some anime find their solace in a quirky art-style which draws in the audience, EoE has a fairly realistic art-style, the characters have normal eyes, noses and hair, the only exaggerated detail being the white squiggle when they are... exposed. The environments, to compliment the character designs are detailed to the last patch of peeling paint. The settings are colorful, whether you're in Washington D.C by day or Shinjuku by night and to those who live in the areas where these scenes are shown, look out and see if you can recognize places you've been to. It's that detailed. However, it doesn't suffer from taking itself too seriously and doesn't let eye-candy take over characters and plot.\\n\r\nSound is another bonus to the series. The opening theme, 'Falling Down' by Oasis in the English Dub, sets up the atmosphere of mystery with it's smooth, sultry sounds, while at the same time giving an undertone of the calm before the storm.\\n\r\nThe ending theme, 'Futuristic Imagination' by School Food Punishment (who do most of the music for this series), uses an upbeat J-Pop tune to pump the viewer up. It almost makes it seem like you have the power to change the world only if you gave it a good try, which in the end is one of the messages of this series. Otherwise, the music is quite subtle, mixing in the occasional English jazz tune with the epic orchestral arrangement and is a joy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOh, the characters.\\n\r\nAkira Takizawa, our naked hero, is an altruistic, eccentric, intelligent man who despite hardship is willing to forgive and no matter what wants to believe in humans and so will always put himself out on a limb for them, knowing that they will always do the right thing in the end. Meanwhile, Akira doesn't come out as 2-D, especially when you find out his past and what he did before he appeared in front of the White House.\\n\r\nSaki Morimi, our perpetually confused heroine, is on the border of being an apathetic girl who is about to become lost in the succubus that is adult life. She has an unrequited love, a fading sense of hope and the sense that she is about to give up on herself. Then what better for her than to meet Takizawa?\\n\r\nThe two main leads work well together, besides having romantic chemistry on screen. There is a sense that the characters really grow in the space of 11 episodes and two movies, learning important lessons and making life-long bonds which is all people ever want in life.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are good too, though they have much less screen-time than they deserve and in some respects can be easily forgotten  and placed into boxes. However, since I find much enjoyment in how they interact amongst themselves and the main cast. Even characters only given one episode serve important roles and most are likable and admirable, taking pride in themselves, while not gilding their flaws, using their skills to become just as much heroes as the main cast. \\n\r\nIn the end, the greatest achievement of the characters is that you will most likely give your full support to Takizawa, not because he is the white of a black-and-white story, but because he is the most likable of a grey story where everyone has one redeemable factor about them, even if it seems like what they do has no justification.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOverall, I love this series and I think if you think anything I said sounds good, you should watch it too and make your own opinions. \\n\r\nAfter calculating the scores I have come up with an exact 9 out of ten. A must-watch.\\n\r\nAnd with that I, Cazuki, beg you adieu.\\n\r\nBang.",

            "content": "Well, this is a rather interesting show, especially how they seem to show a lot of nudity. This feels like the Japanese idea for the Hunger Games a bit (now, I don\u2019t really know all of the hunger games but this is what I gathered). Normal people getting hold of something and end up playing out a \u2018game\u2019 for the enjoyment of some guy that has a lot of money. If the person does not do what is told, they die. Now this has no really baring on the story much but I am a bit surprised that they had actually brought in the freedomtower. \\n\\n\r\nI have to hand it to Saki, if I was in her situation and met a naked man, I would probably just run and not give him my coat and hat. Then she also goes back home with him as well. She just seems a little two innocent to me to be any real impact on the story plot. I wish she was a little more of a tomboyish type of girl and not such a pushover to fall in love like that. And even though she is like that, I felt myself wanting her and Akira together. \\n\\n\r\nAkira seems a bit off in the head, and seems to be similar to L from Death Note in how childish he is. Throughout the whole show, he just tries to figure out who he is. Otherwise, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything more about him that I can say without large spoilers. I just don\u2019t get why he has angel wings on his dog though. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is rather nice, adding a lot of the mystery in the show and only showing small pieces of the show. The ending seems to pretty much foreshadow and maybe even spoil what is to happen in the show which makes me a bit pissed at it. The artwork from within the show is a bit odd, the noses seem turned up somewhat like a pigs and when things happen strangely, they turn into cut out chibi characters of themselves. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I only was able to watch the dub version and even though it was pretty good, some of the voices seemed a bit off in some aspects. I am sure that the parts that were in America would have been better in the original version.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is really nice. I love the openings mystic ring to it and I would probably place it onto my music player. There really isn\u2019t much other music in this that stands out at all. It just seems a bit to low to even be heard. There was only one that stood out from the rest and it was what they used in rather gentle and somber times. It was a nice piano and violin melody. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I have to tell you that the ending of this is something that only M. Night Shyamalan could only make this up. Really, I just can\u2019t believe that they did that and pretty much told you to watch the 2 movies that came out for any real closer.",

            "content": "To start off with my review, if know the band, Oasis. Yes, the LEGIT british band OASIS who are well known for singing champagne supernova and wonderwall. Then, did you know that their song \"Falling Down\" was featured here in this very anime? Well, except if you bought the FUNimation Version of this anime, well you only got Saori Hayami's OP for 10 episodes while Falling Down is only used in Episode 1.\r\nWell, that's the reason why I've got myself hooked because of that. Because first of all... F***ING OASIS! Those are my favorite band. So I said myself, \"hmm... I should gave it atry.\" So here I was, watching the anime and NOT SKIPPING the OP and I was in bliss listening to Oasis's song. Because this is the second time (besides Radiohead in Ergo Proxy) to listen another foreign band outside Japan.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I'm getting out of the topic, so let's review Higashi no Eden. Or in English, Eden of the East.\\n\\n\r\nSo we start at the episode where there was a naked man named Akira Tokizawa who has a gun and a weird cellphone, known as a \"Selecao\", that can do whatever you wanted to do in exchange for a digital money which is originally worth of 10 billion yen and it was been given to the selected 12 candidates who were participating in a kind of game. Whoever loses their money, either squandered, didn't use the digital money or they failed to do their objective as a messiah, then they will be killed by a supporter. \\n\\n\r\nFor short, they must oblige their mission as the new God of the new era using this unholy Cellphone that controls the fate of either the whole world or the user itself. The theme is kinda looks like it was came from MadHouse's \"Death Note\", except that it was kinda slow paced at first, and it has also some deaths as well... but not that brutal like it was shown in DN, and the story is not very that dark. But what they have in common between Eden and DN is that, they have this kind of, what so called, \"God of the new world\" thingy. Except that they were 12 gods in their country, and they have one goal... To continue to become a messiah or savior of this country, either it's bad or good.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot is good but it left us with SO MANY plot holes to fix with. It's like the whole 11-episodes of this anime is not enough though. So IG decided to go have a 2-part movie to seal the holes in this anime. First off, if your asking \"why IG didn't just made more episodes rather than just wait for the movie to be released?\" A simple answer is that, maybe we will see the full and explainable plot on the movie rather than just cut into halves and make it as an episode then, we'll wait for a week to release it. Second, \"is it enough to cover these 11 episodes of this anime by watching the 2-part movie?\" Well, we will get to that if I watch those 2-part movies. \\n\\n\r\nBut, here, at least we have some explanation to which what is happening and what are the objectives of each selecao characters. This is a good start to watch with and... It's like this is just a prologue to those two part movies. Which is, yeah really disappointing. No real plots, just some introductions and their goals and stuff. But at least, we have some few actions, comedies, some love story teaser that maybe it will show it to the two-part movie and some mysteries and unsolved mysteries in this 11-episodic anime. Which is worth to watch.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Art, well, it's fine alright. The surrounding are great as well including the character's artwork and... due to the graphic nature, you might see a scene where a horde of naked male shown at this anime. If your innocent, don't worry this is not eechi or even more than that, so they instead put a white swirling lines for censorship of the penis.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is, surprisingly, awesome. Especially at the first episode where IG ACTUALLY put some REAL AMERICAN voices here to portray their american roles in an american setting. It's pretty great actually, I was expecting to hear some Japanese VA who are struggling to speak english. But that very first episode is just pretty splendid. Well done IG! As for the Japanese Dubs, it's great also. As for the OP, like I already typed earlier, the reason why I've got hooked in this anime because of Oasis. So as for the OP song, \"Falling Down\", well it has a pretty deep meaning onto it when I watched the lyric. I searched it after that and still have no idea what it is though. But the beat of this song is pretty serious including Noel Gallagher's voice tune, which is pretty melancholic. For the ED, it's quite the opposite to Oasis though, it was performed by School Food Punishment and their song \"futuristic imagination\" is very melodic and it has a meaning to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are well-developed and well known. Especially to Akira Tokizawa as, for once, he was very insomniac person until he decides to find the truth of who he really is. They also show some flashbacks about Akira's past life and his goals before, and when he understands it, he quickly do the action for the sake of mankind. And as for the twelve selecao members, well I've only seen few of them. One selecao user is helping the cause for good measures and risking his life for them, two were the reason who is behind the \"careless monday\" scheme, a police who is also a selecao user is tracking Akira, and one selecao user who... likes to cut dicks, yes, DICKS, because she hates dicks and she hate rapists, which is a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, they're only 7 out of 12 of the selecao users were introduced here. So maybe the other 5 are at the movie. Which is pretty irritating considering on how this anime which garnered a lot of potential, is just ended into a cliffhanger. But at least the movie is just around the corner and the only thing we need to do is to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's slow paced, this is looks like to be the intro of the movie, the cliffhanger ending, and some negatives didn't stop me to watch this anime from start to finish. And it is VERY RECOMMENDABLE to watch this anime. This is anime is focuses more on mystery, so if you want to watch it, then DO IT! You wouldn't miss it!",

            "content": "-This review is in English and Spanish.\r\n-Esta review esta en Ingl\u00e9s y Espa\u00f1ol.\r\nENGLISH\r\nI had hopes in this anime, that with its plot and the hand of Production I.G would be interesting but i was mistaken.\r\nHas an interesting premise that has been wasted with bad characters and an approach more directed to become an anime slice of life than an anime focused on the premise that presents.\r\nThe story at the beginning presents an interesting premise that could lead to a great anime, but is wasted straying from the plot trying to become a slice of life, which makes it quite an anticlimatic anime,when the anime triesto be serious ends up diverting and ends up trying to put comedy, which annoys the little atmosphere of suspense that has the anime and when the anime tries to be a slice of life it becomes serious putting the main plot. \\n\\n\r\nTo that add mediocre characters because here we go with the next point, the characters.The main character is a Gary Stu with any positive trait that you can think of, although it has something of charisma which makes it something less horrible, the rest of characters can not say much,the companion of the protagonist does not have any blood in the veins so a main character who is bad has to push such a false relationship is not pleasant and the rest of people are normal people that only annoy the atmosphere of suspense that could have the series.\\n\r\nThe only \"good\" point are the antagonists that at least seem interesting, but neither end because they barely give them some time on screen, in addition to their motivations are mediocre and suffer from strong victimization.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the graphical section, although the animation is fluid and has decent funds, they put CGI in more than one occasion and when the climate of suspense breaks, they put in a horrible chibi style to finish off the little climate of suspense that remains to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound section the opening is good and nothing more, has environmental issues of suspense and a slice of life does not have any bad subject, but also does not have notable themes.\\n\\n\r\nIn general if I had to define the anime in a few words I would define it as an anime of suspense, without suspense,a very wasted plot, that remains like a failed anime that I try to put an interesting plot but fails in all the senses, from the script, going through the characters to the graphical and sound section is not remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact,i really try to enjoy it, but it's very frustrating, the characters are frustrating, and their atmosphere is also very frustrating.\\n\r\nI'm sorry but i cannot recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL NOTE: 4/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nESPA\u00d1OL\\n\\n\r\nTen\u00eda esperanzas en este anime,que con su argumento y la mano de Production I.G ser\u00eda interesante pero me he equivocado,bastante.\\n\\n\r\nTiene una premisa interesante que se ha desperdiciado con malos personajes y un enfoque m\u00e1s dirigido a convertirse en un anime de cosas de la vida que un anime centrado en la premisa que presenta.\\n\\n\r\nLa historia al principio presenta una premisa interesante que podr\u00eda conducir a un gran anime,pero se desperdicia desvi\u00e1ndose de la trama principal,tratando de convertirse en un anime sobre cosas de la vida,lo que lo convierte un un anime muy anticlimatico.Cuando el anime trata de ser serio termina desviandose y termina tratando de meter comedia,lo que molesta porque destruye el ambiente de suspenso que tiene el anime y cuando el anime trata de ser sobre cosas de vida se hace serio poniendo la trama principal.\\n\\n\r\nA eso sumale personajes mediocres porque aqu\u00ed vamos con el siguiente punto,los personajes.El personaje principal es un Gary Stu con cualquier rasgo positivo que se te pueda ocurrir,aunque tiene algo de carisma que lo hace algo menos horrible, el resto de los personajes no se puede decir mucho, el compa\u00f1ero del protagonista no tiene sangre en las venas por lo que un personaje principal que es malo tiene que empujar una relaci\u00f3n tan falsa no es agradable y el resto de la gente son personas normales que s\u00f3lo destruyen la atm\u00f3sfera de suspenso que podr\u00eda tener la serie.\\n\r\nEl \u00fanico punto \"bueno\" son los antagonistas que al menos parecen interesantes, pero tampoco termina de ser un buen punto porque apenas les dan alg\u00fan tiempo en pantalla, adem\u00e1s de sus motivaciones son mediocres y sufren de fuerte victimizaci\u00f3n.\\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto al apartado grafico,aunque la animaci\u00f3n es fluida y tiene fondos decentes,ponen CGI en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n y cuando el anime tiene clima de suspenso,lo rompen metiendo un horrible estilo chibi para acabar con el poco clima de suspenso que tiene el anime.\\n\\n\r\nSobre el apartado sonoro,el opening esta bueno y nada mas,tiene algunos temas ambientales de suspenso y algunos que servir\u00edan para un anime sobre cosas de la vida,si bien no hay ning\u00fan tema malo,tampoco hay alguno destacable.\\n\\n\r\nEn general si tuviera que definir el anime en pocas palabras lo definir\u00eda como un anime de suspense,sin suspenso,un argumento muy desperdiciado, un anime fallido que trato de poner un argumento interesante pero falla en todos los sentidos,desde el gui\u00f3n,

            "content": "This show is more proof we didn't need that MAL reviews need the ability to use spoiler tags. It's impossible to discuss Eden of the East in-depth without giving away certain plot reveals (as it is a mystery story) or talking about its themes in relation to the premise which is kept hidden for a long time. Thus in order to even write the most mild review possible I'm going to reveal slightly more than the bare minimum of the premise that's outlined on the main page. If you want to go in completely blind stop reading this, otherwise I hope you don't mind episode1-4 spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nA man who chooses the name Akira Takizawa wakes up in front of the White House naked with no memories and carrying nothing but a peculiar cell phone. He's discovered by a fellow native Japanese girl named Saki Morimi who is somehow charmed by this guy anyone else would find creepy and insane, and the two team up to find out the mystery behind Takizawa's past and his weird cell phone. It turns out that Takizawa is one of twelve people involved in a high stakes game to \"change the world for the better\". Each of these people is given ten billion Yen on their cell phone which they can use to contact a concierge to do anything they wish - for a price. The problem? Not everyone with a Selecao phone has selfless goals in mind, and only one of them can win this game. The losers get assassinated by a mole known as \"the Supporter\". Takizawa and friends must race against time to discover the true context of this game and finish it before the other Selecao do something insane.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East becomes carried by the potential of its premise with the cell phone game, and early on occasionally explores some of that potential as Takizawa must compete with the other Selecao directly. Because the motivations of the game itself aren't made clear until the very end it's these dangerous direct confrontations that give the series all of its thriller aspects and momentum. The subplots about Takizawa's memory and the other characters are far less engaging for a few reasons. For starters, it's easy to suss out most of what Takizawa's trying to remember faster than the show reveals it, so there are several scenes of characters dwelling on possibilities of stuff we nearly know the answer to. On top of that, the show's attempts at humor are often bad and out of tone with the thriller scenes (the better ones), and every joke is made at the expense of one of the characters' personalities which makes it slightly harder to take their plight seriously each time and crosses the already fragile line of this situation being forgivably plausible at all because no one's taking it seriously like it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe Eden of the East Club makes no sense. They started out as a small recycling group that turned into a... something that's focused on marketing a program called Eden which uses its database to recognize anything in a cell phone picture someone takes. The development on this was supposedly post-poned when a matchmaking feature went awry and this event isn't given any detail as to why it was necessary to halt Eden, and despite the characters talking like Eden isn't ready to be unveiled on the world it's been open access to everyone the entire time to do the same function it always has. Mikuru Katsuhara is the only member of the group who can code and is never seen doing it, and why this club gets together and what they talk about and what their goal is is a complete mystery despite acting like they have one and becoming important side characters. Kazuomi Hirasawa is an intelligent and charismatic leader who \"wants to make a paradise for NEETs\" even though as a near graduate who's extremely capable he wouldn't believably care about NEETs. He's doing nothing to further this goal he states and the Eden program is useful specifically for people who leave their house and socialize. If I was a NEET, I'd be creeped out by the existence of such a program and use it as an excuse to stay inside even more. In fact, with Google, Facebook, etc. selling out information to each other to create permanent profiles on every person on the planet this is pretty much already happening and it IS creepy. The Eden Club is doing the devil's work. Or they're doing nothing at all. But that doesn't stop these guys with no backgrounds or convictions from becoming the focus of several scenes that detract from why the show begins so strongly.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts to fall apart a bit towards the end when it becomes focused on slow monologues to droll out plot explanatons rather than creating unique thrilling scenarios like the Selecao competitions where the characters had to continously one-up each other in amusing ways. Again, I'm prevented from going into detail but i found the explanation of Takizawa's past and the reason for the game to be very flimsy and in need of more detail to justify why everything was done in the overly-contrived way it was, and again this shifting of dramatic tone doesn't go well with the inherent absurdity of it all (including the characters' response). The theme about the obligation of the privileged was a promising one that could've given the series some much needed greater meaning and weight, but for once this part of the plot is tossed aside for the grand finale which doesn't even make sense. How was Takizawa's plan able to respond in the span of a few seconds, and why wasn't something so obvious done before with his nearly unlimited resources? Also, I'm fairly sure it's never a stated rule that Takizawa can't tell others about the game he's playing, and it's easily verifiable he's telling the truth simply by using his phone. If he did this it could've made room for more of the Selecao competition as it makes the Eden club members go from barely relevant to totally pointless and would make it easy to write out most, if not all, of their drab scenes. The series\u2019s shift from being a thriller that reveals its mysteries at the same time it heightens the tension to an investigation fronted by lame characters about something now obvious to us is its downfall.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East\u2019s best quality is a surprising one: its music. This is one of the most consistently quality scores I've heard in an anime and deserves as much as outside listening, and the opening theme of Oasis's Falling Down is great and will make you surprised at realizing Oasis had a secret best song no one talks about. The animation and art is very clear and nice, but the budget rarely has to be utilized much. The dub is also flawless, and I recommend it highly as the dialect flows far, far better than the subs paired with my release. Everyone's voice is how you'd imagine them to sound and I can't think of a reason not to go with the dub unless you're a purist.\\n\\n\r\nThough heavily misguided throughout its run, Eden of the East is an easy and enjoyable watch thanks to its short run and production, and it does just or more than enough to keep you guessing what the next episode has in store. It's just unfortunate that the many threads it lays down through the show lead to a fairly hollow finish that pronounces itself long before you even reach it. A fun series with some cool ideas, but none particularly substantial in any way through the final results.",

With this added length would allow more character and plot development and subsequently lead to an actual conclusion.\r\nOverall I feel empty after watching this anime because there were so many aspects, aside from the characters, like the selecao itself that could've been further developed.\r\nPerhaps my arguments are misplaced as I've yet to see the Movies/OVAsbut as a stand alone series it is incomplete and disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the plot the art style is unique but perhaps a little to minimalistic for my tastes.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nStorywise, EOTE does everything well. Right from the start, we were already sucked in into the world of EOTE by such a wonderful story plot. This was truly a unique plot and it stood out from the other spring animes. They created something that would definitely make us more interacted with the story \u2013 like for example, what would you do if you had a magic cell phone and you could do whatever you wanted? The creators explored and definitely created a great anime that truly took a somewhat romantic anime and put an extra twist in it.\r\nRating: 10/10\r\n\u201cDefinitely no complaints there. The story isdefinitely what made EOTE truly shine.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment:\\n\r\nWell from the start, I knew that they were going to be lots of characters introduced throughout the show, but I didn\u2019t know there would be this much! They sure took their time introducing the other characters to the show, even introducing 3 new characters at the second to last episode! It was good that they didn\u2019t rush through everything, and I\u2019m glad that it will continue over with 2 additional movies planned to air later in the year. The characters for me definitely were explored through very well and were well developed. Hopefully, the other minor characters will be explored more through the next two movies as I am eager to know more about them =]. The story also developed well throughout the show and it was good to know it wasn\u2019t really rushed.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\r\n\u201cSolid, well developed characters that were nice to watch. I just wished more of the other minor characters were explored more.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation:\\n\r\nThe art of EOTE was definitely average. I thought (judging from the poster) that it was going to look very outdated and ugly, but it definitely caught me by surprise there. It also reminded me a bit of other Hayao Miyazaki works (mainly Spirited Away), I think it was the way Saki was designed. It wasn\u2019t a strong point (the artwork / character design) but I guess I have such high expectations in terms of art in an anime that for some, the artwork would be considered excellent. I love their animations though, very nice and smooth. Definitely gotta love their 3d cars XD.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7/10\\n\r\n\u201cSo-so character designs but pulled through with neat animation work.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI absolutely ADORED the opening song of EOTE. Especially the kickass animation they had in it. If you\u2019re not going to watch EOTE, then at least watch the opening. The ending was nice too, and neat animation as well for it. Throughout the show, I have no complaints with the BGM being played in the background. It was fitting to the show and that is what counts, well at least I that is what counts\u2026\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\r\n\u201cNice opening and ending song with some neat animations in both of them. Also, a nice score being played in the background which enhanced the show as a whole.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed watching EOTE, and was one of the only two (the other being K-On) which I truly watched and enjoyed during this season\u2019s lineup. Valkyria Chronicles was a close third though. Anyway, EOTE is something anyone would enjoy, and would keep you entertained and would keep you watching.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\r\n\u201cEnjoyed every episode of EOTE and was definitely entertaining.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 43/50\\n\r\n\u201cA nice engaging show that is something that should be watched by everyone. Nice and sweet characters as well as a great soundtrack make the show stand out even more. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I\u2019m sure all others have enjoyed it as well. If you haven\u2019t tried it, now is the perfect time to do so.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "If there was one word I could use to sum up my thoughts on the Eden of the east franchise, including the series and the films, it would be...\r\nOK.\r\nJust OK.\r\nNothing AMAZING or OUTSTANDING and I don't think it's 'TEH GREATEST ANIME EVAR ZOMG!!!', but for what it's worth, it's good and if you were to watch it you would have a reasonably enjoyable experience. Why do I think this? Well, that's what you're reading the review for isn't it?\r\nFirstly, the story starts off with an interesting premise having main character, Akira Takizawa, standing naked in front of the white house with a gun in onehand and a weird looking phone in the other. And the mystery just expands from there, to terrorist attacks, government conspiracies, secret organisations etc. The plot is very interesting but sometimes it is hard to grasp what's going on with all the political talks and government babble. Furthermore, there are just certain parts of the plot that do not make any sense at ALL, but we'll get to that later. Don't get me wrong, the plot gets very intense and investing at certain points, however I always felt that the stakes sometimes weren't high enough. What I mean by that is that something very nerve-racking could be happening but afterwards nothing really makes the situation more dire. I would go into more detail about this but I don't want to give away spoilers and anyone who's watched the show will probably get what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the characters. Ironically, I found the least interesting characters in the series to be the two main leads. Takizawa is the reckless airhead but has a plan and a good heart and Saki is the very normal girl thrown into these events because of Takizawa. They aren't bad characters, far from it, and their chemistry is very cute but I just find the side characters, specifically the workers for the Eden of the East company, to be much more interesting and fun to watch like Osugi (The one desperately pining for Saki) and Mi-tan (who's name is NOT Mi-tan!). All characters involved in the terrorist group are very interesting as well, though I wished some of them were given more back story.\\n\\n\r\nON THE OTHER HAND, there is one character in the show that I legitimately did not like throughout the series, and that is Juiz. Juiz is the voice embedded in Takizawa's phone that can pretty much do anything as long as it costs less than 10 billion Yen. The first obvious problem with her character here is the problem with any show that has a device that can theoretically do anything that the character wants; it completely shatters the tension of any situation as you know they can just use that device to get out of it. But I would be fine with that and just brush it aside if that was Juiz's only problem, but it's not. Sometimes, she states that doing certain(typically plot important) things are impossible as she cannot perform it under the money limit. Yet other times, she can do seemingly IMPOSSIBLE feats and they are completely within the price limit?! What kind of sh*t is that?! And to my knowledge, it is NEVER explained how she did these! If anyone knows the answer behind these then please let me know, because it just boggles my mind!\\n\\n\r\nDon't take this the wrong way, I'm not saying Juiz is a bad character personality wise, because she has a very memorable personality and gets a lot of funny lines and sarcastic remarks throughout the show. I'm just saying the way she is implemented into the story is honestly, really inconsistent and bad.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, enough Juiz ranting, let's talk about the presentation. The art in this show can look beautiful a lot of the time. The city backdrops, as well as the streets at night just look gorgeous. It's shows like these that seriously make me want to go to Tokyo. The characters are also animated very well, though very average looking and nothing really outstanding. Th soundtrack is also pretty meh. The first opening song as well as the ending song are great, but I cannot really remember any of the background music or any other tracks.\\n\r\nFinally, the dub is good. All the voices fit the characters well, but it isn't really anything too special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eden of the East, as I said at the start, is OK. It has a lot of problems, Juiz being the main one for me, but you will most likely enjoy it if you ever decide to watch it. Give it a shot and see if you end up enjoying it more than I did.",

I don't remember there ever being a moment where I became bored with this anime. Being a mystery type anime, it does a very good job in terms of suspense. With a surprise around every corner, you know just as much as the characters do. Thehumor is subtle as it should be, but makes for a good laugh.

I like the Armageddon-esque plots. They usually always make great shows. It makes you think. All in all, I loved this anime and can't wait until the movies come out. You won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "Story:\r\nI will admit the plot is a little confusing, especially for people who aren't watching it carefully, but the plot is incredibly cool, terrific, and exciting. There's a little bit of everything, but the whole Selecao idea is very confusing. I also had some very big questions that weren't answered in the end (I'm waiting to see if it'll be answered in the second King of Eden movie, coming out fall :P?). There was almost always something to keep me interested in, between the butt load of cash that Takizawa had, him losing his memory, the love story (that, I'll warn you, doesn't develop intoMUCH), and the mysteries of the Selecao and NEETs. There are a lot of factors that go into this series over such a short period of time. It's confusing but interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI LOVE Takizawa and his fluffy hair (I don't know why, but I always stare at character's hair/eyes). Takizawa is adorable. Saki on the other hand looks a little awkward and like a frog. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation has some unique points that catch me off guard. There's the occasional scribble bubble or w/e you call that (maybe there was just one, but it still stood out to me...). It was fluid for the most part, but nothing really outstanding.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI don't really pay attention to sound and nothing stood out to me (it rarely does). I wouldn't really take my word in this category, since I'm not really grading on anything. Check it out for yourself :P If you're like me, you won't notice XD \\n\\n\r\nAs for the op/end... \\n\r\nThe op was unique, but I remember skipping through it a lot. It wasn't terrible, and actually kinda interesting, but... yeah XD \\n\r\nWatching the ending is so cool! D: It's so unique and cool >W< but this is the sound category >_>... sorry. The ending is fun and better than most! I didn't skip through this one (except when I really wanted to watch the next ep). But if you wanna make your own decisions, go to youtube and find it out for yourself XD\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI love Takizawa ._. He may not be realistic, but he's very unique. Somehow he manages to be a BA and an EXTREMELY nice person at the same time. His personality is something I ALWAYS have to hang off of. I'm always curious at what he wants to do or plans to do, and he does the most extremely bizarre things. I swear, watch this series just to watch him almost kill himself or wake up in D.C. naked :D *this isn't a spoiler, it's in the bio* (Also, if you're like me and watch series mostly for the characters, trust me, you'll love him). \\n\\n\r\nSaki is really dull to me. She's extremely kind, but also naive and just boring a lot of the time. She does surprise you every now and then, but mostly she's the typical shy Japanese girl. But Takizawa's awesomeness makes up for it. They get about equal screen time. \\n\\n\r\nSaki also has family/friends that help her and talk about this program called Eden. They're typical background, help the plot move along characters. There's one annoying guy who has a crush on Saki, and he's just stupid. You'll probably get annoyed with him a few times, but you'll get over it. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also a NEET I must mention. He's is probably the only fat anime character I will ever love. Itazu is a genius programmer and pretty funny at times, but he's a big fwuffy teddy bear ;-;\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis anime is one of my all time favorites (clearly since this is the first time I'm review something and maybe the last since these take so long D:). It's a must watch with a terrific balance of everything. The only issues I have with this anime are the unanswered questions (which I have yet to discover if they are answered in the movie continuation), and Saki's lack of personality. She shouldn't bother you too much, though, if you're an otaku because most girls are like that, huh? But please, I beg you to try on this series. There are a lot of epic ideas to the series, and it's terrific and working at making big things even bigger. \\n\\n\r\nWatch and noblesse oblige :3",

            "content": "Eden of the East is centered around a man in his early twenties named Akira Takizawa. He has lost his memories and the first thing he does in this sudden state of amnesia is prance around the grounds of the White House naked while holding a gun. During this prance, though, he meets Saki Morimi, the random Japanese girl who randomly is at the White House when the random naked Japanese guy is running around randomly. Well, these two wind up in a silly situation where they are running from the police in what can only be described as some form of a Jason Bournehomage. From there the duo go to Japan where Akira wants to learn more about his past. What he does find out is that he is part of a huge conspiracy and may have been the guy behind a series of missile attacks on Japan.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is all fine and good, and this plot alone is decent, there is still more to dig into. My favorite part of the plot is the idea of giving twelve random strangers ten billion yen to change Japan. If they run out of money, they die. If they aren\u2019t doing anything to change Japan, then they die. It\u2019s a really cool idea that, in better hands, could have been a bit more effective.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I hated about the plot of Eden of the East was that it started off really good, but midway we are introduced to Eden of the East, a kind of computer recognition software, and from there things get really strange and seemingly inconsequential. This is especially prevalent during the few episodes concerning the \u201cJohnny Hunter\u201d, which were freaking hilarious for all the wrong reasons and could have been left out with the series having the same impact as a whole. At first I had no idea what a Johnny Hunter would be, because either I\u2019m really dense or that term is really outdated. Just say \u201cDick Hunter\u201d. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll offend anyone considering you have a whole plot concerning a woman who garrotes male genitalia if they can\u2019t perform in bed.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys of the series seem to only be there to explain things. There is never a bad guy who is bad, there is just a bad guy who knows more than anybody else seems to. It\u2019s like taking a James Bond villain, cutting out all the parts that make said villain evil, and just leaving the part where he explains his ingenious plot to take over the world. It doesn\u2019t really make you root for one side or the other, in fact you don\u2019t really root for anyone here. The plot moves so fast and the explanations are so quick, you can\u2019t keep up and you can\u2019t really root for anyone because by the time the series is over you\u2019re still mulling over the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad. I quite enjoyed the plot but the pacing was bad. There\u2019s that middle stretch that doesn\u2019t seem to be there for any reason, it\u2019s not bad, but it breaks up the pace of the series and could have been used to elongate explanations and do them in a much more exciting way perhaps than standing around for half an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is alright. Everything comes together and I do enjoy how it ended so large, but it just kind of ends. Typically after the big finale happens there\u2019s a bit of exposition on what happens to the characters and that final kiss that you expect, but Eden of the East forgoes that epilogue that so many series use because it is effective, and instead opts to cut to the credits and leave you wondering what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: And I need to point out that the oblivious people  walking around Tokyo during the finale who look up as if just noticing that fifty-nine missiles were blown up over the city, and have some sort of scared expression because the sixtieth is flying over, annoyed me. There are tiny things like this sprinkled throughout the series that take away from the authenticity.\\n\\n\r\nSo the plot has a cool premise that is executed somewhat mediocrely. That\u2019s about all I can say that sums that up.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation. I really feel like I\u2019m one of the few people who found it kind of okay. It had a certain style that I liked as far as the backdrops and scenery was concerned, but I found the characters to look strange. What I hate most is the fact that these characters that should be adults all look like teenage kids. As far as the characters are concerned I felt the animation dated, but I will say that overall, the animation is pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good as well. The opening is nice and the ending is meh. The American voice actors all perform decently, there was no outstanding or terrible performance to report.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to go into my usual long-winded diatribe about the characters because there\u2019s not a lot I can get into. Akira is a decent character with good motives but his personality is not that unique and really doesn\u2019t shine. His occasional wittiness is not as good as his seriousness. I preferred when he was talking business rather than talking about johnny\u2019s. And the female lead, Saki, is just kind of there for the ride. Kind of like Marie in The Bourne Identity (the book, not the movie). She\u2019s kind of useful, but overall not a really exciting character. The tease of a romance between the two is never fully realized, but does flesh out a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys are all, as I said before, dull and uninteresting. They\u2019re there to give us backstory, but not there to provide compelling villainy. Other than them, the guys at Eden of the East don\u2019t really compel. Overall, none of the characters you can really invest yourself in and none are that exciting.\\n\\n\r\nI sound like I\u2019m complaining a lot, and I truly have been, but I did enjoy Eden of the East. It is one of the few anime I\u2019ve watched in the past year that left me wanting to watch the next episode and marathon it as fast as I could because I enjoyed it so much. It was good, semi-mindless fun. The premise was cool, and the plot played out in a decent, albeit skewed, way. It was short and sweet. Fun and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot Eden of the East did right, but a few things it got wrong. Those wrong things do not totally detract from the experience, but do hurt it nonetheless.",

            "content": "Higashi no Eden, or Eden of the East if you watched it on netflix like I did, is a short anime that I was surprised I had never heard of. It has a really solid, entertaining plot for being short, but because it doesn't get around to explaining much unitil the end it was really underwhelming. the strangest part of the show is how lighthearted everything is despite the fact that it's about an international conspiracy (but that's not necessarily a bad thing). The plot gives you hints about Takizawa's past as it skips along, while also revealing elements of the game that is beingplayed by the Selecao. Granted I think it was pretty backwards that a government would set up this entire \"game\" just to prevent a missile attack, but the game playing out makes the show enjoyable to watch. As I said before the plot revolving around conspiracy is heavy stuff, and I thought it was really interesting how laid back it was (especially in the case of \"Careless\" Monday) and how little the characters seemed to care about horrifying terrorist threats. The characters are great and realistic; especially amnesiac Takizawa who is noble and tenacious but really laid back, and I personally didn't understand why he felt the need to keep wiping his memory. The other characters like Saki and her friends weren't nearly as enjoyable to watch because the plot focuses on Takizawa so much more, but they were realistically portrayed as really normal people blown about by all the crazy international stuff that goes on throughout the show. The art style feels a little different and I feel like throughout the show, the artists really nailed the modern urban style that the city and characters had. Overall the characters are good and the plot is fantastic, but everything just seemed to be a little too safe to me. I would have liked to see more from this show, but I think I just have to watch the Eden of the East movies for more. So overall I thought this was a really good plot based Jason Bourne type show, but it has an odd lighthearted nature to it that gives it a little extra magic. Except for Takizawa, the characters are a little bland for me and not a lot of character development happens, along with the fact that some stuff like the serial killer bird woman never get explained, but overall Eden of the East is a good and somewhat compelling show that I'd recommend to anyone who wants an average detective type plot in an anime.",

            "content": "Had a shock upon watching the first episode, glad that I stayed on.\r\nStory\r\nThe story kept me excited and wanting for more in each epsiode, especially after episode 3, if I remember correctly. The ending was expected but I preferred it though. The first part slowly covers the buildup of the romance between Takizawa and Saki and also, the start to find out more about this mysterious cellphone and his memories that he lost.\r\nArt\r\nI personally hated the artstyle of the censored parts but I don't blame them, they can't possibly show an uncensored version. But other than that, the artstyle is pretty good with detail, forinstance, the outlines of the missiles and etc. I like the artstyle of the characters as well. They are drawn pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nGot to hand it to the one who composed the OST, and some of it sounded very much like Kenji Kawai's works, with one I particularly liked was the intense mood background music during one of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I am not a fan of a characters but I wouldn't be too over for them though. I would have liked if they introduced the other Selecao but it would probably be too tight for the show's schedule considering that it only consists of 11 episodes. I haven't watched the upcoming movies so hopefully this changes. However, one thing I hate would be weak-minded one of the Selecao seemed to be. One last thing would be the utmost sadness I feel for the reason the protagonist lost his memories for. (Don't think I could say as this counts as spoilers, I believe.) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt's been a good experience so far but I feel there could be so much potential for this show, I especially liked the genre too. It combines a bit of romance, action and thriller together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it wasn't a bad show, there's one episode whereby they showed this \"illusion\" which I found it highly unbelieveable to pull it off but other than that, it's all good, looking forward to how they are going to do in the movies. Liked the music, especially the OST.",

            "content": "Production I.G. has a pedigree of action (Blood +), mystery (Ghost Hound), and suspense (Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C.). When the studio decided to go with an original show i.e. Eden of the East there was much speculation about how it was going to turn out. Would it be a slow paced disappointment like Ghost Hound or be a well written engaging success like SAC? Eden of the East was directed and created by Kenji Kamiyama, whom is the same person behind SAC. Good sign number one. The second good sign was the character art was created by Chika Umino, the same person behind Honeyand Clover. A final third thumbs up was basically the main staff behind Production I.G. popular well animated shows were involved in this short 11 episode series and 2 sequel movies to finish the story. This does cover the series and both movies.\\n\\n\r\nOur story follows Morimi Saki whom just graduated takes a trip to the White House in which she encounters a young naked man wielding a gun. This guy is named Takizawa Akira and of course he has amnesia somehow. Trouble ensues as it would, but the only key to the mystery behind Takizawa is his strange mobile phone that has a vast amount of funds and somehow relates to a recent terrorist attack in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story slowly unravels and Saki just cannot help being drawn towards the world in which Takizawa lives in. Takizawa has somehow found himself wrapped up in a game to change the world or your death. There are countless strange encounters with other players to this game, and the themes this show plays on correlates well between society, technology, and politics.\\n\\n\r\nEach character within the show is incredibly unique. Their personalities together with the story produces a very engaging and unique mystery that this genre in anime does not get enough of, or done well. Each evolutionary moment in the story blends well into developing each main character. Music and colorful backgrounds fit into each segment of story. The narrative is consistently developing as it should to a proper climax making the viewer constantly pay attention and absorb all of the information coming across the screen. It maintains a good separation of action and comedy to not detract from keeping the mysterious atmosphere and suspense. This all creates a satisfying plot, twists never seem out of place to why the show is enjoyable, and best of all are the themes discussed are relevant to the real world and the world in which the characters live in.\\n\\n\r\nWhere does the show fall a bit short? People could be put off by such a deep narrative. There are a few questions left unanswered, and if it was not for the movies it would have been extremely sad to end it where the series did. The romance element in the story was front and center, but seriously lacked any commitment the way it was presented. There are some points where the show (second half) and movies halt and stall enough of the pace to notice.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East is a rich experience for those whom are fans of mysteries. With elements of all kinds of genres blended in, there is something here for everybody. The anime makes sure it has its own identity to separate it well from other shows out there. There is no shortage of praise for this show, and the shortcomings are picking at straws. This is a must watch show through and through.",

            "content": "For the first few episodes, East of Eden seemed like my new favorite anime. The animation was beautiful and smooth, the mystery plot was intriguing, and the ED was by School Food Punishment, a band I fondly remember listening to years ago. What makes EoE stand out from the get-go, however, is the positive vibe the atmosphere and characters possess. Many mystery and crime shows tap into themes of corruption, bureaucracy, and so on, and EoE does not shy away from pointing out these problems either; In fact, this is what the entire setting of the story is about. But instead of edgy, nihilistic detectivesand bloody, gut-wrenching expos\u00e9s on the \u201cinherent darkness of mankind\u201d that are all too common in the genre, EoE delivers its ideas in an optimistic light. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are full of life and charm, nuanced yet instantly likable, and the art style gives them exaggerated expressions and movements that resemble a moe show more than a mystery one. While the themes of the show cast a bleak look on society, and the story dips into cold-blooded murder and crime, East of Eden carefully restrains itself from becoming overtly dramatic or dark, and instead counter-balances the criticism with humor and optimistic heroism from the main leads. East of Eden's approach to the ills of society is refreshing in a genre mired by heavy-handed gore and pretentious treatises on human nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the show is revealed almost halfway into the first season, where the story inexplicably decides to continue focusing on the initial premise, the missiles and the MC's memory loss, a move that marks the beginning of the show's collapse. The larger setting of the story is ignored for the less-interesting missile mystery, offering only small glimpses into the stories of the other characters (small, yet perhaps still the most interesting parts of the show later on). The critique of society, which the show focuses on so much at the start, is nowhere to be found; never are the high ideals and optimistic worldviews of the leads reinforced upon later on (their personalities fall apart along with the plot). The rushed reveals of the last few episodes are ultimately underwhelming and littered with plot holes, frustratingly contrasting with the tension and excitement the first half of the show painstakingly builds up. \\n\\n\r\nI use the word frustratingly because this show was so close to becoming one of my all time favorites. And yet, a refusal to develop the themes further and deliver a solid story drops East of Eden all the way down to a 6 for me. I was at the edge of my seat for the first few episodes. But by the end, I was frustrated, disappointed, and sad at what it could have been.\\n\\n\r\n(first time reviewing please no bully)",

Well that's the position certain group of people found themselves in.... They could be what ever they wanted. The story to me is just aboutwhat these set of people did as they came across that much money and power.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I give it 8.5 out of 10, the art was awesome.... It managed to bring out the mysterious feel the anime had to light, it wasn't colourful and didn't stand out either. But all that plainness just added to the greatness of it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was blissful every scene was spectacular the soundtrack is one of the things that will make you stay with the anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime we're quite selfish everyone had their own interests in mind... Not that I blame them that's probably what I'll do I I have that kind of money. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about how much I enjoyed watching it but I have this much....

The anime shows how a person can change just by loosing his memories, how he can be lost and what he would do to get his memories back. Also it shows some really interesting things like \"what would you do if you could do anything you want?\" would you save the world, destroy it or probably let itbe just like it is. It's strange how people can be different when you ask such questions, and you can see all that in this anime, that's why i recommend it highly to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is one part i didn't really like: the short amount of time you have to learn and understand the characters you just saw, because there are so many of them and you have to realize what they are thinking, and that wasn't really easy to do in just 11 episodes. But on the other side, that made it even more interesting, it was like seeing small plot twists every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnimations: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnime aired 6 years ago, but the animations are quite interesting and well made, there are characters who look a bit strange but i think that was to characterize the character itself, it was kinda needed to draw them like that. For the surroundings and colors, really fine made, can't complain much.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme: I haven't heard a English opening for so long and when i listened to it i didn't liked it at first, but after hearing it a few times i realized how it fits with the anime, that calm sound and lyrics, they DID choose a good opening for the series.\\n\r\nEnding theme: I like the ending theme even more, it was such a nice one and it ended every episode in such a nice way that it made me love the ending \\n\r\nFor the background music, i have to say that i didn't really paid attention to it, co i could say that it wasn't anything special, but also not bad, cause then i would realize it for sure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nClosing words:\\n\\n\r\nEven if the anime is really short, and you are probably thinking there is no way they could put up a good story in such short time, try watching it and you will realize that you were wrong.\\n\r\nAlso, there are 2 movies of this anime i have to watch, it's a direct sequel to the story.",

I am so glad that i did watch it. \r\nThe story of this show, to me seemed like the Borne movie series (if u ha.ven't seen them they are great). they both seem to have the same plot of the main character getting their memories erased and slowly regain them.

I personally do not like the art, but thats just me. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds and music of the show both seem fitting for the show.

Im suprised that they didnt do much with the girl during the middle part of the show though...\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show so overall i gave this show a 8 because it was good but not that good.

They touch on supernatural once with one character, which honestly has no bearing on the outcome, but showcases the differences and how chance seems to have played in the plot.  \r\nLoved it through and through. Once I found the bluray, I got it.\r\nThe two main characters and the sudden support team seemingly made ready by the main characters friends in Japan seems well thought out.  The tech is still very possible and surprised it has not happened yet.\r\nApparently I have to write a longer review so blah blahblah blah go watch it.",

Higashi no Eden managed to perfectly pull this nicely\r\nSo, the story starts with a pretty great plothole here and there since the MC is amnesiac and can't remember the last thing he did. There's also a nice backstory about a failed attempt of missile strike at Japan 3 months prior to the start of the series. As you progress, this two concept will be intertwined and makes a very interesting story.\r\nThere's also a bit of romance here but, it does not really take the highlightsince this is a mystery based anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are good. Some of you who familiar with seiyuu may recognize a famous name on the payroll. The OP also fit the scene and the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, they leave many things unanswered for now but the movie gonna cover it up. Oh... The character here isn't flat or one-dimensional. You get to sympathize with them and maybe understand their reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this very much and I'd like to say \"Great work, Production I.G\"",

That's really my only problem with the show, they present you with so many characters and you never really get to know any of them, so when the series ended, I was left with this sort of incomplete feeling, like this world was not fully explored.",

One has to watch the movies too, and after seeing the anime I am not really inclined to spending another couple of hours watching them. To me it looks like the producers weren't completely sure about what to produce: The style jumps back and forth between slapstick humor and strong violence (lots people being killed and getting their \"johnnies\" chopped off), always avoiding to settle for the one or the other. Too much time is\"wasted\" on a couple of characters which do not really contribute much to the story, like Saki and her friends. To be honest: I hated Saki from the beginning. She is a textbook example for the pathetic, self-centered, useless female character so many anime creators seem to think they have to include.\\n\\n\r\nBack in 2009 people probably didn't have much choice, but nowadays i would suggest to skip Eden of the East for Mirai Nikki or Steins;Gate. If you have seen Yuno in action, you won't shed a tear for Saki.",

            "content": "Eden of The East has a very strange concept behind this and somewhat is a bit controversial or bring some topical allusions to it. From Production I.G., who brought us The Ghost in The Shell franchise, Blood: The Last Vampire, Blood+, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade & the anime sequence in Kill Bill, Vol. 1. And this series is directed by Kenji Kamiyama, who also directed the GITS TV Series.\r\n11/22/10, ten missiles strike uninhabited areas of Japan, but on the bright side, no victims were harmed and it was named Careless Monday and no one really cared about that. This situation still does occur throughout theshow.\\n\\n\r\nMeet Saki Morimi, a young Japanese woman visiting Washington D.C. on a trip and then she meets an mysterious Japanese man, whose introduction is mostly him being naked carrying a gun and a cell phone with the amount of \u00a58.2 billion in digital money but apparently you know waving a gun on the nation\u2019s capital isn\u2019t a grand idea. The guy goes by Akira (not that one) Takizawa and he is part of some game where it consists of a Sele\u00e7\u00e3o of 12 individuals that are given \u00a510 billion to save Japan in some way with help from the phone operator named Juiz to fulfill any order for a price but used the money for your own selfish needs, you are instantly eliminated.\\n\\n\r\nBut I bet you wonder this: \u201cWho the hell are the Eden of The East?\u201d Good question.\\n\\n\r\nThe name comes from the name of a cell phone application developed by Saki\u2019s friends, which is mostly a much-improved version of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube mashed in together. The members include: Satoshi \u014csugi, Saki\u2019s friend who does, in fact, has a crush on Saki but when she neglects him for Akira, the typical love triangle or something like that happens; Kazuomi Hirasawa, the de facto leader who wants to create a NEET Paradise; Mikuru Katsuhara, or Micchan, the talented yet shy and frank (also a character I can relate to\u2026.a little and cute, too) programmer who programmed the image recognition system and Yutaka Itazu, a prodigal reclusive hacker whose nickname is \u201cPanties\u201d because he lost his pants and never went outside again.\\n\\n\r\nThere is another character Kuroha Diana Shiratori, who is a president of a model agency by day and a mysterious serial killer who kill men by cutting off their penises and yes, that does sound like it hurt like hell but she only kills rapists so if you\u2019re respectful to women, you are safe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This is an so-so and mostly innovative show but kind of hard to understand when watching it for the first time, much like Ghost in The Shell, both the movies and the series. The main characters are decent but the supporting characters did a top-notch job.  Both the animation is really superb and vivid. The themes of this show are slightly controversial but it is mostly done in a subtle way and the music is acceptable, although I wonder why that one theme song in the 1st episode by Oasis was used only once but used another one for the reminder. But I am not done with this franchise yet\u2026\u2026.there is still 2 more entries, but that\u2019s for another day. Now I bid you Noblesse Oblige.",

Some typical anime weirdness does intrude a bit here and there, and the series ends very abruptly, leaving many plot points unresolved--though there are two movie sequels that right this flaw, albeit in a pretty unsatisfactory way, in my opinion.

After seeing our second main character Saki, who decides to take he anger out on the white house by throwing a quarter he decides tohelp her by getting the attention on him. After this he's pretty much just trying to figure out who he is and what's happened in his past and what's going on with his weird phone. The story actually progresses very well being slow at times and pumping it up at others but it makes it all feel very smooth. The story for some reason actually feels very American which I think it was going for since it even mentions the Borne films and Taxi, its very well done the way that American movie style and anime mix very well in the story. The one complaint I have is something I've been seeing a bit lately, its that as someone watching you figure certain things out and then you're looking at the character and you're like 'why haven't you figured this out yet you have almost the exact same info as me?' As an anime that's trying to be hidden in mystery you figure certain things out pretty fast if you just pay attention and in the end its really rewarding but you kinda want to scream at the characters a bit.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nThe art for Eden is amazing I absolutely love it the characters and environments all look amazing. The one thing that I think looks really awesome is the phones their all very interestingly drawn or rendered well since at time they look kind of seem to be 3D.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nThe sound for the anime is Very good both the opening and closing themes are pretty good and sound design for everything is solid. I watched this English dub and I must say this was a very well,  I absolutly love the voice of Juis and think it is absolutely perfect. Everyone else in the cast does a very good job at bringing out their character at no point did I feel like a voice didn't fit who it was assigned.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8:\\n\r\nThe characters in Eden are all absolutely awesome, I love every single one from the main two characters to the side characters everyone seems really defined in who they were. One thing that was really good was that they all compliment each other in some way or another, but pretty much I like each and every character that's shown here in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\r\nFor me personally I enjoyed everything about this from slowly finding things out about Takizawa and his past, to seeing what Saki and her friends phone app was, to seeing how much power some of these people really have, to even the little sweet moments between Takizawa and Saki that are had.\\n\\n\r\nEden of the East is a very good anime with a bit of mystery that's very satisfying as things become uncovered. The only thing is that to finish the series you have two movies to pick up after but I loved watching this series.",

            "content": "The anime had very good potential, but for me it didn\u2019t really live up to it. The story started off very intriguing - a naked guy who\u2019s supposedly a terrorist has lost all his memory. Oh yeah, I don\u2019t think we ever found out why he was in that situation in the first place...which leads me to point out that there were many unanswered questions left in the anime. How exactly does Juiz work? What was with those white zombie johnnys? Were those just figments of his imagination? What was up with the other Selecaos? Who exactly was the Supporter? How did Selecaos get selectedin the first place? Plot flaws aside, the characters were very weak as well. Pretty much every single character was plain and stereotypical, besides Akira. But even he wasn\u2019t all that great as he went through no development at all (just like all the other characters) Akira - This character was honestly only mediocre at best. Had a really interesting entrance at the beginning, but ultimately he turned out to be \u201cthe charming boy with a dark background\u201d. Saki - Typical teenage girl that falls in love with the \u201cbad boy\u201d. Osugi - The desperate boy that gets friendzoned. Itazu - Stereotypical NEET. Obese, shut in, 1337 hax0r that can somehow crack down a highly confidential system in a matter of minutes\\n\r\nSo yeah, unfortunately I don\u2019t really have the interest left to watch the movies. This anime was quite disappointing for me. Might only be because one of my friends hyped it up like crazy. But still, there were too many flaws for me to enjoy it all that much.",

The anime gets tied in with 2 movies because of the suspense that is created and it's just asking for more!",

            "content": "My appraisal:\r\nFrom also taking into account the two films (they are not proper entities through directly following on from the last episode and hence shouldn\u2019t be treated as such) it can conclusively be said that the crew have proved themselves as highly proficient in making an otherwise well-rounded piece but that such an ambitiously grand-scale concept was still beyond their full grasp.\r\nThe premise had the possibility to become an engagingly hypothetical- and profoundly relevant during its initial airing- look at how the infrastructure of society can be subtly manipulated and improved upon but it is largely squandered in the fleshing out of the story thatis too insistent on bringing in action sequences. With being nonsensically forced into a life-or-death game (it does appear logical but is actually rather ill-conceived and counterproductive) the characters who are given a reasonable opportunity to put their ideas to fruition often don\u2019t take it to heart through instead resorting to extremism (in the loosest sense) and spitefully playing cat-and-mouse. There are glimpses of innovative ideologies with far-reaching consequences but ultimately this production is content in remaining as an effective outlet for the grievances of those feeling suppressed in a saturated society and the committee would be wise to reboot this and realize its true potential.",

            "content": "Eden of the East sucks. Now, don't get me wrong, there's definitely some clever ideas scattered throughout this anime, but as an anime it's all over the place. The premise, 12 individuals receive special phones, access to a huge sum of money, and the task of \"saving Japan\" is definitely interesting, as the vague goal allows for different people to reach different conclusions on what \"saving Japan\" means. The main character (Takizawa)  is savior number 9, but he suffers from amnesia, which he quickly discovers is a result from his own decision to erase his memories. This to is a clever way to drawin the audience as we follow his quest to solve the mystery of who he is \"Jason Bourne\" style. Sadly, it's all downhill from there, which is extremely disappointing to me, because a good friend recommended highly this anime to me as one of the best he'd ever seen, and at first I was really interested to see where they would go with it. Well, by the time the story introduces a character called \"the johnny hunter,\" a psycho bitch who literally abducts men and cuts their genitals off (no, I'm not kidding), I realized the true nature of this god awful anime. It takes a special kind of stupid to think up a character and story arc as unpleasant and ridiculous as this one and attempt to pass it off as a serious development. This isn't mere fan service (sure the woman walks around in her underwear, because why not, right?) or just quirky bizarre anime humor, this is a genuinely revolting amount of excess. Try to imagine the situation reversed: a man abducts little girls and tortures them to death by mutilating their sexual organs. THAT is sick. And this is equally sick. This anime makes me sick. It's one of the biggest missed opportunities I've ever seen. We've seen so many fantastic anime that push the boundaries of what anime can be, and this one had the potential to go the distance, but boy oh boy did it fail spectacularly at that. What a waste of my time.",

Even though one would expect an 11 episode series to feel fast.\r\n\tThe story is intresting but not touched upon enough. There is so many pauses in the series just talking about a character's morals instead of actual story. The characters basically are just written as big sacks of morals and nothing else. most of the characters just seem so robotic and just desighned to think a certain way about a subject, but have no personality at all. This is not true about the main character. He is actually well defined and feels human.Even though I would consider him above average intelligence, I would not say he is a genius. most of his tricks he tries to get him out of trouble a moreso crazy, than smart. But they are crazy enough to work. He is great to watch and somewhat salvages the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for locations is top notch however character designs range from mediocre to repulsive. Mainly the facial expressions can be repulsive.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isnt very memorable. Dont expect anything good or bad from this.\\n\\n\r\nMy reccommendation for this is very low. 11 eposodes isnt to big of a waste of your life if you dont enjoy it.",
