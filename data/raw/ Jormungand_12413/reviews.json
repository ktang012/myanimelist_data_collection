            "content": "First off, for a \"gun\" anime, its knowledge of firearms and firearms users is incredibly poor. Sure, it names off things, but for the most part, *real gun users use nicknames in combat*. It makes for incredibly clunky dialogue, where they shout out \"He's got a Negev LMG\" or \"Mi 24 Hind D\" said out in full. They'd say, \"Hind, take cover!\" or \"Target, machine gunner, 9 o'clock\". There's no addressing the amount of bullets one can carry (in episode four the bad guy guns down an entire opera house with what looks like one nutsack, and that does not hold enough to gun downas many people as shown with one shot-one kill, let alone firing like a moron), there's no tactics, people take stupid shots (god knows how many times they shoot at held guns, a stupid shot to take under almost any circumstance), and nothing in it gives the idea that the people who made the show or manga have any knowledge of guns beyond their statistics. \\n\\n\r\nIf you think that's semantics, it's because good gunplay (if it was there) would be the only saving grace, seeing as the writing is atrocious. The females are otaku-bait, everyone's a philosopher (and a bad one at that), talking is always a free action in supposedly high-pitched gunfights, the three storylines shown thus far are worse than Black Lagoon at its most ridiculous, and it just has nothing going for it.\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, I wanted to like this show. I wanted a good gun show to come out. But this is far from it. Hell, High School of the Dead was better about its guns. And when you lose to HSotD at anything other than pantyshot counts and size of boobs, you know you aren't doing well.",

            "content": "\u201cYour new recruit is a child soldier? And he's got iron, shit.\u201d\r\nThere is much to talk about guns, wars, arm dealers, and child soldiers these days. For those who are into the fast action type, the type of series involving a kickass music, or a type of series involving a main protagonist being loco, or blood being splattered all over the screen, then this series is definitely something to keep an eye on.\r\nAccording to Norse Mythology, J\u00f6rmungandr (or more often known as Jormungand) is known as the Midgard Serpent or the World Serpent. And like a serpent, the main character is cunning as expected ofan arms dealer. For without intelligence and leadership, the crew would not be what they've become of today.\\n\\n\r\nJormungand is based off the manga of the same name starring Koko Hekmatyar, a young arms dealer who sells weapons under HCLI, a weapons corporation. She is badass, she is independent, she is cunning, she is fun, and she is of course loco. With her is the child soldier, sidekick, bodyguard, and brother all the same time named Jonah (Jonathan Mar). He is of the West Asian origin and after being orphaned swears to get vengeance. Yet the same time, with his acquittance of Koko and the crew, his sentiment seems to have cooled down and even has a warmer side to him that some of us may see as cute or peculiar.  \\n\\n\r\n[ - Story - ]\\n\r\nTo be honest, this is the type of show that can make any fan of action genre glued to the screen with its blood packed spilling, rapid violence, and gun dominance at first glance. The first episodes kicks off already with some full throttle road war and those bullets fly across all over the screen. It wastes little time in conveying the hazardous occupation and brutality of being an arms dealer. At the same time, it also finds ways to make the series relaxing through some heartwarming moments and comedic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the modern eras so if you're looking for mecha action, futuristic weaponry, or of the historical theme, then you're looking at the wrong place. Fear not though as the story is easy to understand and not one of those mindfucks that leaves the viewers going \u201cHUH?\u201d Speaking of stories, Jormungand has a smooth pace focusing on the crew's teamwork and abilities to accomplish tasks. Each arc focuses on professionalism and it's up to Koko and her crew to work together in the end to deliver the result. Although somewhat one-sided and predictable, the story is still smooth and to the adult-oriented audience, can be appealing.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Characters - ]\\n\r\nOne of the aspect that engineers this series is the colorful cast of characters. Koko Hekmatyar assumes the role of the female protagonist who is amusing, entertaining, and dramatic to watch. Despite the real dangers of her occupation, she makes fun out of most it and can literally be seen as a troll at occasions. Her character brightens up the gloom and doom of the crew and gives her job a new light that some future arm dealers may find appealing or maybe strange. On the other hand, there is Jonah, the child recruit soldier. Like the opposite side of a coin, he has a more stoic mind and says things that can sometimes be interpreted blunt, sarcastic, or too brutally honest. Yet he is an interesting character if we look at him more carefully for his ability to balance out the seriousness and fun mood of the story and her crew.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the crew, there are some of other prominent characters to look at. One of them is the one eyed ripped girl, Valmet. Her priceless expressions throughout the episodes towards Koko are those of a puppy like crush and silly to watch. Yet behind that eye lies a dark past, one which changed her life forever and made her the person that she is today. There are some others worth to mention namely Lehm that resumes the second in command of the crew, Kasper Hekmatyar (Koko's elder brother), and Chinatsu from one of the earlier episodes. While all of them have contrasting personalities, it is easy to see that they share the theme of having a dark past whether playing the role of the good or bad player. \\n\\n\r\nIt is because of these themes and histories, the crew and the characters of this series are quite unique in its aspects.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Animation/Art - ]\\n\r\nLike Steins; Gate, Jormungand is handled by White Fox. They are a relatively new anime studio who are more into the traditional background. At first glance, that's nothing worth to talk about. Yet, if we look carefully, we can clearly see that the studio creates the realism of the the story and into its characters. The weapons, the military backgrounds, the settings, the outfits, the visuals. It retains its ability to create the atmosphere. Koko's mischievous expressions on her loco face shows it all through the lashes and those slippery grins like a serpentine. That can also be said to the same for her bodyguard, sidekick, and friend, Jonah.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also tries to bring out humor through some of the more comic scenes with the black ringed eyes in the form of priceless expressions. While not too appealing, it brings out the comedy side of the series and shows that while the job of being an arm dealer is dangerous, it can also be fun and to make most of it.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Sound - ]\\n\r\nI'll say this once and once only. The music and soundtrack of this series is pure epic. The music director behind the scene (Taku Iwasaki) puts the e into epic for its beats and techno trance like music that will make you wish you're part of the series. (unless you fear of getting shot that is) \\n\\n\r\nThe OP song, \u201cBorderland\u201d sung by Mami Kawada is also quite catchy. Known for her work from the popular Shana franchise and the Toaru Majutsu no Index series, she brings her latest work to life through this song. All in all for nothing else of a reason to watch this show, the soundtrack of the series is one of them\\n\\n\r\n[ - Enjoyment - ]\\n\r\nLike I said before, this series is packed with nonstop action in rapid sequences. There's not much romance to expect out of this show but who cares when we have Koko and her alpha crew? There's also some little fan-service here and there with the ripped Valmet, the mass volumes of blood spilled on an episode basis, and of course, those kickass music that can get you start watching the show in a heartbeat. The action does occasionally get repetitive and the gore seems to be almost forced on. But if we look carefully, the series also has the more emotionally side to it (especially involving Valmet) in some of the later battles. To combine action and emotion, that is enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the praise, this series does have flaws. After all, without flaws, this show would be in MAL's top 100 by now. Yet, it's not. That's because it does have flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems I'd say would be the forced action that is a bit driven too much and lack of more character development. For example, I'd love to see some more history background besides Valmet, Koko, and Jonah. Maybe that guy with the sniper that has the eye of a hawk, or maybe Schokolade, the blonde informant that has a peculiar and joyful personality. Additionally, the character designs of the show are a bit blend and seems somewhat dirty. After watching Koko and her crew grin on a daily basis, in the OP, on missions, etc, it gets repetitive. But even with these flaws, this series is enjoyable, at least in the action and  seinen department. But even if you don't meet the age demographic, this show can be watched for some guilty pleasure involving Koko's alpha crew and their exchanges. It's fun, it's bloody, it's entertainment, and it's in your face. All in all, this series is great to watch in the middle of the week especially after a busy week of school or work even with all the violence.\\n\\n\r\nJust remember though in real life that violence is not the answer to everything, well except in Jormungand. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cPeople who kill too much turn into dragons one day. Beasts that rule the land atop piles of money and fly the skies on wings of authority. They become more and more violent until they can no longer understand the language of men. We cannot allow dragons to remain in this world, even though we are the ones from which they are spawned.\u201d\r\nKoko Hekmatyar is an unique person, one of those people who keep equlibrium in the world, setting the delicate balance between right or wrong. As a guns merchant she encounters many chaotic situations where the line between right or wrong is easily crossed,however that\u00a0doesn't stop her, as she stands collected in the face of perils. As every person working in this line of business, she gathers a team of people who subordinate to her. As you might have guessed, they are not ordinary people, but experienced soldiers who came alive from the pits of hell. They choose to follow the bright light that Koko emits, being attracted by her charm and wisdom, talents which make her a natural leader.\\n\\n\r\nAs her new subordinate, she recruits Jonah, a boy who fought as a child soldier in the Middle East. Jonah meets her team and is taken by surprise by all the new information he finds out about the world outside the war zone, since he only knew who to shoot a gun and fight. Koko gives Jonah a chance to be free and discover the world in his travels. However, Koko doesn't babysitt him, making him a new addition to her team, and giving him the role of protecting her in her gun transactions with people of the underworld.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the journey of Koko and her team to various countries and continents where Koko sells different guns and war machinery. As expected, the transactions don't always go so well, thus making Koko's team enagage in badass combat to protect her when the situation gets out of hand. It does remind of Black Lagoon, but this show stands on its own, the story being engaging and interesting enough to set itself apart. However, it does have flaws, the story not being coherent at times in the transition between episodes as well as having some characters's backgrounds unexplained.\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is appealing, especially the designs of Jonah and Koko. The animation is constantly good, and the fighting scenes are engaging and highly-elaborated. I find the guns designs pretty imaginative as well as the various combat styles.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is really stunning, from the up-beat rap music to the classic music played in the background and the music in various languages that suits the multi-cutural backgrounds of the characters. One of my favorites songs from this anime is in portuguese,  its beauty touching the strings of your heart.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nAt first Jonah clearly states that even if he's talented with shooting guns and killing people with them, he hates guns and those who sell them. However, he soon discovers that Koko is not your usual cold-hearted, insensitive gun merchant, but follows her own code of morals, even if it at times ambiguous. For example, she doesn't accept payment in drugs, and it's been shown that she admires determination and bravery even in her enemies. The way she chose her followers is the best example. For instance, her bodyguard and driver, Ugo, was a member of the mafia when Koko ordered for them to be killed when they wanted to pay her in drugs, leaving Ugo the only survivor. When asked why did she leave Ugo alive, she replyed that she liked the fact that Ugo looked away in disapproval when the mafia showed the drugs.\\n\\n\r\nKoko is a force of nature, one of those rare people who can become anything they put in mind to be, however, Koko instead chose to be part of the dangerous underworld. She was born at sea, thus not having a place where she belongs, but  because of that she feels unbounded, being able to feel freedom at another level. In norse mythology, Jormungand is called the \"World Serpent\" because he grew so large that he could surround the world and grasp its own tail. That may be a metaphor for Koko, who has the ability to feel free everywhere she goes  in the world, thus by following her, she gives other people  who strive for freedom, the chance of feeling eliberated.\\n\\n\r\nWe also meet her other subordinates which are people who survived wars and conflicts. There is Lehm, the always calm and collected veteran soldier and mercenary who is very compelling as a character. There is also Valmet, a skilled war combatant from Finland who still pursues revenge for her murdered comrades. As Koko once stated : \"She's her teacher, her friend and more than that\".Another member of Koko's team consists of Lutz, who serves at times the role of a comic relief, being shot in the ass several times, however showing superior skill as a sniper.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Jonah is very interesting to watch as he develops, at the beginning showing a strong loathe of guns and the criminal world, after joining Koko's team he finds that things aren't as black and white as he initially had thought, people like Mao, for example, who have a family and are good-natured individuals, but still have to kill  because of their job.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are problems with the characters as well. The portrayal of the characters as being the \u201cgood guys\u201d is highly unrealistic, because of the profession they have. Seeing a sympathetic law-breaker is acceptable in anime format, though. There are also interesting supporting characters but they aren't developed, which is quite a pity. I would also have liked to see more of Jonah's experiences as a child soldier and how they affected him. That would have been very interesting for me to watch, but unfortunately, it was totally discarded.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nI  enjoyed this anime, I recommend it to those who watched Black Lagoon as well as those who like action scenes and imaginative combat styles.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "This was probably one of the best shows that I have ever watched. This anime rocks to the very core!\r\nThe story was great. It shows the reality of what an arms dealer does. I have known some in real life. And they are indeed such kinds of persons who are in this anime. They hire people to defend them, they fuel wars, they compete with other dealers, they kill their enemies, they partner with those they can't handle and most of all they are good in economics (supply and demand lol). It was also somehow realistic in the sense that quantum computing could be dangerous.In fact, such kinds of technologies are existing right now but are currently suppressed or controlled by the governments. To wrap up, the story is outstanding as it never fails to show how reality looks in this kind of game(arms-dealing).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also good.. Not too showy unlike other military genres which have too much explosions and crap that hurts the eye.. The fight scenes are naturally shown and are quite enjoyable.. it's pretty much like how real gunfights look. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also very cool. Each member has different personalities that were nicely portrayed in the show. Not to mention that the show was also able to show most of the stories of each member (their pasts and their struggles). The anime never failed to describe each of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this one a 10. This is one of the best animes that I have ever watched and this is the very first time that I have given myself a chance to create a positive review here in MAL for this anime really deserved it.. :)",

            "content": "NOTE: Before i start my review, i'd like to say that the excellent Shane Smith from VICE has done a reportage from a major arms dealing convention. So if you want to see some Jormungand-style gunrunning in real time, then you can watch it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJct-kBqIKA\r\nMy understanding of arms dealers came after watching the excellent film \"Lord of War\". Nicolas Cage plays a Ukrainian-American arms dealer who sells guns like AK-47s, M-16s and a M-60 Machine gun to warlords and rebel groups. The movie is great as it portrays a balanced view of the arms dealer, and how inane our world is.\r\nArms dealing is rampantin this current age. With the Drug War across Latin America along with Middle Eastern revolutions and a Taliban insurgency in West Asia, the need for arms dealers is higher than ever, and these wars gave rise to people like Viktor Bout who sells AK-47s to dictators like Charles Taylor and Muammar Gaddafi. It is evil, manipulative and horrifying and his recent arrest became a morality tale about the nature of war and how people like Viktor Bout are making the world a worse place to live.\\n\\n\r\nJormungand came a few months after Lord of War, but it's also excellent. And the anime adaptation aired the same month Viktor Bout received 25 years of prison in the United States. So it's pretty co-incidental that both the manga and anime came at a time when stories of arms dealers reached the news.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a group of arms dealers led by a Genki girl named Koko Hekmatyar (Shizuka Itou). Her ragtag crew is like the A-Team of arms dealers, and their ways of running the business is as carefree as the Googleplex, but with more explosions.\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with Koko bringing a new member of the team: A former child soldier named Jonathan. He's about 10, hates guns but joins an arms dealing group to find the dealers who killed his parents. Koko, along with Jonah and her crew of badasses go around the world selling guns and partying. It's k-On! meets Lord of War and Micmacs, and that's the best summary of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, the animation's nice. Pretty sunny, but since it's by White Fox then the lens flare is expected. The character designs are done by by the key animator from Steins;Gate and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe direction is pretty good, especially when it's directed by the director of Katanagatari and School Days. Yeah, about that: Keitaru Motonaga should stick to directing for White Fox since all his other works are pretty bad. His career reminds me of Martin Campbell's career: a hit or two in a resume of crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe music's nice. The OP sounds like something from a Prodigy/Pendulum concert, and the ED is done by the excellent Nagi Yanagi. The entire score is done by Taku Iwasaki who remains great at what he does. His attention to surrounding and action makes him great, which is why he's the best action anime composer ever, since he does stuff like Gurren Lagann, Yakitate Japan and Ben-to.\\n\\n\r\nThe one flaw about this story is character development. So far, Koko, Jonathan and Koko's colleague Valmer (voiced by Sayaka Ohara) has given us a glimpse of what they are and recently we get to see Jonathan's backstory and Koko's brother. And that's about it. There is a backstory about the most recent villain group in the series, but that was not as exciting as it should be. I wanna see more of that Lehm guy (voiced by Unsho Ishizuka) and more of William Nelson (voiced by Kenji Nomura). The series could have been better if each episode revolves around two characters hanging out with each other, like Community. But we get to see more of others later in the series which helps improve character relationship. We also get to see interactions with people outside the arms bubble, like the \"Medicines Sans Frontieres\" guys later in the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Jormungand is a decent anime about arms dealer. It's not as great as Lord of War, but it's good for lots of action and a great staff which makes the series much more enjoyable.",

It is extremely action packed and the character looks interesting at first glance, but there is so many of them and they are all still so cryptic that it is hard to tell if they are not just generic characters in the end. I am not sure where this show will be going exactly, obviously action will take a major part of the show, but I have a feeling (mostly because this is a white fox production) that the character will turn out to be very likable and interesting in the end.\r\nI\u2019m more interested inlearning what is the deal with Jonah. That poor boy is very interesting, he doesn\u2019t like to talk, yet he asks many question, he doesn\u2019t like guns, yet he carries one around. The only time he laughed was when he was able to hold a plush in his hand for a minute. Otherwise he always kept the same Kristen Stewart facial expression for the whole episode. In term of characters, Jormungand already hooked me in. Also, I don\u2019t know if it is just me, but Jonah reminds me of Johan from Monster, mainly because they have the same letters in their name and both kids are messed up beyond any kind of redemption.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of the show that I absolutely loved were the soundtrack. The Opening and Ending are just awesome ! They made me think of Black Lagoon somehow in their style, most likely because both shows are of similar genre after all. Even after listening only once to those songs, I already want to listen to them on loop. I guess I\u2019m kind of a sucker for this kind of \u201cmusic\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019m not sure what to say about the action, the only thing I can clearly say is that some of the stuff they did in the show are simply physically impossible. No one can stand on top of a car that is driving at I don\u2019t know how many kilometers per hour, not unless you have nails under your boots, but even in that case it would have been impossible in that particular scene, since the van was bullet proof and the nails would have never taken grip in the first place. Also, while I\u2019m no explosive specialist, I am fairly confident that the shock wave from a grenade explosion is sufficient (at such close range) to active the detonator of an RPG, but maybe some gun maniac could prove me wrong on that one.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m willing to give this show a try, I have a feeling that the action might never buy me, but the characters already did and from past experience, white fox make great shows. I will look forward to blogging and watching this show, at least for the next couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPossibility of Watching: Likely",

            "content": "What in your mind if we're talking about a series that have gunfire packed with some stunning action? Maybe you would think a hollywood movies that usually have stunning action and amazing gunfire scenes like The Raid Redemption (2012) or maybe James Bond series , how about in anime? Dont worry we have like that too, its called Jormungand.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story in jormungand is about Jonah, a boy who fought in middle east as the child soldier is being recruited as Koko's companions. Koko itself is an arms dealer who travels all around the world for selling the guns. As the arms dealer, Koko must havemany obstacles like resistance from a group in the country or even a rival in dealing with arms. As her subordinate, Jonah and the companions must make sure Koko's safety in every transactions.  By reading the premise of the story maybe you can imagine. There will be many spectacular action and stunning visual gunfire which means you will being served by a full-pack of action. Well, its true.\\n\\n\r\nWhat make me love about this series was this anime wasnt always about gunfire or battle scenes. There was a time when this anime shows good jokes and some lighthearted story. Having a great action battle doesnt mean they forgot about the story, the story in this anime was well-made and not too hard to understand. Jormungand is really great at composing the story when times to jokes and when the times for serious. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, in Jormungand there was some moments when you have question in your mind  like \"what happen?\" or \"how could it happen? what the reason\"\\n\r\nbut eventually, it would happen if you werent focussed. But aside from it, Jormungand is pretty enjoyable action anime that will make you sitting down quietly on your chair.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was awesome, especially in the weapon details. They were specifically put extra details in the weapon that being used in this anime, like when there was a scenes with a weapon usually they make it really like a realistic weapon. Not just the weapon details, The background in this anime was really synch with the situation or the atmosphere, even the background seems so simple but it isnt decreasing the \"epic\" effect when there was a gunfire scenes. The simple background that White Fox usually does is being covered by how the gunfire scenes works. So people usually being sidetracked and focusess on the battle scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nYou wouldnt get spaced out if you're watching Jormungand, since when watching this anime you will feel like in the middle of battles. Gunfire and exploding sound will echoing your room and makes like you're in the middle of battleground. Not just the sound effect, the BGM which made by Yasunori Ebina (known for To Aru majutsu franchise)  is helpfully increasing the feel from \"war\" situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP of Jormungand, which is \"Borderland\" by Mami Kawada is pretty catchy. With some electro tunes and fast beat, this OP easily grasp my heart. This OP itself is quite match with Jormungand themes, which have a full-suspense action and fast battles. I cant help to not to rewind after hearing the OP, its really good and easy listening.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThis is maybe what make Jormungand shines the most. In this anime, you will find many interesting characters. Its not tsundere or dandere that you would find in any anime but its more into realistic terms. Like Jonah, our main character who is mostly quiet (because of the trauma) but at the same time pretty skillful in battle, Koko which is the \"boss\" in this anime, she is very charismatic and sometimes behave like a child but when comes to serious, she is can be very scary, and also there was Valmet, who is Ex-Major serving for UN forces in Africa, looks scary on the outside but can be pretty darling when it comes to Koko and there is still more, from a freaky one into a badass one. This anime full of interesting character that you wouldnt get bored from it.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nAbove all the appreciate that i gave in this anime, Jormungand is really deserve to have all the apreciation, Jormungand is really a great action one that rarely seen in another series. You have great story packed with amazing battle scenes, wonderful soundtrack that can hyping up the atmosphere, great backgrounds and loveable characters. What else did you need again? anyway, this anime is for those who loves action. FYI, i am not action fans but i started to getting addicted with action after watching jormungand. So, basically this anime is RECOMMENDED!",

            "content": "Of all the crap anime I\u2019ve seen over the past year or so, Jormungand is the one that never seems to leave my mind in regards to how bad it was, despite it ending more than six months ago. Every time I think of it, I go back to my MAL, decided I ranked it too high, and lower my score by one point whilst ignoring the fact that everyone else seems to think the anime was cool. For the love of me, I still don\u2019t get what people see in this show. Saying you like Jormungand is like saying you think the original Oneanime is the best thing to ever come out of Key. Newsflash people, \u201cnobody likes the One anime\u201d. Being one of three or four people who feels that way doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll admit, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been as opposed to most people in regards to anime opinions, nor have I had as hard a time finding something to praise, as I have with this crap.\\n\\n\r\nHow badly do I think of Jormungand you may ask? Well both seasons are currently ranked a \u201c1\u2033 on my MAL right now and unfortunately there\u2019s no way it can go any lower despite my best efforts to make it so, and I don\u2019t think there are any scores low enough for the show anyways. Or to put it in more concise terms, I would rather marathon everything by KyoAni and Shaft (good or bad) then have to sit through this shit show ever again!\\n\\n\r\nI am seriously confused in regards to what to recommend about this show in any way. Normally I don\u2019t mind recommending stuff like Eureka Seven or Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 despite the fact that I don\u2019t like them just because others may see differently. Hell, I\u2019ll even recommend Robotics;Notes or Psychic School Wars  if people want it so badly. But Jormungand is just plain useless without a single thing to recommend. What good thing am I supposed to say about this show?\\n\\n\r\nWell I guess there\u2019s the music. It\u2019s composed by Taku Iwasaki, who composed the soundtrack for Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure and Gurren Lagann as well as the currently airing Gatchaman Crowds, although I can\u2019t remember the BGM for that one. Can\u2019t remember what it was like for this anime either, but I remember it being okay aside from that \u201cher name is Koko\u201d crap. Needless to say, it\u2019s not his best work. And I guess if you want me to be really nice, it\u2019s cool to see Jormungand tackle a topic that isn\u2019t done by most anime. But just because something isn\u2019t in high school doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good, and it definitely doesn\u2019t help when Jormungand feels like it was created by hacks who\u2019ve never seen an action movie or read an action story in their life.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the arms dealing is vastly under researched and not realistic in the least. Episode 2 literally had Koko and her group going to an army camp and dealing the weapons out like they were street vendors or something. One of the big advantages that Jormungand has in tackling the arms dealing topic is that because it\u2019s not done very often, the average person wouldn\u2019t know that what Jormungand is showing you is a load of crap. I\u2019ve actually seen some people try and excuse this by telling me \u201cit\u2019s a fictional story\u201d, but I don\u2019t buy that. Now and Then, Here and There is a fictional story, but the guy who wrote it made sure that he accurately captured the torment and suffering that child soldiers go through in war, even if it got way too exploitative and manipulative for me to enjoy in the end. I also wouldn\u2019t call Black Lagoon realistic, as it skews more to the action movie agenda, but the weapons were all carefully researched (I\u2019m not sure about this, but from what I\u2019ve read, there are several gun facts stated in the show that are inaccurate) and any arms dealing that takes place in that show is done in semi-realistic professional manner rather than whatever goofy antics Koko cooks up that we\u2019re supposed to find endearing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads me to my next problem with Jormungand. So the arms dealing isn\u2019t realistic. An anime can still be fun despite that right? Well, maybe if the show didn\u2019t try to push it so hard and yet treat it like a total joke I could. The combination of anime cliches (sleepwalking, bad cooking, oh look at me I\u2019m so wacky) with the grittiness of the gun market is absolutely abysmal. First off, the premise of the show is that a kid who hates arms dealers somehow ends up working for one, and a teenage girl at that. And he never really questions his choices or anything like that. That is a goddamn stupid premise you\u2019ve got right there, but it might have been tolerable if the show didn\u2019t treat it like an absolute joke or if there was some solid writing and good characters, of which there are none. All of the characters are completely forgettable one-note jokes who are only important when the plot calls for, and then lose importance right afterwards with no real development whatsoever. It\u2019s basically the equivalent of what would happen if Angel Beats actually gave focus to TK or Shiina or any of those other joke characters: completely pointless and a waste of episodes whilst not progressing the story. Did you know that when that Red character got his own arc and died, I didn\u2019t know who the fuck he was? Hell, I know fans who didn\u2019t know who he was at first. That\u2019s a sign of good writing.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I can\u2019t remember a single antagonist in this series besides that one rival to Valmet. And I only remember her (and Valmet herself) because Valmet wore an eyepatch and was the only other female in the group, which is not a good sign. As for Jonah and Koko, all I have to say is laaaaammmmmeeee. I\u2019ve written before that Jonah never actually underwent any real growth along with why I felt that way, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that Koko didn\u2019t either. Nothing changed between the two and they weren\u2019t even all that interesting to begin with due to Jonah\u2019s repressed emotions and Koko\u2019s bad combination of grittiness and anime comedy. Whatever praise you could shower on them is mostly memetic aka the same source of praise given to L-Elf. As I also stated in that post, the writing is absolute pointless garbage with an ending so bad I actually wished for the Gundam 00 guys to save me. It was literally one of the worst open-ended things I have ever seen, period. The ending to Kare Kano was better than that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso since I want to pick on a low-hanging fruit that even the fans acknowledge, what the fuck is up with the action scenes in this show? The first episode alone had a car chase scenario where the vehicles looked like they were going at 35 MPH and it just got worse from there. Hell the animation for the entire show is unacceptable when compared to Flowers of Evil or even anime around 2001. The bodies are awkwardly drawn and the CG is laughable in every aspect of the word. There are literally fight scenes where the characters run up to each other and fire guns from ten feet away, and yet they don\u2019t hit each other. Explosions that occur are phoned in and have less of a threat than the green screen stuff in Mortal Kombat Annihilation. The plot armor is so inconsistently bad that it breaks all tension from the fights and what should be cool scenes end up boring me more than anything Bee Train could muster. Give me a reason to care about these action scenes Jormungand. Introduce some tension. Make them cool to look at. Don\u2019t introduce more plotholes than the new Spider-man movie (episodes 3 and 4 were just painful).\\n\\n\r\nJormungand was never a fun anime to watch, not even ironically. It\u2019s one of the biggest wastes of time I\u2019ve ever seen and I have no qualms with saying that Sword Art Online, Guilty Crown, Clannad, and Psycho-Pass are much better watches. Or if you want a good action anime, watch Darker than Black or Black Lagoon. Even the original Hellsing was far better put together than whatever crap Jormungand could come up with. Hell watch almost any anime aside from this turd, because there\u2019s nothing to recommend. The premise sucks. The action sucks. The characters suck. The pacing sucks. The writing sucks. The comedy sucks. The animation definitely sucks. If was to do a Tribute from a Hater on this thing, I\u2019d only be able to praise the fact that its topic is unique. But that\u2019s like praising a businessman in the transportation industry for suggesting we should invent teleporters, yet not having a single clue how to implement them.",

There's just one, huge problem. This is a show centred around dealing weapons, war and gunfights and yet the director seems to know absolutely nothing about any of the above. I'll list a few examples:\r\nOne scene has two people firing assault rifles at each other, full auto from about 10 metres away. AND NOT ONE BULLET LANDS. In this same scene, ariot shield is shown stopping multiple 7.62 rounds. A ballistic shield can do this, but not a riot shield, and my god would you feel the impact.\\n\\n\r\nAn assault rifle with a 30 rnd magazine will on average give you 2.2-2.5 seconds of firing at full auto. These guys must have some magic ass magazines because they get at least 15 seconds each.\\n\\n\r\nThey fire a javelin (a top down anti-armor weapon) which fires in a straight line for some reason, and also inexplicably ignores arming distance and just blows tf up when the dude fires it into his own vehicle. \\n\\n\r\nSome gals fire pistols at each other point blank, im talking about 4-5 mags each here and somehow they both dodge every single round and duke it out with their bayoneted pistols...\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty more examples, but you get the idea.

            "content": "It is commonplace to assume that the arms industry will observe a boom in demand during times of war and little during 'peaceful' times but unfortunately that isn't the case giving the sorry state of the world. Terrorism, uprisings and vast amount of budgeting for security has made arms dealing one of the most profitable modern professions today.\r\nJormungand was originally a manga by by Keitar\u014d Takahashi. It follows the adventures and exploits of the young and cunning shipping heiress Koko Hekmatyar as she travels around the world selling weapons together with her group of bodyguards. The latest addition to her squad is a child soldiercalled Jonah who claims to loathe weapons and warfare but unfortunately has no choice but to use them due to his occupation and state of the world.\\n\\n\r\n The plot in Jormungand is pretty straightforward and simple, selling arms, but how and the situation koko's group gets into to do this is both mediocre and exciting at the same time. Believe it or not, dealing in private arms is a perfectly legal profession in most countries. Most arms dealers that do get arrested aren't arrested because of their profession but because of import and export laws, or U.N. sanctions that are being circumvented and the series does hint at this in the first couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately its not all fun and games, the series being about selling arms gave alot of attention to 'arms' but the selling part was giving very little attention, i felt it would have been a nice addition and would have given the show a bit more sense of realism. At the start we are told that Jonah resents arms dealers due to his past but Jonah shows absolutely no amount of resentment towards Koko from the offset, a little resentment initially and gradually bonding would have been a nice way for the story to flow and build up their relationship but sadly it didn't. In Koko's defense though her personality is very likable and not something one can resent even if they tried.\\n\\n\r\nWhite fox have done a nice job with delivering stunning visuals throughout the show, art was good, scenery and locations also. The design and facial details of characters made them stand out with the artists going for darker pencil lines and color tones that really made the dark aspect of the show stand out. The design of the weapons were done in good detail but i wished more attention should have been given as to what type of weapon was being used at the time. There are also certain firefights where for sure our protagonists would be in a pinch but would always seem to come out unscathed as if having divine protection from the animators.\\n\\n\r\nAll the voice actors were top notch but might intially take a liitle getting used to, in the end all gave astounding performances to even the supporting characters. The OP, Borderland by Mami Kawada is an upbeat J-pop song that really went well with the tone of the show, pumping up audiences for the episode to come. The ED, Ambivalentidea by Nagi Yanagi although a slow paced song seemed surprisingly a good fit and it felt as though it complemented the upbeat OP and in a ways bringing balance to the overall feel. The BGM were nicely done too and the OST CD is definitely a look out for whenever it comes out. The most important sound aspect for the show is inevitably the weapons and it received composite attention, all sounds were in line with real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe place the series takes a bit of a headfall is with character development, Koko, Jonah and one or two of Koko's team members are developed well but the remaining were given very little detail, at times i thought some characters were new additions to her team cause i had never seen them before but only to go back to a previous episode to see that they were present but just lack of screen time was hampering them. We cant really blame them for this since it s just a 12 episode show but the very little introduction brings the show down a bit. The number of Koko's team itself i felt was a bit of a problem, it's just too much and other arm dealers we encounter have a more manageable size of bodyguards .\\n\\n\r\n Its not all bad on the characters sides though, the few people we did see development was done well and kept enjoyable, Koko's cunning is also fun to watch but the humor is something the show wasnt much good at and tries to apply it in situations rather than speech. \\n\\n\r\nDialogue between characters were handled professionally but there were a few places where audiences would be scratching their heads not knowing what was going on though. The choice of sometimes switching names of countries with simple letters like 'country T' i felt was not a good idea. The show seemed to somewhat over rely on the characters personalities a lot to deliver and not really on the story much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Jormungand is a good show and definitely one of the better shows of 2012, it is very enjoyable all through and one of the better thriller animes out there and makes enough impact to trade blows with shows like Black Lagoon any day. All in all you'll discover the life of an arms dealer is more than meets the eye and tricks such as being a professional in using different types of weapons wont get you much far and cunning and wit need to be added to the package.",

            "content": "Ok, so the 1st season of this anime has ended and we all look for ward on the next season, and it is suggested that the main  baddie involves the so called \"Bookman\" ..... obviously he's the guy whom we saw who met up with \"R.\"\r\nBut let's have a short quiz first:\r\nI.True or false\r\n1. The former Soviet Union was the biggest supplier of weapons during the cold war.\r\n             a. true      b false\r\n2. The \" Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \u2014 Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo,\" or better known as\" FARC\"  is currently the most active revolutionary insurgency group in South America particularly in Colombia.\\n\\n\r\n   a.true       b. false\\n\\n\r\n3. The Mexican Drug Cartel is only involved in smuggling and dealing in drugs. \\n\\n\r\n  a. true    b.false\\n\\n\r\n4. The Chicago Mob (Mafia) is currently the biggest criminal organization in the US.\\n\r\n       a.true    b. false\\n\\n\r\nLet me remind you that the question being ask here were related to the anime itself, though you can choose to brush this quiz aside it can only prove that you ain't interested to know at all.\\n\\n\r\nOk enough of the BS, so what now? Just kidding, Since this anime has a Action, Adventure, Military and seinen genre in it, it actually has the following; the flare of James Bond combine with the action of \"The Unit\" with the addition of black comedy of  \"Sons of Anarchy.\"  It kinda looks like that the author himself, Keitaro Motonaga may have had his inspiration with regards to these shows. However, he may have also gotten some inspiration  that happened in real life  and I'm referring to the \"Iran-Contra\" scandal where during 1986  the Reagan Administration violated their own arms embargo to Iran and Israel serves as the middle man between the US and Iran which cause a ruckus in US Congress. In which this anime may be a metaphor for that kind of incident. In reality an arms smuggler like  Koko Hekmatyar would not last 5 mins out there and we are talking about every law enforcement agency including the Interpol would would be knocking in her front door and she'll run out places to hide just like what happen to infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1993. You see the business of being a middleman in arms smuggling is not as glamorous as that of Koko in fact the job itself is as risky as drug smuggling, but unlike drug smuggling, arms smuggling is only cruel to black marketeers but not to arms manufactures and in the countries where they reside. So for the story since the plot varies from episode to episode and there is that element of realism in it  I gave it a \"Good\" number 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nOk, usually I really don't comment much about the art of an anime, but I really like the way them amazon were drawn like Valment, Karen, Curry and Chiquita  it seems that the illustrator may have gotten the idea of using Japan's famous  female body builder Tomoko Kanda as a model for the said female cast of this anime which I like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI simply hate both the opening and closing themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the roles that were fitted into the characters, co'z how they were drawn actually matches them perfectly. Take for example Koko Hekmatyar, one can see that she the good, the bad and the ugly. Good because her posses respect her and she has a way that commands the respect of her would be killers, she's bad co'z if one crosses her it is open season for him and she ugly co'z.............she's smart, cunning and generous, but she simply ugly and I kind hate her for being a lolicon since it is very obvious that she has hots for Jonah. Valmet on the other hand kinda strikes me as both a Milf and a hot Fbb which I find her as awesome, since I kinda have a thing for Milf's and Fbb's. Jonah, for me he looks like grown man in a boy's body, which if I can have it my way I would have love to tie him unto a ICBM and launch him in the sky. You know, I would have wish that Chinatsu better known as \"Commando Girl\" would have had some uncensored fanservice with regards to her butt to add some spice to her character even thought she only appeared in 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7 and Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyable part of this 12 episode 1st season is the gun fight, blood and gore and some good fanservice from the Valment, you can really say that this anime is for seinen who would like a good action and adventure kind of thing, Overall, White Fox studio really did a good action pack anime which deserves a 2nd season. So even if the 2nd season is yet to come I wonder if the \"Bookman\" will be able to tame the \"Jormungand\"( which by the way I'm referring to Koko)? I guess we'll find out when the 2nd season arrives.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBTW, how about another set of Jormungand quiz?\\n\\n\\n\r\n5. What is the name of the Surface to Air Missile (SAM) system that was shown in episode 2?\\n\\n\r\na. Hawk  b. Stinger  c. Patriot\\n\\n\r\n6. One of Koko's mercenaries is a former \" Bersaglieri,\" question, what is a\" Bersaglieri?\"\\n\\n\\n\r\na. An elite unit of the Russian Army   B. An elite unit of  the Royal Army (UK)\\n\\n\r\nc. An elite unit of the Italian Army\\n\\n\\n\r\n7. A Javelin is a form of ____________.\\n\\n\r\na. Artillery    b. Sniper Rifle     c. Shoulder Fired Missile \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nThe following is my review and analysis of Jormungand 1 and 2. The following contains SPOILERS!!!\r\nBlack Lagoon abandoned the cliche of heroic nice guy protagonists and gave viewers a team of   highly morally dubious protagonists who get in epic gun fights and pull jobs for the Mafia. What if you took it one step further and made an anime where you the viewer are flat out asked to root for the bad guy? This is that anime! The main character is a completely ruthless arms dealer that is like a combination of Nick Cage's character in Lord of War with The Major fromHellsing. She is a perpetually grinning, maniacal sociopath who wishes to ultimately rule the world and will destroy anyone and everyone between her and her goal. However, I HIGHLY suspect that Jormungand doesn't actually want the viewer to root for her. Actually I am almost certain that Jormugand is a satire in which the main character Koko Hekmatyar represents the United States and its foreign policy from a Japanese perspective. If you don't believe me, read the next paragraph. The show gives a LOT of evidence to support this!\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Hekmatyar was born in international waters and doesn't belong to any nation, but her father is an American and CEO of one of America's largest companies. This giant American company violates every international law and is secretly the world's largest arms dealer. This is a reference to the fact that the United States is the world's largest weapons exporter. Secondly, the name Hekmatyar for our main character was taken from real life terrorist Galbuddin Hekmatyar, who was heavily backed by the United States to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan...despite the fact that he was a brutal war criminal who was far worse than the Soviets . He later betrayed the US and became a leading member of Al-Qaeda, which he still is to this day. Thirdly, the sidekick of our MC Koko Hekmatyar is an Arab child soldier named Jonah Al-Mar. Neither Mar or Al-Mar are actual Arab names. Al-Mar is the name of a knife company that makes the combat knives for the United States Army. 4th, the bodyguard and leader of Hekmatyar's elite special forces is a Finnish mercenary. The US special forces were founded by a Finnish mercenary named Lauri Allan T\u00f6rni (Larry Thorn)...who was an ex-SS war criminal. The US let him out of jail early in order to teach American soldiers how to fight as ruthless and badass as the Waffen SS. 5th, in the first episode, Hekmatyar kills a bunch of Russians in order to become the sole arms dealer to what she calls a \"cluster of backwater countries in Eastern Europe\". This is a reference to how after defeating Russia in the Cold War, the US expanded NATO to control all of Eastern Europe and is now in fact the sole weapons dealer to all the countries of Eastern Europe except Belarus and Ukraine(yet). 6th, Hekmatyar's plan to take over the world involves a series of weapons satellites that will shoot down all planes in the world that are not under her control. This will give her absolute air power advantage and global domination. This is a reference to SDI, a US military project in the 1980s to build weapons satellites that would shoot down any incoming missiles and allow the US to nuke any opponent without having to worry about counter-attack. This would have given the US total control of the world, although the project was actually propaganda to scare the Soviets and was never technologically feasible, at least not in the 1980s. Lastly, Hekmatyar tells Al-Mar that her plan will shoot down all passenger planes currently flying, but 600,000 to 700,000 people is a small price to pay for the end of war under her total global domination. The number of casualties she estimated is in fact the exact same number of Japanese civilians killed by the US air force in WW2, which Japan feels America very coldly excused by saying it was necessary to end the war (and in Japan's view rule the world). These are just a few of the many examples. If you were paying attention and know something about history and politics, this is hard not to notice. Of course...it could just all be coincidence and this is just a shitty anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has LOTS of gun and weapons porn with all the tanks, helicopters, and gun models presented quite accurately. I wish I could say the same about the character models. Why the hell do the Arabs have white hair and red eyes? I know the Ishvalen's were supposed to represent Arabs, but this is our planet and not some alternate dimension! Just make them look like Arabs! Also, Hekmatyar is supposed to be an ethnic Pashtun (largest ethnic group in Afghanistan), but doesn't look remotely Pashtun! If you can make your M16s and your Hi-24 helicopters look accurate, why not your Arabs and Pashtuns? WTF?!\\n\\n\r\nThe series gives us a highly unconventional protagonist, LOTS of action, lots of accurate weapon models for military geeks, and unless it was the world's largest coincidence, a lot of brutal satire. Obviously I can't know the writer's intentions, so the satire element is speculative and whether or not the author's intention takes away from potential value as a satire is an entirely different lengthy discussion. This at first looks like a pretty mediocre anime, but if you look at it the right way, it makes for a pretty interesting show overall. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cFun, funny and fast-passed, a well-driven action focused show\u2026 A \u2018Lord of War\u2019 (movie) meets \u2018Black Lagoon\u2019 (anime) kind of thing\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nWe all have seen war, whether depicted in movies, games, books or through news channels or even in your own life, but not many things talk or show us about the dark and \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d scenario that takes place during those wars, revolutions or fights of any kind, and by the \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d I mean those person that finance \u2013whether a group or militia- with weapons. Movies like \u201cLord of War\u201d (Nicolas Cage) or \u201cThe International\u201d (Clive Owen) come to mind, so what makes\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d such an acclaimed show? \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 7-\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already stated on my \u201cintroduction\u201d something that its main focus is built around arms dealing isn\u2019t one of the most original things ever, nevertheless it IS a setting that hasn\u2019t been overused like let\u2019s say the topic of WWII. So one of the main things \u2013probably- that has captivated the viewers \u2013in addition to the story- into watching \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is the uniqueness of its main emphasis, the arms dealing and not like most action/adventure shows which main focus \u2013usually- is the war itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story department is simple \u2013at least the first season-,it\u2019s filled with well-achieved action moments, there are some \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201ctouching\u201d memories of the main characters and it\u2019s well-driven, but then again the show falls a few times on one of those typical repetitive patterns shown in plenty other anime. Don\u2019t misunderstand me; the story is great, not a masterpiece \u2013without a doubt- but not a boring one. In addition, \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is one of those shows in which every single one of the main characters are bad-asses, which means that they will always find a way \u2013effortlessly, if I may add- to save the day \u2013their day, of course- thing that by the end of the show leaves you wanting something \u201celse\u201d or \u201cmore\u201d, maybe a little more passion or meaningfulness should be thrown into the story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the characteristic that I find attractive and kept me watching the show is the fact that one of the main characters \u2013Jonah- is against guns and thus bringing an interesting \u201csub-plot\u201d within the show. Another characteristic that makes this show \u201clikeable\u201d \u2013or pleasant, if you will- is the fact that is engaging, interesting and enticing for it isn\u2019t you every-day-war-kind-of-anime. Another aspect is that the show wasn\u2019t always about just guns, most of the times it is but there are some moments that are more focused on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the first season of \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d was probably just made to place and prepare the \u201cboard\u201d for what\u2019s \u2013probably- coming- \\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 8- \\n\r\n\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d the art shown on the show is remarkable, it isn\u2019t a masterpiece or the jewel of the show but it isn\u2019t something \u201cwanting\u201d either. It\u2019s detailed, in most aspects, especially when talking about guns and action scenes, that\u2019s where the magic of the art team of \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d shines. Also, the characters designs are appealing and believable.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 7-\\n\r\nThe show contains very talented voice actors that transfer their mood/feelings to the viewers, although the script isn\u2019t one of the most \u201cdeep\u201d and meaningful things in the world, it looks like it was more action oriented but still, there ARE indeed some reflective moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe music by Takau Iwasaki  is good, it\u2019s a wide range of music styles from music containing ethnic sounds \u2013focused on the country they\u2019re in-, or fast passed compositions made to fit in the moment.  Nevertheless, the soundtrack isn\u2019t a masterpiece or something that is imposing anything interesting, it\u2019s just a soundtrack that tries \u2013and fails, in my opinion- to hype you up. To put it bluntly the soundtrack is shallow, it\u2019s like they tried to have a soundtrack for the sake of just having a soundtrack and not to evoke feelings \u2013other than excitement-. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 9-\\n\r\n\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is made in a 12 episode-format show, which \u2013as I\u2019ve stated before- is usually counterproductive when talking about the \u201cCharacter Department\u201d subject, since most shows aren\u2019t able to develop something or they just lack it or the characters just lack to back bone, but it is probably \u2013in my opinion- the best department in \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much character development per se in this show, it has some but most focused into \u201cfriendship\u201d in a dimmed kind of way, its faint.  \\n\r\nWhat makes the characters so well-achieved is that they\u2019re interesting, they are appealing, they have a past and most importantly everyone has a goal or a believe, making the character department rich and slightly well-grounded.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT: 9 & OVERALL: 8-\\n\r\n\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is one of those shows that you love primarily because of the characters within it. It\u2019s a fast passed, well-driven enjoyable show. \\n\r\nBut as I said before, the season one looks like just like a preparation for what\u2019s to come.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "TL;DR Jormungand is a good series.\r\nJormungand is the story of a crew of arms dealers, led by the charismatic Koko Hekmatyar. The series is mostly episodic, weaving in some character arcs on the way. Usually the formula is this:\r\n1. The crew arrives.\r\n2. Stuff goes awry and they need a way out / need to out-think their opponents / straight up kill dudes.\r\n3. Mission completed and on to the next arc.\r\nPretty easy formula to make a series from. I\u2019m sure that if you\u2019ve heard about this series earlier, then you\u2019ve heard about the series that undoubtedly stands as a huge influence: Black Lagoon. Black Lagoon isabout a small group of people who conduct usually illegal business and get in trouble with all sorts of people. Jormungand is basically this, but with a bigger group. Now, obviously Jormungand isn\u2019t a straight rip-off of BL, it just builds from the same ground. While BL arcs usually comes together with cooperation and the combined with of the Lagoon Crew, Jormungand is basically The Koko Show. And that\u2019s perfectly fine. Koko carries the series very well. For a more fleshed out character run-down, look below:\\n\\n\r\nKoko Hekmatyar: Arms dealer, handling business mainly in Europe and Africa. Very charismatic and beautiful. Usually very energetic and behaving sometimes like a child, she has a ruthless interior and on multiple occasions called a monster. Although usually cool with a smile on her lip, Koko has one of the most intimidating glares in anime.\\n\\n\r\nJonah: Child soldier. His parents were killed in an air-strike and he became a child soldier shortly after. Has a strong hate for weapons, but still works for Koko, often serving as her bodyguard. He definitely shows more understanding than expected from a child.\\n\\n\r\nLehm: Ex-Delta Force operator. Used to be active in Somalia. Second in command of Koko\u2019s crew. Veteran mercenary who takes charge when armed conflict arises. Used to work for Koko\u2019s father. Very versatile in weapon use, ranging from long-distance sniping to close quarters combat.\\n\\n\r\nValmet: Ex-Major serving for UN forces in Africa. Her unit got slaughtered by Chen Guoming and she lost an eye in the attack. Since then, she suffers from anxiety whenever she sets foot in Africa. Very proficient with knives and pistols.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the rest of the cast, that aren\u2019t given much other than support roles most of the time. Technically only Koko and Jonah are the only real main characters, but Valmet and Lehm are given much more time on screen than the other side characters, so they sort of slide into main roles by association. The entire crew is 10 men strong, and the series struggle to give decent air time to all.\\n\\n\r\nThe big cast isn\u2019t a bad thing in itself, but it doesn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s quite logical that an arms dealer would have a decently sized squad with her, but most of the characters see very little air time. Most characters get to have their arcs play out (some might have theirs in the second season) sooner or later, but it\u2019s a shame we aren\u2019t given more time to know the entire cast better. Especially since they keep being given airtime and dialogue with Koko that are defined by their characters and their pasts, both of which we don\u2019t know. Valmet's arc is especially strong. The characters mostly revolve in and out when they have an arc or not. When they\u2019re around, they contribute to the colourful group of people.\\n\\n\r\nTo my surprise, there is little discussing of morality around, especially considering Jonah is a fucking child soldier. Sure, it\u2019s brought up, but quickly shot down at times. Let\u2019s be frank about this, the characters in the show aren\u2019t good guys. They\u2019re varying degrees of bad, I guess. Or, a better way to put it would be that they are all in the moral grey zone. They\u2019re portrayed romantically as the heroes, so naturally you\u2019re going to root for them when the oddball villains pop up to kill them. I wanted to see some more discussion or feelings about war, than what we got. It is a character-driven drama/action series, which is right up my ally, but I feel they do themselves a disservice to skip some strong discussion points on the way. And it\u2019s topical because, you know, there\u2019s tons of child soldiers in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, there\u2019s not a whole lot to be had, except for when the supporting characters have their arcs. The story follows the crew as they deliver and/or sell weapons and other necessities to a diverse set of people. They\u2019re usually dealing in Europe and Africa through the season. Then there\u2019s usually a villain for each episode, with some villains lasting another one or two more. The formula mentioned before is how the episodes unfold.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that quickly stands out is the very distinct art-style. It\u2019s not super drastically different compared to most other anime. It\u2019s usually very realistic, sometimes with some exaggerated details, usually the eyes. For the most part it\u2019s absolutely gorgeously drawn and animated. Backgrounds are usually done nicely as well, and at times with great and impressive detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is excellent across the board. The only drawback is that there\u2019s rarely chances for the actors to use a wider range than slow drama and some comedy here and there. The soundtrack is good when used. Pretty sweet electronic battle music. OP (opening theme) and ED (ending theme) are both excellent songs.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the general theme of the show goes, it\u2019s usually a slow-paced drama with some comedy blended in. Then there\u2019s the occasional high-speed action scenes when deals either go tits-up or there\u2019s other people that want to hit Koko\u2019s group.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the comedy, it\u2019s a bit too much. I would have prepared being almost completely without it. In the most serious episodes, there\u2019s practically none of it, and they\u2019re so much better off without. The comedic parts being randomly inserted here and there just disturb the pacing and atmosphere of the series. It just feels like something inserted to please the mainstream audiences. The thing is though, that this isn\u2019t really a series made for mainstream audiences. It\u2019s about killers and mercenaries selling weapons to guerillas and warlords. Not something that you want your kids or the family to sit down and watch in the evening. Inserting comedy into the formula is detrimental to the concept and leaves us a worse product to enjoy. I want to stress that I\u2019m not anti-comedy, but doing it as half-heartedly and shallow as it is here it can only work badly.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists that pop into the episodes are along the lines of the comedic tendencies mentioned. They\u2019re almost always very eccentric or have some crazy fighting style. In some arcs it works, like when the crew goes to Africa and come face-to-face with an old enemy of one of the crew members. They usually don\u2019t take anything away from the enjoyment, but they don\u2019t usually add to it either.\\n\\n\r\nAn excellent scene which stands as a display of how good the drama of the series can be is when it's brought up that killing to much people can make you \"a dragon,\" and a character asks Koko if she would ever become one. The scene is unbearably tense for it's short running time, and shows how good the series is when it sticks to straight-up drama instead of faffing about with random comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, it\u2019s great. While not being the best I\u2019ve veer seen, this series is highly enjoyable. It\u2019s variance is it\u2019s strength, and while I don\u2019t usually like the comedy, some light-hearted scenes are always good in a series like this, and some scenes succeed in being genuinely funny. From slow-paced planning with some tense meetings with antagonists; to high-speed gun-play and chase-scenes, Jormungand is one hell of a ride, and it\u2019s a pleasure watching it. While not always ending in cliffhangers, the show still gets you excited to watch the next episode after you finish one, and that\u2019s high praise for a series. Jormungand is a delight to watch, and should be seen by people interested in serious drama, and is obviously very recommended for fans of Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like it, check out it\u2019s sequel, Jormungand: Perfect Order.",

Is the anime successful in doing justice to the theme- absolutely not. It doesn't show the expected hear wrenching realities and emotional conflicts or brutalities of the profession but instead the author decides to take a very childish take on the matter which is make the arms dealer an eccentric, charismatic and mysterious person who is able to command respect from her subordinates who are some killers who have come from various walks of life. One of them actually isa child soldier who hates arms dealers because of the atrocities done to him but finds himself having fun with the person. I have to say that justice has e not been do the plot at all. But ignoring this part and assuming that nothing that good can be expected from this series you could have fun just watching the action in it and appreciate the plots too. The character of the child soldier is the most mysterious one and the most interesting to watch and thats the only part of the story that made it watchable.",

            "content": "The Positive Side: Jormungand follows the travels of Jonah, a child soldier with a hatred of weapons, as he serves as body-guard to an eccentric and playful arms-dealer, Koko Hekmatyar.\r\nOne of Jormungand\u2019s greatest strengths is in the way it handles its sprawling cast.  Each member of Koko\u2019s motley crew of bodyguards has a different set of skills, a distinct personality and a different philosophical perspective.   Almost everyone is given an episode or two in the spotlight, and in just a short period of time with any given character, you can get a very strong sense of who they are.  It\u2019s difficultfor a series with a cast this large to achieve this kind of distinction, but character development is one area where Jormundgand shines.  Even the villains, however briefly they appear on screen, bring with them unique quirks and the remnants of their personal histories.\\n\\n\r\nThe most memorable character of the lot is easily Koko.  She grins and jests her way through the tensest of situations, her skylarking and casual demeanor betraying her brilliant coordination of her team.  She\u2019s the perfect blend of silliness, wisdom and charm, like an albino, gun-slinging Willy Wonka.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the market saturation of supernatural/scifi Shonen series, Jormungand serves as a refreshing reminder that you don\u2019t need super-powers to make an action-scene sizzle.  Fights range from chaotic, urban gun-battles to smooth sniper-executions to a beautiful knife-fight set in a secluded clearing of a snowy forest.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily episodic, each new episode setting up a new antagonist for Koko, Jonah and the rest to overcome, and it is not until the end of the series that it becomes clear what all this has actually been building up to.  Like Cowboy Bebop before it, Jormungand proves that an episodic structure can work wonderfully as long as each separate story is well-executed.\\n\r\nThematically, this is a story about the reconciliation between killing and morality.  Koko strives to prove to Jonah that simply because she and rest of the group are in the moral grey by the very nature of their business doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have fun and mess around on their days off.  Koko repeatedly proves that she truly does care about her team, that she wishes to avoid killing when it is unnecessary, and that she has principles she refuses to violate.\\n\r\nThe English dub is very well-acted, thanks to the talents of Funimation, and while the music can be a bit grating and synthetic at points, the opening theme really grew on me after a couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: While a fairly intelligent show in terms of theme and the impact of war, Jormundgand\u2019s greatest failure comes from backing itself into a philosophical corner.  It\u2019s difficult to talk about the ending without giving spoilers, but I will do my best to keep this vague for the would-be viewer\u2019s benefit.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, when we learn of Koko\u2019s ultimate goal, we find that she is about to do something morally horrifying for the sake of what she believes is the greater good.  It\u2019s supposed to be a huge moral quandary, but the flaws in the plan become obvious when given the slightest degree of consideration.  In fact, Koko\u2019s own brother points out the faults in what she\u2019s doing not long after she unveils her grand plan.  The problem is, by the time her plan is revealed to be grossly philosophically imbalanced, the series is out of time, and has nowhere left to go.  While the ending is nowhere near as bad as a few other series I\u2019ve watched (The Big O, Deadman Wonderland), it\u2019s still rather unsatisfying, especially compared to the show\u2019s stellar Season 1 finale.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Despite its lack-luster ending, Jormungand boasts strong characterization, action and plotting.  It\u2019s definitely worth watching, especially if you\u2019re a fan of Seinen and war stories.\\n",

They'd say, \"Hind, take cover!\" or \"Target, machine gunner, 9 o'clock\". There's no addressing the amount of bullets one can carry (in episode four the bad guy guns down an entire opera house with what looks like one nutsack, and that does not hold enough to gun downas many people as shown with one shot-one kill, let alone firing like a moron), there's no tactics, people take stupid shots (god knows how many times they shoot at held guns, a stupid shot to take under almost any circumstance), and nothing in it gives the idea that the people who made the show or manga have any knowledge of guns beyond their statistics. \\n\\n\r\nIf you think that's semantics, it's because good gunplay (if it was there) would be the only saving grace, seeing as the writing is atrocious.

            "content": "\u201cYour new recruit is a child soldier? And he's got iron, shit.\u201d\r\nThere is much to talk about guns, wars, arm dealers, and child soldiers these days. For those who are into the fast action type, the type of series involving a kickass music, or a type of series involving a main protagonist being loco, or blood being splattered all over the screen, then this series is definitely something to keep an eye on.\r\nAccording to Norse Mythology, J\u00f6rmungandr (or more often known as Jormungand) is known as the Midgard Serpent or the World Serpent. And like a serpent, the main character is cunning as expected ofan arms dealer. For without intelligence and leadership, the crew would not be what they've become of today.\\n\\n\r\nJormungand is based off the manga of the same name starring Koko Hekmatyar, a young arms dealer who sells weapons under HCLI, a weapons corporation. She is badass, she is independent, she is cunning, she is fun, and she is of course loco. With her is the child soldier, sidekick, bodyguard, and brother all the same time named Jonah (Jonathan Mar). He is of the West Asian origin and after being orphaned swears to get vengeance. Yet the same time, with his acquittance of Koko and the crew, his sentiment seems to have cooled down and even has a warmer side to him that some of us may see as cute or peculiar.  \\n\\n\r\n[ - Story - ]\\n\r\nTo be honest, this is the type of show that can make any fan of action genre glued to the screen with its blood packed spilling, rapid violence, and gun dominance at first glance. The first episodes kicks off already with some full throttle road war and those bullets fly across all over the screen. It wastes little time in conveying the hazardous occupation and brutality of being an arms dealer. At the same time, it also finds ways to make the series relaxing through some heartwarming moments and comedic scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the modern eras so if you're looking for mecha action, futuristic weaponry, or of the historical theme, then you're looking at the wrong place. Fear not though as the story is easy to understand and not one of those mindfucks that leaves the viewers going \u201cHUH?\u201d Speaking of stories, Jormungand has a smooth pace focusing on the crew's teamwork and abilities to accomplish tasks. Each arc focuses on professionalism and it's up to Koko and her crew to work together in the end to deliver the result. Although somewhat one-sided and predictable, the story is still smooth and to the adult-oriented audience, can be appealing.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Characters - ]\\n\r\nOne of the aspect that engineers this series is the colorful cast of characters. Koko Hekmatyar assumes the role of the female protagonist who is amusing, entertaining, and dramatic to watch. Despite the real dangers of her occupation, she makes fun out of most it and can literally be seen as a troll at occasions. Her character brightens up the gloom and doom of the crew and gives her job a new light that some future arm dealers may find appealing or maybe strange. On the other hand, there is Jonah, the child recruit soldier. Like the opposite side of a coin, he has a more stoic mind and says things that can sometimes be interpreted blunt, sarcastic, or too brutally honest. Yet he is an interesting character if we look at him more carefully for his ability to balance out the seriousness and fun mood of the story and her crew.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the crew, there are some of other prominent characters to look at. One of them is the one eyed ripped girl, Valmet. Her priceless expressions throughout the episodes towards Koko are those of a puppy like crush and silly to watch. Yet behind that eye lies a dark past, one which changed her life forever and made her the person that she is today. There are some others worth to mention namely Lehm that resumes the second in command of the crew, Kasper Hekmatyar (Koko's elder brother), and Chinatsu from one of the earlier episodes. While all of them have contrasting personalities, it is easy to see that they share the theme of having a dark past whether playing the role of the good or bad player. \\n\\n\r\nIt is because of these themes and histories, the crew and the characters of this series are quite unique in its aspects.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Animation/Art - ]\\n\r\nLike Steins; Gate, Jormungand is handled by White Fox. They are a relatively new anime studio who are more into the traditional background. At first glance, that's nothing worth to talk about. Yet, if we look carefully, we can clearly see that the studio creates the realism of the the story and into its characters. The weapons, the military backgrounds, the settings, the outfits, the visuals. It retains its ability to create the atmosphere. Koko's mischievous expressions on her loco face shows it all through the lashes and those slippery grins like a serpentine. That can also be said to the same for her bodyguard, sidekick, and friend, Jonah.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also tries to bring out humor through some of the more comic scenes with the black ringed eyes in the form of priceless expressions. While not too appealing, it brings out the comedy side of the series and shows that while the job of being an arm dealer is dangerous, it can also be fun and to make most of it.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Sound - ]\\n\r\nI'll say this once and once only. The music and soundtrack of this series is pure epic. The music director behind the scene (Taku Iwasaki) puts the e into epic for its beats and techno trance like music that will make you wish you're part of the series. (unless you fear of getting shot that is) \\n\\n\r\nThe OP song, \u201cBorderland\u201d sung by Mami Kawada is also quite catchy. Known for her work from the popular Shana franchise and the Toaru Majutsu no Index series, she brings her latest work to life through this song. All in all for nothing else of a reason to watch this show, the soundtrack of the series is one of them\\n\\n\r\n[ - Enjoyment - ]\\n\r\nLike I said before, this series is packed with nonstop action in rapid sequences. There's not much romance to expect out of this show but who cares when we have Koko and her alpha crew? There's also some little fan-service here and there with the ripped Valmet, the mass volumes of blood spilled on an episode basis, and of course, those kickass music that can get you start watching the show in a heartbeat. The action does occasionally get repetitive and the gore seems to be almost forced on. But if we look carefully, the series also has the more emotionally side to it (especially involving Valmet) in some of the later battles. To combine action and emotion, that is enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the praise, this series does have flaws. After all, without flaws, this show would be in MAL's top 100 by now. Yet, it's not. That's because it does have flaws.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems I'd say would be the forced action that is a bit driven too much and lack of more character development. For example, I'd love to see some more history background besides Valmet, Koko, and Jonah. Maybe that guy with the sniper that has the eye of a hawk, or maybe Schokolade, the blonde informant that has a peculiar and joyful personality. Additionally, the character designs of the show are a bit blend and seems somewhat dirty. After watching Koko and her crew grin on a daily basis, in the OP, on missions, etc, it gets repetitive. But even with these flaws, this series is enjoyable, at least in the action and  seinen department. But even if you don't meet the age demographic, this show can be watched for some guilty pleasure involving Koko's alpha crew and their exchanges. It's fun, it's bloody, it's entertainment, and it's in your face. All in all, this series is great to watch in the middle of the week especially after a busy week of school or work even with all the violence.\\n\\n\r\nJust remember though in real life that violence is not the answer to everything, well except in Jormungand. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cPeople who kill too much turn into dragons one day. Beasts that rule the land atop piles of money and fly the skies on wings of authority. They become more and more violent until they can no longer understand the language of men. We cannot allow dragons to remain in this world, even though we are the ones from which they are spawned.\u201d\r\nKoko Hekmatyar is an unique person, one of those people who keep equlibrium in the world, setting the delicate balance between right or wrong. As a guns merchant she encounters many chaotic situations where the line between right or wrong is easily crossed,however that\u00a0doesn't stop her, as she stands collected in the face of perils. As every person working in this line of business, she gathers a team of people who subordinate to her. As you might have guessed, they are not ordinary people, but experienced soldiers who came alive from the pits of hell. They choose to follow the bright light that Koko emits, being attracted by her charm and wisdom, talents which make her a natural leader.\\n\\n\r\nAs her new subordinate, she recruits Jonah, a boy who fought as a child soldier in the Middle East. Jonah meets her team and is taken by surprise by all the new information he finds out about the world outside the war zone, since he only knew who to shoot a gun and fight. Koko gives Jonah a chance to be free and discover the world in his travels. However, Koko doesn't babysitt him, making him a new addition to her team, and giving him the role of protecting her in her gun transactions with people of the underworld.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the journey of Koko and her team to various countries and continents where Koko sells different guns and war machinery. As expected, the transactions don't always go so well, thus making Koko's team enagage in badass combat to protect her when the situation gets out of hand. It does remind of Black Lagoon, but this show stands on its own, the story being engaging and interesting enough to set itself apart. However, it does have flaws, the story not being coherent at times in the transition between episodes as well as having some characters's backgrounds unexplained.\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art is appealing, especially the designs of Jonah and Koko. The animation is constantly good, and the fighting scenes are engaging and highly-elaborated. I find the guns designs pretty imaginative as well as the various combat styles.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is really stunning, from the up-beat rap music to the classic music played in the background and the music in various languages that suits the multi-cutural backgrounds of the characters. One of my favorites songs from this anime is in portuguese,  its beauty touching the strings of your heart.\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nAt first Jonah clearly states that even if he's talented with shooting guns and killing people with them, he hates guns and those who sell them. However, he soon discovers that Koko is not your usual cold-hearted, insensitive gun merchant, but follows her own code of morals, even if it at times ambiguous. For example, she doesn't accept payment in drugs, and it's been shown that she admires determination and bravery even in her enemies. The way she chose her followers is the best example. For instance, her bodyguard and driver, Ugo, was a member of the mafia when Koko ordered for them to be killed when they wanted to pay her in drugs, leaving Ugo the only survivor. When asked why did she leave Ugo alive, she replyed that she liked the fact that Ugo looked away in disapproval when the mafia showed the drugs.\\n\\n\r\nKoko is a force of nature, one of those rare people who can become anything they put in mind to be, however, Koko instead chose to be part of the dangerous underworld. She was born at sea, thus not having a place where she belongs, but  because of that she feels unbounded, being able to feel freedom at another level. In norse mythology, Jormungand is called the \"World Serpent\" because he grew so large that he could surround the world and grasp its own tail. That may be a metaphor for Koko, who has the ability to feel free everywhere she goes  in the world, thus by following her, she gives other people  who strive for freedom, the chance of feeling eliberated.\\n\\n\r\nWe also meet her other subordinates which are people who survived wars and conflicts. There is Lehm, the always calm and collected veteran soldier and mercenary who is very compelling as a character. There is also Valmet, a skilled war combatant from Finland who still pursues revenge for her murdered comrades. As Koko once stated : \"She's her teacher, her friend and more than that\".Another member of Koko's team consists of Lutz, who serves at times the role of a comic relief, being shot in the ass several times, however showing superior skill as a sniper.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Jonah is very interesting to watch as he develops, at the beginning showing a strong loathe of guns and the criminal world, after joining Koko's team he finds that things aren't as black and white as he initially had thought, people like Mao, for example, who have a family and are good-natured individuals, but still have to kill  because of their job.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are problems with the characters as well. The portrayal of the characters as being the \u201cgood guys\u201d is highly unrealistic, because of the profession they have. Seeing a sympathetic law-breaker is acceptable in anime format, though. There are also interesting supporting characters but they aren't developed, which is quite a pity. I would also have liked to see more of Jonah's experiences as a child soldier and how they affected him. That would have been very interesting for me to watch, but unfortunately, it was totally discarded.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nI  enjoyed this anime, I recommend it to those who watched Black Lagoon as well as those who like action scenes and imaginative combat styles.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "This was probably one of the best shows that I have ever watched. This anime rocks to the very core!\r\nThe story was great. It shows the reality of what an arms dealer does. I have known some in real life. And they are indeed such kinds of persons who are in this anime. They hire people to defend them, they fuel wars, they compete with other dealers, they kill their enemies, they partner with those they can't handle and most of all they are good in economics (supply and demand lol). It was also somehow realistic in the sense that quantum computing could be dangerous.In fact, such kinds of technologies are existing right now but are currently suppressed or controlled by the governments. To wrap up, the story is outstanding as it never fails to show how reality looks in this kind of game(arms-dealing).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also good.. Not too showy unlike other military genres which have too much explosions and crap that hurts the eye.. The fight scenes are naturally shown and are quite enjoyable.. it's pretty much like how real gunfights look. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also very cool. Each member has different personalities that were nicely portrayed in the show. Not to mention that the show was also able to show most of the stories of each member (their pasts and their struggles). The anime never failed to describe each of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this one a 10. This is one of the best animes that I have ever watched and this is the very first time that I have given myself a chance to create a positive review here in MAL for this anime really deserved it.. :)",

            "content": "NOTE: Before i start my review, i'd like to say that the excellent Shane Smith from VICE has done a reportage from a major arms dealing convention. So if you want to see some Jormungand-style gunrunning in real time, then you can watch it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJct-kBqIKA\r\nMy understanding of arms dealers came after watching the excellent film \"Lord of War\". Nicolas Cage plays a Ukrainian-American arms dealer who sells guns like AK-47s, M-16s and a M-60 Machine gun to warlords and rebel groups. The movie is great as it portrays a balanced view of the arms dealer, and how inane our world is.\r\nArms dealing is rampantin this current age. With the Drug War across Latin America along with Middle Eastern revolutions and a Taliban insurgency in West Asia, the need for arms dealers is higher than ever, and these wars gave rise to people like Viktor Bout who sells AK-47s to dictators like Charles Taylor and Muammar Gaddafi. It is evil, manipulative and horrifying and his recent arrest became a morality tale about the nature of war and how people like Viktor Bout are making the world a worse place to live.\\n\\n\r\nJormungand came a few months after Lord of War, but it's also excellent. And the anime adaptation aired the same month Viktor Bout received 25 years of prison in the United States. So it's pretty co-incidental that both the manga and anime came at a time when stories of arms dealers reached the news.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a group of arms dealers led by a Genki girl named Koko Hekmatyar (Shizuka Itou). Her ragtag crew is like the A-Team of arms dealers, and their ways of running the business is as carefree as the Googleplex, but with more explosions.\\n\\n\r\nThe series begins with Koko bringing a new member of the team: A former child soldier named Jonathan. He's about 10, hates guns but joins an arms dealing group to find the dealers who killed his parents. Koko, along with Jonah and her crew of badasses go around the world selling guns and partying. It's k-On! meets Lord of War and Micmacs, and that's the best summary of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, the animation's nice. Pretty sunny, but since it's by White Fox then the lens flare is expected. The character designs are done by by the key animator from Steins;Gate and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe direction is pretty good, especially when it's directed by the director of Katanagatari and School Days. Yeah, about that: Keitaru Motonaga should stick to directing for White Fox since all his other works are pretty bad. His career reminds me of Martin Campbell's career: a hit or two in a resume of crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe music's nice. The OP sounds like something from a Prodigy/Pendulum concert, and the ED is done by the excellent Nagi Yanagi. The entire score is done by Taku Iwasaki who remains great at what he does. His attention to surrounding and action makes him great, which is why he's the best action anime composer ever, since he does stuff like Gurren Lagann, Yakitate Japan and Ben-to.\\n\\n\r\nThe one flaw about this story is character development. So far, Koko, Jonathan and Koko's colleague Valmer (voiced by Sayaka Ohara) has given us a glimpse of what they are and recently we get to see Jonathan's backstory and Koko's brother. And that's about it. There is a backstory about the most recent villain group in the series, but that was not as exciting as it should be. I wanna see more of that Lehm guy (voiced by Unsho Ishizuka) and more of William Nelson (voiced by Kenji Nomura). The series could have been better if each episode revolves around two characters hanging out with each other, like Community. But we get to see more of others later in the series which helps improve character relationship. We also get to see interactions with people outside the arms bubble, like the \"Medicines Sans Frontieres\" guys later in the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Jormungand is a decent anime about arms dealer. It's not as great as Lord of War, but it's good for lots of action and a great staff which makes the series much more enjoyable.",

            "content": "I am not sure what to say about this show. It is extremely action packed and the character looks interesting at first glance, but there is so many of them and they are all still so cryptic that it is hard to tell if they are not just generic characters in the end. I am not sure where this show will be going exactly, obviously action will take a major part of the show, but I have a feeling (mostly because this is a white fox production) that the character will turn out to be very likable and interesting in the end.\r\nI\u2019m more interested inlearning what is the deal with Jonah. That poor boy is very interesting, he doesn\u2019t like to talk, yet he asks many question, he doesn\u2019t like guns, yet he carries one around. The only time he laughed was when he was able to hold a plush in his hand for a minute. Otherwise he always kept the same Kristen Stewart facial expression for the whole episode. In term of characters, Jormungand already hooked me in. Also, I don\u2019t know if it is just me, but Jonah reminds me of Johan from Monster, mainly because they have the same letters in their name and both kids are messed up beyond any kind of redemption.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of the show that I absolutely loved were the soundtrack. The Opening and Ending are just awesome ! They made me think of Black Lagoon somehow in their style, most likely because both shows are of similar genre after all. Even after listening only once to those songs, I already want to listen to them on loop. I guess I\u2019m kind of a sucker for this kind of \u201cmusic\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019m not sure what to say about the action, the only thing I can clearly say is that some of the stuff they did in the show are simply physically impossible. No one can stand on top of a car that is driving at I don\u2019t know how many kilometers per hour, not unless you have nails under your boots, but even in that case it would have been impossible in that particular scene, since the van was bullet proof and the nails would have never taken grip in the first place. Also, while I\u2019m no explosive specialist, I am fairly confident that the shock wave from a grenade explosion is sufficient (at such close range) to active the detonator of an RPG, but maybe some gun maniac could prove me wrong on that one.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m willing to give this show a try, I have a feeling that the action might never buy me, but the characters already did and from past experience, white fox make great shows. I will look forward to blogging and watching this show, at least for the next couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPossibility of Watching: Likely",

            "content": "What in your mind if we're talking about a series that have gunfire packed with some stunning action? Maybe you would think a hollywood movies that usually have stunning action and amazing gunfire scenes like The Raid Redemption (2012) or maybe James Bond series , how about in anime? Dont worry we have like that too, its called Jormungand.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story in jormungand is about Jonah, a boy who fought in middle east as the child soldier is being recruited as Koko's companions. Koko itself is an arms dealer who travels all around the world for selling the guns. As the arms dealer, Koko must havemany obstacles like resistance from a group in the country or even a rival in dealing with arms. As her subordinate, Jonah and the companions must make sure Koko's safety in every transactions.  By reading the premise of the story maybe you can imagine. There will be many spectacular action and stunning visual gunfire which means you will being served by a full-pack of action. Well, its true.\\n\\n\r\nWhat make me love about this series was this anime wasnt always about gunfire or battle scenes. There was a time when this anime shows good jokes and some lighthearted story. Having a great action battle doesnt mean they forgot about the story, the story in this anime was well-made and not too hard to understand. Jormungand is really great at composing the story when times to jokes and when the times for serious. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, in Jormungand there was some moments when you have question in your mind  like \"what happen?\" or \"how could it happen? what the reason\"\\n\r\nbut eventually, it would happen if you werent focussed. But aside from it, Jormungand is pretty enjoyable action anime that will make you sitting down quietly on your chair.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was awesome, especially in the weapon details. They were specifically put extra details in the weapon that being used in this anime, like when there was a scenes with a weapon usually they make it really like a realistic weapon. Not just the weapon details, The background in this anime was really synch with the situation or the atmosphere, even the background seems so simple but it isnt decreasing the \"epic\" effect when there was a gunfire scenes. The simple background that White Fox usually does is being covered by how the gunfire scenes works. So people usually being sidetracked and focusess on the battle scenes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nYou wouldnt get spaced out if you're watching Jormungand, since when watching this anime you will feel like in the middle of battles. Gunfire and exploding sound will echoing your room and makes like you're in the middle of battleground. Not just the sound effect, the BGM which made by Yasunori Ebina (known for To Aru majutsu franchise)  is helpfully increasing the feel from \"war\" situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP of Jormungand, which is \"Borderland\" by Mami Kawada is pretty catchy. With some electro tunes and fast beat, this OP easily grasp my heart. This OP itself is quite match with Jormungand themes, which have a full-suspense action and fast battles. I cant help to not to rewind after hearing the OP, its really good and easy listening.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThis is maybe what make Jormungand shines the most. In this anime, you will find many interesting characters. Its not tsundere or dandere that you would find in any anime but its more into realistic terms. Like Jonah, our main character who is mostly quiet (because of the trauma) but at the same time pretty skillful in battle, Koko which is the \"boss\" in this anime, she is very charismatic and sometimes behave like a child but when comes to serious, she is can be very scary, and also there was Valmet, who is Ex-Major serving for UN forces in Africa, looks scary on the outside but can be pretty darling when it comes to Koko and there is still more, from a freaky one into a badass one. This anime full of interesting character that you wouldnt get bored from it.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nAbove all the appreciate that i gave in this anime, Jormungand is really deserve to have all the apreciation, Jormungand is really a great action one that rarely seen in another series. You have great story packed with amazing battle scenes, wonderful soundtrack that can hyping up the atmosphere, great backgrounds and loveable characters. What else did you need again? anyway, this anime is for those who loves action. FYI, i am not action fans but i started to getting addicted with action after watching jormungand. So, basically this anime is RECOMMENDED!",

            "content": "Of all the crap anime I\u2019ve seen over the past year or so, Jormungand is the one that never seems to leave my mind in regards to how bad it was, despite it ending more than six months ago. Every time I think of it, I go back to my MAL, decided I ranked it too high, and lower my score by one point whilst ignoring the fact that everyone else seems to think the anime was cool. For the love of me, I still don\u2019t get what people see in this show. Saying you like Jormungand is like saying you think the original Oneanime is the best thing to ever come out of Key. Newsflash people, \u201cnobody likes the One anime\u201d. Being one of three or four people who feels that way doesn\u2019t help I\u2019ll admit, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been as opposed to most people in regards to anime opinions, nor have I had as hard a time finding something to praise, as I have with this crap.\\n\\n\r\nHow badly do I think of Jormungand you may ask? Well both seasons are currently ranked a \u201c1\u2033 on my MAL right now and unfortunately there\u2019s no way it can go any lower despite my best efforts to make it so, and I don\u2019t think there are any scores low enough for the show anyways. Or to put it in more concise terms, I would rather marathon everything by KyoAni and Shaft (good or bad) then have to sit through this shit show ever again!\\n\\n\r\nI am seriously confused in regards to what to recommend about this show in any way. Normally I don\u2019t mind recommending stuff like Eureka Seven or Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 despite the fact that I don\u2019t like them just because others may see differently. Hell, I\u2019ll even recommend Robotics;Notes or Psychic School Wars  if people want it so badly. But Jormungand is just plain useless without a single thing to recommend. What good thing am I supposed to say about this show?\\n\\n\r\nWell I guess there\u2019s the music. It\u2019s composed by Taku Iwasaki, who composed the soundtrack for Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure and Gurren Lagann as well as the currently airing Gatchaman Crowds, although I can\u2019t remember the BGM for that one. Can\u2019t remember what it was like for this anime either, but I remember it being okay aside from that \u201cher name is Koko\u201d crap. Needless to say, it\u2019s not his best work. And I guess if you want me to be really nice, it\u2019s cool to see Jormungand tackle a topic that isn\u2019t done by most anime. But just because something isn\u2019t in high school doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good, and it definitely doesn\u2019t help when Jormungand feels like it was created by hacks who\u2019ve never seen an action movie or read an action story in their life.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the arms dealing is vastly under researched and not realistic in the least. Episode 2 literally had Koko and her group going to an army camp and dealing the weapons out like they were street vendors or something. One of the big advantages that Jormungand has in tackling the arms dealing topic is that because it\u2019s not done very often, the average person wouldn\u2019t know that what Jormungand is showing you is a load of crap. I\u2019ve actually seen some people try and excuse this by telling me \u201cit\u2019s a fictional story\u201d, but I don\u2019t buy that. Now and Then, Here and There is a fictional story, but the guy who wrote it made sure that he accurately captured the torment and suffering that child soldiers go through in war, even if it got way too exploitative and manipulative for me to enjoy in the end. I also wouldn\u2019t call Black Lagoon realistic, as it skews more to the action movie agenda, but the weapons were all carefully researched (I\u2019m not sure about this, but from what I\u2019ve read, there are several gun facts stated in the show that are inaccurate) and any arms dealing that takes place in that show is done in semi-realistic professional manner rather than whatever goofy antics Koko cooks up that we\u2019re supposed to find endearing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads me to my next problem with Jormungand. So the arms dealing isn\u2019t realistic. An anime can still be fun despite that right? Well, maybe if the show didn\u2019t try to push it so hard and yet treat it like a total joke I could. The combination of anime cliches (sleepwalking, bad cooking, oh look at me I\u2019m so wacky) with the grittiness of the gun market is absolutely abysmal. First off, the premise of the show is that a kid who hates arms dealers somehow ends up working for one, and a teenage girl at that. And he never really questions his choices or anything like that. That is a goddamn stupid premise you\u2019ve got right there, but it might have been tolerable if the show didn\u2019t treat it like an absolute joke or if there was some solid writing and good characters, of which there are none. All of the characters are completely forgettable one-note jokes who are only important when the plot calls for, and then lose importance right afterwards with no real development whatsoever. It\u2019s basically the equivalent of what would happen if Angel Beats actually gave focus to TK or Shiina or any of those other joke characters: completely pointless and a waste of episodes whilst not progressing the story. Did you know that when that Red character got his own arc and died, I didn\u2019t know who the fuck he was? Hell, I know fans who didn\u2019t know who he was at first. That\u2019s a sign of good writing.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I can\u2019t remember a single antagonist in this series besides that one rival to Valmet. And I only remember her (and Valmet herself) because Valmet wore an eyepatch and was the only other female in the group, which is not a good sign. As for Jonah and Koko, all I have to say is laaaaammmmmeeee. I\u2019ve written before that Jonah never actually underwent any real growth along with why I felt that way, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that Koko didn\u2019t either. Nothing changed between the two and they weren\u2019t even all that interesting to begin with due to Jonah\u2019s repressed emotions and Koko\u2019s bad combination of grittiness and anime comedy. Whatever praise you could shower on them is mostly memetic aka the same source of praise given to L-Elf. As I also stated in that post, the writing is absolute pointless garbage with an ending so bad I actually wished for the Gundam 00 guys to save me. It was literally one of the worst open-ended things I have ever seen, period. The ending to Kare Kano was better than that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso since I want to pick on a low-hanging fruit that even the fans acknowledge, what the fuck is up with the action scenes in this show? The first episode alone had a car chase scenario where the vehicles looked like they were going at 35 MPH and it just got worse from there. Hell the animation for the entire show is unacceptable when compared to Flowers of Evil or even anime around 2001. The bodies are awkwardly drawn and the CG is laughable in every aspect of the word. There are literally fight scenes where the characters run up to each other and fire guns from ten feet away, and yet they don\u2019t hit each other. Explosions that occur are phoned in and have less of a threat than the green screen stuff in Mortal Kombat Annihilation. The plot armor is so inconsistently bad that it breaks all tension from the fights and what should be cool scenes end up boring me more than anything Bee Train could muster. Give me a reason to care about these action scenes Jormungand. Introduce some tension. Make them cool to look at. Don\u2019t introduce more plotholes than the new Spider-man movie (episodes 3 and 4 were just painful).\\n\\n\r\nJormungand was never a fun anime to watch, not even ironically. It\u2019s one of the biggest wastes of time I\u2019ve ever seen and I have no qualms with saying that Sword Art Online, Guilty Crown, Clannad, and Psycho-Pass are much better watches. Or if you want a good action anime, watch Darker than Black or Black Lagoon. Even the original Hellsing was far better put together than whatever crap Jormungand could come up with. Hell watch almost any anime aside from this turd, because there\u2019s nothing to recommend. The premise sucks. The action sucks. The characters suck. The pacing sucks. The writing sucks. The comedy sucks. The animation definitely sucks. If was to do a Tribute from a Hater on this thing, I\u2019d only be able to praise the fact that its topic is unique. But that\u2019s like praising a businessman in the transportation industry for suggesting we should invent teleporters, yet not having a single clue how to implement them.",

There's just one, huge problem. This is a show centred around dealing weapons, war and gunfights and yet the director seems to know absolutely nothing about any of the above. I'll list a few examples:\r\nOne scene has two people firing assault rifles at each other, full auto from about 10 metres away. AND NOT ONE BULLET LANDS. In this same scene, ariot shield is shown stopping multiple 7.62 rounds. A ballistic shield can do this, but not a riot shield, and my god would you feel the impact.\\n\\n\r\nAn assault rifle with a 30 rnd magazine will on average give you 2.2-2.5 seconds of firing at full auto. These guys must have some magic ass magazines because they get at least 15 seconds each.\\n\\n\r\nThey fire a javelin (a top down anti-armor weapon) which fires in a straight line for some reason, and also inexplicably ignores arming distance and just blows tf up when the dude fires it into his own vehicle. \\n\\n\r\nSome gals fire pistols at each other point blank, im talking about 4-5 mags each here and somehow they both dodge every single round and duke it out with their bayoneted pistols...\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty more examples, but you get the idea.

            "content": "It is commonplace to assume that the arms industry will observe a boom in demand during times of war and little during 'peaceful' times but unfortunately that isn't the case giving the sorry state of the world. Terrorism, uprisings and vast amount of budgeting for security has made arms dealing one of the most profitable modern professions today.\r\nJormungand was originally a manga by by Keitar\u014d Takahashi. It follows the adventures and exploits of the young and cunning shipping heiress Koko Hekmatyar as she travels around the world selling weapons together with her group of bodyguards. The latest addition to her squad is a child soldiercalled Jonah who claims to loathe weapons and warfare but unfortunately has no choice but to use them due to his occupation and state of the world.\\n\\n\r\n The plot in Jormungand is pretty straightforward and simple, selling arms, but how and the situation koko's group gets into to do this is both mediocre and exciting at the same time. Believe it or not, dealing in private arms is a perfectly legal profession in most countries. Most arms dealers that do get arrested aren't arrested because of their profession but because of import and export laws, or U.N. sanctions that are being circumvented and the series does hint at this in the first couple episodes. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately its not all fun and games, the series being about selling arms gave alot of attention to 'arms' but the selling part was giving very little attention, i felt it would have been a nice addition and would have given the show a bit more sense of realism. At the start we are told that Jonah resents arms dealers due to his past but Jonah shows absolutely no amount of resentment towards Koko from the offset, a little resentment initially and gradually bonding would have been a nice way for the story to flow and build up their relationship but sadly it didn't. In Koko's defense though her personality is very likable and not something one can resent even if they tried.\\n\\n\r\nWhite fox have done a nice job with delivering stunning visuals throughout the show, art was good, scenery and locations also. The design and facial details of characters made them stand out with the artists going for darker pencil lines and color tones that really made the dark aspect of the show stand out. The design of the weapons were done in good detail but i wished more attention should have been given as to what type of weapon was being used at the time. There are also certain firefights where for sure our protagonists would be in a pinch but would always seem to come out unscathed as if having divine protection from the animators.\\n\\n\r\nAll the voice actors were top notch but might intially take a liitle getting used to, in the end all gave astounding performances to even the supporting characters. The OP, Borderland by Mami Kawada is an upbeat J-pop song that really went well with the tone of the show, pumping up audiences for the episode to come. The ED, Ambivalentidea by Nagi Yanagi although a slow paced song seemed surprisingly a good fit and it felt as though it complemented the upbeat OP and in a ways bringing balance to the overall feel. The BGM were nicely done too and the OST CD is definitely a look out for whenever it comes out. The most important sound aspect for the show is inevitably the weapons and it received composite attention, all sounds were in line with real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe place the series takes a bit of a headfall is with character development, Koko, Jonah and one or two of Koko's team members are developed well but the remaining were given very little detail, at times i thought some characters were new additions to her team cause i had never seen them before but only to go back to a previous episode to see that they were present but just lack of screen time was hampering them. We cant really blame them for this since it s just a 12 episode show but the very little introduction brings the show down a bit. The number of Koko's team itself i felt was a bit of a problem, it's just too much and other arm dealers we encounter have a more manageable size of bodyguards .\\n\\n\r\n Its not all bad on the characters sides though, the few people we did see development was done well and kept enjoyable, Koko's cunning is also fun to watch but the humor is something the show wasnt much good at and tries to apply it in situations rather than speech. \\n\\n\r\nDialogue between characters were handled professionally but there were a few places where audiences would be scratching their heads not knowing what was going on though. The choice of sometimes switching names of countries with simple letters like 'country T' i felt was not a good idea. The show seemed to somewhat over rely on the characters personalities a lot to deliver and not really on the story much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Jormungand is a good show and definitely one of the better shows of 2012, it is very enjoyable all through and one of the better thriller animes out there and makes enough impact to trade blows with shows like Black Lagoon any day. All in all you'll discover the life of an arms dealer is more than meets the eye and tricks such as being a professional in using different types of weapons wont get you much far and cunning and wit need to be added to the package.",

            "content": "Ok, so the 1st season of this anime has ended and we all look for ward on the next season, and it is suggested that the main  baddie involves the so called \"Bookman\" ..... obviously he's the guy whom we saw who met up with \"R.\"\r\nBut let's have a short quiz first:\r\nI.True or false\r\n1. The former Soviet Union was the biggest supplier of weapons during the cold war.\r\n             a. true      b false\r\n2. The \" Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \u2014 Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo,\" or better known as\" FARC\"  is currently the most active revolutionary insurgency group in South America particularly in Colombia.\\n\\n\r\n   a.true       b. false\\n\\n\r\n3. The Mexican Drug Cartel is only involved in smuggling and dealing in drugs. \\n\\n\r\n  a. true    b.false\\n\\n\r\n4. The Chicago Mob (Mafia) is currently the biggest criminal organization in the US.\\n\r\n       a.true    b. false\\n\\n\r\nLet me remind you that the question being ask here were related to the anime itself, though you can choose to brush this quiz aside it can only prove that you ain't interested to know at all.\\n\\n\r\nOk enough of the BS, so what now? Just kidding, Since this anime has a Action, Adventure, Military and seinen genre in it, it actually has the following; the flare of James Bond combine with the action of \"The Unit\" with the addition of black comedy of  \"Sons of Anarchy.\"  It kinda looks like that the author himself, Keitaro Motonaga may have had his inspiration with regards to these shows. However, he may have also gotten some inspiration  that happened in real life  and I'm referring to the \"Iran-Contra\" scandal where during 1986  the Reagan Administration violated their own arms embargo to Iran and Israel serves as the middle man between the US and Iran which cause a ruckus in US Congress. In which this anime may be a metaphor for that kind of incident. In reality an arms smuggler like  Koko Hekmatyar would not last 5 mins out there and we are talking about every law enforcement agency including the Interpol would would be knocking in her front door and she'll run out places to hide just like what happen to infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1993. You see the business of being a middleman in arms smuggling is not as glamorous as that of Koko in fact the job itself is as risky as drug smuggling, but unlike drug smuggling, arms smuggling is only cruel to black marketeers but not to arms manufactures and in the countries where they reside. So for the story since the plot varies from episode to episode and there is that element of realism in it  I gave it a \"Good\" number 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nOk, usually I really don't comment much about the art of an anime, but I really like the way them amazon were drawn like Valment, Karen, Curry and Chiquita  it seems that the illustrator may have gotten the idea of using Japan's famous  female body builder Tomoko Kanda as a model for the said female cast of this anime which I like.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI simply hate both the opening and closing themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the roles that were fitted into the characters, co'z how they were drawn actually matches them perfectly. Take for example Koko Hekmatyar, one can see that she the good, the bad and the ugly. Good because her posses respect her and she has a way that commands the respect of her would be killers, she's bad co'z if one crosses her it is open season for him and she ugly co'z.............she's smart, cunning and generous, but she simply ugly and I kind hate her for being a lolicon since it is very obvious that she has hots for Jonah. Valmet on the other hand kinda strikes me as both a Milf and a hot Fbb which I find her as awesome, since I kinda have a thing for Milf's and Fbb's. Jonah, for me he looks like grown man in a boy's body, which if I can have it my way I would have love to tie him unto a ICBM and launch him in the sky. You know, I would have wish that Chinatsu better known as \"Commando Girl\" would have had some uncensored fanservice with regards to her butt to add some spice to her character even thought she only appeared in 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7 and Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyable part of this 12 episode 1st season is the gun fight, blood and gore and some good fanservice from the Valment, you can really say that this anime is for seinen who would like a good action and adventure kind of thing, Overall, White Fox studio really did a good action pack anime which deserves a 2nd season. So even if the 2nd season is yet to come I wonder if the \"Bookman\" will be able to tame the \"Jormungand\"( which by the way I'm referring to Koko)? I guess we'll find out when the 2nd season arrives.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBTW, how about another set of Jormungand quiz?\\n\\n\\n\r\n5. What is the name of the Surface to Air Missile (SAM) system that was shown in episode 2?\\n\\n\r\na. Hawk  b. Stinger  c. Patriot\\n\\n\r\n6. One of Koko's mercenaries is a former \" Bersaglieri,\" question, what is a\" Bersaglieri?\"\\n\\n\\n\r\na. An elite unit of the Russian Army   B. An elite unit of  the Royal Army (UK)\\n\\n\r\nc. An elite unit of the Italian Army\\n\\n\\n\r\n7. A Javelin is a form of ____________.\\n\\n\r\na. Artillery    b. Sniper Rifle     c. Shoulder Fired Missile \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nThe following is my review and analysis of Jormungand 1 and 2. The following contains SPOILERS!!!\r\nBlack Lagoon abandoned the cliche of heroic nice guy protagonists and gave viewers a team of   highly morally dubious protagonists who get in epic gun fights and pull jobs for the Mafia. What if you took it one step further and made an anime where you the viewer are flat out asked to root for the bad guy? This is that anime! The main character is a completely ruthless arms dealer that is like a combination of Nick Cage's character in Lord of War with The Major fromHellsing. She is a perpetually grinning, maniacal sociopath who wishes to ultimately rule the world and will destroy anyone and everyone between her and her goal. However, I HIGHLY suspect that Jormungand doesn't actually want the viewer to root for her. Actually I am almost certain that Jormugand is a satire in which the main character Koko Hekmatyar represents the United States and its foreign policy from a Japanese perspective. If you don't believe me, read the next paragraph. The show gives a LOT of evidence to support this!\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Hekmatyar was born in international waters and doesn't belong to any nation, but her father is an American and CEO of one of America's largest companies. This giant American company violates every international law and is secretly the world's largest arms dealer. This is a reference to the fact that the United States is the world's largest weapons exporter. Secondly, the name Hekmatyar for our main character was taken from real life terrorist Galbuddin Hekmatyar, who was heavily backed by the United States to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan...despite the fact that he was a brutal war criminal who was far worse than the Soviets . He later betrayed the US and became a leading member of Al-Qaeda, which he still is to this day. Thirdly, the sidekick of our MC Koko Hekmatyar is an Arab child soldier named Jonah Al-Mar. Neither Mar or Al-Mar are actual Arab names. Al-Mar is the name of a knife company that makes the combat knives for the United States Army. 4th, the bodyguard and leader of Hekmatyar's elite special forces is a Finnish mercenary. The US special forces were founded by a Finnish mercenary named Lauri Allan T\u00f6rni (Larry Thorn)...who was an ex-SS war criminal. The US let him out of jail early in order to teach American soldiers how to fight as ruthless and badass as the Waffen SS. 5th, in the first episode, Hekmatyar kills a bunch of Russians in order to become the sole arms dealer to what she calls a \"cluster of backwater countries in Eastern Europe\". This is a reference to how after defeating Russia in the Cold War, the US expanded NATO to control all of Eastern Europe and is now in fact the sole weapons dealer to all the countries of Eastern Europe except Belarus and Ukraine(yet). 6th, Hekmatyar's plan to take over the world involves a series of weapons satellites that will shoot down all planes in the world that are not under her control. This will give her absolute air power advantage and global domination. This is a reference to SDI, a US military project in the 1980s to build weapons satellites that would shoot down any incoming missiles and allow the US to nuke any opponent without having to worry about counter-attack. This would have given the US total control of the world, although the project was actually propaganda to scare the Soviets and was never technologically feasible, at least not in the 1980s. Lastly, Hekmatyar tells Al-Mar that her plan will shoot down all passenger planes currently flying, but 600,000 to 700,000 people is a small price to pay for the end of war under her total global domination. The number of casualties she estimated is in fact the exact same number of Japanese civilians killed by the US air force in WW2, which Japan feels America very coldly excused by saying it was necessary to end the war (and in Japan's view rule the world). These are just a few of the many examples. If you were paying attention and know something about history and politics, this is hard not to notice. Of course...it could just all be coincidence and this is just a shitty anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series has LOTS of gun and weapons porn with all the tanks, helicopters, and gun models presented quite accurately. I wish I could say the same about the character models. Why the hell do the Arabs have white hair and red eyes? I know the Ishvalen's were supposed to represent Arabs, but this is our planet and not some alternate dimension! Just make them look like Arabs! Also, Hekmatyar is supposed to be an ethnic Pashtun (largest ethnic group in Afghanistan), but doesn't look remotely Pashtun! If you can make your M16s and your Hi-24 helicopters look accurate, why not your Arabs and Pashtuns? WTF?!\\n\\n\r\nThe series gives us a highly unconventional protagonist, LOTS of action, lots of accurate weapon models for military geeks, and unless it was the world's largest coincidence, a lot of brutal satire. Obviously I can't know the writer's intentions, so the satire element is speculative and whether or not the author's intention takes away from potential value as a satire is an entirely different lengthy discussion. This at first looks like a pretty mediocre anime, but if you look at it the right way, it makes for a pretty interesting show overall. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cFun, funny and fast-passed, a well-driven action focused show\u2026 A \u2018Lord of War\u2019 (movie) meets \u2018Black Lagoon\u2019 (anime) kind of thing\u201d\r\nREVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!\r\nWe all have seen war, whether depicted in movies, games, books or through news channels or even in your own life, but not many things talk or show us about the dark and \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d scenario that takes place during those wars, revolutions or fights of any kind, and by the \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d I mean those person that finance \u2013whether a group or militia- with weapons. Movies like \u201cLord of War\u201d (Nicolas Cage) or \u201cThe International\u201d (Clive Owen) come to mind, so what makes\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d such an acclaimed show? \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-STORY: 7-\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve already stated on my \u201cintroduction\u201d something that its main focus is built around arms dealing isn\u2019t one of the most original things ever, nevertheless it IS a setting that hasn\u2019t been overused like let\u2019s say the topic of WWII. So one of the main things \u2013probably- that has captivated the viewers \u2013in addition to the story- into watching \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is the uniqueness of its main emphasis, the arms dealing and not like most action/adventure shows which main focus \u2013usually- is the war itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe story department is simple \u2013at least the first season-,it\u2019s filled with well-achieved action moments, there are some \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201ctouching\u201d memories of the main characters and it\u2019s well-driven, but then again the show falls a few times on one of those typical repetitive patterns shown in plenty other anime. Don\u2019t misunderstand me; the story is great, not a masterpiece \u2013without a doubt- but not a boring one. In addition, \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is one of those shows in which every single one of the main characters are bad-asses, which means that they will always find a way \u2013effortlessly, if I may add- to save the day \u2013their day, of course- thing that by the end of the show leaves you wanting something \u201celse\u201d or \u201cmore\u201d, maybe a little more passion or meaningfulness should be thrown into the story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the characteristic that I find attractive and kept me watching the show is the fact that one of the main characters \u2013Jonah- is against guns and thus bringing an interesting \u201csub-plot\u201d within the show. Another characteristic that makes this show \u201clikeable\u201d \u2013or pleasant, if you will- is the fact that is engaging, interesting and enticing for it isn\u2019t you every-day-war-kind-of-anime. Another aspect is that the show wasn\u2019t always about just guns, most of the times it is but there are some moments that are more focused on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the first season of \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d was probably just made to place and prepare the \u201cboard\u201d for what\u2019s \u2013probably- coming- \\n\\n\\n\r\n-ART: 8- \\n\r\n\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d the art shown on the show is remarkable, it isn\u2019t a masterpiece or the jewel of the show but it isn\u2019t something \u201cwanting\u201d either. It\u2019s detailed, in most aspects, especially when talking about guns and action scenes, that\u2019s where the magic of the art team of \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d shines. Also, the characters designs are appealing and believable.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-SOUND: 7-\\n\r\nThe show contains very talented voice actors that transfer their mood/feelings to the viewers, although the script isn\u2019t one of the most \u201cdeep\u201d and meaningful things in the world, it looks like it was more action oriented but still, there ARE indeed some reflective moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe music by Takau Iwasaki  is good, it\u2019s a wide range of music styles from music containing ethnic sounds \u2013focused on the country they\u2019re in-, or fast passed compositions made to fit in the moment.  Nevertheless, the soundtrack isn\u2019t a masterpiece or something that is imposing anything interesting, it\u2019s just a soundtrack that tries \u2013and fails, in my opinion- to hype you up. To put it bluntly the soundtrack is shallow, it\u2019s like they tried to have a soundtrack for the sake of just having a soundtrack and not to evoke feelings \u2013other than excitement-. \\n\\n\\n\r\n-CHARACTER: 9-\\n\r\n\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is made in a 12 episode-format show, which \u2013as I\u2019ve stated before- is usually counterproductive when talking about the \u201cCharacter Department\u201d subject, since most shows aren\u2019t able to develop something or they just lack it or the characters just lack to back bone, but it is probably \u2013in my opinion- the best department in \u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much character development per se in this show, it has some but most focused into \u201cfriendship\u201d in a dimmed kind of way, its faint.  \\n\r\nWhat makes the characters so well-achieved is that they\u2019re interesting, they are appealing, they have a past and most importantly everyone has a goal or a believe, making the character department rich and slightly well-grounded.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-ENJOYMENT: 9 & OVERALL: 8-\\n\r\n\u201cJORMUNGAND\u201d is one of those shows that you love primarily because of the characters within it. It\u2019s a fast passed, well-driven enjoyable show. \\n\r\nBut as I said before, the season one looks like just like a preparation for what\u2019s to come.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "TL;DR Jormungand is a good series.\r\nJormungand is the story of a crew of arms dealers, led by the charismatic Koko Hekmatyar. The series is mostly episodic, weaving in some character arcs on the way. Usually the formula is this:\r\n1. The crew arrives.\r\n2. Stuff goes awry and they need a way out / need to out-think their opponents / straight up kill dudes.\r\n3. Mission completed and on to the next arc.\r\nPretty easy formula to make a series from. I\u2019m sure that if you\u2019ve heard about this series earlier, then you\u2019ve heard about the series that undoubtedly stands as a huge influence: Black Lagoon. Black Lagoon isabout a small group of people who conduct usually illegal business and get in trouble with all sorts of people. Jormungand is basically this, but with a bigger group. Now, obviously Jormungand isn\u2019t a straight rip-off of BL, it just builds from the same ground. While BL arcs usually comes together with cooperation and the combined with of the Lagoon Crew, Jormungand is basically The Koko Show. And that\u2019s perfectly fine. Koko carries the series very well. For a more fleshed out character run-down, look below:\\n\\n\r\nKoko Hekmatyar: Arms dealer, handling business mainly in Europe and Africa. Very charismatic and beautiful. Usually very energetic and behaving sometimes like a child, she has a ruthless interior and on multiple occasions called a monster. Although usually cool with a smile on her lip, Koko has one of the most intimidating glares in anime.\\n\\n\r\nJonah: Child soldier. His parents were killed in an air-strike and he became a child soldier shortly after. Has a strong hate for weapons, but still works for Koko, often serving as her bodyguard. He definitely shows more understanding than expected from a child.\\n\\n\r\nLehm: Ex-Delta Force operator. Used to be active in Somalia. Second in command of Koko\u2019s crew. Veteran mercenary who takes charge when armed conflict arises. Used to work for Koko\u2019s father. Very versatile in weapon use, ranging from long-distance sniping to close quarters combat.\\n\\n\r\nValmet: Ex-Major serving for UN forces in Africa. Her unit got slaughtered by Chen Guoming and she lost an eye in the attack. Since then, she suffers from anxiety whenever she sets foot in Africa. Very proficient with knives and pistols.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the rest of the cast, that aren\u2019t given much other than support roles most of the time. Technically only Koko and Jonah are the only real main characters, but Valmet and Lehm are given much more time on screen than the other side characters, so they sort of slide into main roles by association. The entire crew is 10 men strong, and the series struggle to give decent air time to all.\\n\\n\r\nThe big cast isn\u2019t a bad thing in itself, but it doesn\u2019t help either. It\u2019s quite logical that an arms dealer would have a decently sized squad with her, but most of the characters see very little air time. Most characters get to have their arcs play out (some might have theirs in the second season) sooner or later, but it\u2019s a shame we aren\u2019t given more time to know the entire cast better. Especially since they keep being given airtime and dialogue with Koko that are defined by their characters and their pasts, both of which we don\u2019t know. Valmet's arc is especially strong. The characters mostly revolve in and out when they have an arc or not. When they\u2019re around, they contribute to the colourful group of people.\\n\\n\r\nTo my surprise, there is little discussing of morality around, especially considering Jonah is a fucking child soldier. Sure, it\u2019s brought up, but quickly shot down at times. Let\u2019s be frank about this, the characters in the show aren\u2019t good guys. They\u2019re varying degrees of bad, I guess. Or, a better way to put it would be that they are all in the moral grey zone. They\u2019re portrayed romantically as the heroes, so naturally you\u2019re going to root for them when the oddball villains pop up to kill them. I wanted to see some more discussion or feelings about war, than what we got. It is a character-driven drama/action series, which is right up my ally, but I feel they do themselves a disservice to skip some strong discussion points on the way. And it\u2019s topical because, you know, there\u2019s tons of child soldiers in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, there\u2019s not a whole lot to be had, except for when the supporting characters have their arcs. The story follows the crew as they deliver and/or sell weapons and other necessities to a diverse set of people. They\u2019re usually dealing in Europe and Africa through the season. Then there\u2019s usually a villain for each episode, with some villains lasting another one or two more. The formula mentioned before is how the episodes unfold.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that quickly stands out is the very distinct art-style. It\u2019s not super drastically different compared to most other anime. It\u2019s usually very realistic, sometimes with some exaggerated details, usually the eyes. For the most part it\u2019s absolutely gorgeously drawn and animated. Backgrounds are usually done nicely as well, and at times with great and impressive detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is excellent across the board. The only drawback is that there\u2019s rarely chances for the actors to use a wider range than slow drama and some comedy here and there. The soundtrack is good when used. Pretty sweet electronic battle music. OP (opening theme) and ED (ending theme) are both excellent songs.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the general theme of the show goes, it\u2019s usually a slow-paced drama with some comedy blended in. Then there\u2019s the occasional high-speed action scenes when deals either go tits-up or there\u2019s other people that want to hit Koko\u2019s group.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the comedy, it\u2019s a bit too much. I would have prepared being almost completely without it. In the most serious episodes, there\u2019s practically none of it, and they\u2019re so much better off without. The comedic parts being randomly inserted here and there just disturb the pacing and atmosphere of the series. It just feels like something inserted to please the mainstream audiences. The thing is though, that this isn\u2019t really a series made for mainstream audiences. It\u2019s about killers and mercenaries selling weapons to guerillas and warlords. Not something that you want your kids or the family to sit down and watch in the evening. Inserting comedy into the formula is detrimental to the concept and leaves us a worse product to enjoy. I want to stress that I\u2019m not anti-comedy, but doing it as half-heartedly and shallow as it is here it can only work badly.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists that pop into the episodes are along the lines of the comedic tendencies mentioned. They\u2019re almost always very eccentric or have some crazy fighting style. In some arcs it works, like when the crew goes to Africa and come face-to-face with an old enemy of one of the crew members. They usually don\u2019t take anything away from the enjoyment, but they don\u2019t usually add to it either.\\n\\n\r\nAn excellent scene which stands as a display of how good the drama of the series can be is when it's brought up that killing to much people can make you \"a dragon,\" and a character asks Koko if she would ever become one. The scene is unbearably tense for it's short running time, and shows how good the series is when it sticks to straight-up drama instead of faffing about with random comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, it\u2019s great. While not being the best I\u2019ve veer seen, this series is highly enjoyable. It\u2019s variance is it\u2019s strength, and while I don\u2019t usually like the comedy, some light-hearted scenes are always good in a series like this, and some scenes succeed in being genuinely funny. From slow-paced planning with some tense meetings with antagonists; to high-speed gun-play and chase-scenes, Jormungand is one hell of a ride, and it\u2019s a pleasure watching it. While not always ending in cliffhangers, the show still gets you excited to watch the next episode after you finish one, and that\u2019s high praise for a series. Jormungand is a delight to watch, and should be seen by people interested in serious drama, and is obviously very recommended for fans of Black Lagoon.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like it, check out it\u2019s sequel, Jormungand: Perfect Order.",

Is the anime successful in doing justice to the theme- absolutely not. It doesn't show the expected hear wrenching realities and emotional conflicts or brutalities of the profession but instead the author decides to take a very childish take on the matter which is make the arms dealer an eccentric, charismatic and mysterious person who is able to command respect from her subordinates who are some killers who have come from various walks of life. One of them actually isa child soldier who hates arms dealers because of the atrocities done to him but finds himself having fun with the person. I have to say that justice has e not been do the plot at all. But ignoring this part and assuming that nothing that good can be expected from this series you could have fun just watching the action in it and appreciate the plots too. The character of the child soldier is the most mysterious one and the most interesting to watch and thats the only part of the story that made it watchable.",

            "content": "The Positive Side: Jormungand follows the travels of Jonah, a child soldier with a hatred of weapons, as he serves as body-guard to an eccentric and playful arms-dealer, Koko Hekmatyar.\r\nOne of Jormungand\u2019s greatest strengths is in the way it handles its sprawling cast.  Each member of Koko\u2019s motley crew of bodyguards has a different set of skills, a distinct personality and a different philosophical perspective.   Almost everyone is given an episode or two in the spotlight, and in just a short period of time with any given character, you can get a very strong sense of who they are.  It\u2019s difficultfor a series with a cast this large to achieve this kind of distinction, but character development is one area where Jormundgand shines.  Even the villains, however briefly they appear on screen, bring with them unique quirks and the remnants of their personal histories.\\n\\n\r\nThe most memorable character of the lot is easily Koko.  She grins and jests her way through the tensest of situations, her skylarking and casual demeanor betraying her brilliant coordination of her team.  She\u2019s the perfect blend of silliness, wisdom and charm, like an albino, gun-slinging Willy Wonka.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the market saturation of supernatural/scifi Shonen series, Jormungand serves as a refreshing reminder that you don\u2019t need super-powers to make an action-scene sizzle.  Fights range from chaotic, urban gun-battles to smooth sniper-executions to a beautiful knife-fight set in a secluded clearing of a snowy forest.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily episodic, each new episode setting up a new antagonist for Koko, Jonah and the rest to overcome, and it is not until the end of the series that it becomes clear what all this has actually been building up to.  Like Cowboy Bebop before it, Jormungand proves that an episodic structure can work wonderfully as long as each separate story is well-executed.\\n\r\nThematically, this is a story about the reconciliation between killing and morality.  Koko strives to prove to Jonah that simply because she and rest of the group are in the moral grey by the very nature of their business doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have fun and mess around on their days off.  Koko repeatedly proves that she truly does care about her team, that she wishes to avoid killing when it is unnecessary, and that she has principles she refuses to violate.\\n\r\nThe English dub is very well-acted, thanks to the talents of Funimation, and while the music can be a bit grating and synthetic at points, the opening theme really grew on me after a couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative Side: While a fairly intelligent show in terms of theme and the impact of war, Jormundgand\u2019s greatest failure comes from backing itself into a philosophical corner.  It\u2019s difficult to talk about the ending without giving spoilers, but I will do my best to keep this vague for the would-be viewer\u2019s benefit.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, when we learn of Koko\u2019s ultimate goal, we find that she is about to do something morally horrifying for the sake of what she believes is the greater good.  It\u2019s supposed to be a huge moral quandary, but the flaws in the plan become obvious when given the slightest degree of consideration.  In fact, Koko\u2019s own brother points out the faults in what she\u2019s doing not long after she unveils her grand plan.  The problem is, by the time her plan is revealed to be grossly philosophically imbalanced, the series is out of time, and has nowhere left to go.  While the ending is nowhere near as bad as a few other series I\u2019ve watched (The Big O, Deadman Wonderland), it\u2019s still rather unsatisfying, especially compared to the show\u2019s stellar Season 1 finale.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Despite its lack-luster ending, Jormungand boasts strong characterization, action and plotting.  It\u2019s definitely worth watching, especially if you\u2019re a fan of Seinen and war stories.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes I get a review request and have no idea what to expect. Jormungand is one of those times. I'd barely even heard of it when I got the request and the name tells me nothing aside from that there's a possible connection to Norse mythology. From what I can tell, the manga was written by Takahashi Keitaro and the anime was brought to us by Geneon and White Fox. It's not a whole lot to go on, so let's just dive in and see what the anime is about.\r\nI quickly discovered to some minor disappointment, that Jormungand has nothing whatsoever to do with Norsemythology. No, I will not hold that against the anime. I may be highly critical, but that would just be taking it too far. There isn't much in the way of story in Jormungand. There's an arms dealer named Koko who travels with a group of bodyguards, including a child soldier, an ex-mafia agent and several former soldiers. Most of the episodes have very little to do with each other. Rather, they show the group undertake different missions. There are both good and bad things about this approach. On the positive side, it allows for a variety of situations and locales. It also allows for more of a character focus. On the downside, since things jump around there isn't a whole lot that has any lasting impact. And, although it isn't an issue in the first season, the lack of a plot could easily lead to the episodes getting repetitive. It also has to rely heavily on its characters in lieu of a story.\\n\\n\r\nSo, does Jormungand have characters capable of sustaining it? I would have to say that it does. It has a very compelling, and awesomely quirky group. Koko is a lovable nutter. Valmet is both a total badass and quite adorable. Even the more secondary members of Koko's group are well done. Unfortunately, I did have one pretty substantial problem with the characters. And that's that the dynamic between Koko and Jonah, the child soldier, seems like its moving towards romance at some points. They had a great opportunity for a spectacular cast of characters and they compromised it by forcing the audience to question whether or not the main protagonist is a pedophile. What the hell Takahashi? Did you just not realise that that would be a problem? Were you trying to create a completely unique dynamic and just didn't notice how it could be construed as problematic? To be fair, it isn't entirely clear in the anime whether she has an over-zealous platonic affection towards him or an attraction, but at the same time this isn't something that should be open to interpretation. I really hope that they better define Koko and Jonah's relationship in the second season and that it isn't supposed to be romantic. As it is, it's pretty suspect. \\n\\n\r\nLooking at the art, I can't say that I care for it that much. The characters tend to have bizarre faces and there are several who look just about the same. Don't get me wrong, I'm the only real criticism I have for it is that it really is hard to differentiate between some of the minor characters. I just personally didn't care for the style. The action sequences are really good. They manage to combine over the top elements with semi-realism in a way that really works. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the voice acting. Now, there are some major moments of over-acting but they all work in context and they do refrain from going overboard with them. Itou Shizuka Ohara Sayaka, Ishizuka Unsho, Koshimizu Ami and all of the other actors all do spectacular work. I wasn't nearly as fond of the music. Some of it's really good and does a lot to enhance the mood, but some of it falls pretty flat. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is easily a 6/10. Koko seems to attract quite a few other women, especially Valmet, who is unfailingly awesome. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Jormungand is a 7/10. Most of my problems with it are pretty minor and the biggest issue I have is more of something that's suspect than something that's definitively gone wrong. If you liked Black Lagoon, this is your type of anime. If you're looking for a good cast of characters, it won't disappoint. If you're looking for an impressive story, you should look elsewhere.",

I'll do my best to give some unbiased information about the anime while injecting my reasons for liking it as much as I do. But do keep in mind that bias. \r\nThis is mostly review of the first season, not the second, but it will show some aspects of the entire series in general. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nI loved the story in both seasons, but this is season 1 so I'll talk about thestory of season 1. Season one's purpose is to give you an idea about what Koko does, how she operates, and the general feel of Jormungand. It was REALLY fun to watch. The story arcs in the first seasons are entertaining, action-packed, and made me compelled to continue.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea how accurate this anime is when it comes to firearms, as I know shit about guns, but I would hope it's pretty accurate because this is an anime that revolves around an arms dealer. I also really don't know how accurate the anime is about actual combat, but I'm guessing that combat is not completely accurate, like most action anime. I mean, at some points Valmet and Chiquita hunt down many men with knives, despite the fact that the men have automatic weapons. Like any anime, you have to have a certain suspension of disbelief. I believe it's a lot more realistic with combat than other gun-based action anime like - say - Black Lagoon. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season has a very good story, but I feel it it isn't as good as the season second, so I must give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art style of the Jormungand anime is faithful to the manga, which was created by Keitarou Takahashi. I personally LOVE the art style of his work, and therefore I love the art style of the anime. The animation quality itself is pretty great, but I've seen better quality animation before so I believe 8/10 is appropriate. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. My god, the soundtrack on this anime is amazing. A few of these soundtracks by themselves are my favorite songs of all time. The \"beautiful\" ones are Essentia (even if you hate the anime, you have to admit that Essentia is beautiful), Cogito Ergo Sum, Lamento, Tristeza, and Meu Mundo Amor. And Jormungand, the first song on the soundtrack, is..... powerful. There are tracks that pump you up like Time To Attack. Many of them give nice atmosphere such as Poached Egg, Masala Dosa, Jonathan. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nKoko Hekmatyar:\\n\\n\r\nShe is what sold the series for me. Koko has been an arms dealer since she was very young, as shown in flashbacks. She's mysterious, powerful, a great leader to her soldiers, and always has an edge over everyone else. She's kind to her subordinates, but ruthless to those who oppose her.  If you watch her for more than an episode, you find out she's pretty eccentric. Sometimes, she acts youthful and childish, and will be the \"kind older sister\" to Jonah or the fun boss to her soldiers. Sometimes she is the practical businesswoman that knows how to get her way in a deal. Other times she's a complete monster who will completely fuck you up if you do something that she views is wrong (for example, don't give Koko drugs instead of money.) She knows how to play her cards, what faces to wear, and what battle tactics to use to get out of a situation alive. \\n\\n\r\nShe has a.... very twisted idea of world peace, to say the least, but I don't mind that. It gives her character a lot of depth. She is the epitome of meaning that just because you don't agree with their methods or their world view, it doesn't mean they are not a fantastic character. I find that people dislike certain parts of the series because of her twisted goals on how to achieve world piece. I'm not going to spoil what her goals are, but I will say this: who cares? The method is EXTREMELY flawed, I know that for sure, but I respect her for it anyway. She put her money where her idea was and sought to achieve it, believing it was the right thing to do. Flawed, but something I can respect. That is more season 2 though, so I will not expand on that part any more. \\n\\n\r\nShe's also a complete badass. She was physically assaulted twice in the first season. With the first person, she kept smiling while blood was trickling down her face, then pretended to pull a trigger and - with her \"bang\" - her sniper got the man. The second time she was hit in the face by Scarecrow, and she did nothing but tell him he was an insect that was nothing to her. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the Japanese and the English voice actresses did a superb job, but I personally favor Anastasia Munoz's performance (she's my favorite English voice actress, as I find her voice incredibly sexy). If you want a younger, more bubbly sounding Koko watch the Japanese version. If you want a calmer, more mature sounding Koko, watch the English version. \\n\\n\r\nValmet:\\n\\n\r\nShe's missing an eye and can still outdo almost every single fighter in the entire anime. She's the resident knife-wielder of Koko's team, and is NOT someone to mess with. Her story arc at the end of the first season adds personality to her, and you can see she is more than a knife-wielding lesbian who is in love with Koko. She is a former Finnish special ops soldier who has been haunted by her past for many years, and is on a journey to get her revenge, no matter what it takes to do it. \\n\\n\r\nBoth voice actresses did a fantastic job.\\n\\n\r\nJonah:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the series, alongside Koko. The story of Jormungand begins with him. \\n\r\nHe absolutely hates weapons, but he can't live without them, as he is a child soldier that is working for Koko Hekmatyar as part of a deal with her older brother Kaspar. His family was killed by same kind of weapons that Koko sells, so he dislikes anyone who deals with weapons, but you can tell that he doesn't dislike Koko as a person. He has a lot of conflict within him, which isn't easy to tell at first because he is so stoic. \\n\\n\r\nAs I just barely said, he is stoic and cold on the outside despite being a child. He is perceptive, intelligent, brave, a quick thinker, and is mature for his age. He still has childish tendencies, like skipping his math lessons and not wanting to remove the bullet embedded in him because he does not like needles. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else on Koko's team (Lehm, Wiley, Ugo, Lutz, R, Toujo, Mao) are not explored as much as those three, but they aren't life-less. They have character traits, personalities, and aspects that you could describe and get a feel of.  \\n\\n\r\nBoth voice actors did well. He sounds a lot younger and more matter-of-fact in the Japanese version, while he sounds older and slightly more abrasive in the English version. \\n\\n\r\nKaspar:\\n\\n\r\nI love Kaspar. He's pretty affable at times, but he's a completely charming asshole. He's a lot like Koko in the way that they can be completely ruthless, but he is not as kind as her in the first place. He has a more practical world-view than his sister does, but has no desire for world peace as he is an arms dealer after all. \\n\\n\r\nBoth Japanese and English voice actors did a splendid job make him sound like a charming ass.\\n\\n\r\nChiquita: \\n\\n\r\nThe only notable member on Kaspar's unit. She's the resident knife-wielder of Kaspar's team. Like Koko, she has an ever-present smile, but Chiquita's is MUCH more unsettling. You can tell that she is loving every second of her job, as she is thrown into combat often. She's not in season one as much as in season two, but she's still present whenever Kaspar is there. She's also Lehm's ex-wife.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Japanese and English voice actors did well. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters:\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to list all the enemies and allies, it would take days and days. I feel that Jormungand did pretty well overall on the characters. They had personalities, traits, goals, and felt human, even if they weren't explored too much.\\n\r\nAlso, I believe everyone's voice actors did well in both the Japanese and English versions. I do prefer the English version because of Anastasia Munoz, but it doesn't really matter which one you watch because both are well done. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n10/10. As I said before, this is my favorite anime, so it's a 10/10 for enjoyment. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Since you have to choose between either a nine or a ten, I put a 10. If you add all of the scores in the individual categories up and divide them by the number of categories, you get an average of 9.2 for this anime. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you are reading this because you have not yet seen this anime and want to see if it is the right show for you then please keep in mind that this is my opinion and may differ from your own so please keep your own tastes in mind when you are reading this. If you have already seen this anime then you are just along for the ride.\r\nIntro:\r\nI heard about this anime from various places but I have never heard too much about it and I wasn't particularly sure what to think of it until one day when I had nothing to do, soI figured I would take the plunge; having no idea what to expect. I wound up with a pretty pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character:\\n\r\nJormungand is a dark gritty and sometimes comical seinen (geared for a more mature audience) action series about an arms dealer named Koko and her elite team of badass bodyguards and a child soldier named Jonah who is their new recruit into the team and chronicles all of the adventures they have though a mostly episodic set up.\\n\r\nMy overall impression of the story and anime in general was pretty good, it had some pretty great action in the form of gun fights, knife fights, fist fights, etc. and a somewhat compelling plot about war and morality on the side. This show was also funny especially with some of the interactions between the characters, Koko's team in particular showing that the all have a pretty good bond and have worked together for a wile. This show is mostly episodic so most of the episodes are pretty self contained.\\n\r\nThe characters for the most part are very fleshed out with there own past though not all of them are until the second season but never the less all of the characters were fun and entertaining. I also especially liked the attention to detail some of the use of weapons and firearms in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe art and animation was pretty good and had some really good character designs and it had a nice gritty look to it.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was ok but it wasn't the best but my favorite part was the sound design and yet again they had really good attention to detail to what the guns sound like.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub:\\n\r\nThere are animes out there that are to said to have a dub that is particularly better than the original, I believe this is one such anime and I don't say that lightly considering I normally take a neutral stance on this topic but after watching the dub I really didn't care to see the original subbed version and I'm saying the Japanese version is bad because it isn't but the english on this one is just a step above.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good and the voices in english fit the cast so well and dub is little more funny considering they did change some of the lines but subtitles don't always get it right not to mention the cast is kind of multinational with some characters having different accents and all of that just doesn't come crossed in Japanese. Now I'm not here to tell you what you should be watching but I will suggest that the dub for this anime, is defiantly worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Hated:\\n\r\nI did have some problems with this anime, one being that the main cast which is Koko's team of bodyguards are really overpowered to the point that you know how most of the gun fights and skirmishes are going to turn out with them coming out on top and sweeping away the bad guys. The second problem I had was that this anime despite all of it's action was very anti-climatic, like I said before the enemies and villains are swept away so easily to the point where it takes out most  of the excitement after a while and I feel that with many of the villains there was a lot of wasted potential with them considering most of them are killed off pretty quickly and a lot of them seemed like pretty interesting characters. But all in all that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7 out of 10.\\n\r\nIt's not perfect but it is pure unadulterated fun.",

            "content": "Jormungand \r\nStory:\r\nThe story doesn't have a really cohesive narrative arc but gets the job done mostly. There is a great deal of globe trotting so scenarios and environments do change up once in a while. Though the story has a rather humorous tone, there are some tragic moments like some of Jonah's flashbacks.\r\nArt:\r\nFor the most part, the artwork and animation is passable. The characters themselves have distinct appearances. However, I always feel that color scheme has a white hazy monochrome to it. Thankfully it's not too distracting. \r\nSound:\r\nThe music very good and really does get one pumped up for the action. The voice acting inboth Japanese and English audio is decent. On the subject of voice acting, the English dub isn't bad, but it doesn't really offer much. Compared to other similar shows like Black Lagoon, Cowboy Bebop, and Baccano!, the Jormungand's dub doesn't make the characters sound more emotive or natural as the appropriate ethnic accents, slang, and profanity are noticeably absent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters in Jormungand are decent archetypes with some having more personality than others. The main character Koko is a rather funny and likeable protagonist. Granted she's an arms dealer, but she does avoid causing unnecessary casualties and has an admirable leadership skills. Also her childish eccentric demeanor does make her stand out in a rather realistic environment. Ditto Jonah, whose social awkwardness does have a real sense of charm. The other characters are all right though some feel like they can use more development and personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall its a rather fun series. The action is intense and flashy. There are plenty of humorous moments. And there's a real attention to detail. However, I feel that Jormungand doesn't quite go far enough with narrative or do anything experimental. Still worth a watch. \\n",

            "content": "Many anime filled with guns are also filled with absurdities.  You either accept that or you don't, and that is key to your enjoyment of this series.  Even if you like the characters and the story, even if you suspend disbelief through the clunky dialogue and excessive exposition, you still have to get past the inaccuracies.  \r\nI remember one anime (Crystal something-or-other, I think) in which a man was shooting at some people hiding behind a table with what is clearly supposed to be a .44 Mag and being unable to hurt them through the table.  (Maybe that flimsy-looking wooden tablehas a titanium plate on the bottom...)  Shortly after that, one of the people behind the table shoots down a huge chandelier with one shot from a tiny pocket gun that might be a .380 at best.  I still chuckle when I remember that scene.  \\n\\n\r\nJormungand is no exception to this rule.  I only watched a little of it before I was distracted by more interested things, but I remember there being quite a bit of that stuff.  I found a couple things while skimming what I had seen before.  In episode one, someone loads a magazine from the wrong end.  In episode three, there is a machine gun that has bullets pointed toward the user.  For some reason, I doubt there are many of them that work that way.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately you need to decide for yourself if the show bothers you.  If what I have said makes you cringe, you are probably right to stay away.  If nothing I have said about Jormungand turns you off, you may very well find that you enjoy it.",

An arm dealer traveling with 9 elite bodyguards is not to be underestimated.\r\nI don't know about you guys, but the moment i saw this anime's banner, i thought to myself, \"Gosh, this would be another boring violent anime with SIMPLISTIC \"save the princess\" plotline\". Guess what? It's true!!!\r\nHowever, Jormungand is different. Your princess now is a dangerous person who are an evil genius and selling weapons across the world.\r\nOk, now for the interesting part [spoilers alert].\r\nPrepare yourself for an amazing experience by watching this anime. I have to admit, althoughthe base line is, as i said, SIMPLISTIC, as you go deeper into the anime you'll encounter a lot of emotional storyline. Hatred and betrayal are to be expected to be this anime, but Jormungand didn't stop there. Love, trust, revenge, affection, trickery, sarcasm, jealousy, admiration, etc , etc, etc, YOU NAME IT! It's all (most of it) there!!! Not only that, they also brought the problem that is existing in the world now. Child Soldier, Smuggling, Corruption, Illegal transaction, unhealthy competition, animal extinction, etc ,etc, etc, you'll find more and more as you progress through the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no telling of what going to happen next and they'll always hang you at the end of the episode. It motivates me to finish this anime in ONE SEATING!!(this anime is the first one that did it to me) It's 12 episodes of consistent thrill, action, drama and comedy! What more can you ask really??\\n\\n\r\nHow can you stop staring at this beautiful anime??? I mean Ms Hekmatyar might be a little bit creepy but look at how detailed they present the gun, the atmosphere, the humour, the expression of the characters... THEY NEVER FAILED TO AMUSE ME! It ables to convince me that a battlefield is fun @.@!! (I'm going nuts)*Please ignore my previous sentence*. Your ears will also certainly be entertained all the time. Music (from songs and instrumental melody, when i'm talking about instruments that include guns) is a harmony that will enrich your experience from watching this anime even more.\\n\\n\r\nNow, now... what about the characters? I TELL YOU THIS! THEY ARE AWESOME O.O!!! You got a dishonored major to a child soldier. Really, the variety of characters are so great, every character is very unique to their own background and speciality.\\n\\n\r\nYou  :  Well, you seems to like this anime a lot. But don't you think you're a little bit bias? All i can see is praise in your review.\\n\r\nMe   :  Fine, fine... Certainly this anime has it flaws. Sometimes Jormungand just brought its plot to somewhere else totally unconnected and their character development are not so in depth for everyone of them. There are a few loopholes here and there. Some of the things happened are also not explained fully.  But hey, these minor flaws are insignificant enough for me to say that this anime is EXCELLENT!!(Not yet a masterpiece, I must admit)\\n\\n\r\nAnd guess what? I want to bet that Jormungand 2 can overcome those flaws, thus making this anime A MASTERPIECE!! Muahahahahaha!!!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is worth your time to watch this anime (totally worth it). For you guys who don't like gun shooting anime or action anime, maybe you can find interest in the story and drama that this anime has to offer. As i said before, this anime can make us realise how troubled our world is.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : GO WATCH IT!!! DEFINITELY!!!\\n",

            "content": "Guns! War! And a crazy protagonist, what else could you ask for? Violence and gore? Check. Freaky dynamic characters? Check. A plot? Half-check. Jormungand is a very interesting anime that caught my eye when I was browsing through my list of anime to watch and here's why:\r\n- Story - \r\nThe story itself isn't too memorable. It followed a pseudo-enemy-of-the-week type of format, where the enemy of the week was an arc on its own. The drive was centered around arms dealers and the arms market. That might sound too professional, but whatever the plot was for the arc, it always accumulated to an epic deathmatchbetween teams of badasses with guns! Guns! It was epic! Chase scenes, snipe scenes, professional operations and all that glory. So the plot is a military-type plot, which in all fairness didn't quite mix with all the soft parts they threw in. The dynamic with the main character, Yoko Hekmatyar and Jonah was awesome. A kid who hates guns but is hired as a part of her elite team. But overall, the plot threw in the soft parts with a recurring quote: \"because I'm an arms dealer.\" Or with variants of that quote. It personally felt like mixing water with oil at cold temperatures.\\n\\n\r\n- Art -\\n\r\nThe studio that animated Jormungand was the one that did Steins; Gate. Was I impressed? Not particularly. This is a personal quirk but I found the art style emphasized odd eyelashes. I just could not for the life of me accept that the characters had to have those ridiculous add-ons. I loved the contrast of vibrant colours with the characters in them. I gotta praise the multiculturalism in the characters as well, it was emphasized in the characters' designs.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound -\\n\r\nIn my opinion the soundtrack was bland and boring. There wasn't much background music, which was fine in my opinion. I didn't think very much of the OPs but I'm generally not a fan of openings or endings. I think this anime shone without the need of music, which is a rather rare thing to happen.\\n\\n\r\n- Character - \\n\r\nThe main character, Koko Hekmatyar was an absolute badass leader. She alone was the charismatic leader and the driving force of her entire crew. Their backgrounds all revolved around how they met her, which put her at the center of the character development. She had almost no development as a character, but that's alright because her personality was extremely quirky. She has a bland background but a good drive to the \"plot\". Being the leader, she is also a target for the enemies so her part in the sub arcs are mainly calling the shots or being rescued. \\n\\n\r\nJonah was by far the most compelling character in the anime. He is the youngest and the most scarred, or at least the character with the best developed background. He has his quirks like the rest of the team but what seriously sets him apart is his innocent mix with the absolute badass side. He has his flaws and the down-to-earth non-murderous side of his life is actually quite well alluded to.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime quite a bit, even in the aftermath of thinking about it. The senseless violence was there, and the brainless gawking at the screen without thinking was by no means a waste of time. In terms of being a work, the anime put together several interesting ideas and tried to have its soft, light-hearted moments, which in my opinion didn't fully work with the setting. Overall, Jormungand is worth the watch for a very interesting, quirky anime full of guns!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Jonah is a a child soldier who hates guns and arms dealer who he hates because he blames the for selling the guns who killed his family. However, he ends up working as a body guard for the enigmatic illegal arms dealer Koko Hekmatyar.\r\nWith Jormungand we delve into the murky world of illegal arms dealing and the contradictions that go with. We follow Koko and her band of mercenaries as she makes arms deal with anyone who can make her money, rival arms dealers whilst dodging assassins and the CIA. One thing is for sure, where Koko goes death surely follows.\r\nOne thing Jormungand does toowell is glamourising the world of illegal arms dealing. One thing you have to remember none of the characters are nice people. On the surface the characters are very likable but this is a facade. Koko is fiercely loyal to those who follow her and that loyalty is returned but this loyalty has a price. She is extremely cunning, expertly hides her thoughts and will ruthlessly kill anyone who crosses her. Her mercenary bodyguards are really more like well armed killers. This contradiction is probably the point of Jormungand.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the morality of Jormungand. The art isn't the best but the story is good. The key to the whole anime is Koko Hekmatyar as you never know how she will handle any situation and it is this unpredictability that makes Jormungand enjoyable to watch and give the anime depth where it could have been just mired in gratuitous violence.\\n\\n\r\nA violent but well worked and very enjoyable anime but it could never be a classic.",

            "content": "When comparing this to relevant animations such as Black Lagoon, I was struck by a pleasant surprise. I first watched Jormungand on a whim to get more of the brainless action that I got from Black Lagoon. In that sense, I was left with disappointment when watching Jormungand, for it is not as braindead as one might think.\r\nThe story has a simple introduction of our main character, Jonah. He's a child who has lost his parents in a war and is now a child soldier in said war. What country this war takes place is unspecified (for the simplicity's sake, I reckon), but Jonah lookslike he's originating from the middle east. Shortly after, Jonah is introduced to the money-loving, top of the food-chain and absolutely nuts woman; Koko. Koko is part of her family's logistics company: HCLI. They transport weapons to clients and Jonah is now part of Koko's crew which consists of persons from all over the world, from various organizations and gangs or whatever it may be.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, the development is rather nice (maybe even more so than the second season, if you ask me!) and it was indeed a pleasant surprise when I first started watching. I'm not going to dive further into the various complex situations revolving around the story, that would just ruin the experience. I am, however, going to rate the story 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork isn't really standing out much, but it isn't necessarily bad either. There's multiple fast shooting-scenes and CQC (close quarter combat) involved, which in my experience tend to lead towards poorly animated frames, but Jormungand actually delivers quite well in that sense. Some of the scenes left me with a sense of disappointment due to some poor execution, but all in all, I can't really complain. 7/10 on art.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get into the real awesome part of Jormungand that really sets it apart from other action animations; sound. The soundtracks in Jormungand are fantastic. If you ever get to watch Jormungand, make sure you watch it with good headphones or with good speakers. The opening in both seasons really hyped me for what was about to come (even though it's stuffed with Engrish), but as I said, the soundtracks are what really makes it so damn good. I highly suggest that you look through the various OST's and listen through them thoroughly. Giving sound anything other than 10/10 would be unforgivable to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Jormungand don't really get introduced too much until the second season, where they try to focus on getting to know the background of all the characters. This may leave you a bit unsatisfied, but the characters themselves are still pretty damn awesome. The first season, I'd say, is more focused on Jonah and Koko, whereas the second season is more focused on the group as a whole. Anyhow, I will give character 7/10 for this one.\\n\\n\r\nMost important of all is, however, the enjoyment. I can gladly say that I indeed enjoyed watching armies getting slaughtered and see Sofia's mad skills with knives. Jormungand delivers, I have to say that, although it's not delivering all the way for me. It has good action, kickass sound and characters fit for the role, but in the end I think they needed more episodes to develop the story. My enjoyment rating on Jormungand is going to be 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Jormungand 8/10 and if you're looking for action that might not be as braindead as you think; you've come to the right place.",

Gunfights are boring and so bad and unrealistic that you must have talent to achieve that level of \"bad\", 90% of gunfights are just static animations of people shooting while laying down or while standing and it switches from good guys to band guys there is no tactical movement or anything to make the fight interesting or intense, you can skip 5 minutes of gunfights and you would not miss anything because after some time you realize that no one important can die, they are important for the story like ads when you watch youtube video.\\n\\n\r\nTherm \"arms dealer\" in this anime has nothing to do with real arms dealers, here they all have personal mini army and every character in group of one dealer is literally the same like in group from another arms dealer just different name and look, personality and abilities are the same and you get some stupid short poorly written story about some them that does not make you care more about character than before you know their \"story\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you expect any intellectual content like arms dealers outsmarting each others or police dont watch this, you might like this if you are 10 years old if you are not just go on some other anime dont experiment with this one it really is bad just as i said on the beginning read \"arch_nightmare\" review  and then imagine is says everything opposit, he really did good job with sarcastic review i am little mad because it was one of those that made me start watching this but in the end \"it is just a prank bro\".",

            "content": "Jormungand is about an arms dealer and her assistants. The story revolves around their adventures and their hidden objective. The story contains a lot of gun scenes and explosion. I recommend this to others and here's why.\r\nStory:\r\nYou might think that the story is just your normal rambo crap but its not. The story might but slow to develop but it is very interesting. It also involves brain games that can make you guess what will happen next. The series are divided into different arcs that may contain 2-3 episodes but each of it are interesting.\r\nArt:\r\nThe animation is very good given that it contains a lotof fight scenes that needs high frames per second. Those scenes are quite well done that really helps the mode of story. The blood scenes can be seen quite often so if don't like that scenes you might want to skip this anime. The background are well made and given that they go different places, the quality did not drop.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is also good. The ost's are great and it really helps in setting the mode. You can feel the excitement when needed and it really gets you going to watch more. Even in the preview track, the sound is really great that it will play in your head a number of times. Honestly, I always look forward to the preview track every time I watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development is discussed in the series. The lead is very interesting and really gives an impression. The sub characters might not be very interesting in the start but as the series goes on, you will learn a lot about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThere may not be a lot of fanservice but you can still find this series interesting and enjoyable. The story is good and the scenes are intense. I sometimes stop watching just to kill my over excitement when watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, I will recommend this anime given the ideas I discussed on the top. I'm sure you will not regret this because it's a complete package anime.",

            "content": "Jormungand has, to say the least, action. Lots and lots of action. If you like action movies like Rambo, Die Hard, just about any Jean Claude van Damme movie, then look no further. On a personal note, I do enjoy such films and was taken in quite quickly by this show.\r\n       For an arms dealer, you would think their attitude would be serious, evasive, short and to the point. Koko Hekmatyar seems anything but serious. Rather, she\u2019s very calm and cheerful and has a demeanor that would put one more atease than anything. Without any prior knowledge of Hekmatyar, you would think she\u2019s a spacey goofball of a businesswoman. Her mannerisms can sometimes be that of a typical 10 year old throwing a tantrum.\\n\\n\r\n       With only 12 episodes to work with, they jump into plot rather quickly, not really bothering to go into the supporting characters much. Over the course of the series, they do eventually touch up on some of them and you learn about their past a little. But it is a bit sad when a character that only has three episodes of screen time gets more of a background than one of Koko\u2019s own men whom we see in every episode. I would have liked to have seen more background on the other supporting characters that got few lines and hardly any screen time, and saved the main story and action for the second season.\\n\\n\r\n         The most pressing question many watchers of this show have in mind is, \u201cif this kid Jonah hates weapons so much, why is he so good with them, and why does he continue to use them? If he hates arms dealers so much, why is he traveling with Koko?\u201d This is explained during the early- middle part of the series. We learn about the trials Jonah has faced and why he has become who he is. As the story progresses, we do see a bit of a change in his personality, and he does eventually warm up to Koko\u2019s group while still keeping his main goal in mind.\\n\\n\r\n        The animation is nothing super spectacular, but it\u2019s still better than average. There were a few scenes during gunfights when I noticed the quality drop a little bit behind the muzzle flash of gunfire. Other than that, there wasn\u2019t anything notably wrong with the animation.\\n\\n\r\n        In a nutshell, Jormungand definitely has a target audience in mind. But for those among that audience, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

The crazy yet genious arms dealing female with her as crazy bodyguards who sells arms to anyone who can pay in money. Makes your blood rush and it just feels fun watching it. For me the story and the consept of an arms dealing woman is an original consept. Normally its the old man with the female bodyguard but in thiscase this takes it to a more fun step. Every episode feels like 15 min instead of 23 and it makes you crave more as they give you cynical yet great information about the world itself and its people. The action is well done and made fun in every feeling and its never too much it slows down when it should and speeds up when its called for. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoy the clean animation thats all i can say that. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime got an easy memorable opening and eventhough the ending isnt all action its great and beautiful that you can feel fit this anime. The soundtrack makes this anime in many ways and blends perfect with the story and its characters. The music is so interesting and sometimes i just want to dance in crazy pleasure over it. It can be beatiful but it can also be action filled or filled with a little manic feels. \\n\\n\r\nI already said how much i liked the consept with an arms dealing female. Its not only that she is a female mind you its also because everything she does makes the anime even more fun. The crazyness pulls one in and makes you laugh at times although you normally wouldnt laugh there. She is one of those female characters you just have to love in every sence. Along with her are many other interesting characters that follows from her child soldier body guard to her overprotective female bodyguard and even more. Every character has a meaning you feel in this anime and thats whats makes it even better. \\n\\n\r\nWell i enjoyed the hell out of this anime. I like everything that it is and does because its so unique and fun with action and a cynical view of the world. Black lagoon is the only anime there i would say i get these feelings from at this point in time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i rate it to a 9 because i think its made so well in every way. Also i find few faults in it although some might say it has some rushed points but that would be the only downside to it. The story merges well with the characters and the music just makes it greater and i find next to no faults with it. Having said that its not a 10 since i dont view as that level in a sence. I mean i enjoyed it to a 10 and more but overall its not up there.",

            "content": "I began watching Jormungand with very low expectations.\r\nI wasn't searching for a fascinating story or complex characters. I just wanted to watch some fun, badass action.\r\nJormungand failed to even meet these low standards.\r\nI guess I should start by saying that this anime wasn't offensively bad: it was just boring. It took all of my willpower just to click the play button for the next episode, and I would often leave it untouched for weeks at a time. \r\nFor something so centered around action and weaponry, the combat scenes were dull. The occasional knife fight could be entertaining, but Jormungand mostly consists of confusing gunfights withzero creativity. We just get to watch bright lights (bullets! missiles! bombs!) hitting things... or missing things... and people hiding behind walls to avoid getting hit by the aforementioned bright lights. It is anything but dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that the creators may have wanted to maintain realism in their action sequences, and this might have been fine if there were a good story backing it up. However, the story is hardly even there until the last few episodes, and what we're given is hardly anything interesting. It's a revenge story (arc?), made flimsy by one-dimensional characters whom I did not care for at all. And a revenge story only works if the characters are complex, flawed, and intrinsically human, so that we might actually care about watching them carry out their vendetta. (See: Cowboy Bebop). It doesn't help that Jormungand was grasping for straws when it came to incorporating a theme or \"profound\" question, and landed on something blatantly shallow, while simultaneously lacking the proper subtlety to pull it off. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a wide cast of characters, and I can only remember the names of three of them. The cast was too big, there were too many side characters who contributed nothing important to the show, while still having some of their backstories jammed into the twelve episodes. I enjoyed their antics and quirks, but I was never able to really care about any of them.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the weapons-dealing aspect, which could be intense and even thought-provoking at times. I might have enjoyed it a whole lot more if I knew anything about weapons, or if the show had provided deeper explanations of the conflicts that called for the weapons in the first place, such as motives for the opposing armies and whatnot. \\n\\n\r\nI just DIDN'T care about Jormungand. I didn't even care enough to hate it. It's just kind of there. I'm sure there's plenty of people who love it; I'm just not one of them.",

            "content": "We've all seen Fullmetal Alchemist, hell, your grandma secretly watches it. The characters in FMA were some of the most well developed characters I've ever seen, but what was up with Scar? Driven by vengeance, his past draped in shadows. Sure, we get to learn a lot about him as the show progressed, but there was always something missing I felt.\r\nWell, if you felt this way as well, ponder no longer because Jormungand sheds a little light on his past. What was scar's actual name? Well, it was Jonathan Mar as it turns out (Jonah for short) and he had a series of adventures witha young arms dealer named Koko Hekmatyr and her gang of pals. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I've heard a lot of tales about Jormungand, so I grabbed a couple volumes of the manga, as you do. It was actually really difficult to follow in manga format guys, I'm gonna advise that you just don't start there and just jump right into the anime because it's actually a fluid story. Oh sorry, I mean several stories, since it's one of those episodical tales. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen that this website likes to anally divide their reviews into specific sections for each aspect of the show, so I'll do that =]\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOh boy, what a tale! I mean, I haven't actually finished it yet, I'm about 9 episodes in but that's more than enough to form an informed opinion on something don't you think? Oh you do! Great, so do I! Anyway where was I? Right, story. Ok, so nearly every episode (sometime's they're two parters) is basically its own thing so if you have a very brief attention span, there's a bonus. The gist of this is it's emulating Cowboy Bebob through Black Lagoon, which isn't a bad thing really because I'll be damned if it didn't do it in it's own little way. I wont spoil the ending (I can't, I haven't seen it XDDDD). People say this is super realistic and I guess they're right because silicon breasts are pretty realistic too.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt looks pretty good, the animation itself isn't anything mind blowing. It's a little cheesy and the backgrounds aren't particularly interesting but hey it gets the job done. Character design's a little hit or miss, Scar looks almost exactly like he does in FMA (albeit without the scar or tats yet lol) however there are like three characters that look exactly the same (ugo and wiley and that south african dude that chills with Minami are pretty much interchangable) also there are several female characters that are just variations of each other but I'm just grasping at straws tbh.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLmao I keep seeing all these comments about the soundtrack like \"Omg it's so varied, I love it, one of the best anime soundtracks ever haha lol\" like wtf is wrong with you? Did you randomly decide while you were watching this that \"Oh, you know what? I might actually listen to the music in the background and see what it's like, haven't done that before tbh smae\" and then you went \"Omg so varied, best anime soundtrack ever!\" it's the only one you've heard though! Basically what I'm trying to say is the soundtrack is horrid, varied sure, but variety doesn't equal quality lol y'all need to listen to more soundtracks. Though in saying that I'll be damned if the opening theme doesn't go hard I mean damn, that's my jam m/ pretty good imo tbh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nScar's pretty interesting here, easy to see how he developed into the radical ishvalist we know him as today. I actually in all honesty thought that the characters in this show (the main ones anyway, the side characters or one off characters actually sucked a fair bit of willy) were actually it's selling point, Valmet was great lovely to see some lgbt pride in anime amirite? Also I love how it tries to be all like \"the main characters are super likable and relatable, they are not savage killing machines but real people with real sadboy emotions. These other guys though, oh no, they're disgusting pigs!\" like stfu who are you trying to kid? But anyway I'm missing out the best part, you could watch this entire thing just for Koko Hekmatyr imo tbh.\\n\\n\r\nKoko Hekmatyr:\\n\r\nYou know what idgaf this chick needs her own paragraph I mean god damn I'd wife that shit hard. I'd approach her one day you know, she's doing her thing, I'm doing my thing you know how it do and I'mma be like \"Hey how you doing, I just thought you were really cute can we go grab a drink? *tips trilby*\" and she'll be all like \"Sure, just gotta go make some illegal money and what not brb\" you know, all the usual stuff. You know, we'll date for a few years and then when I feel the time is right I'm gonna be like \"Koko, tbh will you marry me?\" and she'll say \"smae tbh\" then we'll be married. Wont be having kids straight away you know, she's got to sell weapons and stuff full time, it's not an easy job she doesn't have time to be looking after kids. Neither do I, I've gotta be watching Jormungand, super important stuff. Anyway you can't deny this chick's a total qt be honest, you'd wife that too but too bad cause she's mine and we're happy together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I thought that this was relatively enjoyable, nothing to tell your dad about or anything. It's immensely corny and you may as well just watch Black Lagoon which is far better but hey, it's your life.\\n\\n\r\nIt's better than it's manga at least.",

Man I gotta love me some great action anime series, like Canaan (heard about it, never watch it), \r\nMichiko to Hatchin, Cowboy Bebop, and Black lagoon is my favorite. This Anime is not only my second favorite action anime series, but it my favorite by far to my top 20 of my favorites anime's.\r\n NO SPOILERS! let's get to the review. \r\nStory/Plot 10/10-(Brilliant) It like Black Lagoon equivalent plot (an outsider joining a team of mercenaries), with a clear suggestion that human ugliness will be examined through the arms trade. Non-Stop Action, Guns, Mafia,  You have the ruthless squads dealer,you have a Main character's with charismatic, and quest to a journey of world peace.     \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 10/10-(Marvelous) I know I bit may have too much liking to the animation (overuse), no. The fight sequences is the best part to this animation, great gun/knife fights, and the car chase, also with dark background to the main character's. Characters design look like Gangsta (anime recommended).\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound 10/10-(Excellent) Soundtrack/OST is really Outstanding, rap, edgy, remix, but great. I prefer watching this on English dub, because watching it in Japanese dub it no fitting to the character's personality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's/Development 9/10-(Outstanding) The Cast is really great. top 3 best characters to this series.\\n\r\n 1. Valmer (She skillful in knife, she muscular and cute, she could be my waifu) (maybe).  \\n\r\n2. Koko ( She charismatic, and ruthless and has been called a 'monster' by various characters, Harley Queen split personality, she my second favorite character).\\n\r\n 3. Johna (he kickass, great lack of development, and skillful in battlefield)   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10- (Really Enjoy it) ACTION!, ACTION!, and MORE ACTION! I'm not board of it, it took me a year to finished it, because I hold it a month ago and brought back to finished it. I really enjoyed everything about this series. I 'vent watch season 2 Yet, I'll get to it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10-(Love it) It my 3rd favorite action anime, like hellsing ultimate, black lagoon, and cowboy bebop are in the general. \\n\r\nIf you love Those kind of anime with Non-stop action, badass cast character, that a prize chance for you.\\n\\n\r\nJORMUNGAND!\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever had this feeling to just watch something with a whole lot of action in it? Well, if you haven\u2019t, stay the heck away from Jormungand. You may as well leave this review now if you hate action shows. Okay, now that all of the action-haters have left the room, let\u2019s talk about Jormungand. A lot of people like to compare today\u2019s show with Black Lagoon, another anime that focuses on high-flying logic-defying action. I\u2019m going to be upfront about this; I think Jormungand is the superior show. I personally couldn\u2019t get into Black Lagoon, no matter how hard I tried to getinvested into it. Jormungand, on the other hand, had me invested within the first few minutes. So, it\u2019s obvious that I really enjoyed the show subjectively; but how does it hold up objectively? Sit back, relax, and read on as I review Jormungand and its second season Jormungand: Perfect Order. \\n\\n\r\nJormungand\u2019s setup is rather simple; a child soldier named Jonah is brought into the arms trade as a bodyguard of Koko Hekmatyar, a female arms dealer. From there on, action ensues; explosions, gunfights, fiery deaths, crazy chicks with guns; you name it, Jormungand\u2019s pretty much got it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Jormungand are what I believe to be the both the best and worst part of the show. Each character introduced into the show is fairly interesting and likable for the amount of screen time that they\u2019re allowed, but some characters are more favored than others. For example, a character named Valmet had a character arch that is basically the climax of the first season, while a character named Lehm barely gets any backstory but was equally as important to the plot. Then there\u2019s also the fact that character motivations are sometimes completely shot, with the most obvious target being Jonah himself. Jonah lost his parents earlier in his life due to his village being attacked, and because of this he claims to hate weapons and those who use them. However, this makes him the biggest hypocrite in existence because he constantly uses weapons during his time as a child solider and in defending Koko. His character was just a huge walking contradiction, and I was waiting for the show to address this and give us a full explanation of Jonah\u2019s backstory. That never happens. We learn why he got involved with Koko, but we never learn anything else beyond that. The show attempts to justify this by saying that Jonah uses weapons because he can\u2019t live without them, but that statement is both incredibly weak and doesn\u2019t explain why Jonah became a child soldier in the first place. I also couldn\u2019t help but think that this was the creator\u2019s attempt to make Jonah seem more human than he actually was, as this character trait plays close to no part in the entire story. I suppose I would be able to overlook this if it only happened once, but Jonah\u2019s character isn\u2019t the only one who suffers from this lack of backstory. This flaw also affects a lot of the more minor antagonists and side characters. I won\u2019t go into detail about them because then I would be spoiling a lot, but let\u2019s just say that this flaw is very noticeable and the show seems to be unaware of that fact. The show just seems to expect you to connect the dots yourself, which in a lot of cases would be fine; except in this case, the show doesn\u2019t give you enough dots to connect, and therefore you don\u2019t have the entire picture. As for character personalities, they were fleshed out enough so that they felt like real people, but they weren\u2019t very complex or even original in a lot of cases, with the exception of Koko herself. Koko is a fantastic character, and she was just so much fun to watch. Her personality is that of a fun-loving person, but at the same time is cold, calculating, and all-knowing. She always seems to be one step ahead of everyone else, and has enough charisma that her bodyguards would die to her sake. The side characters were just kind of there to create excuses for more action scenes, which in this show\u2019s favor is a rather good thing, but I still would\u2019ve liked to see a little more development on that front.\\n\\n\r\nJormungand\u2019s story is one of those stories that starts off episodic and then concludes under an overarching story. The first season and around half of the second season is split into archs, each ranging from around one to three episodes (as displayed in the episode titles) and focusing on either a member of Koko\u2019s team, some opponent that the group encounters, or both. In my opinion, this is where the show shined the brightest, but that\u2019s only because of my own tastes, as I like more character-centric shows. When the show\u2019s overarching story kicked in, I was more than a little disappointed. Granted, the story wasn\u2019t horrible, but it wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as the individual character stories that were featured previously. Then there\u2019s the ending. Wow, that ending was just\u2026it wasn\u2019t as bad as I anticipated it to be, but it was incredibly open-ended and felt like a cop-out on the creator\u2019s part. I also want to address the overall tone of the show, which is rather lighthearted. Some might view this particular tone as a horrible aspect, because the show makes it seem like child soldiers and the arms trade are perfectly fine and don\u2019t involve any moral dilemmas. Now, I don\u2019t want to get political, but having read A Long Way Gone\u2026it was harder for me to overlook than it probably will be for most. If you\u2019re sensitive towards that kind of stuff, then Jormungand is not the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by White Fox, Jormungand looks pretty darn good, but it\u2019s not White Fox\u2019s best. In comparison to both Katanagatari and Steins;Gate, Jormungand looks a lot more jagged and is outlined with darker colors, as a contrast to the constant white that is the show\u2019s main color. On top of that, the characters don\u2019t always look all that three-dimensional and more like drawings. During the action scenes, however, the show looks  really good and barely cuts any corners. The character designs were also pretty top-notch, with each character looking fairly realistic but at the same time retaining that anime feel we all know and love, which is preferred in my book. The OST is good at getting you excited for action and accompanies each scene well, featuring a lot of techno, auto-tune, and rap lyrics that are in ENGLISH (heck yeah). Both openings for the show are great, and the second ending theme is a nice listen too, but the best out of all is Jormungand\u2019s first opening. This song is what kept me awake when studying for finals, and has cemented itself as one of my favorite anime openings ever. Finally, English or Japanese? No contest, English. I tend to like English dubs a lot more when the main setting isn\u2019t Japan because it feels more natural, and Jormungand is no exception. The best performance goes to Anastasia Munoz as Koko, for providing a convincing performance that make Koko sound confident, fun, and manipulative when needed. As for the Japanese dub (I did listen to some of it), honestly I couldn\u2019t stand it. It may have better acting, but the English just sounds a lot more natural to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Jormungand despite its many issues and was able to accept the anime for what it is. If you\u2019re not a fan of action, then this anime won\u2019t change your mind in the slightest. If you like action, this may not be the best choice, but it\u2019s still a fun anime. I give Jormungand a 3.25 out of 5, and a recommendation to watch it if you want a decent action show to pass the time with. Like always, however, it\u2019s up to you to decide your own opinions.\\n",

            "content": "Jormungand was an anime I watched back when I was just getting into anime, right after Madoka Magica and Naruto. I was younger then, but I really enjoyed this anime and have rewatched the first season maybe twice. The story is really intriguing and, like many good anime, leaves you on cliffhangers each episode to keep the tale weaving itself on. There is some inferencing to be made, but the story fills itself in as the anime goes on. The artwork is absolutely amazing, with the semi-realistic style I have grown to love and comedic expressions to add to themood. It's a perfect mix of anime and reality, making it one of the anime I love most for its artwork. The soundtrack is really great for me personally, and the opening is on many of my anime playlists to this day. All of the songs in this anime are songs I would always like to listen to again, just because they really set the mood for the storyline and characters, of which are equally amazing. They are all interesting in their own rights, and there isn't a character that can be considered dull. They all have personalities, and you'll grow attached to them rather quickly. It's easy to see what's most important in their eyes and see the experiences they've had in the past. I really enjoyed this anime (the first season at least), because everything just came together and was very simple to understand and easy to become hooked on. Definitely an anime I'd recommend to anyone who likes action, politics, or even just a nice story mixed in with great artwork and sound.",

            "content": "[NO SPOILERS]\r\nStory 7 / 10\r\nJormungand's story is good, although it isn't special. The episodes may seem a little chaotic at times as this anime thinks the action is more important the the plot line. The action is indeed very good, but because of the heavy focus on action, the actual story suffers. Don't get me wrong, all episodes form a continuous storyline with a clear beginning and an end. It's just that this anime could have been more if it tried harder(or so I like to believe). It is clear that the writers tried to make a complex story. Unfortunately, Jormungand fails at this aspect.The background of all characters are in fact interesting. Also, every episode is fun to watch, as it has some really good action. But I would never call the story of Jormungand complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are pretty straight forward: someone orders our weapons - we go there - something that we expected would go wrong did go wrong - since we prepared for it we easily solve the problem and get the money anyway. That's basically every episode of Jormungand. It isn't boring, absolutely not! The characters are nicely written and there is some comedy. Also there is a lot of action which is really good. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is good, but not great. For that reason it deserves a 7 out of 10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, not great, but good. The art is somewhat angular, reminding me just a little of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. I mean, you can barely compare it, but I think you'll get the same feeling after watching a couple of episodes. The art style fits Jormungand. The angular style makes this show more mature, which is good. It would've been weird to use coloful art. Because of this art form, characters really had a distinctive look, which I really liked.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI really like Jormungand's OST as I did its Opening theme. The opening theme is one of my favorite ones in fact. The VA's fit the characters really well and I still listen to the OST of Jormungand\\n\r\nAlso, who can forget: \"Her name is Koko, she is loco, I say OH NO!\" I still got that one in my head!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacterrs 6 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fine, but not memorable. You won't really sympathize with any of them, with maybe the child soldier as the exception. Although the cast was pretty good, to me there were too many characters. It's hard to bond with any of them if there are so many running around.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves didn't really go through any kind of change or growth. They started out the same and ended the same. Even one of the main characters, the child soldier, Jonathan Mar, who had a lot of potential for character development, did not change at all. To me, the only memorable character was one of the two main characters: Koko Hekmatyar, who carried the whole show in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI might seem a bit negative, but Jormungand is in fact a very good show. It could've been better, but it is definitely good! I really enjoyed this anime. It has its funny moments, the action is really good and I especially like one of the two main characters: Koko Hekmatyar. I don't recommend this anime to people who like anime heavily focused on their story, since you won't get that with Jormungand.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nJormungand is very good but has its flaws. It lacks a good set of characters, and if it was up to me half of the cast would have been cut.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, reminding me a little of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor.\\n\\n\r\nThe music fits the show really well. The opening theme is awesome and the OST is good too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Jormungand is very good, but definately not the best you'll ever see.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you for listening!\\n\\n\r\nRazovy",

That coudl also be the reason why at one point I dropped it almost for 8 months and only after that manageed to finish it.\r\nStory 5/10:\r\nIt is supposed to be serious and it does touch serious subjects and there are people dying, but.... either due to directing or becuase of some reason, it looks like bunch of mercenaris fooling aroudn and having a good time, crackingjokes and so on. Even in serious segments it doesn't feel like there's any danger and so on.\\n\\n\r\nNoir, which I watchedm any years ago, was much better of handlign stuff like this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nWell, characters have surprisingly low amount of details on their faces, and main female lead has a triangular face type with low amount of detail. However, rather than being a cookie-cutter style that is frequently used in some school-related comedies (where you can confuse males from different series, where everybody is proportioned as a teen and so on), this time aroudn this seems to be an artistic choice, albeit an unusual one. It is neither realism, nor comical \"chibi-fication\". Backgrounds are fairly good, and a lot of effort was put into portraying various military tech.\\n\r\nThere's some CG and at moments it is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nOne of the least impressive intro/outro themes I heard (\"Her name is Koko, she is loco, hey yeah!\"), and it doesn't set the right tone for what looks like it was supposed to be a serious anime. Female lead often soudns like she doesn't take herself too seriously, and it is unclear whether this is intentional or not.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10:\\n\r\nCharacters fail to portray themselves as believable people, and their interactiosn and relationships look aritificail. Well, at least female lead is slightly amusing while prancing around and making faces.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10:\\n\r\nIt is a meh. At one point I got bored with it and dropped it for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10:\\n\r\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands, you could check it out, but this anime is an odd one. Not a masterpiece, probably fails to present difficult subjects properly. But there's something unusual about it, so perhaps in the end it is worth watchign.",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what I expected when I entered the world of Jormungand - if the plot synopsis gave me any idea, it was that there would be a lot of guns. It certainly didn't let me down there. Is there more to this anime than explosions and eye candy? Mmmmmnnnoooot really.\r\nStory: 4/10 \r\nJormungand doesn't follow a specific plotline - it's almost as if it's a slice of life, arms dealer style. I'm not sure it really worked. I mean, sure, I really enjoyed watching it - it's fun, not something you really have to put much thought into, but that, to me, doesn't necessarilymean that it was successful. The fact that the style of the anime was episodic meant that there was no intense finale, which is the sort of thing one expects from this kind of series. The finale ended up being anti-climactic [i]regardless[/i] of the fact that there wasn't enough buildup. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and character design were fluid and not uninteresting - the weapons (which, admittedly, are practically the focus of the series) were well animated and drawn, the characters were unique enough, and the scenery was pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nProbably the best part of Jormungand for me - the voice acting, both the English and Japanese versions, was great and portrayed the right vibe. If you're an English speaker, I recommend the dub - being able to hear the characters swear makes the whole experience a little more interesting. The soundtrack was pretty awesome as well - it definitely fitted in with the overall atmosphere of the series. The opening is probably one of my all time favorites soundwise. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThere was little to no character development - any development there was felt a little forced. Some of the character interactions/relationships seemed forced as well - for example, those between Koko and Jonah, the main characters. Jonah is a deadpan child soldier who hates the fact that he works with weapons, but it's almost as if we wouldn't know this if it wasn't constantly explained to the audience by his internal dialogue. Koko is the better character in my opinionn, although she could have been better portrayed. If she is supposed to be the hardcore crazy bitch the others make her out to be, we never really see that side of her, apart from in the way she 'smiles in the face of danger'. If she is meant to be intimidating or even frightening, I'm afraid I didn't get that feeling from her at all. However, she was definitely the most fun to watch of all Jormungand's characters, closely followed by Valmet. If it weren't for the fact that the characters were so entertaining to watch, even just in battle, the score would be lower.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI prioritized this series because I enjoyed it, finishing it in 4 days, despite the copious amount of crap I still have to finish. That says something to me. I was enthusiastic to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nI rate anime highly for clearly achieving what they intend to - and I'm afraid Jormungand really didn't meet that mark. What one would expect is grit, terror, nailbiting action - but to me, it was just a bit fun. If I had gone into it with any expectations, I'm pretty sure I would have been disappointed.",

So I figured there must be a connection between the two. (The voice acting people of Revy, Dutch, and Scarecrow; producers and production; special effects; broadcasters... That's about it.)\r\nJormongand is the spiritual successor of that \"swearing up and down like a drunken sailor\" of a franchise, Black Lagoon; taking a view that's more whimsical and down-to-earth than it should. Not to say that it has less adrenaline than it's gun-crazed \"older sister.\" It's just that you're more likely to welcome Koko & Co intoyour house than Revy & Co.\\n\\n\r\n\"Dem Pr'feshun'lz\" are an odd, mixed lot with some pretty tear-worthy pasts.

            "content": "In a world of violence and bloodshed\u2014where the sounds of blaring firearms and steel clashing is an everyday occurrence\u2014being an arms dealer is neither an easy task nor laughing matter. It is not a position where honesty and justice prevail, but one where deception and cruelty run rampant. But despite the bad reputation and dangers that come with the occupation, there is one individual who has made a name for herself in the business. Her name is Koko (Hekmatyar)... and she is loco. With the help of her talented comrades, the story of Jormungand follows Koko and co. as they travel around the world doingtheir work. Now, let's see how big of a splash this series has made in the vast body of water that is the world of anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nFittingly enough, the notable grainy appearance of the visuals matched the overall theme of the series quite well. It illustrated the \"get down and dirty\" aspect of the arms dealer job and the dusty battlefield of the wilderness. However, on a more subjective note, the character designs barely appealed to me at all. For the most part, virtually all the characters had many similar physical traits, making the minor characters hard to remember. It even got to the point where I had at times asked myself, \"Where did this character come from?\" before realizing they had been introduced earlier on. As for the battle scenes, the animation was generally fluid and not hard on the eyes to watch. A decent job overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10)\\n\r\nHere is where the score for the series takes a hit. Aside from Jonah, and possibly Koko/Valmet, all the other characters seemed rather bland. Sure, they had their own little distinguishing characteristic/story to set them apart from each other, but other than that, they were barely developed. On the other hand, I do understand that with only twelve episodes to work with, the story might be prioritized over the characters. That said, what's to say you can't use the story to help develop the characters (i.e. give a character screentime during which they not only develop the story but also allow the viewer to understand more about them)? \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nSounds in general are usually a hit or miss in most anime; either they really help one get into each episode, or they stick out like a sore thumb. For Jormungand, it luckily fell into the former. While the OP, ED, BGM, and voice acting weren't outstanding, they were definitely not bad. The OP was upbeat, and despite the Engrish, quite catchy too. On the other hand, I personally didn't really like the ED that much as I felt it didn't fit the theme of the show. The show's BGM was probably the best of the four aspects; high-octane tracks matched to hot-blooded action is never a bad combination. No comment on the voice acting, which was more or less average. Lastly, who can forget about the epic episode preview track? That alone, factored in greatly to this section's score. \\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nOne's first impression of Jormungand's story might be that it's just a bunch of people killing each other with guns. While that's partially true, there is also some dialogue and informative content as well. To be honest, I wasn't really too into the whole arms dealer idea. However, I do admit that by watching this anime, I learned a bit about tactical strategics and arms dealing (assuming they're depicting the job accurately). The story had its ups and downs\u2014from being downright boring to keeping me at the edge of my seat for the entire episode. With that being said, I'll give this season's story the benefit of the doubt by assuming that having to also add in character introductions might have hindered the story's potential. However, I won't be so forgiving when season two rolls around. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\nAlthough it wasn't a memorable series by any means, Jormungand was entertaining for the most part. It's not an anime where a lot of thinking is required; just kicking back and watching Loco Koko's adventures is enjoyable in and of itself. Anyone with an open mind will probably enjoy this series so feel free to give it a try if you have the time and haven't already. As for me, I'll be patiently waiting for season two, which starts airing in Fall 2012.",

            "content": "\"Jormungand was an unexpected delight for me.\"\r\nSTORY: Weight of 25% at 3.9/5\r\nJormungand follows the story of an arms-dealer named Coco Hekmatyar and her trusty bodyguards. The plot has her going across the globe, running from buyer to buyer and selling her goods. However, as it should be expected, usually things don't go too smoothly and they end up finding themselves in a jam. \r\nNow, because of the type of story that this series tries to tell, the experience felt very episodic with every few chapters or every one or two episodes usually being a single adventure that they have to complete. And while there aresome elements that carry over, after things happen in the last adventure, there really isn't a feeling of continuity and it usually felt stand-alone. At the same time, it was very hard to tell if the story makes any progress. \\n\r\nSee, the goal that the main character Coco aims for is world peace, at least that's what she's telling us. But it was very hard to tell if she was actually trying to accomplish this until later parts of the series where it becomes much more obvious. And unless you give your full attention to what is being said or written, you might accidentally skim over important words that might tell you if the story actually advances. \\n\r\nWith all that said, the story is very fascinating because it presents us a third-party view on conflict and war in general. There are no good guys or bad guys for arms dealers, only buyer or not buyer. Because of this outsider's point of view, it also raises questions on real life conflicts and shows how futile war really is. \\n\r\nAt the same time, it raises some interesting social and political issues that exist both within the story and in reality and it really is interesting when you take some time to reflect.\\n\r\nOverall however, if the story really doesn't interest you, the plot creates many opportunities to witness some beautiful gunfights, so everybody wins.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Weight of 25% at 4.0/5\\n\r\nJormungand has a very nice gathering of both cool and interesting characters. Not only is the roster large, the supporting characters were memorable and interesting and the more important characters were simply fantastic. What does make all of these shine though is that they are not simply one-faced. Unlike other animes where a character is set in stone from the moment they are presented, usually categorized as A, B or C, none of Jormungand's characters are like this. \\n\r\nA good example would be the main female character Coco Hekmatyar, the arms dealer. Coco is a very interesting character. Apart from being charismatic and shrewd, she also has a funny and quirky side, a dangerous and cold side and a philosophical and intelligent side. Furthermore, I can't help but smile when such an interesting contradiction of a protagonist exist, I mean really, a peace seeking arms dealer?\\n\r\nStanding next to Coco, we have the main male character Jonas, a young child soldier. While some might be quick in writing him off as that quiet kid, in reality he is so much more. He does voice his opinion when people ask him for it and isn't afraid to speak freely about what he thinks. But at the same time, he knows the world well enough to know his place. So while he might give his thoughts, he never goes out of line, unless he's really pushed. Symbolically though, Jonas represents the future of all children that will come if the world walks down the path of war.\\n\r\nThe other characters are all fantastic. Whether that be the villains, the supporting or the minor ones. They each get at least a single memorable scene and I assure you that whether that be a chuckle or a heartbeat, you will love them.\\n\\n\r\nADAPTATION: Weight of 25% at 4.4/5\\n\r\nThe Jormungand anime took all that we loved in the manga, kept it and threw away all the stuff we didn't like. We liked the action scenes, we liked the story and its hidden meanings, we liked the interesting characters, so White Fox kept that. The anime, in one word, transcended the manga and I would definitely recommend the anime over the manga, if not only for the awesome aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\nAESTHETICS: Weight of 25% at 4.8/5\\n\r\n2012 was an awesome year for beautiful animes like Psycho-Pass, Guilty Crown and K but Jormungand was by far the one I enjoyed whose aesthetics I enjoyed the most. Maybe I'm just a sucker for military weaponry but I love seeing guns in anime, whether that be pistols or rocket launchers, and Jormungand has a lot of big guns. And other kind of big guns. But no joke, the animation is beautiful, with the action scenes in particular showing exactly what the word polished means. The sound is amazing, whether it be gunfire or explosions, I can't get enough. The music is not only catchy but also fits the series perfectly and even if you don't want to care about the story, you can simply watch the awesomeness that is happening on your screen. The two openings were amazing, the two endings were amazing and the background music is amazing and Jormungand really WAS amazing when it comes to the aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Overall score of 85.5%\\n\r\nJormungand was an unexpected delight for me. It provided more than a simple story, more than a few mediocre characters and more than shit ass animation and sound. And I would definetely recommend the anime to anyone who wants a beautiful fast-paced and maybe even thought-provoking show to watch.\\n",

            "content": "The story is just garbage. The author has no idea about arms dealing, guns, military operations, or even how organizations function. There are lots of overrated shows on MAL, but this has to be one of the most blatant examples.\r\nSeriously, in the first episode the arms dealers get shot at by the military to prevent them from delivering weapons. Makes sense right? Except, the military that's shooting at them are the ones that ordered the weapons. And they're not doing it for any sensible reason like skipping out on paying. They're actively trying to prevent the delivery of the weapons THEY ALREADY PAID FOR. Notbecause they don't want to pay anymore, but because they want to ensure they remain WEAKER than their neighboring countries.\\n\\n\r\nThen in the second episode, the dealers head out to deliver the weapons to a low-level unit commander directly in the middle of a battlefield. Like large-scale international arms dealers are some sort of door-to-door salesmen that go out of their way to sell peanuts to small fry who don't have the authority to pay in the first place. And they do it in a location where they have a high chance of being shot at for no reason, because there wouldn't be an excuse for some unrealistic action otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems to only be getting worse from here, so I dropped it. If you're just looking for some action, and have the coveted ability to turn off your brain's ability to reason, then you might like this. However, if you're expecting something even remotely realistic from a supposedly Seinen show, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",

The two animes share similarities, in which different groups of people are always encountered whether they are CIA, gangs, possibly paramilitary groups. However, I cannot say they are same.\r\nWhat made \"Black Lagoon\" very good was lacking in this anime. First the bad-ass female characters became sex appeal, in which the macho male associates in the group are always admiring their body shape or trying to find a romantic moment. Another if the lack of danger of this anime. The crew fought off various lethal elements yet theyjust passed unscathed due their overwhelming skill in combat. This is where I would just be a bit irritated because despite anime logic, its hard for protagonist to win by outgunning the other guys. As a result, there is clearly a lack of deaths of the \"protagonist\" side except for one who wasn't exactly loyal to the group. I felt very little excitement, or anxiousness since they never use cleaver tactics and cleanly defeat everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nMy given rating is on the assumption that the anime is watched for the first time without having experiencing \"Black Lagoon\".

            "content": "I devour the five continents and swallow the three seas. But my body has neither wings, hands, nor feet and thus is powerless against the sky. I am world's serpent and my name is....Jormungand!!\r\nQuite an opening to an anime that follows the escapades of an arms dealer and her bodyguards as they travel the world while trafficking illegal weapons, scuffling with the competition, and avoiding the law. Jormungand is an anime that tells the story of the young woman Koko Hekmatyr, an arms dealer, and her crew of bodyguards. Specifically, the anime focuses on Koko and her newest recruit, the child soldier, Johnathan Mar whois referred to as Jonah by the group. The story is mostly straightforward with each episode (or group of episodes) focusing on a mission that Koko's team has undertaken. As one would expect from an action anime of this sort, lots of fast-paced gun fights and chases are involved. This run-and-gun style of storytelling causes somewhat of a lack of an overall plot. This anime relies more on the characters and their own pasts to tell a story and this somewhat unique style of storytelling works well with this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Jormungand is very well done, especially the attention to detail when animating the weapons and vehicles used throughout the series. My hat goes of to White Fox (which is the same studio that provided animation for Steins;Gate - another great series). It's also not surprising that the physical combat sequences were nicely animation, especially the bodily movements and reactions of the characters. Speaking of the characters, many of them are peculiar yet intriguing in their own way. Many of the characters have equally interesting back stories (the remainder of the characters whose back stories were not featured in the first season will most likely be featured in the upcoming second season). This focus on detail leads to fairly intense actions scenes which help to move the anime along at a good pace. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Jormungand is one of the few aspects which I didn't enjoy. Sure, the opening theme is catchy and there were a few tracks which were well done, but those tracks were few and far between. Most of the music is too bland to be featured in a high-action anime such as Jormungand. Hopefully, this is corrected in the upcoming second season. Another aspect that was somewhat poorly handled was the multitude of specific names and titles used throughout the series when referring to weapons, vehicles, or locations. This could easily cause some confusion when attempting to follow along with plot. However, it's not really an issue if viewers pay attention during the \"negotiation\" scenes. The dialogue is somewhat heavy, so I recommend that viewers pay close attention to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Jormungand is unique action anime which should be given credit for what it has tried to accomplish in a field of anime that has been dominated by super-powered teenagers with spirit blades, ramen-loving ninja, and elastic pirates. It's nothing revolutionary when it comes to the genre of action anime, but it's definitely a well done series that delivers lots of action given the constraints of nonfiction themes and facts that it attempts to work with. I would recommend Jormungand to all viewers who enjoy action anime or who are looking for a unique series in general.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "Action anime akin to Jormungand are tough to come by, and very rarely any good. Based on a manga of the same name, Jormungand is an adventure through mediocrity not exactly going to appeal to action fans, nor fans of much else. Its\u2019 boring characters, lame action, and unexplained everything compound to become an anime that is very rarely entertaining, let alone exciting.\r\nJonah is a boy soldier whose friends were killed in some sort of warzone. He winds up killing those who killed his friends, consequently becoming a murder machine. He is picked up by Koko Hekmatyar, a very cunning young arms dealer. He becomesher bodyguard, one of many bodyguards as a matter of fact. He joins the ranks of nine shunned or fallen military heroes (and one Mafioso) who, as a unit, protect Koko from all kinds of baddies including assassins, mobsters, militiamen, and pirates.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the show does provide for a wide array of stories, but none of them are particularly appealing. None of the episodes truly stand out in my mind as they were all fairly straight-forward in story. Jormungand continually uses flashbacks as a means to dole out plot but the flashbacks are very overused. The various members of Koko\u2019s group don\u2019t have particularly entertaining, nor inventive, pasts; one woman\u2019s entire squadron was killed and she wants revenge on the man who did it, there\u2019s a guy who was the lone survivor when Koko took on the mafia, and another was blamed for something he didn\u2019t do. None of it is anything you haven\u2019t watched or read before.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really bothers me about the show more so than its lackluster plot is how, while we see a lot of minor character background, we never see any of Koko\u2019s background. Questions are brought up during the show of why she became an arms dealer, but the answer she gives is never heard by the audience, instead we are treated to a well-timed rush of wind. That, to me, is not good story telling. I feel like the writer couldn\u2019t actually come up with a reason so makes it a secret, hoping it makes the character look more mysterious. And while Koko is certainly mysterious, the lazy storytelling doesn\u2019t particularly add to it, more so it detracts from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge problem with the story is how Koko gets the arms she sells, where she gets all her money, and how she has military aircraft, among other things. While there is that small mention of her father, we are given no idea as to why she became an arms dealer and how she does it. Instead the story decides to skip what I assume the writer thought would be the boring details and get straight into the action.\\n\\n\r\nThis could be okay if the action wasn\u2019t so gosh-darned dumb. Take for example the group\u2019s battle against Orchestra. If you haven\u2019t seen Jormungand allow me to set the scene:\\n\\n\r\nKoko and Jonah hide behind a wall at the end of a plaza. Orchestra, a man and girl team, shoot at them wildly from the center of the plaza. Lehm, an older man and sniper, is to Orchestra\u2019s side with a silenced pistol. Instead of surprise attacking them from the side as they shoot at Koko and Jonah, he waits until they have time to pick up a riot shield and can block the shots. On top of that, why isn\u2019t the group\u2019s sniper\u2026sniping? Take a briefcase upstairs, put the weapon together in perhaps thirty or even twenty seconds if he\u2019s as good as he\u2019s made out to be, and kill Orchestra.\\n\\n\r\nThese lapses in logic truly destroy the action sequences for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of Orchestra, I\u2019d love to point out the demeaning view of women that seems to permeate Jormungand. I don\u2019t know if anyone else felt the way I did, but I found the show to be\u2026like it was written by a fifteen year old boy. The most disturbing instance of demeaning women comes in the form of the young girl who is part of Orchestra. Her story is that she had to go through a river to kill some men, and it was uncomfortable wearing wet panties, so she decided to take them off and found that she shot better without them on. So, apparently, she wears skirts and no panties much to the chagrin of the viewer. But nobody in the show seems to be embarrassed by this as it is played as a joke.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough to make you feel embarrassed, then allow me to continue. Koko and Valmet are obvious lesbians and, while nothing explicit is shown, they sleep in the same room in their underwear much of the time. Sometimes it even feels like the same bed. While I\u2019m not offended by lesbians in an anime I\u2019m more so offended by how bipolar the characters are made out to be. In public they are demonic badasses but in private they are always shown either half naked or naked and in some form of lesbian context.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the female counterpart to the CIA agent following Koko around is a ditzy, borderline idiotic, person. Also, don\u2019t forget Karen. Completely subservient to her master, she will do anything for him and, despite being shunned from his graces, she comes back to him again and again. Also add the fact that the characters are typically depicted in some form of the nude, from going to the bathroom, to sleeping, to going to the beach, and the male characters even try to feel up one of the character\u2019s breasts.\\n\\n\r\nIf those three paragraphs aren\u2019t enough to convince you that this show has a demeaning view of women, even with a woman as the main character, then I don\u2019t know what will. There is no particularly strong female character that isn\u2019t without some sort of lesbian tendency or something silly like that. It just feels wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSomething else really embarrassing (one of a plethora of things it seems) is the fact that in a couple episodes, countries aren\u2019t given names. Instead, they are called Country A or something generic like that; as if somebody was supposed to fill that in with an either real or fake name. It\u2019s very bad storytelling and, truthfully, lame. Nothing detracts from a show attempting to showcase realistic action than a lackluster ability to portray that realness. We know they\u2019re in Eastern Europe somewhere, but instead of play off of tensions in that area of the world currently, Jormungand creates a generic and easily dismissed story. It\u2019s, as I\u2019ve stated before, lazy storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one last example of lazy storytelling while I\u2019m on the subject. The random meetings of the arms dealers, coincidental meetings in different parts of the world, are really unneeded and I guess are meant to portray tension between two enemies. The problem with this being that while it is okay the first time, showing the characters again just to remind us they are there isn\u2019t particularly appealing. There are a few characters with recurring roles but none of them are ever used to their full potential, nor are any of them exciting enough to care about.\\n\\n\r\nLazy writing is what Jormungand comes down to. I\u2019m a big fan of Tom Clancy, Brad Thor, Alex Berenson, and Robert Ludlum; thriller books with plots kind of like Jormungand. The difference between Jormungand and the rest is that Jormungand is poorly researched, poorly written, and comes across less as realistic and violent and more so as a pointless, piece of crap anime. One of the only commendable things about it is the fact that Jonah\u2019s child-like behavior in some parts is good characterization of an otherwise demonic child soldier. But the rest is unbelievably dense and stupid. I can\u2019t help but think that a horny teenaged boy with a violence fetish wrote this, perhaps consulting the few news programs he\u2019d seen in the past five years, Google Maps, and a few crappy  books and movies as research material.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I found the animation and sound to be good, I did take issue with the very idiotic tone shifts. What I mean by that is the whole episode will be serious, like an episode of Ghost in the Shell. Not a lot of comedy, more so a serious story being told. But sometimes Jormungand will inject these cartoony images, such as all of Koko\u2019s killers having red eyes. Because telling us they are killers isn\u2019t a good enough indication that they may be dark characters, I need them to suddenly become the vampires from Shiki. And then there are moments where all the characters say the same thing simultaneously or go into a silly little laugh like the end of a bad sitcom. And I\u2019m not complaining that the anime is being a cartoon, because I understand that the 2D images on my screen are, in fact, cartoons. But such tone shifts are unpleasant and take away from how serious the anime is. I mean, I can\u2019t take such stupidity seriously anyway, but the few people who are bound to take it seriously will at least be offset by these moments.\\n\\n\r\nJormungand isn\u2019t particularly good in any way. It\u2019s very poorly executed story compounded with the inherent sexism and sometimes God awful dialogue makes it a very dull show to watch. It innovates in no way, and it comes across as a young boys fantasy more so than an adventure for the ages.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do like Jormungand, there is good news for you. There will be a second season this fall.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bad news for the rest of us, there will be a season two.",

            "content": "Adapted from the manga written and drawn by Takahashi Keitarou, the anime was released in spring of 2012. In a nutshell, the story revolves around an arms dealer, named Koko Hekmatyar, and her crew of mercenaries with their new addition to the group, Jonathan Mar, a child soldier.\r\nStory\r\nThe anime consists of small arcs, one to two episodes long, each concentrating on a member of the group and their corresponding profession. Nicely paced, you are kept entertained at all times with gory action scenes and tense negotiations, while having occasionally some comedy and light-hearted moments.\r\nCharacters\r\nUnfortunately, the biggest downfall of this series, is the lacking character development.At the beginning of the anime, you are already overwhelmed with a huge cast of characters which I couldn't even fully remember myself at the end of the anime. Out of all the members, only two characters, besides Koko and Jonathan, received some proper development, while the history and background story of others were briefly mentioned or left out. It's a real shame though they had to split the series into two seasons, as most of the character are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAs for the animation, 'White Fox', who was responsible for other anime, such as 'Steins;Gate' or 'Katanagatari', did a great job on the animation, especially with their stunning backgrounds. The animation was fluid and pleasing to the eye. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe audio, in my opinion was by far the strongest aspect of 'Jormungand'. While the opening was fast paced, electronic music, and the ending a slow paced, violin themed song, they both were enjoyable to listen to and had a catchy tune to them. Taku Iwasaki, did an amazing job with the soundtrack, which was utilised throughout the series. There isn't much complaining about the sound effects and dubbing either.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nOverall, it was an enjoyable show. It's definitely worth a try, especially if you like anime like Canaan or Black Lagoon.",

            "content": "With guns blazing and knives flashing, Jormungand brings an almost unparallelled action packed adventure which fails to do anything but draw me deep into the story, craving for more. The story is centered around the exploits of the boy soldier Jonah, the ever charismatic Hekmatyar Koko and her bodyguards as they encounter and overcome countless challenges through the course of their business, selling weapons. Truly a fun filled and addictive gem. Do take note, this review is for S1 only.\r\n[POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW: I have refrained from spoilers as much as possible. Read at your own risk.]\r\nStory & Setting\r\nAs mentioned previously, the story follows the dangerouslifestyle which Koko Hekmatyar lives as she deals out weapons and other various less-than-legal sales across the globe. Naturally, such deals would end in at best, gunboat diplomacy, though more often than not, it simply leads to spectacular fight scenes, showcasing the spectacular amount of firepower available to a first class weapons dealer. The action is written in a spectacular fashion, creating an appeal that any action-junkie would not be able to pass up. Though it might seem rather shallow as a whole, the story does take measures to delve into the past of some of Koko's nine bodyguards, which not only diversifies the plot but also helps to link and provide closure to certain other parts of the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nThough admittedly an action-focused plot isn't deep in any sense, it's written very wittily at parts, naturally with the main usage of this wit being in how they get out of the rather sticky situations which the group always seems to find themselves in. At other parts, it could be the complete opposite, simply providing an added WOW effect when they resort to brute force to solving their problems. Even though some, perhaps most, of this could be considered obnoxious usage of Deus Ex Machina, it still does create a certain air of excitement in anyone watching and needless to say, is simply irresistible in the fun it brings.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the story is not fixed, with almost every single mini-arc taking place in a different part of the world. This naturally introduces in countless minor characters who may or may not be related to the story in the second season. The writer however does take pains to ensure that the addition of some of these characters is not completely wasted and hence does create a well-written plot, despite it being an almost purely action story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation is done very well, especially with regards to the countless fight scenes which take place and weapons which appear throughout the whole anime. The non-combat scenes are not animated to a spectacular level but yet, they are still done impressively enough. Not overwhelmingly strong but not subtle enough to be forgotten through all of the action, the backgrounds are done in an almost perfect balance with the various scenes. Naturally one would expect that in an action-type anime, the focus would be in the action scenes; And I was not let down at all in this aspect. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is rather interesting in this particular anime. Not only does it have the regular type of background sound and music one would expect from this genre, but also incorporates several unique types of sound throughout the show. This would include the occasional classical piece of music as well as even songs done in languages other than English and Japanese. Don't get me wrong, this is a boon rather than a bane to the show, as it not only creates the perfect atmosphere for each scene but entices the audience further into the show. Though admittedly these various different types of music might not be as catchy and memorable as other dramatic tracks from other anime, the OP and ED both compensate more than enough for this, with the former being immensely addictive and the latter being a surprisingly gentle change from the general feel you'd get from the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nJormungand is one of the ambitious animes which attempt to take a big step into creating not one, not two, but eleven repeating characters who occur in every single episode, save for perhaps one or two, and put an almost equal amount of focus into all of them. Naturally though, the two main characters receive more attention than the others. Surprisingly enough, for this genre, the was a decent amount of development into a few of the characters, showing their past as well as their goals and personal feelings on various issues. The unmistakable theme of growth and development is present in Jonah as he learns from the others more about the world and slowly develops from an unstoppable killer into something else. In addition to this, the various characters' traits are also displayed in other subtle ways, which do actually bring about a more human feel to the characters, rather than making them seem like nothing but killing machines.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime does represent a rather slanted view on the actual situation. Taking the stand of \"everyone is a good person deep down\", the anime paints arms dealers into the best light possible. Though this could be considered to be rather biased and unreal from one school of thought, it presents a great opportunity to bring about a very interesting story from the darker side of society which we do not see often, except perhaps through fictional works such as this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nBeing almost unparalleled in terms of crazy action and less-than-logical fight scenes, perhaps on par with Black Lagoon, but most importantly, tremendously fun, Jormungand is a definite gem in this era of action anime. A must watch for any action-junkie, and as a matter of fact even those who have never been a huge fan of the action genre, prepare to be blasted away by the sheer amount of fun this story shoots right at you.\\n\\n\r\n[AFTERWORD: Thank you for taking time to read this review. Please do give any comments of which I could learn from and improve on for any reviews I might do in the future!]",

            "content": "I saw this anime in recommendations after finishing Black Lagoon and Gunslinger Girl. Both shows have unique charm and are very enjoyable so I thought Jormungand would offer similar entertainment. \r\nStory is cheesy like most of action shows: protagonists are involved in dangerous business, threats are everywhere and gunfights occur frequently. \r\nArt is allright, some landscape scenes are outstanding.\r\nThough voice acting and sounds of weapons are great, most of music is very unfitting to gunfights which lowers enjoyment.\r\nVariety of characters is the strongest point of this show, all of them are very lively and show their attributes. Their interactions are most of the time amusingto watch and each one has an obsession (for example obsession with butterflies) and all of them are quirky.\\n\r\nSadly, I didn't manage to enjoy the show. I expected the show to have cheesy action scenes but they lack in thrill and tense which make them boring: most of the time some unfitting song playing in background while protagonists get attacked and after some time either enemies decide to make a stupid move which gets them gunned down or some protagonist goes banzai and kills everyone without a stretch, there is no element of surprise which makes fights more interesting or danger that protagonists may die, that ruined my enjoyment and no matter how much I liked characters and other elements, I couldn't have enjoyed the show. Another sad thing is that many characters were given too few time, for example two assassin crews were very interesting and too bad they got so little time, there is enough of material for each crew. \\n\r\nEnjoyment ruined my rating of this show, even though there might be some deeper ideas in the show (for example dangers of getting involved with illegal business and how that affects on people, especially what kind of people is in that business), they aren't easy to find because it's difficult to focus on uninteresting show.\\n\\n\r\nStarting Jormungand after Black Lagoon and Gunslinger Girl made me expect cheesy and thrilling fun with some charm, not sure was it a good thing because the show didn't match my expectancy, though I might have missed some things because poorly made action scenes annoyed me.",

Especially since the end is \u201cWe are a killing team\u201d. Which pretty much sums it up. The endings were ok but I didn\u2019t ever pay much attention. And I don\u2019t know if this would be considered \u201cmusic\u201d but I thought at the end when they showed the preview of the next episode, the little song that went \u201cHer name is Koko, she is loco, I say oh no!\u201d is hilarious and it\u2019sprobably what I look forward to most out of the entire episode. Haha.\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot : I find Jormungand to be unique in it\u2019s genre because I\u2019ve never watched an anime with a weapons dealer as the main character before. I actually read the first volume of the manga like four years ago and greatly enjoyed it. So when the anime came out I was pumped. I think the plot is very engaging and funny. If you like comedic violence this is the show for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters : So I ABSOLUTELY love two characters in this series. The first is Jonah. He\u2019s super cute yet he\u2019s a child soldier. He is very strong willed, but he is also kind of like a zombie for most of the series. You can tell he cares about Koko, and she about him. He is the best on the team in my opinion and my favorite part is when they\u2019re trying to teach him math and they are like \u201cIf there are 18 wheels on one airplane, then how many are on three?\u201d And after waiting for five minutes, he was like \u201cA lot.\u201d Funniest. Thing. Ever. Then there\u2019s Koko. Just like the end thing says, she is loco! But she\u2019s also a very unique character. She definitely stands out in the anime world and I don\u2019t think theres another character like her. If there is, they\u2019re probably crazy too. As for the rest of the team I like them all also, they just don\u2019t stand out to me. Except Valmet, she\u2019s pretty B.A.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was a great anime, I loved every episode and I can't wait for season 2 in October!",

After all, Kurama had flowing hair - and red to boot! If you like strong female leads, this is it - from brains to brawn, from wits to wiles.\r\nIf you were a gun enthusiast, you'd love this even more (critiquing or otherwise). Nonetheless, cool weapons, bad-ass sounds, state-of-the art toys introduced better than the Secretary of State. \r\nIf you happened to watch So Close or Naked Weapon, you wont be disappointed by thefight scenes, especially of the women. \\n\\n\r\nAND! It doesn't make excuses for it's characters. One does what one must do  - and luckily none softened by a love bite or something. Each character  brings its own richness to the scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: must watch.",

Literally from start to finish.\r\nKoko is an interesting character, VA does a good job of potraying that. Jonah well he is cool from the start. \r\nThe Team themselves all have interesting back stories, so its enjoyable as you learn alot about them, the team is itself and its composition is interesting, from Seals and normal soldiers to Members of Mafia. Not to Mention a child soldier :P.\r\nIts comedic even though its dark. The Sound quality of the weapons are nice, Especially after watching Upotte youkinda appreciate the details they have included. Its more action then anything.\\n\\n\r\nIts reminds me of War Lord, but its alot more over the top. It covers alot of areas in the world, but its mainly about europe and africa, There is alot of mention about the Chinese presence in Africa, Which felt like Political propaganda or maybe the authors biased views.\\n\\n\r\nOverall its really fun to watch, action is pretty much spot on.",
