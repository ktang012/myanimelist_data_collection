            "content": "Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m getting old and senile, but it seems that the more anime I watch, the less sense they seem to make. You could imagine my confusion when I started watching Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? \"Why is the zombie weak to sunlight but not the vampire? Why the hell is he in a pink frilly dress? Why is that monster a giant lobster?\" In exasperation, I put these questions to a good friend, and I found that his reply turn out to be a very apt one-sentence summary for my review.\r\nHe said to me: \"I dunno lol, who cares? It's fucking hilarious!\"\r\nEverythingin Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, from story to character to humor, is based on complete outrageousness. I hesitate to call Kore wa Zombie~ an original anime, because it's seems that Kore wa Zombie~'s idea of originality is to take as many ideas as possible, exaggerate them to the absolute maximum limit of the imagination, and then cram them together into a single, epic anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo exactly is it that I mean when I say outrageousness? Let's pretend that there are 2 'idea guys' who started working on the story for this, whom I will dub them Jim and Bob. (Warning, minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\n\"Here's an idea!\" says Jim. \"Let's make the main protagonist a zombie.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Great idea!\" replies Bob. \"We'll have an utterly immortal zombie who constantly gets humorously dismembered, baked like a potato chip when he stands in the sun, and receives magical powers that turns him into a pink cross-dressing/chainsaw wielding mas(h)ou shoujo(nen).\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Awesome,\" nods Jim with approval, \"and since this is a harem, we need at least one tsundere character.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replies Bob again, \"we'll have a pseudo-sadistic tsun~ ninja girl with a ridiculously named fighting technique that uses cellulose (leaves), cooks up acid pots, and plays the violin in a maid orchestra.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's make her a vampire as well.\" adds Jim.\\n\\n\r\n\"Why the heck not,\" laughs Bob, giving Jim a high-five.\\n\\n\r\n... and you get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is most surprising about Kore wa Zombie~ despite having so many wild concepts crammed in, it somehow still manages to tie it all into a very neat comical package. Normally you'd expect something so slapstick-heavy to comprise it's plot and characters, but Kore wa Zombie~ manages to seamlessly incorporate all it's content into an (almost) coherent and flowing story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kore wa Zombie~ are all, well, ridiculous. I mean one of them literally has like, 10 different voice actors. And she doesn't talk! (try getting your head around that one). Needless to say, all the characters are very 'interesting' and their backstories relatively well thought out and presented. There is the exception of the protagonist's human friend cuz, he's well... y'know, normal. Kore wa Zombie~ is a harem of course, so there is the usual male lead and his entourage of female companions. What is great though is that unlike many harem (to Love-Ru for instance) that focuses on the protagonist's perverse interactions with the females, Kore wa Zombie~ instead chooses to emphasize building the relationship between the male lead and his companions, which I thought was a nice change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't exactly call Kore wa Zombie's story solid, the plot itself isn't exactly complex; there are various backstories which were left untouched and minor plot hole issues. As far as harem-type story goes however, Kore wa Zombie's plot is definitely up there in with the rest. The interesting aspect of Kore wa Zombie~'s story isn't WHAT is happening, but HOW it's happening, and I found that with Kore wa Zombie~\u2019s almost surrealistic approach, I was caring about the actual plot a lot less that I normally would have, because I was too distracted that ridiculously hilarious thing that just happened.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is the art. While Kore wa Kore~'s animation quality is nothing too spectacular, the action scenes are unique in that they contain a very interesting combination of a dark tone, spectacle, gore, and an excess of pink. Yeah don't think too hard on that one. The OP is also surprisingly well done, and it almost makes me sad that they couldn't maintain the same level of quality throughout the entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe only gripe I have with this anime is due to it's comical nature, there are various moments when supposedly serious scenes are ruined because they took the humor a little bit too far. To give one example (spoiler alert), in the final moments of the main antagonist's death, as he lies dying in the arms of his necromancer, he looks into her eyes in a touching scene, and he says:\\n\\n\r\n\"If I die, make me a penguin.\"\\n\\n\r\nHahaha... No wait. Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nThis really isn't a major issue, but I was disappointed in the show slight deficiency in real consequential, solemn scenes which didn't involve some sort of joke tacked on the end. It made the anime feel a little bit one sided and narrow, and prevented me from giving it a higher score. One thing to mention though. They actually bothered air another episode after the 'big climatic battle'. I literally can't count the number of times I've watched anime that seemed to think that a 3 minute epilogue was sufficient in ending the story after the big boss goes down. Kore wa Zombie~ actually took the effort to give some rarely found closure to the story. Thank god.\\n\\n\r\nKore wa Zombie~ is a rather unique anime, perhaps something you'd expect if you crossed J.C. Staff with SHAFT. It definitely won't win any awards and it's not exactly thought provoking, but it easily makes up for it in sheer ridiculousness and outrage. So why should you watch Kore wa Zombie desu ka? \\n\\n\r\nI dunno lol, who cares? It's fucking hilarious!",

            "content": "Is everything really better with zombies?\r\nGiven the recent surge in stories involving the shambling undead it's pretty obvious that there are people out there who believe that they can improve any form of entertainment, so much so that at times it seems as though the world is already in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Tales of creatures that wander aimlessly, groan a lot, and have the annoying habit of eating people while they're still alive are rife in movies and games (although I tend to class Resident Evil as more of a playable soap opera with added undead), but that's only the tip ofthe iceberg. Zombies are now appearing on prime time TV (The Walking Dead), and even literary works have fallen foul of them (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, anime and manga are no strangers to stories of the undead, and while there are some interesting takes on the theme (and before you ask, no, the adolescent wet dream that is Highschool Of The Dead isn't one of them), the majority of titles on offer follow the George A. Romero method and offer up a healthy dose of body shock. While there are stories like Zombie Loan that try to do things differently, these are often lacklustre affairs that are more drama than actual horror.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there are shows like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka (Is This A Zombie)?\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a popular light novel series by Kimura Shinichi (which has also spawned three different manga that are set in the world of the story), the anime adaptation follows the life of Ayumu Aikawa, a highschool student who was murdered by a serial killer. He was quickly resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, and since that time he has tried to make the best of a bad situation. His life now consists of everyday mundanity (barring an inability to tolerate the sun and avoiding fire hazards), as he lives in relative peace with his silent saviour, but all that changes when he meets the young, chainsaw wielding masou shoujo in training called Haruna (and no, that's not a spelling mistake).\\n\\n\r\nAfter that his life takes a turn for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, it all sounds pretty intriguing, but that's as far as it goes. The plot features some interesting tokens that work well with one or more of the themes in KoreZom, but the series composition has been poorly executed, so much so that viewers may find themselves wondering if there's any point to the show. The main problem is that there's simply too much going on, and because of this the storyline is so disjointed it can sometimes seem like the narrative is being held together with some glue and a couple of nails, and that's not the worst part.\\n\\n\r\nKoreZom attempts to parody some well known genres, and initially it may manage to raise a few laughs with its approach, but this quickly becomes tiresome as the series attempts to turn them into running gags. In addition to this the idea of putting all of the protagonists under one roof has only been done for those stereotypical comedy moments that are amusing to those with more teeth than braincells, which is a shame as there are a few hints of how funny the show could have been. The storyline appears to be desperately trying to reach for ... something, but what it is and how it could be achieved are things that only the producers may know.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the shoddy workmanship continues into the visuals where generic design seems to be the order of the day. Aside from the outfits, KoreZom features some truly unremarkable looking characters, all of whom look like they were copied directly from other harem based shows. That said, Studio DEEN are only partly to blame for this as the main inspiration came from the light novel's illustrations by Kobuichi and Muririn, which is a tad unfortunate as if the rest of the artwork is anything to go by, the series would have been better served with the producers creating everything from scratch. While the scenery and settings may sometimes be generic, they can also be atmospheric and detailed, and there's a variety to the imagery that highlights the difference in creative mentalities. Granted the character design may have been an attempt to support the parodying of specific genres, but that's no excuse for the obvious lack of originality or innovation.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up the issue of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a show has a transparently weak foundation there are many ways to bolster the viewer's opinion of it, but the one that takes the least effort follows the simple ethos that \"sex sells\". Now somebody on the production team obviously realised very early on that KoreZom was a shaky proposition so not only is the fanservice aggressively blatant, it often feels more like a slap in the face.\\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously, is there any need for all those close ups during the fights? This is supposed to be a comedy, not Ikkitousen or Queen's Blade.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the background imagery, the only other good point about the visuals is the animation, most of which is of a decent standard. There are a few blips here and there, some of which are purposeful to highlight certain comedic aspects while  others simply slipped through the net, but these can be forgiven in light of the major problems this series has.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence features a rather dramatic array of imagery depicting the main characters in various \"thoughtful\" poses before adding some action sequences to highlight their combat skills, all set to the song Leave-It-To-Me-Tonight by Nomizu Iori. Unlike the OP, the ending sequence is more true to the predominantly humourous tone of the series, and features the track Realize, Mr. Zombie, I Am Your Classmate by Rie Yamaguchi and Manzo. As for the background music, KoreZom has a nice variety of well choreographed accompaniments, but the truth is that a few of them are unnecessary as they don't really add much to the scene and seem like nothing more than another support for a weak storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, especially given all of the production issues, the acting is actually pretty decent. The script is fairly mediocre as it follows an age old comedy format (so repetitive phrases abound), which isn't really the best thing for the serious moments in the show as it can be difficult to make the mental switch between humour and action - and this shows in several places. Thankfully the seiyuu are on hand to save the day, so what could have been very flat comedy routines gain some life and the more emotive scenes are provided with much needed personality. Unfortunately the actors are only human, so even though they do their best with the script, there's simply not enough viable content to support or develop their roles.\\n\\n\r\nNow given that KoreZom is supposed to be a parody of sorts it should be the case that characterisation is all that's needed to make the series work, so it's a little disappointing that the characters are nothing more than shallow copies based upon one or more archetypes that are generally found in harem romantic comedies. Aikawa is the typical clueless lead male with few future prospects who is suddenly surrounded by females who apparently like necrophilia (he's a zombie, remember?), and after his introduction viewers can engage in a spot of ornithology (bird watching).\\n\\n\r\nOh look! There's the Greater Spotted Tsundere Loli, and over there is the Large Breasted Warrior trying not to look embarrassed, and in front of the TV you can see the Silver Haired Silent Warbler waiting to be entertained.\\n\\n\r\nYes, KoreZom has a wealth of common character types that will keep any harem junkie entertained for five minutes, and the best thing about all of them is that viewers will never once believe that they could ever be real, so feeble is their characterisation and development.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there actually anything good about this series?\\n\\n\r\nWell ... actually there are a few bits worthy of praise, and if one discounts the generally banal and inane humour then KoreZom has a few morsels to offer. There are some genuinely funny moments that are both surprising and well executed, and the while the initial parody of the mahou shouko genre is pretty bog standard, the second one actually refutes the idea that Puella Magi Madoka\u2605Magica was in any way genre breaking.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the comedy can only carry the show so far, and the simple fact is that KoreZom simply doesn't know what it's supposed to be, so it winds up being nothing in particular. It's a shame really as the seeds are there for this to have been either an interesting supernatural tale, or a very good parody (if one removes the unnecessary fanservice), and it's nice to see a different take on zombies once again.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad fact is that the traditional zombie is now almost extinct in entertainment media, and those that remain are treated as rare relics of the original belief that a person could be magically raised from the dead in order to complete tasks like carrying the shopping, painting the house, etc, etc. These old style zombies from West Africa and Haiti are usually a far cry from the modern take, often being better groomed, able to speak, and capable of following simple orders.\\n\\n\r\nActually, they sound a lot like husbands.",

Aren't zombies suppose to be the living dead with rotting flesh and mindless expressions, mumbling \"braaaainnnnssss....\" \r\nNo wait, that's my biology lecturer...\r\nAnyways, sure Aikawa Ayumu looks like a normal typical high school boy with a boring life etc etc, but isn't that how all the typical animes started out with?\r\nHowever, he is blessed with a special gift... No! Not a harem! Im talking about his gift of being the walking undead! (And for added fun, the ability to crossplay!)\r\nThe anime started out pretty normal but just less then a minute everything turns haywire as his identity ofhis zombiefication (Is that even a word?) is exposed in a brutal but comedic manner.\\n\\n\r\nArt looks pretty well done and detailed (especially the gore part.. Wouldnt want that to be censored now would we?) \\n\r\nSound is pretty above average. Nothing to add here.\\n\\n\r\nIntroducing the only male harem lead who is a Zombie...\\n\r\nAikawa Ayumu.. Hmm.. Other than the fact he possess inhuman powers, he is infact weak towards the sun.. Thats odd? Zombies are weak towards the sun but vampire ninjas are OK? \\n\r\nSo he also possess the power to change into a Masou Shojo which never fails to make me barf each time. Seriously, no kidding, I skip the entire transformation sequence, and you would too if you're a TRUE man.\\n\r\nSure he is a T.K wannabe in break dancing and he has a fetish for little sister and he has a perverted best friend and he doesn't live with his parents etc etc, the fact he has his own harem means deep down he is a good guy and every good guy deserves a harem. Just wondering why I haven't gotten mine yet...\\n\\n\r\nSo lets review the girls shall we? My favorite part of all harem anime\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #1\\n\r\nA necromancer? Silver haired, endowed with super imbalanced powers, and yet a fragile existence you feel like you just wanna protect. Best part is? She won't say a word which means less arguments and more *ehmm* time if ya know what I mean? ;) What you dont know what I mean? Sheesh, what are they teaching you kids in class nowadays.\\n\r\nHarem Girl score: 9.0\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #2\\n\r\nA masou shojo with a chainsaw who lets everyone change into a magical girl except herself. Typical tsundere with flat chest, but claims to have the highest IQ of them all. Sassy and courageous, she's the first of the magical that actually has an attitude. However, he inability to cook anything but eggs doesn't look in her favour for guys who's a glutton. Who cares anyways? Ayumu is a zombie and all he eats is brains.. (No seriously, zombies should eat brains)\\n\r\nHarem Girl Score: 8.8\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #3\\n\r\nA Ninja Vampire?? Who writes this stuff anyways?? Approximately D-E cup, this natural beauty is equipped with not only a sharp tongue, but with a superiority complex. Master of the leaf blade but only able to use a single technique, terrible chef and not much of a genius, some guys still like her due to her busty looks and long black hair. Probably slim chances of being in Ayumu's harem but she's living under the same roof with him so she's practically in it without even knowing it herself. Good luck to Ayumu trying to get this one.\\n\r\nHarem Girl score: 9.0\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #4\\n\r\nAnother Ninja Vampire?? Oh c'mon now.. Anyways, my personal favourite, tom boyish, a bit of an air head but still charming in her own way. Probably the only character up to date that actually have feelings for zombie boy over here due to some unforseen circumstances (If you're a cult member of the harem revolution, then you probably have a slight gist of how this happened)\\n\r\nHarem Girl score: 9.2 \\n\r\nEXTRA POINTS FOR BEING ABLE TO COOK!\\n\\n\r\nI rate the comedy of this anime to be a fusion of MM! + Dokuro-chan\\n\r\ndue to it's extreme slapstick jokes and the never ending pain the male lead has to suffer. But look at the bright side.. He can never be put out of his misery... Wouldn't you want an immortal body when you have a harem all to yourself?\\n\\n\r\nOverall Gore+Comedy+Supernatural+Chainsaw wielding Magical Girl+Crossplaying = Kore wa Zombie Desu, which can also be equals to animegasm. (Im just randomly adding words here) And some fan-service to boot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER!\\n\r\nEveryone's favourite GIGA PUDDI made an appearance in episode 3 :)",

            "content": "So what is 'Is This A Zombie?' aka 'Koreha Zombie Desu ka?'\r\nZombie Desu ka (as I'll refer to it from now on) is an anime that abuses genre cliches, it's horrendously inconsistent, shockingly violent and has some of the most uncomfortable shots of a guy's ass on several occasions...and it's easily one of the funniest animes I've ever seen.\r\nYES. Zombie Desuka is the BUSINESS. I honestly couldn't contain my laughter ever since the dynamic and hysterical first episode. What makes this anime so special is, as I've mentioned, how it abuses genre cliches such as harem, shonen, fantasy, fanservice and even a bit of heavilyimplied yaoi. There's an ample amount of fanservice in this anime, ranging from your typical 'pantsu' shots to bouncing cleavage, but there's also a surprising amount of fujoshi bait (and by that I mean moments that would make girl fans cream themselves) which is a nice balance. So while it was uncomfortable to see the main character's ass every so often, I can take it as fair since modern animes try more to appeal to both perverse fanbases.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the main character, Ayumu is your typical, lazy-eyed, dangling spiky hair protagonist. You can draw comparisons between him and Tomoya from Clannad and Ichika from infinite Stratos, but I believe that he is a lot like Sato from the anime Ben-To. They're both energetic guys who don't go out of their way to be perverted but are definitely guys who wouldn't pass a chance to take a look, nor do they act all bashful when they're caught. In fact, there's a lot of similarities between Ben-To and Zombie Desu ka, from the absurd plot devices, the pacing and tone as well as the random comedy. And like Ben-To, I found myself surprised by wacky elements popping up every so often and it was great how it managed to blend with the semi-serious story. I've grown fond of animes like this; the whole 'comedy action fanservice' genre, cause it manages to not take itself too seriously but delivers a hilarious plot with some great action and fanservice shots. It's a delicate balance that few animes manage to achieve properly, but these few are pretty amazing. Animes such as Heaven's Lost Property and Highschool DxD have much 'darker' stories and heavy ecchi/ fanservice, whereas animes like Ben-To and Zombie Desuka are lite on the fanservice but emphasize the wacky side more often.\\n\\n\r\nSo as the title implies, the anime revolves around Ayumu being a zombie, resurrected by a quiet, moe necromancer named 'Eu' who treats him as a servant and friend. He uses his newfound life, and surprisingly superhuman powers, to find his killer. If this all sounds awfully serious and deep, trust me the first episode derails that by the end. The dramatic air that the first few minutes of the first episode give off is immediately dispelled by a hilarious moment when Ayumu gets hit by a car in a wacky fashion. By the end of the episode, I shit you not, he becomes a magical garment girl on top of being a zombie, doing a whole long-ass magical girl transformation and everything, with PANTY SHOTS AND EVERYTHING *shudders*. The weird train doesn't end there, as he ends up having a 'masou-shoujo' in this house, then later a vampire ninja girl (with big boobs, cause why not) and eventually has another vampire ninja girl (also well endowed) end up falling in love with him, under ridiculous, parody-cliche circumstances. While this all sounds like a cluster of absurd plot devices, it's exactly what makes this anime so hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the defining features of Zombie Desu ka is the aforementioned moe necromancer, Eu. Her full name is 'Eucliwood Hellscythe' and she takes the quiet moe girl cliche to a whole new level. What I found very creative is how, while she doesn't speak at all and prefers to write down what she wants to say, the main character imagines her voice in his head, saying perverted things in place of the normal request she asked. This is done each episode by a different voice actress (both in the sub and dub) so you're never sure which voice is her real one, and it's probably one of the most creative things about her character. While there's a lot of cliches in her design, her reason for not speaking are actually quite dramatic. The explanation comes off as a load of over-complicated fantasy mumbo-jumbo, but it fits in with the semi-serious tone of the show and it's a major plot device. I won't ruin too much but there's a lot of surprises in store regarding her reasons for not speaking, and trust me you'll wanna see what those reasons are.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists in this anime are unexpected but manage to be entertaining in their own ways, and the overarching main bad guy delivers one of THE funniest lines in the second to last episode. The final episode decides to take all the cliches it hadn't touched upon and abuse them to a comedic end as well, and so does the OVA episode. While this can be considered a harem anime at its base level it surprisingly manages to dodge a ton of genre cliches or use them in moderation; strange for an anime that parodies cliches. It almost never uses the typical 'walk in on girl naked' cliche and 'fall on and grope girl' cliche that animes like To Love Ru are infamous for, and when it does the result is violent retribution (as usual) which is balanced by the fact that Ayumu is a zombie so any physical damage is real but doesn't last. The main character however does go through a ton of physical and verbal abuse from start to finish, being called 'pervert' and 'maggot' for a ton of different reasons, a lot of which is funny. However the vampire ninja girl Sera does weigh on your patience with her persistent insults and she's not even a tsundere or love interest waiting to happen, she's more of the freeloader who has her own motives and shits on the main character all the time. While she is hot and her insults are funny for the most part, it can become annoying after a while. Despite that, every character manages to be goofy and funny in a variety of ways so small things like that don't get in the way.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that Zombie Desu Ka is perfect, far from it. There's a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies and moments that go unanswered. There's characters that get introduced but disappear just as quickly or aren't seen often. There's plot devices that are mentioned or implied, but never expanded upon. And there's a lot of issues regarding the depth of Ayumu's powers and why he's able to steal someone else's powers. However, I don't believe that any of these are an issue since the animes M.O. from the start was to abuse plot devices and cliches, so you tend to go with the flow rather than look for answers in a semi-serious anime. A lot of the occurrences in animes like Excel Saga go unexplained and we accept them purely because it's wacky fun, and whilst a lot of comedy animes have a decent amount of wacky elements I'd say that Zombie Desu Ka is one of the few animes that fully embraces the wacky side. Despite the inconsistencies, there's a lot of subtle things that this anime does well. The animation is solid and the fight scenes are fluid and epic. The music is upbeat and can be mellow when dramatic things occur. The plot device of Ayumu hating the sun since it dries him up (strange plot device for a zombie, I know) is interestingly accentuated by how blinding the light is during the day and each character has one or two defining quirks just like this, including the main bad guy. So while it was the kind of anime you don't have to think too deeply about, it was easy on the eyes too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what can I say about Zombie Desu Ka? It's absurd, it's violent, it's random and it's just plain weird sometimes. But it's also hilarious, epic, touching at times and surprising at other times. I don't usually give numbered scores but if I could give this anime a score i'd give it a 9/10. I've only watched the first season so far so I have big hopes for the second. I watched the dub of it, and the cast did a phenomenal job, especially with the many voices that portrayed Eu in Ayumu's thoughts. Both the japanese and english versions manage to be funny for their own reasons in both the delivery of jokes and contexts of funny situations, so each is a unique watch. I look forward to watching the dub of the second season and I really hope it doesn't derail itself like too many second seasons do. However if it's like Heaven's Lost Property or Highschool DxD, it can only get better and funnier. Despite all the physical violence, verbal abuse, weird situations and world ending events that come across Ayumu's way, he can take it. Why? Cause he's a zombie.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen an anime you were convinced was going to be really cool and interesting and only just to have it let you down to no end?  Welcome to my experience with Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka.  After two episodes which presented a genuinely interesting and refreshing take on the harem genre (interesting takes on mythological creatures, nobody particularly interested in each other romantically, basically just putting up with each other simply because they have to), this series succumbs to the harem tropes it actively avoids and just becomes ultimately a very lazy series.\r\nThe initial concept for this show is actuallypretty interesting, with Ayumu who has just recently become a zombie living with the necromancer who resurrected him because, well what else is he going to do realistically.  After his transformation, they meet other mythological creatures and beings such as a magical school girl and a vampire ninja.  They fight creatures called megalos which are evil spirits that actually have some really creative and inspired designs to them.  In one episode, they fight a giant whale in a school uniform that would put Sin from Final Fantasy X to shame.  In another, they fight a giant enemy crab and attack its weak point for massive damage.  One of the big points of humor in these fights is how as a zombie Ayumu basically has no powers, so he has to use magical girl powers a la Sailor Moon, which include gratuitous transformation sequences (it\u2019s actually pretty funny in practice.)  In this regard, the first half of the series is the best because it focuses on the sheer lunacy of the entire situation and the creatures they have to fight.   \\n\\n\r\nBut then something terrible happens, Zombie No Desu Ka starts to take itself seriously.  This show, about a zombie living who uses magical girl powers and lives with a necromancer, another magical girl and a vampire ninja, starts to take itself incredibly seriously for some reason right around episode 4 or 5 and it absolutely kills the momentum.  When the show isn\u2019t having fun with its ridiculous premise, its bogged down by pointless drama about Ayumu\u2019s killer or a story arc later in the series that is so ridiculous that I can\u2019t believe they even animated it.  On top of all this, after episode 6 the show just starts to become a victim of the same tired harem/ecchi anime tropes that we\u2019ve seen a million times before.  The jokes start to get really lazy, the girls start to get interested in Ayumu, a new tsundere vampire ninja is introduced, and the entire show just becomes a drag.  It just drags itself through the motions up until the final episode, which is almost unwatchable.  It\u2019s a pool episode featuring some terrible J-Pop performances from the cast of girls that I\u2019m convinced almost made my ears bleed.  How in the hell did we get to this point?\\n\\n\r\nThis is what happens when you completely forget why your show works and just start pulling stuff out of thin air to kill time.  This show could have been really cool by sticking to having fun with its absurd initial set up and following it through to the end.  I was completely on board to enjoy this show thoroughly.  Please don\u2019t waste your time on this show.  It\u2019s a crime that a show like this ended up getting better ratings across Japan than a masterpiece like Fractale, despite this being a wasted opportunity.  If you want a real comedy series, look elsewhere; this will just leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.\\n",

            "content": "Hello, folks. Today we'll talk about `Koreha Zombie Desuka?', whose original name is \u300c\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u300d, henceforth called `KoreZom'. First, allow me to tell you that I've never read the original Light Novel, as well as never read any of the adaptation manga. So, every opinion bases itself on the anime, and no comparisons between adaptations are made.\r\nWell then, let us begin.\r\n~!~\r\nStory: 9 out of 10.\r\nKoreZom has lots of comedy, but even though it manage to unfold an very interesting plot. Since, once again, it has great focus over the comedy, I really wasn't expecting any story at all. I've seen comedy animes that just had almostno plot; the anime seemed to flow only over its own jokes, but there was no development. Well then, KoreZom is not like that. As a matter of fact, its plot is much more well thought than other animes of this very season.\\n\r\nI was going to give it 8, but it turned out 9 because the jokes are all very well timed and played, so much that they affect positively the story itself.\\n\r\nBy the way, every character seems to have cool backgrounds, but I fear those aren't going to be shown, unless we get a second season.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nIt is beautiful. The characters' designed is cool and well-done, from casual outfits to a necromancer's armored outfit. Emotions are well expressed, too. Also very fitting are the backgrounds, from a high school to a graveyard, they're all very expressing, and cool.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nGreat voice acting, general background effects, as well as a rocking awesome opening! The ending music kind of sucks, although being funny, but since there's no reason to hear it, I didn't count it.\\n\r\nThere's really not much to say, really. It is just great.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nNow that's where that show shines. A cool zombie lead male, an even cooler necromancer girl (well, she's my fav anime girl), a bad-mouthed vampire ninja, an extravagant masou-shoujo (a pun with mahou-shoujo), and that's not even the beginning. Funny as hell friends, psychopath villains, and (yet again) funny enemies called `Megalos'.\\n\r\nDamn, the characters are splendid, each one of them.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nCool characters, well timed and played jokes, nice artwork, and a interesting story. How could you not enjoy it? You'll laugh out loud, pause at a certain zombie's delusions, re-watch the cool moments, and have chills in the spine with Yuu (also called Eu).\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nThat's it, folks. There's absolutely no reason to look down or overlook this fantastic anime. Each episode proves better than the previous, and you'll catch yourself counting days until the next episode. The best thing is that there's more to come! And maybe we got even a second season.\\n\r\nNow, I know that there will be folks that won't like it the way I do, for everybody has its own tastes. But well, that's my opinion: this anime is a masterpiece, whose only drawback is the low number of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time!",

            "content": "\"Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\" is, despite what the \"Zombie\" in its title might suggest, the extreme opposite of every zombie show you've ever seen before. Forget about mindless monsters trying to eat you alive. What we have here is a harem mixed with slapstick comedy, magic and lots of gore.\r\nStory: As in most harem animes, the actual story is not the show's main focus. However, at first glance, it seems quite a promising one for its genre, though pretty simple: A high school student is murdered after he is attacked by an unknown person. However, he is revived as a zombie with the helpof a weird necromancer girl. From then on, he serves as her undead servant, while at the same time searching for the one who killed him, as well as continuing his school life. Various other (female) characters are also introduced, including a magic girl and a vampire-ninja, each with their own mini-backstories.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Animation: Like most of the latest anime, the animation is very good. The designs are crisp and well drawn, and I dare say quite pretty. I can't say that I have any particular problem with it whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting does its job well, with the voices being properly funny or serious depending on what is needed. There is nothing really memorable about them, but that's not nececerily a bad thing, as long as the job gets done. What I do have to aplaud  is the OP, which is officially my third favourite OP of all time (behind only the OP of Umineko and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: To the core, the characters in \"Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\" are pretty much the usual Harem stereotypes: A teenage guy surrounded by a bunch of girls (which include the typical tsundere, loli etc). However, the fact that they all belong in the supernatural world slightly changes things. They can all be quite kickass at times (except for the Necromancer girl, who is extremely docile 99% of the time, but bringing people back from the dead is even cooler anyway ;) ). They can all be hilariouly funny at the same time, and they all seem to have some higher goal in life than just sleeping with the other characters - which some of them also have, nontheless. To sum it up, they seem like proper characters, unlike in the majority of harem animes. I mean, what other harem features a zombie and a vampire ninja among the protagonists? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This a harem anime, so fanservice and tyical harem humor is always going to be there. But there is much more to it than that. The element of slapstic comedy is always there. What is unusual is the excecive (for the genre) amount of gore - which can be strangely funny, rather than shocking, at times. Add to that all the supernatural stuff... you 've got yourself a very good combination right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Harem, Comedy, Supernatural, Gore, School Life... there are not many series that combine all these. \"Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\" does so, and it seems to do so well. If you like any of the above genres, you 've got to give this a try. You might love it or you might not... but you'll never know until you try for yourself.",

            "content": "Oh boy... This show. I find myself torn while writing this, on one hand there were some extremely funny and enjoyable moments where I could not stop laughing. But on the other hand there were some downright terrible moments where I was raising my head to the ceiling praying for the scene to end. Is this a Zombie is an anime that makes it's mark by throwing in every genre, every character type, every trope, just everything really. If you can think of it there is a high probability you'll find it in this show. But despite throwing everything under the sun into this anime,I would never dream of calling it cliche, and actually say it is extraordinarily unique. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nGuy meets girl, they kind of like each other, plot ensues, girl now lives with guy, more girls live with guy, etc, etc. While some of the specifics may be new, the overall concept is nothing we have not seen. \\n\r\nThe Zombie and Necromancer (a.k.a servant and master) relationship was well done. Tack onto that the school life setting with a guy just trying to pass through along with his nerdy best friend; it was all well done, though a bit unoriginal. The eccentricities and unique nature of this show come in when we meet a chain-saw wielding Magical Girl (though she uses her magic a whole lot less than Ayumu...) and a busty Vampire Ninja with a leaf sword. Not gonna lie, her concept is fucking amazing. This show throws in every concept you can think of but somehow manages to make it work. \\n\r\nI would be remiss if I did not mention my largest gripe with the show, the fact that Ayumu is more or less our magical girl... Maybe I am alone, but I do not find cross-dressing to be a very funny plot point, I just don't. But even then I can sometimes see how it could work in a story if well done. But sadly, I did not find this to be one of those times. You see, Ayumu doesn't like it, first time, first episode, he dislikes transforming into a magical girl with a pink frilly outfit complete with panties and a bow. Hates it may be a more accurate statement. But every time he is forced to do so, he gets an unbelievable amount of shit from the other characters for doing it. Forced to cross dress in pink to save them all, and they insult him for doing so. Sorry, not a scenario I found even remotely amusing or entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much here, it felt exceedingly average. But since the average these days (for 2011) is still good, it gets a 7. Though I should mention I really liked the character designs. I can't say anything on their artistic value, just a specific aspect I found really nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI found that the OST really just did it's job. Set the scene, nothing more. But what I absolutely loved was the voice acting. I came into this show long after it aired, long enough that there was in fact an English Dub, and that is what I watched. Stone me, go ahead. Spout your insults and hate for the one who neglected to watch it subbed but had the audacity to write a review. Ignoring the hate though, I loved the English Dub. I thought the voices were perfect and added to the hilarity of the scenes, while also capturing some of the more emotional moments fairly well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis was a rather fun cast of characters. They all seemed to fall into archetypes, but were extremely memorable despite that. \\n\\n\r\nAyumu Aikawa- Our zombie protagonist who is a nice enough guy but with that laid back, bored disposition. I rather liked Ayumu, he was fairly similar to other harem leads in that he isn't the most popular, isn't extremely capable physically or intellectually, but still sits in the back right side of the classroom next to a window. He gets a lot of abuse in this show, verbal and physical. Being immortal the characters feel no guilt in stabbing him. Being the nice guy he takes it all with a bit of disbelief but really just goes along with it.\\n\\n\r\nEucliwood Hellscythe- I thought I had seen the quiet character exhibited perfectly in Yuki Nagato. Boy was I wrong. Eucliwood (though everyone calls her Eu) is the character that I consider to be the ultimate moe blob of adorable. She takes the quiet nature to a whole new level by literally not saying a word, but writing everything on little notepads. Though giving off an uncaring persona, she is actually extremely kind hearted. Where I truly applaud the creators is the way Eu had a different voice actress for every episode. Now for a character that doesn't speak it may seem difficult to have a voice actress; luckily our perverted main is here to imagine Eu complimenting him in a suggestive format. It was well done and extremely enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nHaruna- The resident Tsundere Magical Girl who is a self proclaimed genius and makes great eggs. She really is just a fun character with a ton of energy. She doesn't have the best memory and freeloads at Ayumu's home eating more food than anyone else. \\n\\n\r\nSeraphim- The busty Vampire Ninja, she is extremely cold towards our main character but gets along with others well enough. My issue with Seraphim is that she is accurately summed up by the word bitch. Obviously there is a bit more to her than that attribute alone, but that forms the crux of her character and it left liking her a very arduous task...\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the characters is that they all seem to give Ayumu a bit too much crap. Don't get me wrong, at times it was hilarious to watch them all insult Ayumu. But in my not-so-professional opinion this show needed a character that Ayumu could get along with. In my head this equated to a character that acted in a more playful manner rather than a degrading one. Sexual innuendo or playfully teasing, just someone that alleviated the constant barrage of shit Ayumu received. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment overall is limited to a 7. When this show was good, it was GREAT, but when it wasn't great I honestly considered it be rather bad. My opinion in this facet is probably rather polarized from the majority, but for every scene I loved I found one I disliked as well. My enjoyment did swing in a positive manner on the whole, but nevertheless I had my issues. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis show takes every thought that could pop into a writer's brain and throws it into an oddly coherent plot. Combined with a fun cast and good voice acting, comedy, some action, and even the occasional emotional moment, you get a genuinely good show. This show is definitely good for a laugh. Even if you are like me and dislike main characters who get a ton of shit, I would still recommend this show. If you're on the fence about the show than I would recommend watching the first two episodes as they perfectly exhibit what this show is: A fun 12 episodes that is even complimented by a second season. Is This a Zombie is a good anime that combines every cliche into something unique.",

            "content": "The following will be a review for one of my favourite shows; Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\r\nNow, without further ado, Here is the review.\r\n~Story~ (8/10)\r\nFor me, the story for excellent. The was the story works in this anime is really quite odd. Everyone has their own stories and agendas, there really isn't an overarching story until the second season.\r\nThe main gist of the story revolves around the Zombie Ayumu and the Necromancer Eucliwood (Eu) and the shenanigans and such that they get up to. On the surface, this may just look like your average Harem/Ecchi/Action but if you care to look deeper you'll really findsome great character development and romance in the scenes where Ayumu is alone with Eu.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this show was really quite good. It wasn't on an Angel Beats! level or anything like that, but it was still very good. The fight scenes were drawn well and fluidly, and the characters all looked great; especially Eucliwood. The backgrounds were alright enough and the monsters and big center scenes were all drawn really well.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ (8/10)\\n\r\nI found the sound to be surprisingly good for a show like this. The OP and ED were both decidedly average, despite the OP being sung by Nomizu Iori, so I have to say; I was expecting more.\\n\r\nNow onto where the sound really shines; the voice acting. I really loved the voice acting in this show. Eucliwood was just amazing, and I love how they gave her a different Seiyuu for all of Ayumu's fantasies. Haruna was voiced in your typical tsundere fashion, and Seraphim's voice was just amazing; I loved how perfectly cold and sharp it was.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in\"Kore wa\" are really quite good and diverse. For this review I'll only be going into the main 'harem' characters. \\n\r\nTo start off with Ayumu is virtually your typical shounen male lead, so there really isn't that much to cover on him, I will instead focus on the others. \\n\\n\r\nEucliwood is really quite a complex character. She really cares about all of her friends, but in turn that winds up hurting them when she decides to just take matters into her own hands without properly talking things through with anyone. I would love to say more, but I feel like too many spoilers would be revealed.\\n\\n\r\nSeraphim is a 100% tsuntsun 0% deredere character. She is mainly a fan service and story progression character, but if you watch the show, you'll see she has quite a deep backstory.\\n\\n\r\nHaruna is one of your more typical tsundere characters; starting off hating Ayumu, but slowly coming to accept him (and more?).\\n\\n\r\nSorry I couldn't really say anything more here, I really didn't want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ (10/10)\\n\r\nAll up I really loved this anime. It has a really great cast of characters, the story is good, and Eucliwood is my personal pick for the best female character ever. Every episode seemed like it was over in a heartbeat, and I was left wanting more after every ED.\\n\\n\r\nThanks a lot for bearing with me through my first review :3 Hopefully they'll be getting better after I've written a few, but hey. Everyone has to start somewhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to discuss anything, drop a comment on my profile! Usually I reply to anything.",

Also random addition, this episode has lots of blood forthose of you who are a little squeamish \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing about the music really stood out to me, except maybe a few moments where I went \"well this is kinda catchy...\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI give characters a 9 not because their especially compelling but most because their entertainment factor was through the roof for me. Just the way the protagonist seems to interact and react with his world, even the way he narrates as a character; I found very appealing. Additionally they did make some room in this episode for some potentially more serious and in depth character development later in the show, not much, but they did leave room.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI've only been watching anime for 6 months, but pilot episode literally made me laugh out loud, which only two other anime have been able to do so far, I spent a lot of the episode thinking about how ridiculous the situations were, but O so very entertaining :P. Just watch out for some unexpected fanservice and a lot of of wtf moments :P\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIf you like ridiculous comedies, magical girls, ecchi....and blood, you'll likely really enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "*This may contain a few spoilers*\r\nAt first I thought Kore wa zombie desu ka? was going to be one of those fantasy-comedy anime without an actual storyline and with lots of boring episodes. Fortunately, it was much better than I thought.\r\nStory: 6\r\nI was very surprised that this had a plot. It really did. The story focuses on a high school boy, Ayumu, who is both a zombie and a Magiclad Girl (Yeah, I know, kinda weird) and his supernatural friends, Eu, Haruna and Sera who fight against all kind of creatures. This might seem a little mediocre and it is because as the show goeson, more and more unearthly phenomena occur and strange characters show up. But, like I said, I am glad that the anime followed a decent plot with some unexpected events and it wasn't just a stupid comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 9\\n\r\nBoth were good. The characters have many details and some distinctive features, the magical creatures are ok and the outdoor scenery is good, so I don't have much to say. My eyes liked what they saw.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nHere, unfortunately, we have some stereotypical characters: Ayumu - the easy-going teenager who cares a lot about his friends and wants to protect them. Eu - the most powerfull character, silent but very smart, full of emotions and very altruistic. Haruna - the funny girl, always smiling who falls in love with Ayumu. Sera - the sensible one, with a strong character who likes being in charge of everything,\\n\r\nThere is truly nothing special about those characters, none of them stands out. On the other hand, I apperciate the huge character development. Ayumu starts to care about Eu when she leaves and realizes she's very important to him. Eu also realizes that she's not a soulless monster and she has friends who would die for her and Sera abandons her mission to kill Eu because she finally understood that friends are the most important thing in the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt wasn't a brilliant anime, even far from a good one, but I somehow enjoyed watching it. It was funny indeed (especially Ayumu's transformation into a Magiclad Girl), it was violent indeed (which I liked the most) and it had some heartbreaking moments which really got to my feels. As I said, there were some boring episodes, unrelated to the actual plot but at least they were funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI rated Kore wa zombie desu ka? 7 because it represented a nice surprise for me. The series exceeded my expectations which is really awesome and if the caracters were a little more original, I would give it an 8.\\n\r\nWhat can I say... If you like fantasy-comedy-harem with some gore and romance anime, you should really watch this. It might be a disappointment for some people but on the contrary, I find this anime better than I thought it would be.",

            "content": "Looking back on this show I question myself how I enjoyed this show. Riddled with fanservice, a harem which means no actual romance, and a cast of invincible characters. Our good male lead Ayumu is a zombie, taking an arm or two is but a flesh wound, and our female lead  has enough magic power that the universe is changed at her emotions and words. The action scenes are enjoyable and occur frequently but nothing extraordinary. They aren't afraid to show a bit of blood though!\r\nNevertheless, there is something about the comedy in this set up that makes every episode worth watching. Of coursebeing undead gives the genre slapstick a new meaning, and by the end of the first episode Ayumu gains the power of Masou Shoujo. Yes that\u2019s right - he is a magical zombie cross dresser wielding a pink chainsaw. If you don't find it funny the first time he transforms well you will definitely get sick of it by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow I did look down on the show earlier for the fanservice. However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the female cast. Eu is our mute armored necromancer who doesn't get much of an appearance in the show till later because, well, she is mute. I liked her appearances but story wise she made a lot of decisions that didn't make sense. \\n\\n\r\nHaruna is the masou shoujo who has lost her powers and is the pain in the ass tsundere that lives in Ayumu's house. The fanservice target, she is the most prominent female character. Another person who can be a break or make on your takeaway from the show. \\n\\n\r\nSera is a vampire, whose story of origin was horrible. Yet, voiced by Youko Hisaka, one of the more fun characters. She has a running gag of how horribly she can verbally abuse the main character, but is also a ninja at the same time. She is never prominent in the story, but makes steady appearances throughout.\\n\\n\r\nYuki, another vampire, acts as the wife or Ayumu, reasons to be left to your imagination, and is the only character that's dere was actually enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a strong comedy, it attempts to have a serious plot at times. At these times it fails to be serious, and you are left wondering if they intended to make the plot a joke (in more ways than one). It starts out with how Ayumu wants to get revenge on his murderer, but despite how mysterious it seems like it will be at the start the intensity vanishes until he easily finds them a few episodes in. From there the plot switches to Eu's past mistake and the whole situation is rather ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a mix of peculiar comedy and have a tolerance for harem settings this could be the show for you. The atmosphere is typically bright except for those random serious moments they throw at the viewer. \\n",

            "content": "Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was certainly an interesting show.  What initially attracted me to the show was that the main character was in fact a zombie and after seeing that it was labeled as a harem story I was interested to see where it would go.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nOk, personally I really enjoyed this show.  However I would say that the story was the show's major weak point.  The initial premise of the story is extremely unique and interesting.  Main character and normal high schooler Ayumu Aikawa is murdered by a serial killer, is then brought back to life as a zombieby a necromancer and now is trying to discover who killed him and why, certainly a somewhat dark and unique idea.  However with the introduction of Masou-Shoujo Haruna, the story takes a turn for the weird and comedic.  After being cut in half by Haruna's chainsaw during a battle, Ayumu accidentally absorbs her magic and must now take over her role of fighting demons as a Mahou-Shoujo, complete with transformation sequence and frilly pink dress.  And that basically is how the rest of the show proceeds.  It constantly walks the line between \"wow this is a dark bloody action anime\" and \"boy in a pink dress encounters harem hijinks.\"  This results in the pacing of the show being somewhat off and at times I felt as if I was watching two completely different shows.  Most of the time there was no particular reason for why the story progressed the way it did, things would just kind of happen and then the characters would respond.  \\n\\n\r\nThis having all been said though, the comedic aspect of the show was great and almost every episode something would be said or happen that would provoke a laugh out of me and the show does tell a compelling and unique story when it decides to get serious.  Despite also being labeled a harem genre, this is only a minor detail in the events of the main story and the overall feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe animation in the show was very good I felt.  The scenery was good, the landscapes realistic, and the character designs were very unique and fresh.  The fight sequences and gore were extremely well done yet equal attention was given when dealing with the more comedic and ridiculous aspects of the show (flying whale monsters for example).  The sound was also excellent, the opening got you hooked and the ending theme was just plain fun and both were very original.  The voice acting was good as well, everyone delivered a great performance and fit their roles to a tee.  Plus Yuu's plethora of different voice actresses contributed to a great part of the series' humor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were definitely (in my opinion) the best part of the show.  They were modeled off past traditional character types but they were very fleshed out and there was a good amount of character development in the show across the boards.  Ayumu is not your typical average harem lead ( for one he's a zombie).  He's not overly perverted or boring in any way, he's just an average guy forced to deal with ridiculous situations and handles them accordingly, and unlike a normal harem lead he's got some redeeming qualities and is more than capable of being a badass when its crunch time.  I thought that all of the characters were hilarious in their own way though.  All of the rest of the characters in the show were mostly there for comic relief and fulfilled their roles excellently.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDespite its faults, I really liked Kore wa? The whole time I was watching it I was just thinking to myself \"wow I love this show\", even when I noticed plot inconsistencies or when I felt they went over the top with something.  It was hilarious, the characters were crazy, the story was original, and while the romantic and the serious aspects of the show often clashed, I felt both worked in their own right and made the show amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: If you are looking for a show with great comedic value, unique characters, or just a different or ridiculous story, then I would highly recommend watching Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.  It was always fun, with its fair share of serious moments and interesting characters.  I highly recommend for fans of harems or offbeat comedies.",

            "content": "Story/Characters: 10/10 of 10\r\nAt the half-way point, this is a well wrought tale, with significant twists along the way. There is a certain amount of \"cliche elements\" in the telling, but what sets Kore wa Zombie desu ka? apart from the crowd and saves it from being a cliche ridden also ran is the way it turns each and every one of those cliches on its ear, pokes a wet willy in it, strips it of its dignity, and then tells it \"It is OK! People still love you even with all your warts!\" In other words, the show has an overriding irreverent tone anda mocking sense of humor about itself and the various genres from which it harvests its plot fodder. The show is extremely well written and funny, eliciting several \"laugh out loud\" moments per episode on average, but at the same time, it actually approaches tear inducing tenderness when it takes the time to focus on the protagonist and his savior/master/goddess of all that is dandere, Yuu. (I said almost... I don't think I have cried yet, though I am a notorious softy... just ask my kids.)\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Yuu is a thing to behold. Moe in the extreme, she takes dandere to a new height, as she isn't just quiet, she doesn't talk, with the exception of dream sequences, labeled \"This is fantasy of our weak-hearted protagonist Aikawa Ayumu\", in which she speaks with a high, pleading voice and calls him Onii-chan, complete with mooney eyes, and frequently scantily clad. She communicates by writing notes on a pad, frequently with a tsun edge in the writing, making her, I guess, a tsun-dan-dere character.  The other characters are good as well. The heavily tsundere Haruna, who is living with them until she recovers her Masou Shojo powers from Ayumu, is a bundle of contradictions, as a genius magical girl that can't seem to be bothered to remember mundane things like names or where she was supposed to be buying tofu for her magical girl teacher. The third member of the harem is Sera, the Vampire-Ninja who seeks Yuu's aid and stays with them when she is refused, hoping to earn Yuu's help, all the while referring to Ayumu as various names similar to \"worthless pile of $%!#\". There are also Ayumu's friends at school, who he doesn't want to discover the truth about his living/unliving situation, as being the male living with a harem of magical/dangerous women is not something he thinks his high school buddies can handle.\\n\\n\r\nAll this would rate a high, but not stellar score if it weren't for one thing that the show does: surprise! Just when I think that I have a handle on the show, it throws a curve. Just when I think I know where the story is headed, it changes course. And just when I think I have things figured out, it turns another corner and reveals that most of what you have seen is not really the way things are. When that is combined with the consistently funny dialog and over the top humor, it makes for an enjoyable ride!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe main failing in Kore wa Zombie desu ka? is the art, at least in my opinion. There are frequently times when it seems the backgrounds are neglected, and the character renditions sometimes have shortcuts. Much of the combat animation is choppy and awkward looking, though I will grant that some of this is intentional due to the nature of the zombie protagonist. His body moves in awkward ways at times. The character designs, with the exception of  Yuu, are also a bit generic, with Sera being the only human character that I have not mistaken for someone else at least briefly at some point in the show. The men are particularly generic, with the glasses of the 'best friend' character distinguishing him from the protagonist. Luckily there are not many shots of men other than Ayumu. It is possible that this is mostly a personal problem and others see more distinction between the designs, but I particularly find it hard to distinguish Haruna from some of the other girls, either at his school or the \"friend\" in the hospital that shows up in the third episode. There are some parts that are beautifully done, but others that fall short. The magical transformation sequences are quite striking, in their visual effect and the humor value as well! Another aspect that bothers some, but not me, is the level of fan service and gore. I consider most of the fan service to be parody, and it never becomes prurient or of an overtly sexual nature. The gore is also frequently used for comic effect, and the show is, after all, about a zombie! One must anticipate a certain amount of blood and gore!\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that there aren't some bits of excellence. Where the animators take the time to make the art shine, it is great. I just feel there are too many points at which they let it slide along at average.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound Effects: 8 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening music is very good and the incidental music is frequently spot on. The end music is a catchy little tune, but also a bit annoying, as is the super deformed animation used during it.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe main voice actors are well done, with Haruna and Sera having a nice blend of acerbic tone with the occasional softer side. The male lead is well done but nothing really that special either. The best friend character's voice I find annoying, but I think you are supposed to. The Megalo tend to all sound alike to me. The \"friend in the hospital\" is one of the strongest vocal performances, as that character goes through some pretty impressive changes and variations across the episodes the is featured in. The absolute winner in terms of voice acting is the sickly sweet voice of Yuu in Ayumu's weak-hearted fantasy life! She sounds absolutely endearing and devoted, as is appropriate for a fantasy of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nI am loving this show! I watch it first of the Monday shows that come out on Cruncyroll and will re-watch episodes most weeks. The combination of broad comedy, fun action sequences, macabre zombie mayhem, and strong plotting with a touch of sentimentality that sparkles with joy when it bubbles up to the surface make it a fun, fast paced, and thoroughly enjoyable ride! Oh, and Yuu is muy, muy dandere moe!!! But that isn't really why I like it. Honest...",

            "content": "I've always suspected that sometimes people request anime reviews from me because they want to see how I'll react to a particular really bad anime. That suspicion has been confirmed. Today's review was requested specifically because \"Ive seen Ktulu review some real crappy stuff (I think I saw Baka to Test somewhere), so I thought this would be 'right up his alley' reviewing-wise.\" Yes, that is an actual quote. Is it really that bad? Let's take a look and find out. \r\nKore wa zombie desu ka follows a magical girl zombie who lives with the necromancer who brought him back to life, a magical girland a vampire ninja. It's every bit as stupid as it sounds. There is an over-arching story but it's really basic. An enemy shows up, the group has to fight him. You might think that, as stupid as the premise is, it has to get some good humour out of it. Nope. The humour is as weak and imbecilic as the story. Most of it is simply the same joke repeated. Ayumu is a zombie, watch as he gets abused. The series tries to mix comedy and seriousness but it fails at both and the mixing of the two just makes it more pronounced. The last episode is a pointless fan-service episode and the relationship developments are just grody. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same one-dimensional cliches that pop up in every poorly written harem anime. The clingy jealous girl, the quiet but kind girl, the tsundere girl, and the girl who gets pulled into the situation through an absurd plot contrivance that makes her feel like she has no choice but to pursue the main character and, of course, the completely unremarkable and utterly boring protagonist who can't make up his bloody mind. It doesn't help that all of the characters are idiots. We're told that Haruna is a genius, but she acts like a complete and utter twit so it's as much of an informed characteristic as the marksmanship skills of Imperial Stormtroopers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre. It could be better if not for the strange art decisions at some points and the over-reliance on fan-service. Yeah, there's a massive amount of fan-service. Since it's a harem anime, this should come as no surprise. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty dull. The only actor who seems to be putting in any effort is Nomizu Iori, the rest of the main cast sound like they're bored most of the time. And she exaggerates to an absurd degree. If I wasn't familiar with the cast from other series I might suspect that they just made bad casting calls, but I've heard all of the main cast and most of the secondary cast in roles where they gave much better performances These aren't incompetent actors, this is incompetent directing. The music is the best part of the series. It's actually pretty good. It's got a lot of energy and the performances are well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. Seraphim and Haruna have some moments, and there's one moment with Haruna and Eu. But they never go anywhere and the series is quick to dismiss them. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Kore wa zombie desu ka is a 1.5/10. It's not one of the absolute worst anime I've seen, but it comes pretty close. The story and humour are rubbish and the characters are completely unsympathetic with no redeeming qualities. The only thing worthwhile is the music and you don't have to watch the mind-numbingly stupid series to hear it.",

            "content": "Is This a Zombie? is an anime I seen pop up on Netflix and I'm glad to say that I gave it a watch! It reminded me of so many different shows such as \"My Bride's A Mermaid\", \"B Gata H Kei\", and \"Heaven's Lost Property\". This is not to say this anime doesn't have a charm of it's own. I went into this show with not knowing what I was getting into really because I had heard nothing about it. Not gonna lie, the 1st episode was a bit over the top for me at first, but you get adjusted to it shortly after.I believe the reason I liked this show so much was because of the expectations I had when I began to watch it. The thing is, I had none! So I was thoroughly surprised when certain scenes occurred. This anime is to never to be taken seriously, if you take it seriously you lose the whole point of the show, which is to entertain you rather than to tell some complex story with plot twists up the ass. Now let's get into the sections of the show and what I liked and disliked. (I haven't watched the OVAs and the 2nd season at the time I'm writing this review)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe show's story is a extremely weird but I LOVED IT. It's all about a boy who's name is Ayumu who was tragically killed by a serial killer and is brought back to \"life\" by a Necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (Eu). Eu is the most powerful magical being in the world, but having all that power comes at a cost. After this encounter with Eu, Ayumu's life will never be the same. He then becomes friends with a Magical Garment Girl and a Vampire Ninja. Story sounds pretty crazy right? It only gets crazier as the story progresses. It was pretty unique and different in my eyes, so I enjoyed a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nI'm not very good when it comes to determining how Art is, compared to other anime and what not. But I enjoyed the art style for what it was. The colors really gave the show a nice feeling to it because they would always match depending on the scenario. Never seen any flaws with it in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I don't remember hearing anything really memorable from the show. Which is a good and a bad thing. Its a good thing because it shows I found nothing wrong with the sound itself, but it didn't stand out much. So it was ok, the only song I remember was that blasted Ending. It was AMAZING, I almost always watched it whenever it came around. I honestly got giddy when it came to the end of episode so I could hear it again. The animation that goes with the ending also added to my enjoyment to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters were both the one of the greatest things about the show and one of the downfalls of it as well. If you're not closely watching the show and just enjoying it for what it is, you'll find the 95% of the the characters are likeable and funny in their own ways. The situations they get themselves in are pretty hilarious as well. But when I took a better look at them, most of them are just one dimensional, there are a few exceptions mind you, but again MOST OF THEM are. Characters won't be much of a problem if you don't this anime seriously though. Most of them are all zany, even if they don't show it at first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is easily one of the funniest anime I've seen in a while. From the parodying of clich\u00e9s, to the overall humor this anime provides, it's just a riot. Some people may find some of the rehashed jokes some characters use to be annoying but, I didn't mind them one bit. Another thing people may have a problem with is when this show is trying to be serious. This anime has the tendency to have a serious moment, have some humor and then a serious moment again. This may cause viewers to have a disconnect with serious moments. BUT, as I said before, this show is just for enjoyment. So if you don't take it seriously, you'll actually find some of the serious moments to be funny in itself. Some moments just didn't make sense even when I replayed over several times, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5-9\\n\r\nThis show was something I didn't imagine I'd like very much, contrary to this, halfway through the 1st episode is where I just fell in love with it. As I've stated several times in this review, if you take this show seriously you're not going to enjoy it much. If you turn your brain off for the 12 episodes this show has, you'll most likely enjoy it very much. Even when you turn your brain off, you may notice some things in the show that don't seem right, but you'll get over it no time.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. In my opinion, I loved when this show showcased the different parodies of popular things that happen in other genres of anime and just of clich\u00e9s in general. I would be bursting out with laughter XD\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE OVAS AND SEASON TWO!",

            "content": "Ok, so call me EL Diablo, amigos, for giving this anime a rating of all 6's, but, HEY! That's how I looked at it, anyway there are a couple of more episode to go before the \"PIECE DE RESISTANCE\" of this anime and move to the new season, so, why all the 6's?\r\nIst, the story:\r\nEven it 's genre are: Action, ecchi and magic, I think that comedy and mystery should be inculded since this anime did played with our minds as to who really killed the muchaho(male lead) and how his realtionship doing with the tres chicas (Yu, Sera and Haruna) if there isa love connection with any of them before ep 7. There is also a lot of laughs involve especially when the muchacho (lead male) is a reluctant cross dressing Mahou shoujo and other funny secnes which the 3 chicas gives the muchacho a lot of cabeza del dolor (headache). I never thought that there is still a main villan involved aside from Kyoko whom we now know is the serial killer, but you know I think it is only FAIR ( number 6) enough that we wait just a few more episode and see how things will turn up. \\n\\n\r\n2nd, the art:\\n\\n\r\nI'd say for a anime with an action genre, I think that the art itself as to how the characters were drawn should have been given a much more symmetric body figure. Then again since there is comedy in it, so a 6 will do.\\n\\n\r\n3rd, the sound:\\n\\n\r\nHere, I'm referring to the soundtrack, particularly the opening theme......What can I say, soy mucho gusto. By the way, I really hate the closing theme. So 6 it is.\\n\\n\r\n4th, characters:\\n\\n\r\nAikawa Ayumu- A loner at frist, until he get's skewed to dead and resurrected, though he's greatful for the unfortunated thing that happen to him - co'z he ain't lonely anymore, he's unable to enjoy summer co'z the intense sun shine willl dried him out. He kinda function as a male bitch for the 3 chicas and it is unclear if any of them has any feelings for him. He always fantasize about Yu talking in a cutsy manner and he also did the same with Sera (only once). Now he's linked to Yuki a vampire ninja from another tribe, question is, does he like her?\\n\\n\r\nEucliwood \"Yu\" Hellscythe - she was found by Aikawa sitting near a conveniences store, as just like that, they started chatting - Yu writing down her words rather that saying it and then the next moment she's reviving Aikawa. At fist I thought that she's the villian (how wrong am I). It is not know wheather she has feeling for Aikawa since she declared him his servant. Among the characters she's probably the most mysterious of all to the viewers, co'z as the episode progresses we see a lot more that what we think she is. Who wouldn't know that she doesn't just revivie dead people, she also has powers for fighting and she did mentioned that her magical powers would still fuction even when she's dead,  does that mean she'll never die?\\n\\n\r\nHaruna 'Masou Shoujo\" - It's very clear as to why she stayed with the muchacho, she want's her powers back from the muchacho and as unlucky as it get's, both of them don't know how to do it, what puzzles me is why would the author of this anime decide to let Haruna maintain some of her powers, while her true form is stuck with the muchacho, also why did she since she already saw her sensie in ep 7, why didn't she took the opportunity to ask for help in getting her true form back from Aikawa? By the way, her near naked scene really adds to the encchiness of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSeraphim 'Sera'- is a vampire ninja sent to request Yu's help to come to their village, though she's the muchacho's servant (in word only) she doesn't seems to be like one co'z as we watch the anime she's always engage Aikawa in petty bikering and cusses the poor muchacho everytime, I like her boobs.\\n\\n\r\nYoshida Yuki - she only came around in ep 7 and her weapons are pretty wierd, her tribe is probably the only ones who uses Tonkastu soup as a weapon of choice - or maybe they used something else. She's cute, but I prefer either Haruna or Sera to be the muchacho's love interest. Like, that will happen.\\n\\n\r\nAriel - who we now know is haruna's Dai Sensie, I wonder if she's the main villian?\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not lease, Kyoko \"The serial killer\"- I guess she's the \"Piece de resistance.\" Or is she?\\n\\n\r\nI do have some questions about the character, but, who am I talking to anyway? Well a number 6 rating will do for this part. \\n\\n\\n\r\n5th and 6th, Enjoyment and Overall: \\n\\n\r\nI guess this anime if fair enough to be enjoyed by early teens as young as 13 -15, since the ecchiness is rather quite mild and the blood scene were artistically done, Strongly it is not for children as young as 10 and below. So I give both a fair 6  co'z the anime itself is not that bad but not too good either.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I have not read the manga, so pls bear with me, amigos.",

            "content": "Out of all the anime I watched this season I would probably say Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? is one of the stronger series.  The reason I decided to give the series a try is because the picture caught my attention when I was selecting anime to watch.  However I'm glad that I decided to watch this series\r\nThe first half of the series doesn't really follow much of a story, instead we are given some gut busting comedy to pass the time.  The comedy did actually get me to laugh a lot and I would've had no problem if the series keptgoing like this, but in the second half of the series a plot started to unfold. After the plot was revealed, the amount of jokes in each episode dropped to advance the more serious plot.  There was still some comedy during the second half of the series and the jokes were still funny when they came around though.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself wasn't actually bad. Sometimes the plot did feel rushed because they tried to fit it in the end, and there were some plot holes.  I think it would've been  better if they either made the plot a bit longer to let it develop more or just taken it out entirely.  It's not the best plot out there but it is interesting nonetheless and it is certainly better than some of the other plots in series that aired this season. Also putting together a good plot with gut busting comedy isn't exactly the easiest thing to do, so I think the series did a respectable job with the plot\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually very good, I like the character designs and the backgrounds were okay too.  The animation during the opening was awesome and you could really tell the mood by the art. I have no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was alright, I enjoyed listening to the opening and ending and the voice actors did a solid job with their character. However nothing really attached to me here.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw the opening and saw the different characters that were going to be in this series I thought to myself, this seems to be a strange combination of characters. However the characters were done really well.  Our main protagonist, Ayumu is a zombie is probably one of the better protagonists I've seen mainly because he's not weak like a lot of normal Harem leads. That already is a plus and he also seems know how to act in tight situations.  We also have a very adorable female lead, Eucliwood (Eu for short) who undergoes the most development and also doesn't talk, instead she writes on a notepad. She doesn't show her emotions much but as the series goes on she begins to open up to the main protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also very likable. They don't seem to undergo much development but that's just really asking for too much from a series like this.  We have a tsundere Mahou Shoujo and 2 other Vampire Ninjas.  They do have traits of harem stereotypes but they also have qualities that makes each one of them unique.\\n\\n\r\nKore wa Zombie Desu ka? is really an enjoyable series, I couldn't count the amount of times that I laughed.  Add in very lovable characters and we have ourselves a very entertaining series. If you want a good laugh I would recommend watching this\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was one of the better series of the season and although the quality of it did dip slightly toward the end I still found the series to be very good. I give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Nothing in this anime is serious and should not be taken serious. It makes fun of all aspects anime out there, and does a good job at it. It builds up great characters that are lovable and does a decent job at putting in background story considering the anime is more ofa feel good funny show. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I think if you want a good laugh this is the anime for you",

            "content": "Ayumu Aikawa is a zombie resurrected by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe after being killed by a serial killer. As he tries to make the best of his un-dead life, he encounters a mashou shoujo named Haruna and accidentally takes her magic powers, being forced to become a mashou shoujo in the process. With Eucliwood, Haruna, and a vampire ninja named Seraphim living with him, Ayumu helps battle demons known as Megalos while trying to figure out the mystery behind his own death.\r\nStory & Characters (5/10)\r\nAfter watching enough gut-busting man-eating zombie movies you start thinking that you've seen everything that is until you saw Korewa Zombie Desu ka? (aka KoreZom). This hybrid show takes those horror stuffs into a new leap with its flashiness like a magical girl chainsawing monsters or some guy trapped in your every harem jest.\\n\\n\r\nPlain-looking high school student Aikawa Ayumu is a normal teenager living a boring, laid-back life with no excitement except one thing: as he's ready to tell you, he's a zombie. But how come a zombie doesn't feed on human fleshes and goes to school? That's not a long story. His life dramatically changed after being butchered by a serial killer. Luckily, a silver-haired lady necromancer by the name of Eucliwood \"Eu\" Hellscythe brought him back to life and Ayumu has entered the world of the occult since. Meanwhile, super-powered beasts wearing traditional seifuku called Megalo appeared wrecking havoc in town. Armed with a high magical (pink) chainsaw and a Cardcaptor outfit, Ayumu battles these monsters while trying to get to the bottom of things.\\n\\n\r\nNo mistake about it, KoreZom is utterly insane and comical. We've all seen the scene where a character selflessly jumps in front of a vehicle to save an animal or person countless times in anime, but in this case the potential hero, right before being struck, turns his head towards the screen and says: \"Oh, yeah, I'm a zombie.\" Wow, that's one heck of a start and it sets a variety you couldn't expect in a show with the title \"zombie.\" Wait, maybe you could.\\n\\n\r\nFor most part, KoreZom is purely for fun. Breath-taking humor being thrown rubbed away the disturbing gore and intense psychopath. There's chaos with zombies, vampires and the undead but the show always seems on the verge of blowing apart under the pressure of its own insanity. Characters are introduced when convenient or seemingly for the hell of it, to be killed or excised on a whim perhaps lighten the series up a little.\\n\\n\r\nBut they don't, being a typical harem trap, the female cast have convenient moe look yet their kinds don't attract much. Eu is an expressionless bishoujo with a hidden past, Seraphim is a busty hot chick with sword and Tomonori (naturally) is the protagonist's wife. For a \"harem leader\" achertype, Ayumu can pretty stand up for himself as he can dismember without hesitant, not exactly the \"loser\" formula. Crazy, but brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nStudio Deen, an animation studio who is famous for those bloody gore such as Higurashi and Umineko, here produces a bright and colorful effort which is hardly a paragon of action animation but loads itself up so effectively on the cute factor. Its designs are uninteresting, mainly focus on the moe standard with is trademark hairstyle, facial expression and eyes (although Eu's Gothic-moe look is a joke unto itself). Ayumu's design is even worse, you can immediately tell that he's yet again another dating heroes. Still, the utterly absurd parody of a magical girl transformation scene, complete with the sexy gasp, involving Ayumu is a hoot and the ensuing panty shots of him show that even the series' fairly frequent fan-service isn't immune to parody, either. Stick with this guy a little, and you'll see tons of crazy stuffs around him including his pervy delusion and \"man-service.\"\\n\\n\r\nAh right, because the title has the word zombie, there are expectations of violence. And speaking of violence, what is better than those moments full of all the decapitation, amputation and disemboweling that even the most juvenile of gore-hounds could desire.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nCasting features some familiar faces, giving KoreZom a bit of familiarity shared by its genre. Majima Junji again voices a colorless nice guy, while others such as Haruna or Seraphim's manage to give the show pushes with their cutie tsundere tones.\\n\\n\r\nThe synthesizer-heavy musical score mixes some cheesy themes in with cutesy themes, an occasional mildly dramatic one, and themes which sound like they were directly borrowed from an ero game for an overall effect that is energetic but unimpressive. The same goes for OP \"Ma?Ka?Se?Te Tonight\" sung by Eu's seiyuu, a somewhat cute and spiritual the show has, and ED which composed with a highly enthusiastic male-female dual with the lead characters performing some new kind of caramelldansen in the background.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nAccept KoreZom for what it is \u2013 a simple cutesy fan-service show \u2013 and it can be quite entertaining. However, those who finished the show would find it quite disappointing. The plot is divided into two parts with little relation to each other: the first part is about the search for the mystery behind the murders while the second revolves Eu's past. But what more of an utter disappointment is how the producers turn the last episode into a mindless silly gag created for fan-service. There's still the OVA (or perhaps a sequel) to talk about, but I highly doubt they will continue the left-opened story. Just wait to see what other tricks they have up their sleeves. You will find lots of laughter here, depth probably not, but really, what can you expect in a series that has a guy wearing women's clothing as demon fighter?\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\n+ An entertaining, breath-taking humor take on demon-fighting cliches.\\n\r\n+ Ayumu is kind of manly for his achertype.\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\n+ Ridiculous villains.\\n\r\n+ Last episode is a cheap trick.",

            "content": "Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m getting old and senile, but it seems that the more anime I watch, the less sense they seem to make. You could imagine my confusion when I started watching Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? \"Why is the zombie weak to sunlight but not the vampire? Why the hell is he in a pink frilly dress? Why is that monster a giant lobster?\" In exasperation, I put these questions to a good friend, and I found that his reply turn out to be a very apt one-sentence summary for my review.\r\nHe said to me: \"I dunno lol, who cares? It's fucking hilarious!\"\r\nEverythingin Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, from story to character to humor, is based on complete outrageousness. I hesitate to call Kore wa Zombie~ an original anime, because it's seems that Kore wa Zombie~'s idea of originality is to take as many ideas as possible, exaggerate them to the absolute maximum limit of the imagination, and then cram them together into a single, epic anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo exactly is it that I mean when I say outrageousness? Let's pretend that there are 2 'idea guys' who started working on the story for this, whom I will dub them Jim and Bob. (Warning, minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\n\"Here's an idea!\" says Jim. \"Let's make the main protagonist a zombie.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Great idea!\" replies Bob. \"We'll have an utterly immortal zombie who constantly gets humorously dismembered, baked like a potato chip when he stands in the sun, and receives magical powers that turns him into a pink cross-dressing/chainsaw wielding mas(h)ou shoujo(nen).\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Awesome,\" nods Jim with approval, \"and since this is a harem, we need at least one tsundere character.\" \\n\\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replies Bob again, \"we'll have a pseudo-sadistic tsun~ ninja girl with a ridiculously named fighting technique that uses cellulose (leaves), cooks up acid pots, and plays the violin in a maid orchestra.\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Let's make her a vampire as well.\" adds Jim.\\n\\n\r\n\"Why the heck not,\" laughs Bob, giving Jim a high-five.\\n\\n\r\n... and you get the idea.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is most surprising about Kore wa Zombie~ despite having so many wild concepts crammed in, it somehow still manages to tie it all into a very neat comical package. Normally you'd expect something so slapstick-heavy to comprise it's plot and characters, but Kore wa Zombie~ manages to seamlessly incorporate all it's content into an (almost) coherent and flowing story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kore wa Zombie~ are all, well, ridiculous. I mean one of them literally has like, 10 different voice actors. And she doesn't talk! (try getting your head around that one). Needless to say, all the characters are very 'interesting' and their backstories relatively well thought out and presented. There is the exception of the protagonist's human friend cuz, he's well... y'know, normal. Kore wa Zombie~ is a harem of course, so there is the usual male lead and his entourage of female companions. What is great though is that unlike many harem (to Love-Ru for instance) that focuses on the protagonist's perverse interactions with the females, Kore wa Zombie~ instead chooses to emphasize building the relationship between the male lead and his companions, which I thought was a nice change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't exactly call Kore wa Zombie's story solid, the plot itself isn't exactly complex; there are various backstories which were left untouched and minor plot hole issues. As far as harem-type story goes however, Kore wa Zombie's plot is definitely up there in with the rest. The interesting aspect of Kore wa Zombie~'s story isn't WHAT is happening, but HOW it's happening, and I found that with Kore wa Zombie~\u2019s almost surrealistic approach, I was caring about the actual plot a lot less that I normally would have, because I was too distracted that ridiculously hilarious thing that just happened.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is the art. While Kore wa Kore~'s animation quality is nothing too spectacular, the action scenes are unique in that they contain a very interesting combination of a dark tone, spectacle, gore, and an excess of pink. Yeah don't think too hard on that one. The OP is also surprisingly well done, and it almost makes me sad that they couldn't maintain the same level of quality throughout the entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe only gripe I have with this anime is due to it's comical nature, there are various moments when supposedly serious scenes are ruined because they took the humor a little bit too far. To give one example (spoiler alert), in the final moments of the main antagonist's death, as he lies dying in the arms of his necromancer, he looks into her eyes in a touching scene, and he says:\\n\\n\r\n\"If I die, make me a penguin.\"\\n\\n\r\nHahaha... No wait. Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nThis really isn't a major issue, but I was disappointed in the show slight deficiency in real consequential, solemn scenes which didn't involve some sort of joke tacked on the end. It made the anime feel a little bit one sided and narrow, and prevented me from giving it a higher score. One thing to mention though. They actually bothered air another episode after the 'big climatic battle'. I literally can't count the number of times I've watched anime that seemed to think that a 3 minute epilogue was sufficient in ending the story after the big boss goes down. Kore wa Zombie~ actually took the effort to give some rarely found closure to the story. Thank god.\\n\\n\r\nKore wa Zombie~ is a rather unique anime, perhaps something you'd expect if you crossed J.C. Staff with SHAFT. It definitely won't win any awards and it's not exactly thought provoking, but it easily makes up for it in sheer ridiculousness and outrage. So why should you watch Kore wa Zombie desu ka? \\n\\n\r\nI dunno lol, who cares? It's fucking hilarious!",

            "content": "Is everything really better with zombies?\r\nGiven the recent surge in stories involving the shambling undead it's pretty obvious that there are people out there who believe that they can improve any form of entertainment, so much so that at times it seems as though the world is already in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Tales of creatures that wander aimlessly, groan a lot, and have the annoying habit of eating people while they're still alive are rife in movies and games (although I tend to class Resident Evil as more of a playable soap opera with added undead), but that's only the tip ofthe iceberg. Zombies are now appearing on prime time TV (The Walking Dead), and even literary works have fallen foul of them (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, anime and manga are no strangers to stories of the undead, and while there are some interesting takes on the theme (and before you ask, no, the adolescent wet dream that is Highschool Of The Dead isn't one of them), the majority of titles on offer follow the George A. Romero method and offer up a healthy dose of body shock. While there are stories like Zombie Loan that try to do things differently, these are often lacklustre affairs that are more drama than actual horror.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there are shows like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka (Is This A Zombie)?\\n\\n\r\nOriginally a popular light novel series by Kimura Shinichi (which has also spawned three different manga that are set in the world of the story), the anime adaptation follows the life of Ayumu Aikawa, a highschool student who was murdered by a serial killer. He was quickly resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, and since that time he has tried to make the best of a bad situation. His life now consists of everyday mundanity (barring an inability to tolerate the sun and avoiding fire hazards), as he lives in relative peace with his silent saviour, but all that changes when he meets the young, chainsaw wielding masou shoujo in training called Haruna (and no, that's not a spelling mistake).\\n\\n\r\nAfter that his life takes a turn for the worse.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, it all sounds pretty intriguing, but that's as far as it goes. The plot features some interesting tokens that work well with one or more of the themes in KoreZom, but the series composition has been poorly executed, so much so that viewers may find themselves wondering if there's any point to the show. The main problem is that there's simply too much going on, and because of this the storyline is so disjointed it can sometimes seem like the narrative is being held together with some glue and a couple of nails, and that's not the worst part.\\n\\n\r\nKoreZom attempts to parody some well known genres, and initially it may manage to raise a few laughs with its approach, but this quickly becomes tiresome as the series attempts to turn them into running gags. In addition to this the idea of putting all of the protagonists under one roof has only been done for those stereotypical comedy moments that are amusing to those with more teeth than braincells, which is a shame as there are a few hints of how funny the show could have been. The storyline appears to be desperately trying to reach for ... something, but what it is and how it could be achieved are things that only the producers may know.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the shoddy workmanship continues into the visuals where generic design seems to be the order of the day. Aside from the outfits, KoreZom features some truly unremarkable looking characters, all of whom look like they were copied directly from other harem based shows. That said, Studio DEEN are only partly to blame for this as the main inspiration came from the light novel's illustrations by Kobuichi and Muririn, which is a tad unfortunate as if the rest of the artwork is anything to go by, the series would have been better served with the producers creating everything from scratch. While the scenery and settings may sometimes be generic, they can also be atmospheric and detailed, and there's a variety to the imagery that highlights the difference in creative mentalities. Granted the character design may have been an attempt to support the parodying of specific genres, but that's no excuse for the obvious lack of originality or innovation.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up the issue of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a show has a transparently weak foundation there are many ways to bolster the viewer's opinion of it, but the one that takes the least effort follows the simple ethos that \"sex sells\". Now somebody on the production team obviously realised very early on that KoreZom was a shaky proposition so not only is the fanservice aggressively blatant, it often feels more like a slap in the face.\\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously, is there any need for all those close ups during the fights? This is supposed to be a comedy, not Ikkitousen or Queen's Blade.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the background imagery, the only other good point about the visuals is the animation, most of which is of a decent standard. There are a few blips here and there, some of which are purposeful to highlight certain comedic aspects while  others simply slipped through the net, but these can be forgiven in light of the major problems this series has.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence features a rather dramatic array of imagery depicting the main characters in various \"thoughtful\" poses before adding some action sequences to highlight their combat skills, all set to the song Leave-It-To-Me-Tonight by Nomizu Iori. Unlike the OP, the ending sequence is more true to the predominantly humourous tone of the series, and features the track Realize, Mr. Zombie, I Am Your Classmate by Rie Yamaguchi and Manzo. As for the background music, KoreZom has a nice variety of well choreographed accompaniments, but the truth is that a few of them are unnecessary as they don't really add much to the scene and seem like nothing more than another support for a weak storyline.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, especially given all of the production issues, the acting is actually pretty decent. The script is fairly mediocre as it follows an age old comedy format (so repetitive phrases abound), which isn't really the best thing for the serious moments in the show as it can be difficult to make the mental switch between humour and action - and this shows in several places. Thankfully the seiyuu are on hand to save the day, so what could have been very flat comedy routines gain some life and the more emotive scenes are provided with much needed personality. Unfortunately the actors are only human, so even though they do their best with the script, there's simply not enough viable content to support or develop their roles.\\n\\n\r\nNow given that KoreZom is supposed to be a parody of sorts it should be the case that characterisation is all that's needed to make the series work, so it's a little disappointing that the characters are nothing more than shallow copies based upon one or more archetypes that are generally found in harem romantic comedies. Aikawa is the typical clueless lead male with few future prospects who is suddenly surrounded by females who apparently like necrophilia (he's a zombie, remember?), and after his introduction viewers can engage in a spot of ornithology (bird watching).\\n\\n\r\nOh look! There's the Greater Spotted Tsundere Loli, and over there is the Large Breasted Warrior trying not to look embarrassed, and in front of the TV you can see the Silver Haired Silent Warbler waiting to be entertained.\\n\\n\r\nYes, KoreZom has a wealth of common character types that will keep any harem junkie entertained for five minutes, and the best thing about all of them is that viewers will never once believe that they could ever be real, so feeble is their characterisation and development.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there actually anything good about this series?\\n\\n\r\nWell ... actually there are a few bits worthy of praise, and if one discounts the generally banal and inane humour then KoreZom has a few morsels to offer. There are some genuinely funny moments that are both surprising and well executed, and the while the initial parody of the mahou shouko genre is pretty bog standard, the second one actually refutes the idea that Puella Magi Madoka\u2605Magica was in any way genre breaking.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the comedy can only carry the show so far, and the simple fact is that KoreZom simply doesn't know what it's supposed to be, so it winds up being nothing in particular. It's a shame really as the seeds are there for this to have been either an interesting supernatural tale, or a very good parody (if one removes the unnecessary fanservice), and it's nice to see a different take on zombies once again.\\n\\n\r\nThe sad fact is that the traditional zombie is now almost extinct in entertainment media, and those that remain are treated as rare relics of the original belief that a person could be magically raised from the dead in order to complete tasks like carrying the shopping, painting the house, etc, etc. These old style zombies from West Africa and Haiti are usually a far cry from the modern take, often being better groomed, able to speak, and capable of following simple orders.\\n\\n\r\nActually, they sound a lot like husbands.",

No! Not a harem! Im talking about his gift of being the walking undead! (And for added fun, the ability to crossplay!)\r\nThe anime started out pretty normal but just less then a minute everything turns haywire as his identity ofhis zombiefication (Is that even a word?) is exposed in a brutal but comedic manner.\\n\\n\r\nArt looks pretty well done and detailed (especially the gore part.. Wouldnt want that to be censored now would we?) \\n\r\nSound is pretty above average. Nothing to add here.\\n\\n\r\nIntroducing the only male harem lead who is a Zombie...\\n\r\nAikawa Ayumu.. Hmm.. Other than the fact he possess inhuman powers, he is infact weak towards the sun.. Thats odd? Zombies are weak towards the sun but vampire ninjas are OK? \\n\r\nSo he also possess the power to change into a Masou Shojo which never fails to make me barf each time. Seriously, no kidding, I skip the entire transformation sequence, and you would too if you're a TRUE man.\\n\r\nSure he is a T.K wannabe in break dancing and he has a fetish for little sister and he has a perverted best friend and he doesn't live with his parents etc etc, the fact he has his own harem means deep down he is a good guy and every good guy deserves a harem. Just wondering why I haven't gotten mine yet...\\n\\n\r\nSo lets review the girls shall we? My favorite part of all harem anime\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #1\\n\r\nA necromancer? Silver haired, endowed with super imbalanced powers, and yet a fragile existence you feel like you just wanna protect. Best part is? She won't say a word which means less arguments and more *ehmm* time if ya know what I mean? ;) What you dont know what I mean? Sheesh, what are they teaching you kids in class nowadays.\\n\r\nHarem Girl score: 9.0\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #2\\n\r\nA masou shojo with a chainsaw who lets everyone change into a magical girl except herself. Typical tsundere with flat chest, but claims to have the highest IQ of them all. Sassy and courageous, she's the first of the magical that actually has an attitude. However, he inability to cook anything but eggs doesn't look in her favour for guys who's a glutton. Who cares anyways? Ayumu is a zombie and all he eats is brains.. (No seriously, zombies should eat brains)\\n\r\nHarem Girl Score: 8.8\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #3\\n\r\nA Ninja Vampire?? Who writes this stuff anyways?? Approximately D-E cup, this natural beauty is equipped with not only a sharp tongue, but with a superiority complex. Master of the leaf blade but only able to use a single technique, terrible chef and not much of a genius, some guys still like her due to her busty looks and long black hair. Probably slim chances of being in Ayumu's harem but she's living under the same roof with him so she's practically in it without even knowing it herself. Good luck to Ayumu trying to get this one.\\n\r\nHarem Girl score: 9.0\\n\\n\r\nCandidate number #4\\n\r\nAnother Ninja Vampire?? Oh c'mon now.. Anyways, my personal favourite, tom boyish, a bit of an air head but still charming in her own way. Probably the only character up to date that actually have feelings for zombie boy over here due to some unforseen circumstances (If you're a cult member of the harem revolution, then you probably have a slight gist of how this happened)\\n\r\nHarem Girl score: 9.2 \\n\r\nEXTRA POINTS FOR BEING ABLE TO COOK!\\n\\n\r\nI rate the comedy of this anime to be a fusion of MM! + Dokuro-chan\\n\r\ndue to it's extreme slapstick jokes and the never ending pain the male lead has to suffer. But look at the bright side.. He can never be put out of his misery... Wouldn't you want an immortal body when you have a harem all to yourself?\\n\\n\r\nOverall Gore+Comedy+Supernatural+Chainsaw wielding Magical Girl+Crossplaying = Kore wa Zombie Desu, which can also be equals to animegasm. (Im just randomly adding words here) And some fan-service to boot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER!\\n\r\nEveryone's favourite GIGA PUDDI made an appearance in episode 3 :)",

            "content": "So what is 'Is This A Zombie?' aka 'Koreha Zombie Desu ka?'\r\nZombie Desu ka (as I'll refer to it from now on) is an anime that abuses genre cliches, it's horrendously inconsistent, shockingly violent and has some of the most uncomfortable shots of a guy's ass on several occasions...and it's easily one of the funniest animes I've ever seen.\r\nYES. Zombie Desuka is the BUSINESS. I honestly couldn't contain my laughter ever since the dynamic and hysterical first episode. What makes this anime so special is, as I've mentioned, how it abuses genre cliches such as harem, shonen, fantasy, fanservice and even a bit of heavilyimplied yaoi. There's an ample amount of fanservice in this anime, ranging from your typical 'pantsu' shots to bouncing cleavage, but there's also a surprising amount of fujoshi bait (and by that I mean moments that would make girl fans cream themselves) which is a nice balance. So while it was uncomfortable to see the main character's ass every so often, I can take it as fair since modern animes try more to appeal to both perverse fanbases.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the main character, Ayumu is your typical, lazy-eyed, dangling spiky hair protagonist. You can draw comparisons between him and Tomoya from Clannad and Ichika from infinite Stratos, but I believe that he is a lot like Sato from the anime Ben-To. They're both energetic guys who don't go out of their way to be perverted but are definitely guys who wouldn't pass a chance to take a look, nor do they act all bashful when they're caught. In fact, there's a lot of similarities between Ben-To and Zombie Desu ka, from the absurd plot devices, the pacing and tone as well as the random comedy. And like Ben-To, I found myself surprised by wacky elements popping up every so often and it was great how it managed to blend with the semi-serious story. I've grown fond of animes like this; the whole 'comedy action fanservice' genre, cause it manages to not take itself too seriously but delivers a hilarious plot with some great action and fanservice shots. It's a delicate balance that few animes manage to achieve properly, but these few are pretty amazing. Animes such as Heaven's Lost Property and Highschool DxD have much 'darker' stories and heavy ecchi/ fanservice, whereas animes like Ben-To and Zombie Desuka are lite on the fanservice but emphasize the wacky side more often.\\n\\n\r\nSo as the title implies, the anime revolves around Ayumu being a zombie, resurrected by a quiet, moe necromancer named 'Eu' who treats him as a servant and friend. He uses his newfound life, and surprisingly superhuman powers, to find his killer. If this all sounds awfully serious and deep, trust me the first episode derails that by the end. The dramatic air that the first few minutes of the first episode give off is immediately dispelled by a hilarious moment when Ayumu gets hit by a car in a wacky fashion. By the end of the episode, I shit you not, he becomes a magical garment girl on top of being a zombie, doing a whole long-ass magical girl transformation and everything, with PANTY SHOTS AND EVERYTHING *shudders*. The weird train doesn't end there, as he ends up having a 'masou-shoujo' in this house, then later a vampire ninja girl (with big boobs, cause why not) and eventually has another vampire ninja girl (also well endowed) end up falling in love with him, under ridiculous, parody-cliche circumstances. While this all sounds like a cluster of absurd plot devices, it's exactly what makes this anime so hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the defining features of Zombie Desu ka is the aforementioned moe necromancer, Eu. Her full name is 'Eucliwood Hellscythe' and she takes the quiet moe girl cliche to a whole new level. What I found very creative is how, while she doesn't speak at all and prefers to write down what she wants to say, the main character imagines her voice in his head, saying perverted things in place of the normal request she asked. This is done each episode by a different voice actress (both in the sub and dub) so you're never sure which voice is her real one, and it's probably one of the most creative things about her character. While there's a lot of cliches in her design, her reason for not speaking are actually quite dramatic. The explanation comes off as a load of over-complicated fantasy mumbo-jumbo, but it fits in with the semi-serious tone of the show and it's a major plot device. I won't ruin too much but there's a lot of surprises in store regarding her reasons for not speaking, and trust me you'll wanna see what those reasons are.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists in this anime are unexpected but manage to be entertaining in their own ways, and the overarching main bad guy delivers one of THE funniest lines in the second to last episode. The final episode decides to take all the cliches it hadn't touched upon and abuse them to a comedic end as well, and so does the OVA episode. While this can be considered a harem anime at its base level it surprisingly manages to dodge a ton of genre cliches or use them in moderation; strange for an anime that parodies cliches. It almost never uses the typical 'walk in on girl naked' cliche and 'fall on and grope girl' cliche that animes like To Love Ru are infamous for, and when it does the result is violent retribution (as usual) which is balanced by the fact that Ayumu is a zombie so any physical damage is real but doesn't last. The main character however does go through a ton of physical and verbal abuse from start to finish, being called 'pervert' and 'maggot' for a ton of different reasons, a lot of which is funny. However the vampire ninja girl Sera does weigh on your patience with her persistent insults and she's not even a tsundere or love interest waiting to happen, she's more of the freeloader who has her own motives and shits on the main character all the time. While she is hot and her insults are funny for the most part, it can become annoying after a while. Despite that, every character manages to be goofy and funny in a variety of ways so small things like that don't get in the way.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that Zombie Desu Ka is perfect, far from it. There's a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies and moments that go unanswered. There's characters that get introduced but disappear just as quickly or aren't seen often. There's plot devices that are mentioned or implied, but never expanded upon. And there's a lot of issues regarding the depth of Ayumu's powers and why he's able to steal someone else's powers. However, I don't believe that any of these are an issue since the animes M.O. from the start was to abuse plot devices and cliches, so you tend to go with the flow rather than look for answers in a semi-serious anime. A lot of the occurrences in animes like Excel Saga go unexplained and we accept them purely because it's wacky fun, and whilst a lot of comedy animes have a decent amount of wacky elements I'd say that Zombie Desu Ka is one of the few animes that fully embraces the wacky side. Despite the inconsistencies, there's a lot of subtle things that this anime does well. The animation is solid and the fight scenes are fluid and epic. The music is upbeat and can be mellow when dramatic things occur. The plot device of Ayumu hating the sun since it dries him up (strange plot device for a zombie, I know) is interestingly accentuated by how blinding the light is during the day and each character has one or two defining quirks just like this, including the main bad guy. So while it was the kind of anime you don't have to think too deeply about, it was easy on the eyes too.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, what can I say about Zombie Desu Ka? It's absurd, it's violent, it's random and it's just plain weird sometimes. But it's also hilarious, epic, touching at times and surprising at other times. I don't usually give numbered scores but if I could give this anime a score i'd give it a 9/10. I've only watched the first season so far so I have big hopes for the second. I watched the dub of it, and the cast did a phenomenal job, especially with the many voices that portrayed Eu in Ayumu's thoughts. Both the japanese and english versions manage to be funny for their own reasons in both the delivery of jokes and contexts of funny situations, so each is a unique watch. I look forward to watching the dub of the second season and I really hope it doesn't derail itself like too many second seasons do. However if it's like Heaven's Lost Property or Highschool DxD, it can only get better and funnier. Despite all the physical violence, verbal abuse, weird situations and world ending events that come across Ayumu's way, he can take it. Why? Cause he's a zombie.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen an anime you were convinced was going to be really cool and interesting and only just to have it let you down to no end?  Welcome to my experience with Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka.  After two episodes which presented a genuinely interesting and refreshing take on the harem genre (interesting takes on mythological creatures, nobody particularly interested in each other romantically, basically just putting up with each other simply because they have to), this series succumbs to the harem tropes it actively avoids and just becomes ultimately a very lazy series.\r\nThe initial concept for this show is actuallypretty interesting, with Ayumu who has just recently become a zombie living with the necromancer who resurrected him because, well what else is he going to do realistically.  After his transformation, they meet other mythological creatures and beings such as a magical school girl and a vampire ninja.  They fight creatures called megalos which are evil spirits that actually have some really creative and inspired designs to them.  In one episode, they fight a giant whale in a school uniform that would put Sin from Final Fantasy X to shame.  In another, they fight a giant enemy crab and attack its weak point for massive damage.  One of the big points of humor in these fights is how as a zombie Ayumu basically has no powers, so he has to use magical girl powers a la Sailor Moon, which include gratuitous transformation sequences (it\u2019s actually pretty funny in practice.)  In this regard, the first half of the series is the best because it focuses on the sheer lunacy of the entire situation and the creatures they have to fight.   \\n\\n\r\nBut then something terrible happens, Zombie No Desu Ka starts to take itself seriously.  This show, about a zombie living who uses magical girl powers and lives with a necromancer, another magical girl and a vampire ninja, starts to take itself incredibly seriously for some reason right around episode 4 or 5 and it absolutely kills the momentum.  When the show isn\u2019t having fun with its ridiculous premise, its bogged down by pointless drama about Ayumu\u2019s killer or a story arc later in the series that is so ridiculous that I can\u2019t believe they even animated it.  On top of all this, after episode 6 the show just starts to become a victim of the same tired harem/ecchi anime tropes that we\u2019ve seen a million times before.  The jokes start to get really lazy, the girls start to get interested in Ayumu, a new tsundere vampire ninja is introduced, and the entire show just becomes a drag.  It just drags itself through the motions up until the final episode, which is almost unwatchable.  It\u2019s a pool episode featuring some terrible J-Pop performances from the cast of girls that I\u2019m convinced almost made my ears bleed.  How in the hell did we get to this point?\\n\\n\r\nThis is what happens when you completely forget why your show works and just start pulling stuff out of thin air to kill time.  This show could have been really cool by sticking to having fun with its absurd initial set up and following it through to the end.  I was completely on board to enjoy this show thoroughly.  Please don\u2019t waste your time on this show.  It\u2019s a crime that a show like this ended up getting better ratings across Japan than a masterpiece like Fractale, despite this being a wasted opportunity.  If you want a real comedy series, look elsewhere; this will just leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.\\n",

            "content": "Hello, folks. Today we'll talk about `Koreha Zombie Desuka?', whose original name is \u300c\u3053\u308c\u306f\u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u300d, henceforth called `KoreZom'. First, allow me to tell you that I've never read the original Light Novel, as well as never read any of the adaptation manga. So, every opinion bases itself on the anime, and no comparisons between adaptations are made.\r\nWell then, let us begin.\r\n~!~\r\nStory: 9 out of 10.\r\nKoreZom has lots of comedy, but even though it manage to unfold an very interesting plot. Since, once again, it has great focus over the comedy, I really wasn't expecting any story at all. I've seen comedy animes that just had almostno plot; the anime seemed to flow only over its own jokes, but there was no development. Well then, KoreZom is not like that. As a matter of fact, its plot is much more well thought than other animes of this very season.\\n\r\nI was going to give it 8, but it turned out 9 because the jokes are all very well timed and played, so much that they affect positively the story itself.\\n\r\nBy the way, every character seems to have cool backgrounds, but I fear those aren't going to be shown, unless we get a second season.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nIt is beautiful. The characters' designed is cool and well-done, from casual outfits to a necromancer's armored outfit. Emotions are well expressed, too. Also very fitting are the backgrounds, from a high school to a graveyard, they're all very expressing, and cool.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nGreat voice acting, general background effects, as well as a rocking awesome opening! The ending music kind of sucks, although being funny, but since there's no reason to hear it, I didn't count it.\\n\r\nThere's really not much to say, really. It is just great.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nNow that's where that show shines. A cool zombie lead male, an even cooler necromancer girl (well, she's my fav anime girl), a bad-mouthed vampire ninja, an extravagant masou-shoujo (a pun with mahou-shoujo), and that's not even the beginning. Funny as hell friends, psychopath villains, and (yet again) funny enemies called `Megalos'.\\n\r\nDamn, the characters are splendid, each one of them.\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nCool characters, well timed and played jokes, nice artwork, and a interesting story. How could you not enjoy it? You'll laugh out loud, pause at a certain zombie's delusions, re-watch the cool moments, and have chills in the spine with Yuu (also called Eu).\\n\\n\r\n~!~\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 out of 10.\\n\r\nThat's it, folks. There's absolutely no reason to look down or overlook this fantastic anime. Each episode proves better than the previous, and you'll catch yourself counting days until the next episode. The best thing is that there's more to come! And maybe we got even a second season.\\n\r\nNow, I know that there will be folks that won't like it the way I do, for everybody has its own tastes. But well, that's my opinion: this anime is a masterpiece, whose only drawback is the low number of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time!",

            "content": "\"Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\" is, despite what the \"Zombie\" in its title might suggest, the extreme opposite of every zombie show you've ever seen before. Forget about mindless monsters trying to eat you alive. What we have here is a harem mixed with slapstick comedy, magic and lots of gore.\r\nStory: As in most harem animes, the actual story is not the show's main focus. However, at first glance, it seems quite a promising one for its genre, though pretty simple: A high school student is murdered after he is attacked by an unknown person. However, he is revived as a zombie with the helpof a weird necromancer girl. From then on, he serves as her undead servant, while at the same time searching for the one who killed him, as well as continuing his school life. Various other (female) characters are also introduced, including a magic girl and a vampire-ninja, each with their own mini-backstories.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Animation: Like most of the latest anime, the animation is very good. The designs are crisp and well drawn, and I dare say quite pretty. I can't say that I have any particular problem with it whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting does its job well, with the voices being properly funny or serious depending on what is needed. There is nothing really memorable about them, but that's not nececerily a bad thing, as long as the job gets done. What I do have to aplaud  is the OP, which is officially my third favourite OP of all time (behind only the OP of Umineko and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: To the core, the characters in \"Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\" are pretty much the usual Harem stereotypes: A teenage guy surrounded by a bunch of girls (which include the typical tsundere, loli etc). However, the fact that they all belong in the supernatural world slightly changes things. They can all be quite kickass at times (except for the Necromancer girl, who is extremely docile 99% of the time, but bringing people back from the dead is even cooler anyway ;) ). They can all be hilariouly funny at the same time, and they all seem to have some higher goal in life than just sleeping with the other characters - which some of them also have, nontheless. To sum it up, they seem like proper characters, unlike in the majority of harem animes. I mean, what other harem features a zombie and a vampire ninja among the protagonists? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This a harem anime, so fanservice and tyical harem humor is always going to be there. But there is much more to it than that. The element of slapstic comedy is always there. What is unusual is the excecive (for the genre) amount of gore - which can be strangely funny, rather than shocking, at times. Add to that all the supernatural stuff... you 've got yourself a very good combination right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Harem, Comedy, Supernatural, Gore, School Life... there are not many series that combine all these. \"Kore wa Zombie desu ka?\" does so, and it seems to do so well. If you like any of the above genres, you 've got to give this a try. You might love it or you might not... but you'll never know until you try for yourself.",

            "content": "Oh boy... This show. I find myself torn while writing this, on one hand there were some extremely funny and enjoyable moments where I could not stop laughing. But on the other hand there were some downright terrible moments where I was raising my head to the ceiling praying for the scene to end. Is this a Zombie is an anime that makes it's mark by throwing in every genre, every character type, every trope, just everything really. If you can think of it there is a high probability you'll find it in this show. But despite throwing everything under the sun into this anime,I would never dream of calling it cliche, and actually say it is extraordinarily unique. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nGuy meets girl, they kind of like each other, plot ensues, girl now lives with guy, more girls live with guy, etc, etc. While some of the specifics may be new, the overall concept is nothing we have not seen. \\n\r\nThe Zombie and Necromancer (a.k.a servant and master) relationship was well done. Tack onto that the school life setting with a guy just trying to pass through along with his nerdy best friend; it was all well done, though a bit unoriginal. The eccentricities and unique nature of this show come in when we meet a chain-saw wielding Magical Girl (though she uses her magic a whole lot less than Ayumu...) and a busty Vampire Ninja with a leaf sword. Not gonna lie, her concept is fucking amazing. This show throws in every concept you can think of but somehow manages to make it work. \\n\r\nI would be remiss if I did not mention my largest gripe with the show, the fact that Ayumu is more or less our magical girl... Maybe I am alone, but I do not find cross-dressing to be a very funny plot point, I just don't. But even then I can sometimes see how it could work in a story if well done. But sadly, I did not find this to be one of those times. You see, Ayumu doesn't like it, first time, first episode, he dislikes transforming into a magical girl with a pink frilly outfit complete with panties and a bow. Hates it may be a more accurate statement. But every time he is forced to do so, he gets an unbelievable amount of shit from the other characters for doing it. Forced to cross dress in pink to save them all, and they insult him for doing so. Sorry, not a scenario I found even remotely amusing or entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much here, it felt exceedingly average. But since the average these days (for 2011) is still good, it gets a 7. Though I should mention I really liked the character designs. I can't say anything on their artistic value, just a specific aspect I found really nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI found that the OST really just did it's job. Set the scene, nothing more. But what I absolutely loved was the voice acting. I came into this show long after it aired, long enough that there was in fact an English Dub, and that is what I watched. Stone me, go ahead. Spout your insults and hate for the one who neglected to watch it subbed but had the audacity to write a review. Ignoring the hate though, I loved the English Dub. I thought the voices were perfect and added to the hilarity of the scenes, while also capturing some of the more emotional moments fairly well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis was a rather fun cast of characters. They all seemed to fall into archetypes, but were extremely memorable despite that. \\n\\n\r\nAyumu Aikawa- Our zombie protagonist who is a nice enough guy but with that laid back, bored disposition. I rather liked Ayumu, he was fairly similar to other harem leads in that he isn't the most popular, isn't extremely capable physically or intellectually, but still sits in the back right side of the classroom next to a window. He gets a lot of abuse in this show, verbal and physical. Being immortal the characters feel no guilt in stabbing him. Being the nice guy he takes it all with a bit of disbelief but really just goes along with it.\\n\\n\r\nEucliwood Hellscythe- I thought I had seen the quiet character exhibited perfectly in Yuki Nagato. Boy was I wrong. Eucliwood (though everyone calls her Eu) is the character that I consider to be the ultimate moe blob of adorable. She takes the quiet nature to a whole new level by literally not saying a word, but writing everything on little notepads. Though giving off an uncaring persona, she is actually extremely kind hearted. Where I truly applaud the creators is the way Eu had a different voice actress for every episode. Now for a character that doesn't speak it may seem difficult to have a voice actress; luckily our perverted main is here to imagine Eu complimenting him in a suggestive format. It was well done and extremely enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nHaruna- The resident Tsundere Magical Girl who is a self proclaimed genius and makes great eggs. She really is just a fun character with a ton of energy. She doesn't have the best memory and freeloads at Ayumu's home eating more food than anyone else. \\n\\n\r\nSeraphim- The busty Vampire Ninja, she is extremely cold towards our main character but gets along with others well enough. My issue with Seraphim is that she is accurately summed up by the word bitch. Obviously there is a bit more to her than that attribute alone, but that forms the crux of her character and it left liking her a very arduous task...\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the characters is that they all seem to give Ayumu a bit too much crap. Don't get me wrong, at times it was hilarious to watch them all insult Ayumu. But in my not-so-professional opinion this show needed a character that Ayumu could get along with. In my head this equated to a character that acted in a more playful manner rather than a degrading one. Sexual innuendo or playfully teasing, just someone that alleviated the constant barrage of shit Ayumu received. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment overall is limited to a 7. When this show was good, it was GREAT, but when it wasn't great I honestly considered it be rather bad. My opinion in this facet is probably rather polarized from the majority, but for every scene I loved I found one I disliked as well. My enjoyment did swing in a positive manner on the whole, but nevertheless I had my issues. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis show takes every thought that could pop into a writer's brain and throws it into an oddly coherent plot. Combined with a fun cast and good voice acting, comedy, some action, and even the occasional emotional moment, you get a genuinely good show. This show is definitely good for a laugh. Even if you are like me and dislike main characters who get a ton of shit, I would still recommend this show. If you're on the fence about the show than I would recommend watching the first two episodes as they perfectly exhibit what this show is: A fun 12 episodes that is even complimented by a second season. Is This a Zombie is a good anime that combines every cliche into something unique.",

The was the story works in this anime is really quite odd. Everyone has their own stories and agendas, there really isn't an overarching story until the second season.\r\nThe main gist of the story revolves around the Zombie Ayumu and the Necromancer Eucliwood (Eu) and the shenanigans and such that they get up to. On the surface, this may just look like your average Harem/Ecchi/Action but if you care to look deeper you'll really findsome great character development and romance in the scenes where Ayumu is alone with Eu.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this show was really quite good. It wasn't on an Angel Beats! level or anything like that, but it was still very good. The fight scenes were drawn well and fluidly, and the characters all looked great; especially Eucliwood. The backgrounds were alright enough and the monsters and big center scenes were all drawn really well.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ (8/10)\\n\r\nI found the sound to be surprisingly good for a show like this. The OP and ED were both decidedly average, despite the OP being sung by Nomizu Iori, so I have to say; I was expecting more.\\n\r\nNow onto where the sound really shines; the voice acting. I really loved the voice acting in this show. Eucliwood was just amazing, and I love how they gave her a different Seiyuu for all of Ayumu's fantasies. Haruna was voiced in your typical tsundere fashion, and Seraphim's voice was just amazing; I loved how perfectly cold and sharp it was.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ (9/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in\"Kore wa\" are really quite good and diverse. For this review I'll only be going into the main 'harem' characters. \\n\r\nTo start off with Ayumu is virtually your typical shounen male lead, so there really isn't that much to cover on him, I will instead focus on the others. \\n\\n\r\nEucliwood is really quite a complex character. She really cares about all of her friends, but in turn that winds up hurting them when she decides to just take matters into her own hands without properly talking things through with anyone. I would love to say more, but I feel like too many spoilers would be revealed.\\n\\n\r\nSeraphim is a 100% tsuntsun 0% deredere character. She is mainly a fan service and story progression character, but if you watch the show, you'll see she has quite a deep backstory.\\n\\n\r\nHaruna is one of your more typical tsundere characters; starting off hating Ayumu, but slowly coming to accept him (and more?).\\n\\n\r\nSorry I couldn't really say anything more here, I really didn't want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ (10/10)\\n\r\nAll up I really loved this anime. It has a really great cast of characters, the story is good, and Eucliwood is my personal pick for the best female character ever. Every episode seemed like it was over in a heartbeat, and I was left wanting more after every ED.\\n\\n\r\nThanks a lot for bearing with me through my first review :3 Hopefully they'll be getting better after I've written a few, but hey. Everyone has to start somewhere.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to discuss anything, drop a comment on my profile! Usually I reply to anything.",

Also random addition, this episode has lots of blood forthose of you who are a little squeamish \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing about the music really stood out to me, except maybe a few moments where I went \"well this is kinda catchy...\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI give characters a 9 not because their especially compelling but most because their entertainment factor was through the roof for me. Just the way the protagonist seems to interact and react with his world, even the way he narrates as a character; I found very appealing. Additionally they did make some room in this episode for some potentially more serious and in depth character development later in the show, not much, but they did leave room.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI've only been watching anime for 6 months, but pilot episode literally made me laugh out loud, which only two other anime have been able to do so far, I spent a lot of the episode thinking about how ridiculous the situations were, but O so very entertaining :P. Just watch out for some unexpected fanservice and a lot of of wtf moments :P\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIf you like ridiculous comedies, magical girls, ecchi....and blood, you'll likely really enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "*This may contain a few spoilers*\r\nAt first I thought Kore wa zombie desu ka? was going to be one of those fantasy-comedy anime without an actual storyline and with lots of boring episodes. Fortunately, it was much better than I thought.\r\nStory: 6\r\nI was very surprised that this had a plot. It really did. The story focuses on a high school boy, Ayumu, who is both a zombie and a Magiclad Girl (Yeah, I know, kinda weird) and his supernatural friends, Eu, Haruna and Sera who fight against all kind of creatures. This might seem a little mediocre and it is because as the show goeson, more and more unearthly phenomena occur and strange characters show up. But, like I said, I am glad that the anime followed a decent plot with some unexpected events and it wasn't just a stupid comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 9\\n\r\nBoth were good. The characters have many details and some distinctive features, the magical creatures are ok and the outdoor scenery is good, so I don't have much to say. My eyes liked what they saw.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nHere, unfortunately, we have some stereotypical characters: Ayumu - the easy-going teenager who cares a lot about his friends and wants to protect them. Eu - the most powerfull character, silent but very smart, full of emotions and very altruistic. Haruna - the funny girl, always smiling who falls in love with Ayumu. Sera - the sensible one, with a strong character who likes being in charge of everything,\\n\r\nThere is truly nothing special about those characters, none of them stands out. On the other hand, I apperciate the huge character development. Ayumu starts to care about Eu when she leaves and realizes she's very important to him. Eu also realizes that she's not a soulless monster and she has friends who would die for her and Sera abandons her mission to kill Eu because she finally understood that friends are the most important thing in the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt wasn't a brilliant anime, even far from a good one, but I somehow enjoyed watching it. It was funny indeed (especially Ayumu's transformation into a Magiclad Girl), it was violent indeed (which I liked the most) and it had some heartbreaking moments which really got to my feels. As I said, there were some boring episodes, unrelated to the actual plot but at least they were funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI rated Kore wa zombie desu ka? 7 because it represented a nice surprise for me. The series exceeded my expectations which is really awesome and if the caracters were a little more original, I would give it an 8.\\n\r\nWhat can I say... If you like fantasy-comedy-harem with some gore and romance anime, you should really watch this. It might be a disappointment for some people but on the contrary, I find this anime better than I thought it would be.",

            "content": "Looking back on this show I question myself how I enjoyed this show. Riddled with fanservice, a harem which means no actual romance, and a cast of invincible characters. Our good male lead Ayumu is a zombie, taking an arm or two is but a flesh wound, and our female lead  has enough magic power that the universe is changed at her emotions and words. The action scenes are enjoyable and occur frequently but nothing extraordinary. They aren't afraid to show a bit of blood though!\r\nNevertheless, there is something about the comedy in this set up that makes every episode worth watching. Of coursebeing undead gives the genre slapstick a new meaning, and by the end of the first episode Ayumu gains the power of Masou Shoujo. Yes that\u2019s right - he is a magical zombie cross dresser wielding a pink chainsaw. If you don't find it funny the first time he transforms well you will definitely get sick of it by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow I did look down on the show earlier for the fanservice. However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the female cast. Eu is our mute armored necromancer who doesn't get much of an appearance in the show till later because, well, she is mute. I liked her appearances but story wise she made a lot of decisions that didn't make sense. \\n\\n\r\nHaruna is the masou shoujo who has lost her powers and is the pain in the ass tsundere that lives in Ayumu's house. The fanservice target, she is the most prominent female character. Another person who can be a break or make on your takeaway from the show. \\n\\n\r\nSera is a vampire, whose story of origin was horrible. Yet, voiced by Youko Hisaka, one of the more fun characters. She has a running gag of how horribly she can verbally abuse the main character, but is also a ninja at the same time. She is never prominent in the story, but makes steady appearances throughout.\\n\\n\r\nYuki, another vampire, acts as the wife or Ayumu, reasons to be left to your imagination, and is the only character that's dere was actually enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a strong comedy, it attempts to have a serious plot at times. At these times it fails to be serious, and you are left wondering if they intended to make the plot a joke (in more ways than one). It starts out with how Ayumu wants to get revenge on his murderer, but despite how mysterious it seems like it will be at the start the intensity vanishes until he easily finds them a few episodes in. From there the plot switches to Eu's past mistake and the whole situation is rather ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a mix of peculiar comedy and have a tolerance for harem settings this could be the show for you. The atmosphere is typically bright except for those random serious moments they throw at the viewer. \\n",

            "content": "Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was certainly an interesting show.  What initially attracted me to the show was that the main character was in fact a zombie and after seeing that it was labeled as a harem story I was interested to see where it would go.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nOk, personally I really enjoyed this show.  However I would say that the story was the show's major weak point.  The initial premise of the story is extremely unique and interesting.  Main character and normal high schooler Ayumu Aikawa is murdered by a serial killer, is then brought back to life as a zombieby a necromancer and now is trying to discover who killed him and why, certainly a somewhat dark and unique idea.  However with the introduction of Masou-Shoujo Haruna, the story takes a turn for the weird and comedic.  After being cut in half by Haruna's chainsaw during a battle, Ayumu accidentally absorbs her magic and must now take over her role of fighting demons as a Mahou-Shoujo, complete with transformation sequence and frilly pink dress.  And that basically is how the rest of the show proceeds.  It constantly walks the line between \"wow this is a dark bloody action anime\" and \"boy in a pink dress encounters harem hijinks.\"  This results in the pacing of the show being somewhat off and at times I felt as if I was watching two completely different shows.  Most of the time there was no particular reason for why the story progressed the way it did, things would just kind of happen and then the characters would respond.  \\n\\n\r\nThis having all been said though, the comedic aspect of the show was great and almost every episode something would be said or happen that would provoke a laugh out of me and the show does tell a compelling and unique story when it decides to get serious.  Despite also being labeled a harem genre, this is only a minor detail in the events of the main story and the overall feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe animation in the show was very good I felt.  The scenery was good, the landscapes realistic, and the character designs were very unique and fresh.  The fight sequences and gore were extremely well done yet equal attention was given when dealing with the more comedic and ridiculous aspects of the show (flying whale monsters for example).  The sound was also excellent, the opening got you hooked and the ending theme was just plain fun and both were very original.  The voice acting was good as well, everyone delivered a great performance and fit their roles to a tee.  Plus Yuu's plethora of different voice actresses contributed to a great part of the series' humor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were definitely (in my opinion) the best part of the show.  They were modeled off past traditional character types but they were very fleshed out and there was a good amount of character development in the show across the boards.  Ayumu is not your typical average harem lead ( for one he's a zombie).  He's not overly perverted or boring in any way, he's just an average guy forced to deal with ridiculous situations and handles them accordingly, and unlike a normal harem lead he's got some redeeming qualities and is more than capable of being a badass when its crunch time.  I thought that all of the characters were hilarious in their own way though.  All of the rest of the characters in the show were mostly there for comic relief and fulfilled their roles excellently.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDespite its faults, I really liked Kore wa? The whole time I was watching it I was just thinking to myself \"wow I love this show\", even when I noticed plot inconsistencies or when I felt they went over the top with something.  It was hilarious, the characters were crazy, the story was original, and while the romantic and the serious aspects of the show often clashed, I felt both worked in their own right and made the show amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: If you are looking for a show with great comedic value, unique characters, or just a different or ridiculous story, then I would highly recommend watching Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.  It was always fun, with its fair share of serious moments and interesting characters.  I highly recommend for fans of harems or offbeat comedies.",

            "content": "Story/Characters: 10/10 of 10\r\nAt the half-way point, this is a well wrought tale, with significant twists along the way. There is a certain amount of \"cliche elements\" in the telling, but what sets Kore wa Zombie desu ka? apart from the crowd and saves it from being a cliche ridden also ran is the way it turns each and every one of those cliches on its ear, pokes a wet willy in it, strips it of its dignity, and then tells it \"It is OK! People still love you even with all your warts!\" In other words, the show has an overriding irreverent tone anda mocking sense of humor about itself and the various genres from which it harvests its plot fodder. The show is extremely well written and funny, eliciting several \"laugh out loud\" moments per episode on average, but at the same time, it actually approaches tear inducing tenderness when it takes the time to focus on the protagonist and his savior/master/goddess of all that is dandere, Yuu. (I said almost... I don't think I have cried yet, though I am a notorious softy... just ask my kids.)\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Yuu is a thing to behold. Moe in the extreme, she takes dandere to a new height, as she isn't just quiet, she doesn't talk, with the exception of dream sequences, labeled \"This is fantasy of our weak-hearted protagonist Aikawa Ayumu\", in which she speaks with a high, pleading voice and calls him Onii-chan, complete with mooney eyes, and frequently scantily clad. She communicates by writing notes on a pad, frequently with a tsun edge in the writing, making her, I guess, a tsun-dan-dere character.  The other characters are good as well. The heavily tsundere Haruna, who is living with them until she recovers her Masou Shojo powers from Ayumu, is a bundle of contradictions, as a genius magical girl that can't seem to be bothered to remember mundane things like names or where she was supposed to be buying tofu for her magical girl teacher. The third member of the harem is Sera, the Vampire-Ninja who seeks Yuu's aid and stays with them when she is refused, hoping to earn Yuu's help, all the while referring to Ayumu as various names similar to \"worthless pile of $%!#\". There are also Ayumu's friends at school, who he doesn't want to discover the truth about his living/unliving situation, as being the male living with a harem of magical/dangerous women is not something he thinks his high school buddies can handle.\\n\\n\r\nAll this would rate a high, but not stellar score if it weren't for one thing that the show does: surprise! Just when I think that I have a handle on the show, it throws a curve. Just when I think I know where the story is headed, it changes course. And just when I think I have things figured out, it turns another corner and reveals that most of what you have seen is not really the way things are. When that is combined with the consistently funny dialog and over the top humor, it makes for an enjoyable ride!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe main failing in Kore wa Zombie desu ka? is the art, at least in my opinion. There are frequently times when it seems the backgrounds are neglected, and the character renditions sometimes have shortcuts. Much of the combat animation is choppy and awkward looking, though I will grant that some of this is intentional due to the nature of the zombie protagonist. His body moves in awkward ways at times. The character designs, with the exception of  Yuu, are also a bit generic, with Sera being the only human character that I have not mistaken for someone else at least briefly at some point in the show. The men are particularly generic, with the glasses of the 'best friend' character distinguishing him from the protagonist. Luckily there are not many shots of men other than Ayumu. It is possible that this is mostly a personal problem and others see more distinction between the designs, but I particularly find it hard to distinguish Haruna from some of the other girls, either at his school or the \"friend\" in the hospital that shows up in the third episode. There are some parts that are beautifully done, but others that fall short. The magical transformation sequences are quite striking, in their visual effect and the humor value as well! Another aspect that bothers some, but not me, is the level of fan service and gore. I consider most of the fan service to be parody, and it never becomes prurient or of an overtly sexual nature. The gore is also frequently used for comic effect, and the show is, after all, about a zombie! One must anticipate a certain amount of blood and gore!\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that there aren't some bits of excellence. Where the animators take the time to make the art shine, it is great. I just feel there are too many points at which they let it slide along at average.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound Effects: 8 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening music is very good and the incidental music is frequently spot on. The end music is a catchy little tune, but also a bit annoying, as is the super deformed animation used during it.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8 of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe main voice actors are well done, with Haruna and Sera having a nice blend of acerbic tone with the occasional softer side. The male lead is well done but nothing really that special either. The best friend character's voice I find annoying, but I think you are supposed to. The Megalo tend to all sound alike to me. The \"friend in the hospital\" is one of the strongest vocal performances, as that character goes through some pretty impressive changes and variations across the episodes the is featured in. The absolute winner in terms of voice acting is the sickly sweet voice of Yuu in Ayumu's weak-hearted fantasy life! She sounds absolutely endearing and devoted, as is appropriate for a fantasy of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10 of 10\\n\\n\r\nI am loving this show! I watch it first of the Monday shows that come out on Cruncyroll and will re-watch episodes most weeks. The combination of broad comedy, fun action sequences, macabre zombie mayhem, and strong plotting with a touch of sentimentality that sparkles with joy when it bubbles up to the surface make it a fun, fast paced, and thoroughly enjoyable ride! Oh, and Yuu is muy, muy dandere moe!!! But that isn't really why I like it. Honest...",

            "content": "I've always suspected that sometimes people request anime reviews from me because they want to see how I'll react to a particular really bad anime. That suspicion has been confirmed. Today's review was requested specifically because \"Ive seen Ktulu review some real crappy stuff (I think I saw Baka to Test somewhere), so I thought this would be 'right up his alley' reviewing-wise.\" Yes, that is an actual quote. Is it really that bad? Let's take a look and find out. \r\nKore wa zombie desu ka follows a magical girl zombie who lives with the necromancer who brought him back to life, a magical girland a vampire ninja. It's every bit as stupid as it sounds. There is an over-arching story but it's really basic. An enemy shows up, the group has to fight him. You might think that, as stupid as the premise is, it has to get some good humour out of it. Nope. The humour is as weak and imbecilic as the story. Most of it is simply the same joke repeated. Ayumu is a zombie, watch as he gets abused. The series tries to mix comedy and seriousness but it fails at both and the mixing of the two just makes it more pronounced. The last episode is a pointless fan-service episode and the relationship developments are just grody. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same one-dimensional cliches that pop up in every poorly written harem anime. The clingy jealous girl, the quiet but kind girl, the tsundere girl, and the girl who gets pulled into the situation through an absurd plot contrivance that makes her feel like she has no choice but to pursue the main character and, of course, the completely unremarkable and utterly boring protagonist who can't make up his bloody mind. It doesn't help that all of the characters are idiots. We're told that Haruna is a genius, but she acts like a complete and utter twit so it's as much of an informed characteristic as the marksmanship skills of Imperial Stormtroopers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre. It could be better if not for the strange art decisions at some points and the over-reliance on fan-service. Yeah, there's a massive amount of fan-service. Since it's a harem anime, this should come as no surprise. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty dull. The only actor who seems to be putting in any effort is Nomizu Iori, the rest of the main cast sound like they're bored most of the time. And she exaggerates to an absurd degree. If I wasn't familiar with the cast from other series I might suspect that they just made bad casting calls, but I've heard all of the main cast and most of the secondary cast in roles where they gave much better performances These aren't incompetent actors, this is incompetent directing. The music is the best part of the series. It's actually pretty good. It's got a lot of energy and the performances are well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. Seraphim and Haruna have some moments, and there's one moment with Haruna and Eu. But they never go anywhere and the series is quick to dismiss them. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Kore wa zombie desu ka is a 1.5/10. It's not one of the absolute worst anime I've seen, but it comes pretty close. The story and humour are rubbish and the characters are completely unsympathetic with no redeeming qualities. The only thing worthwhile is the music and you don't have to watch the mind-numbingly stupid series to hear it.",

            "content": "Is This a Zombie? is an anime I seen pop up on Netflix and I'm glad to say that I gave it a watch! It reminded me of so many different shows such as \"My Bride's A Mermaid\", \"B Gata H Kei\", and \"Heaven's Lost Property\". This is not to say this anime doesn't have a charm of it's own. I went into this show with not knowing what I was getting into really because I had heard nothing about it. Not gonna lie, the 1st episode was a bit over the top for me at first, but you get adjusted to it shortly after.I believe the reason I liked this show so much was because of the expectations I had when I began to watch it. The thing is, I had none! So I was thoroughly surprised when certain scenes occurred. This anime is to never to be taken seriously, if you take it seriously you lose the whole point of the show, which is to entertain you rather than to tell some complex story with plot twists up the ass. Now let's get into the sections of the show and what I liked and disliked. (I haven't watched the OVAs and the 2nd season at the time I'm writing this review)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe show's story is a extremely weird but I LOVED IT. It's all about a boy who's name is Ayumu who was tragically killed by a serial killer and is brought back to \"life\" by a Necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (Eu). Eu is the most powerful magical being in the world, but having all that power comes at a cost. After this encounter with Eu, Ayumu's life will never be the same. He then becomes friends with a Magical Garment Girl and a Vampire Ninja. Story sounds pretty crazy right? It only gets crazier as the story progresses. It was pretty unique and different in my eyes, so I enjoyed a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nI'm not very good when it comes to determining how Art is, compared to other anime and what not. But I enjoyed the art style for what it was. The colors really gave the show a nice feeling to it because they would always match depending on the scenario. Never seen any flaws with it in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nTo be completely honest, I don't remember hearing anything really memorable from the show. Which is a good and a bad thing. Its a good thing because it shows I found nothing wrong with the sound itself, but it didn't stand out much. So it was ok, the only song I remember was that blasted Ending. It was AMAZING, I almost always watched it whenever it came around. I honestly got giddy when it came to the end of episode so I could hear it again. The animation that goes with the ending also added to my enjoyment to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters were both the one of the greatest things about the show and one of the downfalls of it as well. If you're not closely watching the show and just enjoying it for what it is, you'll find the 95% of the the characters are likeable and funny in their own ways. The situations they get themselves in are pretty hilarious as well. But when I took a better look at them, most of them are just one dimensional, there are a few exceptions mind you, but again MOST OF THEM are. Characters won't be much of a problem if you don't this anime seriously though. Most of them are all zany, even if they don't show it at first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is easily one of the funniest anime I've seen in a while. From the parodying of clich\u00e9s, to the overall humor this anime provides, it's just a riot. Some people may find some of the rehashed jokes some characters use to be annoying but, I didn't mind them one bit. Another thing people may have a problem with is when this show is trying to be serious. This anime has the tendency to have a serious moment, have some humor and then a serious moment again. This may cause viewers to have a disconnect with serious moments. BUT, as I said before, this show is just for enjoyment. So if you don't take it seriously, you'll actually find some of the serious moments to be funny in itself. Some moments just didn't make sense even when I replayed over several times, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5-9\\n\r\nThis show was something I didn't imagine I'd like very much, contrary to this, halfway through the 1st episode is where I just fell in love with it. As I've stated several times in this review, if you take this show seriously you're not going to enjoy it much. If you turn your brain off for the 12 episodes this show has, you'll most likely enjoy it very much. Even when you turn your brain off, you may notice some things in the show that don't seem right, but you'll get over it no time.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. In my opinion, I loved when this show showcased the different parodies of popular things that happen in other genres of anime and just of clich\u00e9s in general. I would be bursting out with laughter XD\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE OVAS AND SEASON TWO!",

            "content": "Ok, so call me EL Diablo, amigos, for giving this anime a rating of all 6's, but, HEY! That's how I looked at it, anyway there are a couple of more episode to go before the \"PIECE DE RESISTANCE\" of this anime and move to the new season, so, why all the 6's?\r\nIst, the story:\r\nEven it 's genre are: Action, ecchi and magic, I think that comedy and mystery should be inculded since this anime did played with our minds as to who really killed the muchaho(male lead) and how his realtionship doing with the tres chicas (Yu, Sera and Haruna) if there isa love connection with any of them before ep 7. There is also a lot of laughs involve especially when the muchacho (lead male) is a reluctant cross dressing Mahou shoujo and other funny secnes which the 3 chicas gives the muchacho a lot of cabeza del dolor (headache). I never thought that there is still a main villan involved aside from Kyoko whom we now know is the serial killer, but you know I think it is only FAIR ( number 6) enough that we wait just a few more episode and see how things will turn up. \\n\\n\r\n2nd, the art:\\n\\n\r\nI'd say for a anime with an action genre, I think that the art itself as to how the characters were drawn should have been given a much more symmetric body figure. Then again since there is comedy in it, so a 6 will do.\\n\\n\r\n3rd, the sound:\\n\\n\r\nHere, I'm referring to the soundtrack, particularly the opening theme......What can I say, soy mucho gusto. By the way, I really hate the closing theme. So 6 it is.\\n\\n\r\n4th, characters:\\n\\n\r\nAikawa Ayumu- A loner at frist, until he get's skewed to dead and resurrected, though he's greatful for the unfortunated thing that happen to him - co'z he ain't lonely anymore, he's unable to enjoy summer co'z the intense sun shine willl dried him out. He kinda function as a male bitch for the 3 chicas and it is unclear if any of them has any feelings for him. He always fantasize about Yu talking in a cutsy manner and he also did the same with Sera (only once). Now he's linked to Yuki a vampire ninja from another tribe, question is, does he like her?\\n\\n\r\nEucliwood \"Yu\" Hellscythe - she was found by Aikawa sitting near a conveniences store, as just like that, they started chatting - Yu writing down her words rather that saying it and then the next moment she's reviving Aikawa. At fist I thought that she's the villian (how wrong am I). It is not know wheather she has feeling for Aikawa since she declared him his servant. Among the characters she's probably the most mysterious of all to the viewers, co'z as the episode progresses we see a lot more that what we think she is. Who wouldn't know that she doesn't just revivie dead people, she also has powers for fighting and she did mentioned that her magical powers would still fuction even when she's dead,  does that mean she'll never die?\\n\\n\r\nHaruna 'Masou Shoujo\" - It's very clear as to why she stayed with the muchacho, she want's her powers back from the muchacho and as unlucky as it get's, both of them don't know how to do it, what puzzles me is why would the author of this anime decide to let Haruna maintain some of her powers, while her true form is stuck with the muchacho, also why did she since she already saw her sensie in ep 7, why didn't she took the opportunity to ask for help in getting her true form back from Aikawa? By the way, her near naked scene really adds to the encchiness of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSeraphim 'Sera'- is a vampire ninja sent to request Yu's help to come to their village, though she's the muchacho's servant (in word only) she doesn't seems to be like one co'z as we watch the anime she's always engage Aikawa in petty bikering and cusses the poor muchacho everytime, I like her boobs.\\n\\n\r\nYoshida Yuki - she only came around in ep 7 and her weapons are pretty wierd, her tribe is probably the only ones who uses Tonkastu soup as a weapon of choice - or maybe they used something else. She's cute, but I prefer either Haruna or Sera to be the muchacho's love interest. Like, that will happen.\\n\\n\r\nAriel - who we now know is haruna's Dai Sensie, I wonder if she's the main villian?\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not lease, Kyoko \"The serial killer\"- I guess she's the \"Piece de resistance.\" Or is she?\\n\\n\r\nI do have some questions about the character, but, who am I talking to anyway? Well a number 6 rating will do for this part. \\n\\n\\n\r\n5th and 6th, Enjoyment and Overall: \\n\\n\r\nI guess this anime if fair enough to be enjoyed by early teens as young as 13 -15, since the ecchiness is rather quite mild and the blood scene were artistically done, Strongly it is not for children as young as 10 and below. So I give both a fair 6  co'z the anime itself is not that bad but not too good either.\\n\\n\r\nPS: I have not read the manga, so pls bear with me, amigos.",

            "content": "Out of all the anime I watched this season I would probably say Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? is one of the stronger series.  The reason I decided to give the series a try is because the picture caught my attention when I was selecting anime to watch.  However I'm glad that I decided to watch this series\r\nThe first half of the series doesn't really follow much of a story, instead we are given some gut busting comedy to pass the time.  The comedy did actually get me to laugh a lot and I would've had no problem if the series keptgoing like this, but in the second half of the series a plot started to unfold. After the plot was revealed, the amount of jokes in each episode dropped to advance the more serious plot.  There was still some comedy during the second half of the series and the jokes were still funny when they came around though.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself wasn't actually bad. Sometimes the plot did feel rushed because they tried to fit it in the end, and there were some plot holes.  I think it would've been  better if they either made the plot a bit longer to let it develop more or just taken it out entirely.  It's not the best plot out there but it is interesting nonetheless and it is certainly better than some of the other plots in series that aired this season. Also putting together a good plot with gut busting comedy isn't exactly the easiest thing to do, so I think the series did a respectable job with the plot\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually very good, I like the character designs and the backgrounds were okay too.  The animation during the opening was awesome and you could really tell the mood by the art. I have no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was alright, I enjoyed listening to the opening and ending and the voice actors did a solid job with their character. However nothing really attached to me here.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first saw the opening and saw the different characters that were going to be in this series I thought to myself, this seems to be a strange combination of characters. However the characters were done really well.  Our main protagonist, Ayumu is a zombie is probably one of the better protagonists I've seen mainly because he's not weak like a lot of normal Harem leads. That already is a plus and he also seems know how to act in tight situations.  We also have a very adorable female lead, Eucliwood (Eu for short) who undergoes the most development and also doesn't talk, instead she writes on a notepad. She doesn't show her emotions much but as the series goes on she begins to open up to the main protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are also very likable. They don't seem to undergo much development but that's just really asking for too much from a series like this.  We have a tsundere Mahou Shoujo and 2 other Vampire Ninjas.  They do have traits of harem stereotypes but they also have qualities that makes each one of them unique.\\n\\n\r\nKore wa Zombie Desu ka? is really an enjoyable series, I couldn't count the amount of times that I laughed.  Add in very lovable characters and we have ourselves a very entertaining series. If you want a good laugh I would recommend watching this\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was one of the better series of the season and although the quality of it did dip slightly toward the end I still found the series to be very good. I give it a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Nothing in this anime is serious and should not be taken serious. It makes fun of all aspects anime out there, and does a good job at it.

            "content": "Ayumu Aikawa is a zombie resurrected by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe after being killed by a serial killer. As he tries to make the best of his un-dead life, he encounters a mashou shoujo named Haruna and accidentally takes her magic powers, being forced to become a mashou shoujo in the process. With Eucliwood, Haruna, and a vampire ninja named Seraphim living with him, Ayumu helps battle demons known as Megalos while trying to figure out the mystery behind his own death.\r\nStory & Characters (5/10)\r\nAfter watching enough gut-busting man-eating zombie movies you start thinking that you've seen everything that is until you saw Korewa Zombie Desu ka? (aka KoreZom). This hybrid show takes those horror stuffs into a new leap with its flashiness like a magical girl chainsawing monsters or some guy trapped in your every harem jest.\\n\\n\r\nPlain-looking high school student Aikawa Ayumu is a normal teenager living a boring, laid-back life with no excitement except one thing: as he's ready to tell you, he's a zombie. But how come a zombie doesn't feed on human fleshes and goes to school? That's not a long story. His life dramatically changed after being butchered by a serial killer. Luckily, a silver-haired lady necromancer by the name of Eucliwood \"Eu\" Hellscythe brought him back to life and Ayumu has entered the world of the occult since. Meanwhile, super-powered beasts wearing traditional seifuku called Megalo appeared wrecking havoc in town. Armed with a high magical (pink) chainsaw and a Cardcaptor outfit, Ayumu battles these monsters while trying to get to the bottom of things.\\n\\n\r\nNo mistake about it, KoreZom is utterly insane and comical. We've all seen the scene where a character selflessly jumps in front of a vehicle to save an animal or person countless times in anime, but in this case the potential hero, right before being struck, turns his head towards the screen and says: \"Oh, yeah, I'm a zombie.\" Wow, that's one heck of a start and it sets a variety you couldn't expect in a show with the title \"zombie.\" Wait, maybe you could.\\n\\n\r\nFor most part, KoreZom is purely for fun. Breath-taking humor being thrown rubbed away the disturbing gore and intense psychopath. There's chaos with zombies, vampires and the undead but the show always seems on the verge of blowing apart under the pressure of its own insanity. Characters are introduced when convenient or seemingly for the hell of it, to be killed or excised on a whim perhaps lighten the series up a little.\\n\\n\r\nBut they don't, being a typical harem trap, the female cast have convenient moe look yet their kinds don't attract much. Eu is an expressionless bishoujo with a hidden past, Seraphim is a busty hot chick with sword and Tomonori (naturally) is the protagonist's wife. For a \"harem leader\" achertype, Ayumu can pretty stand up for himself as he can dismember without hesitant, not exactly the \"loser\" formula. Crazy, but brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nStudio Deen, an animation studio who is famous for those bloody gore such as Higurashi and Umineko, here produces a bright and colorful effort which is hardly a paragon of action animation but loads itself up so effectively on the cute factor. Its designs are uninteresting, mainly focus on the moe standard with is trademark hairstyle, facial expression and eyes (although Eu's Gothic-moe look is a joke unto itself). Ayumu's design is even worse, you can immediately tell that he's yet again another dating heroes. Still, the utterly absurd parody of a magical girl transformation scene, complete with the sexy gasp, involving Ayumu is a hoot and the ensuing panty shots of him show that even the series' fairly frequent fan-service isn't immune to parody, either. Stick with this guy a little, and you'll see tons of crazy stuffs around him including his pervy delusion and \"man-service.\"\\n\\n\r\nAh right, because the title has the word zombie, there are expectations of violence. And speaking of violence, what is better than those moments full of all the decapitation, amputation and disemboweling that even the most juvenile of gore-hounds could desire.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nCasting features some familiar faces, giving KoreZom a bit of familiarity shared by its genre. Majima Junji again voices a colorless nice guy, while others such as Haruna or Seraphim's manage to give the show pushes with their cutie tsundere tones.\\n\\n\r\nThe synthesizer-heavy musical score mixes some cheesy themes in with cutesy themes, an occasional mildly dramatic one, and themes which sound like they were directly borrowed from an ero game for an overall effect that is energetic but unimpressive. The same goes for OP \"Ma?Ka?Se?Te Tonight\" sung by Eu's seiyuu, a somewhat cute and spiritual the show has, and ED which composed with a highly enthusiastic male-female dual with the lead characters performing some new kind of caramelldansen in the background.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\r\nAccept KoreZom for what it is \u2013 a simple cutesy fan-service show \u2013 and it can be quite entertaining. However, those who finished the show would find it quite disappointing. The plot is divided into two parts with little relation to each other: the first part is about the search for the mystery behind the murders while the second revolves Eu's past. But what more of an utter disappointment is how the producers turn the last episode into a mindless silly gag created for fan-service. There's still the OVA (or perhaps a sequel) to talk about, but I highly doubt they will continue the left-opened story. Just wait to see what other tricks they have up their sleeves. You will find lots of laughter here, depth probably not, but really, what can you expect in a series that has a guy wearing women's clothing as demon fighter?\\n\\n\r\nGood:\\n\r\n+ An entertaining, breath-taking humor take on demon-fighting cliches.\\n\r\n+ Ayumu is kind of manly for his achertype.\\n\\n\r\nBad:\\n\r\n+ Ridiculous villains.\\n\r\n+ Last episode is a cheap trick.",

Today, the \"zombie\" genre is very widespread, so it no wonder that Japan has already opened its doors to it. \r\nThere have already been other \"zombie\" anime that have been made, namely HOTD and the like. But unlike its other companions, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka is... unique! \r\nKore wa Zombie is a hilarious anime that will most likely leave you gasping for air in every episode. It's a fun, worry-free, and not-so-serious anime. But as a \"zombie\" anime, it isguaranteed to have lots of blood and gore to satisfy its fans.  But don't worry. The \"blood-gore\" level isn't that bad. So people with weak constitutions can watch it without worry. Although what you should be afraid of is the moments where one might lack oxygen due to laughing too much. It even has a touch of harem to boot!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. But it's not that note-worthy since almost all 2011-2012 anime use the same type of technique. It's all pretty balanced. But I'm pretty sure you won't be pausing to look at the artwork, since its pretty fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED both sound pretty nice. And they have great Seiyuus to boot too. Once again, all of them totally fit their characters... Well all except maybe Hellscythe-dono. I've noticed that her voice changes in several episodes, and it's bothered me a bit, but it's nothing serious.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kore wa Zombie is definitely a must watch! Guaranteed to satisfy all your hilarity needs. Warning: when asthmatic, please make sure you have your asthma attack spray ready, just in case of emergencies. (b>w",

            "content": "Its always good to pick up an anime that means absolutely nothing, once in a while and humor it just for laughs. If it wasn't obvious already, this is definitely one of those anime. I had always wanted to watch it since I loved its opening theme \"Ma.Ka.Se.Te.Tonite\" by Iori Nomizu and after having dedicated my day to it, I'm here reviewing it with mixed feelings.\r\nThis anime gets the \"fan_service\" tag for being all about lewd portrayals, panty-shots, casual nudity and bodacious characters. It also has its good share of cartoonish-gore. Being a zombie, Ayumu is subjected to his body parts being dismembered, more thana dozen times and it doesn't end with him. Ayumu is also forced to cross-dress against his liking which was just funny. Sera's degrading dialogues are cold, unforgiving and hilarious to listen to. Does anything make sense? Not in the very least. The anime succeeds at being an over-the-top fusion of all these elements and actually got me laughing for half of its tenure. The other half was rather grueling.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tries to take on a more serious note on several occasions, all of which seemed uninteresting. Some of the later battle scenes had me yawning, even fast forwarding, through it. They kinda had a whole episode centered on Fan-service which was not just cliched but also wasn't worth my time. There's nothing particularly outstanding about it but its good for an anime between two anime.\\n\\n\r\nOkay... Fan-service, check. Tsundere, check. Moe, check. Harem, check. Zombies, Magicians and Necromancers, check. Ninjas, check. Vampires, check. Ninja Vampires, check. Chainsaws, Katanas and Scythes, check. Human abuse, check check. SO, if you're in the mood for some mindless humor, this anime is deemed eligible.\\n\r\nPS: Zombie fanatics will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nMy Evaluation: 7 / 10",

            "content": "I've approached this anime while looking for something trashy and relaxing, for which I could turn off my higher brain functions and just enjoy the dumb humour and action - and I've got exactly that, but not necessarily in the quality I hoped for. If I wanted to describe this anime shortly, I'd say it's Highschool DxD, but with less ecchi and way more WEIRD. It's a show that never treats itself seriously and has fun with the harem formula, but to the point it barely manages to even pretend it tries to tell a coherent story, or build a setting and characters that aremore than just walking gags.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, to be fair, many fun ideas in it and jokes that land well. The strange, \"mute\" main heroine adds quite a lot of mystery and comedic opportunities to the whole setup. The parody of magical girl tropes is great. The protagonist is perverted in an amusing way and the internal dynamic of the harem is quite fun, thanks to the very different attitudes of the girls and a clear emphasis on Eucliwood being the primary one. All of this, however, does not develop into any kind of coherent narrative, and none of the characters truly shine during the first season. It was fun while it lasted, but left me feeling pretty much nothing when it was over and with very few memorable moments to think about - if something ever stood out, it was mostly through sheer randomness and absurdity.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality of the show is very decent and I honestly think it provides a fine way to burn a few hours when you don't want to challenge yourself in any way. It just never rises above being a fun distraction - be sure to adjust your expectations appropriately.",

            "content": "\"What was my finishing move? Let see uh...Oh right I think it was...Mystletainn Kick!\" \r\n\"That's not a kick! You cross dressing pervert!.......\" \r\nQuote that while is not the norm for every part of the series, makes up about 85% of the story. Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?  is an action harem at it's core with tons of comedic moments to fill the time. I won't lie, what drew me to this anime was the title picture of a magical girl...with a chainsaw. Getting superficial here but who doesn't appreciate a chainsaw toting magical girl(and later magical girl boy, well, whatever the hell he's supposeto be). \\n\\n\r\nOn to the first section, the story. I won't be going into many details since I can't do it in way without spoiling it. At  the first third or half of the story nothing much is going on other than character introductions. This is fine because there's a lot of great comedy to be had and it's fun to see the characters interact with one another. After that the story starts picking up at a decent pace although it's a bit confusing to follow due to some awkward shifts in the episodes and what seem to lack of explanation in terms of certain back stories for characters introduced later on. Despite being a sporadic mess at times it's not the worst story out there. For a harem it actually carries a story in a decent, sorta realistic(for it's universe) way without being forced.(I think people with a lot of experience with harems know what I mean with that trend to try have serious moment in the last two episodes of a series and it come off as feeling fake). \\n\\n\r\nThe art for series was very fun to look at and fit the series perfectly for what it is. The backgrounds were pleasant to look, particularly the graveyard and the city as a whole. If I recall there wasn't a lot of stuff going in those backgrounds but still nice designs. The character designs were good and fit the personalities of the characters, the necromancer and Haruna magical girl outfit were probably the highlights. The enemies gave the vibes they needed to give off appearance wise(whether it was to look seriously or be utterly hilarious the crayfish Megalo. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is possible my favorite part about the show. The opening almost never failed to get excited for watching the new episode. I don't believe I ever skipped that or the ending. The ending song is also great I loved how it had a game show/arcade game vibe to the song. On the background music, it's the typical fare but it's memorable. For the more quote on quote heartfelt moments there was a nice lonely piano bit that for me invoke childhood memories. There is also a quick ostinato thing that usually play during battles and some of the funnier bits. I would link it but I don't think it's been uploaded. The voice actors were excellent, I expected nothing less. Props especially go to Junji Majima who voiced Ayuma. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show range from being typical to your standard harem to being a little unique. Ayuma himself is a bit of a typical harem lead in being a perverted clown but as shown when times get serious this guy is really willing to give it his all and not a hesitant cowards. Eu, the silent necromancer, is a great female lead. Even without ever really saying anything she made quite an impact in what she wrote on her notepad and her actions. The other characters are stereotypical to a harem but all played a fun role. Haruna is a highlight for being an high energy idiotic \"genius\" who intentions are hard to understand even as the show unfolded. The villians were the weak point in the character department for this show, not exactly memorable and once out of the picture they're gone, no mention.\\n\\n\r\nThis was very a fun show to watch week after week if for one reason alone. At the end of the day it was over the top cheesy fun. It entered as a good goofy show and it ended as a great goofy show without ever really compromising how it started originally. Recommended to those who want to watch a decent harem or simply a fun show to pass the time. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so any comments on how I could improve it and how much I suck are appreciated. :)",

            "content": "Suppose zombies weren't the brainless shambling horrors mainstream media portrays them as. Suppose zombies live otherwise normal lives like you and me. So then, how can you tell them from us? Simple. Take a chainsaw, preferably a sturdy one, and saw suspected zombie in half. If said suspect continues to twitch, then he's a zombie. Congratulations. If said suspect doesn't, well- But wait! Have you ever wondered if you can find out the same with magical garment boys?\r\nAdapted from a light novel series of the same name by Shinichi Kimura, Is This a Zombie? was directed by Takaomi Kanasaki and produced by Studio Deen. Characterdesigns, original and anime, were provided by Kobuichi and Shinobu Tagashira respectively. We follow one Ayumu Aikawa who, after finding a random sword sticking out of his gut before keeling over, was reanimated by the mysterious, beautiful, and seemingly mute necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe. The both of them now living under the same roof as servant and master, our undead male protagonist tries to live his school life the best he can without anyone normal finding out. Trouble finds him, however, juggling the eccentric company of ninja vampires and magical garment girls wielding leaf blades and chainsaws on top of the caveats that being a zombie in his universe entails, and suddenly, he's also living with a vampire ninja and a magical garment girl. And, for whatever reason, he magically becomes a magical garment boy. Yeah, boy, though unfortunately, the costume's not tailored to his specific gender.\\n\\n\r\nLots and lots of random, over-the-top hilarity ensues, and it's precisely the random and over-the-top qualities that make the comedy work well in this series. The show's no stranger to exploiting anime tropes, most notably the -dere series, but the show is so audaciously gung-ho about each of them that their comedic value stays fairly constant. In addition to these running gag anchors are just a stream of ridiculously absurd developments, puns, gags, one after another, keeping the funny consistently fresh for a good portion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization deserves a mention. Granted, it's not going to win any accolades for it, but for what it is, a random, over-the-top harem comedy, I appreciate that the show were able to characterize these girls as individuals outside of their designated stereotypes, and that they show a significant amount competence independent of the male protagonist. Aikawa himself also comes off as a decent character, with humorous quirks and relatable worries. You know, ones that don't constantly scream pervert all the time and end up with him getting constantly decked. Getting beaten down's a reality for him, but it's not something the staff overly abuses for constant laughs. Outside fairly harmless daydreams about Eucliwood, or Eu, he doesn't harbor any obsessive lust for the women that surround him; in fact, he genuinely respects, cares, and tries his damndest to shield them from grief.\\n\\n\r\nOutside comedy, at least for the more episodic first half, there's also some fairly decent drama, the majority of it centering around Eu and how her necromantic abilities, powerful enough to raise the dead, and possibly more powerful still, are related to her seeming inability to speak. Outside her exotic headdress and armor plate, outside her quiet, emotionless exterior, is a girl who's lonely and, because of circumstances, has been alone until now.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned first half, because the show starts to come off from its seams by the second once there's a transition to something more plot-centric. Simply put, the writers behind this series do not know how to write a decent plot, especially one meant to be dramatic. Here random, over-the-top, and this show's brand of comedic are not welcome. Everything supposedly linear comes out fragmented, everything supposedly serious comes out unfulfilling, and everything supposedly silly comes out contrived. For instance, we got a life-threatening situation over here involving someone being crushed to death. Is it really a smart time to be stupid by making the perpetrator a giant plushie? We got a world-ending scenario involving the creation of a portal to hell on top of kidnapping and coersion. Is it the best time to animate a completely nonsensical scene of walking in to everyone nonchalantly eating pasta? The potential those few precious moments of drama early to make something delightful is wasted on the show's later lack of focus and tact.\\n\\n\r\nUtilizing the heavy elements of the electric guitar and drum set, OP \u201cMa-Ka-Se-Te Tonight,\u201d or \u201cLeave-It-To-Me Tonight\u201d by Iori Nomizu is strong enough rock to get into for those who are fans of that genre, coupled with the action-packed introductions of the main cast in a rather bleak, apocalyptic setting, but overall, in my opinion, it wouldn't be the number I'd use to characterize this show, the action is more a supplementary element than a major focus, however well-animated it may be at times. I'd also have to question, limited my understanding of the Japanese language may be, why opening seconds grammatically misuse some of the romaji for the show's title. ED \u201cKizuite Zombie-sama, Watashi wa Classmate desu,\u201d or \u201cNotice me Mr. Zombie, I am your Classmate,\u201d fits the bill better.  Essentially a duet by Rie Yamaguchi, who also seiyuus one of the characters, and Manzo, it has this goofy sense charm that playfully shifts tempo, style, and pitch at sections to fit with the visual whimsy of the male protagonist dying while in heat. That's a double entendre.\\n\\n\r\nA generally funny show that doesn't go too overboard on fan service, as far as harem comedies go, with a surprising amount of depth, the second half soured what would otherwise have been a mainly positive experience.  If the staff could get a better handle at working the plot, or just making future content more episodic like before, then I'd be a happy zombie. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, it occurred to me that there were less messy ways for sniffing out zombies than using chainsaws. Oops.\\n\\n\r\nI give Is This a Zombie? a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "I didn't realize how good KoreZom was until rewatching it about four months after the first time. A breathtaking comedy that will give you a huge amount of good moments, without losing focus on what matters: romance and drama.\r\n{STORY - 4/10}\r\nAt first, episodes may only steal lots of laughter, but plot gets a little more interesting when close to the end. It obviously wasn't intended to be epic. Still, we can see some funny and quick battles against many animal-based demons, called \"megalos\".\r\nAyumu's dull life changes completely after being murdered by a serial killer and revived by a necromancer called Eucliwood. Now living as azombie, he struggles to find the one responsible for his death. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really impresses is that the story doesn't really matter until you reach the last three episodes. There are some critical situations, but focus was kept on entertaining watchers with a huge dosis of basic fanservicing and many jokes. Both climax and dramatic scenes take some time to make their appearance and, when they do, things finally start getting serious...\\n\\n\r\n{ART - 9/10}\\n\\n\r\nOverall graphics from KoreZom aren't so amazing, comparing to other animes from 2011. However, the constant use of distinct visual effects and insane facial expressions on Ayumu, plus very well-made battle sequences and active scenes turn this show into something able to take front against the best designed works from Shaft's studio.\\n\\n\r\n{SOUND - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nThe most notable thing from this particular category is the voice acting. A cast filled with many know names, like Iori Nomizu, who also performs \"Ma-Ka-Se-Te Tonight\" (opening),  Yoko Hikasa and Rie Yamaguchi (same actress from Sora no Otoshimono's Kazame Hiyori), the one sings the ending theme, side by side with it's writer, manzo. Choosing Junji Majima to incorporate Ayumu seemed so perfectly planned. His acting has to be praised, as he's able to match all of Ayumu's emotions within his own tones.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, backgrounding used throughout the entire anime is impecable and every theme suits its situation perfectly. Most characteristic ones are Haruna's transformation intro and a tenre guitar song that opens almost every episode and is played on calm moments.\\n\\n\r\n{CHARACTER - 8/10}\\n\\n\r\nHaving one of the shortest casts I've ever saw isn't exactly a problem. Featuring few, but unique characters is what really matters in an anime, and KoreZom takes a lot of advantage on this area. The ones shown in here may not be seen on common works. A necromancer, a masou shoujo and a vampire-ninja. Those are the main categories from each of the girls close to Ayumu, who belongs to a different kind of zombie. He's immortal and super-strong, despite being vulnerable to direct sunlight, unlike any other living dead I saw before!\\n\\n\r\n{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nNon-stop stupid jokes, loli and sis complexes, both ridiculous battles and enemies and limitless perversion. That's what best describes this show. Still, ir can awake your deepest emotions at some times and even cause reflections about the way we live our lives. Impossible not loving this incomparable anime!\\n\\n\r\n{OVERALL - 8/10}\\n\\n\r\nAyumu just wanted to have a peaceful life. That until he got killed and then revived, into a zombie. He didn't have concerns, but an eternal life made he think again about how life is precious and must be enjoyed at all moments. Dealing with demons and love are his newest problems, but will he be able to handle all the trouble that three unusual girls keep dragging to him? At the same time he struggles to have a normal high school life?",

What do you get when  you take standard ecchi character formula mixed with some classic fantasy archetypes and stick it in the parody blender?  You get a Zombie, a Necromancer, a magic girl and a vampire ninja living under the same roof.\r\nThe story is simple, take your typical ecchi anime.  Now turn the main male lead into a zombie.  Next turn the girls hes living with into fantasy archetypes and make them all abuse and takeadvantage of him.  Oh and mix in some of the best parodied troups of anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound are top notch.  The opening is great, but the ending is just plain golden.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are perfect.  Every one of them is a classic troup anime personality given a twist that brings the show into its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this show gets a 10 is because of the sheer amount of jaw dropping laughter.  Everything is over the top, and hilarious.  If there is any downfall in this series it that the creators are just trying to hard.  That said, there effort is enough to make any anime fan grin.\\n",

            "content": "What could be more fun than a series that contains magical girls, zombies, vampires, ninjas, necromancers, and evil whales in school uniforms? Well, a lot of things actually. Kore wa Zombie desu ka? starts off promising and funny, but starts to take itself too seriously toward the end and focus on the rather unexciting and uninspired plot than what really made it good. When you watch the first episode, you know you are stepping into strange territory that only gets stranger as the series progresses, but it maintains a certain sense of seriousness that seems unneeded in an anime that\u2019s main character is a zombiewho can transform into a magical girl boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is fairly simplistic. Ayumu dies and is resurrected by a cute necromancer girl, Yuu. The guy runs into a tiny, feisty magical girl named Haruna. He steals her powers accidentally and gains the ability to transform into a magical girl boy complete with pink striped panties. He also meets a vampire ninja. Together, the four search for the person who killed Ayumu. It gets somewhat complicated from there with a magical girl school and rival vampire ninja clans and another zombie like Ayumu. This is all well and good, but the problem with the plot is not in the fact that it is trying too hard to be complicated and adult, but more so, as I stated, in the fact it takes itself so seriously most of the time. Which is fine, but when you start a series with lots of comedy and very little story, don\u2019t try and throw something at me that is attempting to be complicated.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem can be seen in the rushed ending. The main bad guy of the series is another zombie who was resurrected by Yuu. His intentions are never clear, other than the fact he wants to die. Why he wants to destroy the world in the process is lost on me and how he has magical powers is never actually explained. Anyway, the end of the series comes with episode eleven. Episode twelve is what should have been an OVA as it is the obligatory pool episode with enough fan service to make Rosario Vampire blush. Not only is the episode stupid and pointless, it is also a waste of time. With a second season on the way, there had to be more story that could have been thrown in, or at least something stupid, but progresses the plot or character interactions (like something between Ayumu and Tomonori?).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright. Characters look good, backgrounds look good, but it can sometimes look a little on the sloppy side, especially during fight scenes. If I can give the animators an award, it would have to be for jiggle physics. One particular fight halfway through the series was so amazingly captivating in its use of hypnotic giant boobies bouncing around a graveyard like two happy, skipping children. With every movement the breasts flung themselves in the direction the girl is going, threatening to tip her over. A chiropractor had to have been needed after that battle.\\n\\n\r\nSound, sound, sound. Whatever shall we do without you? The opening is pretty good, not exactly amazing but better than the generic pop that permeates the openings of a majority of anime. The ending on the other hand is plain. Music during the show ranges from six notes on a piano (which I\u2019ve complained about before) to what could be village music in a Final Fantasy game. The voices are all good and the sound effects are good as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character department, as always, is the part where I completely destroy an anime. But one of the things that makes Kore wa Zombie so great is that it has a variety of good characters to enjoy the company of. A few aren\u2019t so great, but a few are pretty fun.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with main character Ayumu. He\u2019s as generic as every sentence I write about main characters in anime. It\u2019s getting boring saying that the main character isn\u2019t all that exciting minus his one problem or complex (in this case, being a zombie), but it has to be done pretty much every time I review something. He\u2019s just a generic guy with a harem. Nothing sets him apart from the rest of the high school kids in strange situations.\\n\\n\r\nEucliwood Hellscythe is an interesting character. As she doesn\u2019t speak and doesn\u2019t really show emotions, there\u2019s a lot that you know is inside of her that you want to learn more about. What she writes and the few emotions she displays do make you feel sympathetic toward her. She\u2019s not the kind of character you will fall in love with, but she does have a certain appeal that can mostly be found in the mystery surrounding her, as well as her feelings later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHaruna is the magical girl of the anime and has an allergy to clothing. She\u2019s got a lot of nude and scantily clad scenes throughout, but she is also not a particularly bad character. She\u2019s got the tiny complex, she\u2019s got the attitude, but there\u2019s also something likeable about her. And it\u2019s not the nudity. Don\u2019t say that. It\u2019s more so her personality. I know you can trade her for a magical girl version of many anime characters, but I like the females with an attitude who don\u2019t take crap from anyone. She\u2019s strong and likeable because of how tough and in your face she can get. She doesn\u2019t act like it when just screwing around with her friends, but she truly cares for them and would do anything to protect them. She\u2019s also a magical girl with a chainsaw. A FRICKIN\u2019 CHAINSAW. And she\u2019s also the funniest of all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI did not like Seraphim on the other hand because the moment we are introduced to her, I knew she was what my friends and I call \u201cThe Boob Character\u201d. Big tits=big laughs and lots of guys paying attention. Not only is she a total slut, she\u2019s also a vampire ninja. This ridiculousness would have been funny if it hadn\u2019t turned into some sort of political intrigue about conservative vampire ninjaism vs. radical vampire ninjaism. On top of that, she just didn\u2019t have a lot of character. She was helpful as a fighter, but as a person she was just an ass, plain and simple, and totally unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nTomonori is the final character I\u2019ll dedicate a whole paragraph to. She was one of my favorite characters for whatever reason (maybe it was the fact I didn\u2019t get to see her enough to learn to hate her). She was damn cute, and on top of that her relationship with Ayumu is my favorite of the series. As the plot progresses, you can see her change and start to really like Ayumu. And on top of that, she was the second funniest character.\\n\\n\r\nKing of Night, the bad guy, as stated before was lame and pretty cardboard. The other bad guy (who I won\u2019t name) wasn\u2019t all that exciting either. Dai-Sensei is a character I want to know more about. Otherwise, everyone else is not worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nKore wa Zombie is a fun little ride. It has good action, good characters, and some pretty funny comedy. It starts to lack that comedy as it progresses, but the story isn\u2019t all that bad, just nothing worth remembering. There are some idiotic moments (the last episode), some cool moments (the whale), but overall it\u2019s a lot of meh. It just never seems to find its stride. With a second season on the way though, we can hope that it will provide better bad guys and figure out whether it wants to be a funny plot-based story or a serious plot-based story.",

I do not mean this as an insult, rather I think its great, but the way it is written is such that everything from eating rice, to someone dying is somehow turned into a joke.\r\nThe story is that of a guy who was resurected as a zombie, and then gets a harem of women from there on out. There are a couple fights but its not like any of them really amount to much or affect the happennings of the the story any.\r\nThe characters as mentioned involvea: zombie, necromancer, vampire ninja(as if one or the other werent enough) and a magical garment girl, whatever the hell that is... It is a great combination if this were all about fights and kickin ass(mainly the vampire ninja) but it doesnt really go there so we just have all these people with all this potential that isnt really getting used... oh and the zombie cross-dresses on the side...Man up and become a girl!!! lol\\n\r\nI really did enjoy watching this, mainly because of all the jokes being tossed in. Yes, there is such a thing as too much comedy, but honestly I dont think that happenned here, because it was built on comedy without which it would have collapsed in on itself.",

I watched 3 episodes at the start and decided I would rather watch something else more interesting. But soon after I watched a few episodes of other stuff I was beginning to complete a lot of things a part from Kore wa Zombie desu ka which stood at 3 episodes watched. I decided I had to pick up the pace and start liking this anime! So what I did was told myself watch 2 episodes and if I still wasn't interested Iwas to put it on hold or just drop it but after the fourth episode I thought I ned to stop watching this! but remembered my note of watching 2 episodes. I shook my head and watch episode 5! Which just changed my entire view of Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Everything seemed different characters power became more interesting their lives past lives futures became more interesting. More or less I decided to watch to episode nine. By that time it was still interesting but it was  in the morning so I went to sleep and completed it the next day. My opinion of this anime is give it a shot like I did. Then recommend it to people or tell people to stay away depending on your opinion. If you have seen this anime before give yourself a pat on the back you managed to see this anime out of all the animes in the world! And if your overall rating was nine like me... then add me and we can discuss more animes!",

The story line was super wonky and how magic and power work in this seem massively without a proper power scale, but this anime just provides so much humour and enjoyment without it. My only issue with it would be that the last episode was ENTIRELY unnecessary and perhaps could've been used to help further the plot into thesecond season. All in all, worth a watch.",

My main problem with this type of show is how some of the main or minor characters, especially in a harem, give so much crap to the main. All everyone does is ridicule and beat on Ayumu for no good god reason. Those types of shows are really not okay in my book. It's just bullying. Not to mention that one of the characters always calls him names. All this show is about bullying. The only real parts I liked were the actions scenes,and this particular show is supposed to be a comedy, but I hardly laughed. I've been trying so hard to finish this just so I can say I watched it, but it's just so hard considering all that I said.",

Now onto the characters, all characters have there spot in the show and none feel rushed or forced to be put in the show, though I do have issue and this might only be me butI personally did not like they way they showed the main character. Aikawa, I expected so go out of the house once in a while just to take a walk or something, when there's people living in your house that tease you and bring pain upon you'd think he's want to get away from all that once in a while, overall this really good and worth your time, if your considering watching this stop thinking about it and go out and watch this!",

            "content": "First and foremost if you have a passionate hate for fanservice or those who only watch anime for a strong story, then this is not for you. However if you can deal with that and can easily laugh at most things, then this should be a good watch for you. \r\nStory: 6\r\nAs said before this anime doesn't really have a strong story for the most part. They try to put a little story element in there, which I was able to enjoy, but by no means is this show made to be watched due to the story. \r\nArt: 7\r\nI feel this is more of asubjective subject to judge. It's better than previous anime of course, but most anime around this series release should be. The art was nothing to be praised about either but it was good. It didn't hurt my eyes and the fanservice was a good plus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nCharacters for me is one of the strongest points. You have a zombie, necromancer, vampire ninja, and magiclad girl as the main cast. Each character was characterized really well. Though the main character is more of your stereotypical anime protagonist the things that he actually goes through really makes his character more funnier than most. Necromancer is your silent heroine, Magiclad girl is your very loud, cocky, and honestly somewhat annoying heroine, and the vampire ninja is your sadist matured heroine who pretty much verbally abuses our main protaganist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAgain a very subjective and rate but I rather greatly enjoyed this show. It was one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. I can honestly find myself re watching this show whenever I wanted to. The comedy and the characters really having me coming back to the show. That and the fact that I'm kind of in love with the necromancer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nI enjoyed this show more than others so of course my overall may seem unreasonable to some of you. If you want to laugh with out getting angry over a bit of cleavage and even some dude bulge then you can watch this show and enjoy it. The story is fairly weak so don't jump in this thinking it's going to have one of the best feels ever cause you going to disappoint yourself. Watch it with a mindset that's there to laugh and honestly have fun watching it. I know I have for the multiple Times I've watched it.",

            "content": "Kore wa zombie desu ka? follows the story of Ayumu, normal teenager who one days dies, then comes back as a zombie, then turns into a magical garment girl after some pretty funny sequences of events. He is now tasked with defeating Megalos, demon-type enemies bent on destruction. However, he has a few problems, mostly the girls in his life who will not leave him alone! I giggled throught the anime and it made me smile. \r\nI thought Kore wa (shortened!) was a nice little anime at first, kitchy with its comedy and fanservice and the way the girls (haruna, Eu, and Sera) always pickedon him and more often than not (haruna) beating him up. However about halfway through the story changed into something darker, deeper and more compelling. Sure there were the comedy/fanservice moments but i found myself tearing up at some parts and really getting into the characters, most noteably Eu (Lady Deathsythe) her story just about teared me to bits. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go Ayumu is pretty average, he is the typical high school guy, leering at girls, slacking off. He really does have a soft spot though and he really shines near the end during Eu's crisis. He had his redeeming moments, much like the others. The one i did not truely like was Sera (Seraphim) she is a ninja and thus, cold. She does show a softer side but hearing her call Ayumu 'repugnant' or a 'maggot' multiple times Every. Single. Episode. Got annoying to say the least. Same with Haruna, i had to hear 'dumb Ayumu' more than i would have liked.  There are other characters thrown in as well, but they do not have such a defining story as the others. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it is a charming anime, with 12 episodes int he first 'season' it is short and worth the 6 hours to watch it if you like yoru light animes. While there are some dark themes and quite a bit of blood, it is not so deep that it will stick with you indefinatly but its a nice, easy, vacation from the more complex animes out there. \\n",

None of the characters have any personality and all of the writing relies on slapstick humor. The animation is under-par, so none of the comedic slapstick gets across the way that it should. Our main character is supposed to be a zombie, however does not resemble one, with the exception has limps are detachable and re-attachable. \r\nI have to admit that I watch the dub of this anime, mostly because I was looking for something I could watch sideways in bed without having to read subtitles. The englishvoice acting was so bad. This is the worst voice acting I have ever heard. The actors sound like they were hired at random off the street without ever having seen an animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason this gets an overall score of 3 rather than 2 or even a 1 is because of the genuine creativity derived from the source material. It seems like a pretty interesting attempt at lampooning other anime. This is an obvious spoof, and some of the content here would have been interesting with better execution.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS IS A SPOOF ANIME THAT ACTUALLY MANAGES TO BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THE CONCEPTS IT TRIES TO DECONSTRUCT!

            "content": "TLDR:This show had some real potential but too much torture p0rn and too much cringe. If they had focused on the real comedy, the fight's, the side characters, and the romance this could've been god tier. As a result I say it's a 5. if you're willing to go through the shitty first season, for a mediocre second then it's worth a watch. Otherwise stay away. I recommend you watch kona suba for a real comedy, as for this anime, at the very least watch the funny moments on youtube.\r\nI have seen both seasons, as such i'm reviewing it as a package.\r\nStory: Forgettable...I just finishedit and i can barely remember the plot points. The plot is just there to get the characters from A to B. Which is fine, it's a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Most of the main cast are unlikable. The MC is funny and cool, but the 3 girls he lives with are awful. Eucliwood is okay, Haruna can be cute and funny at times, but is usually really annoying and obnoxious, and Seraphim is just a bitch...she so snobby and condescending it's not even funny. (More on them later) The side characters really make the show for me, but get very little screen time. Aikawa's best friend is super funny, yuki is a really great person, Kirara is interesting, and Kyoko is just awesome. But they get barely any time.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: Here is my biggest problem with this anime, over 80% of the jokes (especially in Season 1) are pretty much the MC getting hurt or humiliated to the point where honestly i'd call it torture p0rn. The MC is like deadpool, as he can regenerate from pretty much anything. Seraphim, and Haruna pretty much use this as an excuse to mercilessly beat him every episode. You really start to feel bad for the MC for taking these beatings on the daily...Whether it's getting pikes shoved up his anus (Not exaggerating) getting his eyes stabbed (Not exaggerating) Getting his teeth kicked in ETC... Even though it's his house, for some reason he puts up with it. If that's what you find funny then to each their own but that stuff is really dumb to me. What makes this anime funny are the interactions with the side characters. This show could have been funnier if they ditched all the torture p0rn and made more of the real comedy this anime has to offer.   \\n\\n\r\nArt:This one is hard because there's times where this show looks average, but times where it looks almost movie quality. But it never looks bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound:The voice actors are great and did what they could with the scripts they were given. Music doesn't stand out. Sound effects are decent.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:(Same as TLDR) This show had some real potential but too much torture p0rn and too much cringe. If they had focused on the real comedy, the fight's, the side characters, and the romance this could've been god tier. As a result I say it's a 5. if you're willing to go through the shitty first season, for a mediocre second then it's worth a watch. Otherwise stay away.

            "content": "I didn't have high expectations for Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?, seeing it's an ecchi harem and that's not usually my cup of tea, but found myself enjoying it a lot. It definitely got me hooked and I went through the 12 episodes pretty fast.  \r\nThe comedy was one of the main things that grabbed my attention, since it doesn't take much too process. It's perverted to say the least (panty shots, boobs, girl and guy butts, you name it) which caught me off guard sometimes, but just added to the hilarity. There's also some sarcasm, breaking of the fourth wall, and just flatout immaturity. It made me laugh out loud a lot.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing some might have a problem with is the lack of of a consistent plot. Each episode bounces from one thing to the next, occasionally bringing ideas from previous ones with it. Often things are resolved quickly and then something new would pop up to replace it. A few parts of the story also carried action along with it, which surprisingly had some gore in it. The gore-factor though was kind of hard to take in while teenage boy Ayumu, the main protagonist, is dressed as a magical garment girl wielding a bright pink chainsaw.  \\n\\n\r\nBut the not very strong story wasn't an issue for me- I was too busy enjoying the characters! I really liked all of them, my personal favorite being Eu, the necromancer who uses a pen and paper to communicate. (Or as Haruna would say, \"neck-wear mancer\") I thought the dynamic of the characters worked together very well, especially in the show's comedic sense. You definitely can see a lot of the stereotypical anime tropes in cast, but all of the characters' quirks help soften the edges of the easy to spot tropes.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really liked Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?, and would recommend to it anyone looking for something short, funny and easy to enjoy.",

            "content": "I never heard of a zombie that wanted to become a \"penguin\".\r\n\"Is This a Zombie?\" or \"Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?\" is a rear and interesting anime at most. I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it before. Its funny and serious but too comedic at times that suck the seriousness right of it. I cant say this a is a perfect anime but it was good. If you need a anime that to pass the time this is it.\r\nI can't see myself getting to invested in the story. \"Is This a Zombie?\" kept reminding me of the anime \"Rosario + Vampire\" soif you were a fan of that you might like this. This did make me laugh at times but sometimes I felt like they were trying to hard to make \"you\" laugh and at times the jokes were just too flat.This happens about twice during the hole show. Somethings that kept bugging me, throughout the hole thing \"Ayumu\" the main character who is a zombie kept referring himself as a zombie. Whenever there was a life and death situation he would say something like \"let me do this, remember i'm a zombie\" or something stupid like that... It did make me laugh when \"Seraphim\" the \"Vampire Ninja\" (whatever that means) would always refer to \"Ayumu\"  as a \"maget\".The story does a good job in introducing each character and where they come from. For the most part, the story jumps around until the last 5 episodes not counting episode 12. Which felt like the were done with everything and need one more episode to fill up space but for the most part it was good. There is a lot of thing that just got me confused and made me scratch my head at, like one was the hole violin and music thing to destroy the incoming monster this isn't a spoiler but it is weird. \\n\\n\r\nBut sometimes its better to just accept these flaws and just go with it. Well that's what I did and after I was done with the hole thing I started asking my self these weird question like why does a zombie die in the sun? But to be honest even if I got an answer I would still question it. And the amazing thing about it is that its extremely enjoyable. This anime is just for the LOL's and nothing else. The story is kinda touching but nothing too serious. It wont make you sad and cry but makes you curious makes you wonder whats going to happen next. I would have like to seen the anime to take themselves a bit more serious but its good the way it is. So if your bored and have nothing to do, do yourself a favor and watch it. Oh ya and did I mention that the main character who's a zombie that cant die and will live forever is also a tranny with magic powers. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nDon't forget to hit that \"Helpful button\" if you found this helpful in any way so others can find this review. Don't be afraid to send me a message if you want to talk more about this anime or had any comments with my review. ^_^",

Oh and a quick side note I loved the opening theme song and ending song so I gave sound an 8 hehe",

            "content": "I felt the desire to \"random\" something that wasn't already recommended to me at some point since I started this hobby of mine. I did just that and I gotta say I was surprised.\r\nNow normally I'm a little cautious when it comes to the Slice of Life genre when it has both the Harem and Ecchi tags going along with it. High School DxD was the show that did this to me because that show was the first one that I saw which I felt really went way overboard with both aspects. I'm certain it was the intention to do so but just my personaltaste.\\n\\n\r\nI'm happy to say that Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? didn't do this. I was pleasantly surprised at the end of it to feel good about almost everything. It has just enough Ecchi to where you never really feel like its being forced down your throat. Comedy that doesn't feel overly forced and doesn't require a ton of TL notes to understand. A nice cast of characters within the Harem complete with different traits among the girls that aren't overly done in my opinion. A main character that is well rounded enough. It feels like he's still a high school student but not completely awkward when it comes to the ladies around him in their risque moments. That for me is huge because I personally do not like a main character who is nothing but a wuss when it comes down to this aspect\\n\\n\r\nThey did manage to put in a range of supernatural things, which I enjoyed even squeezing in the traditional Mahou Shoujo transformation whenever the time called for it. It was  a big bonus that it did't drag. Each time it felt really compact. I've seen a few shows where after five or six transformations I start dreading it coming at me. This never happened here.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure if everyone will get this reference but my opinion of this show is that it's a bag of trail mix. That's the best way I can describe it. You have a lot of elements that come into this show to make it one whole bag of a Slice of Life series but they sprinkled just enough of all the ingredients to make the bag tasty and filling. I don't think this one will be called one of the best of all time by any means but really I do think that if you enjoy the slice of life genre you shouldn't skip this one.",

Following with Seraphim and Yuki.\r\nAyumu himself has goals to fulfill since he got a second chance and he's trying his hardest to get there.\r\nThe anime from the beginning hasthe feeling it's just supposed to be ridiculous and crazy, not serious at all. Something fun and entertaining, simple to just sit down and watch the whole season. And that's partly what it is, I liked it more than I thought I would.\\n\r\nIt's not all just laughs and ridiculous things happening, there is a plot and it can get pretty deep which is a great contrast to the rest of it.\\n\r\nIt all comes together really well which is why it's so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe little imaginary talking parts for Eu are fantastic, it gives it a perfect perverted vibe and I love that. \\n\r\nIt's definitely Ecchi and Harem, lots of fan service and naughty jokes. It's put together really well, I laughed a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThis is something I'll definitely recommend to people, it was really fun to watch and for a weird, crazy plot it works. \\n\r\nEpisode 12 fantastic.

            "content": "Kore wa zombie desu ka? is a comedy/action/harem anime series produced by Studio Deen, that aired in the Winter 2011 Anime season. The show is a crazy mishmash of genres, character tropes and various powers and supernatural beings that come together to create an extremely energetic and fast paced show.\r\nAyumu Aikawa is the central character of the show, a normal Japanese high school student who just happens to be a zombie. After being killed by a roaming serial killer and subsequently revived by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe (Yuu), he is now a walking dead, with enhanced strength and invulnerability. While searching in a graveyard fora clue to the identity of his killer, Ayumu encounters Haruna, a \u201cmasou shoujo\u201d, or magical girl, who inadvertently transfers her powers to him while attempting to heal him. Ayumu is now both a zombie and a magical girl, granting him magical powers, the use of Mystletainn, Haruna\u2019s pink chainsaw (of course) and a full magical girl costume, frilly adornments, garters, stockings and all.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses, many more characters join the cast, including Seraphim (Sera) a vampire ninja who wishes to become Eucliwood\u2019s student and servant and Tomonori, a vampire ninja from a different faction who Ayumu accidentally marries after the two kiss. Ayumu and his harem fight a number of different monsters, called Megalo, including a giant demon bear, a giant lobster wearing a school uniform and a giant flying whale. Later on in the series, Ayumu also encounters his killer, as well as the king of the night, another zombie previously revived by Yuu, who serves as the main villain of the series.\\n\\n\r\nKore wa zombie desu ka? is a high-octane show, with most of the story progression and comedy being fuelled by the crazy and surreal situations Aikawa is put into. The premise doesn\u2019t change too much, the characters and the comedy style in the first episode here still apply, the fight scenes are still of a very high quality and the characters are still extremely likeable. While the show continues to surprise with the surreal elements, throwing them into the mix at a very rapid pace, the actual plot of the show is never too deep and the story doesn\u2019t progress too quickly either. The show attempts to show a love connection between Aikawa and Yuu, with occasional love interests in Haruna and Tomonori, but they come across as hackneyed and stale, never going further than the standard harem tropes and superficial, immature love stories portrayed in countless series before it.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of the series is without a doubt the surrealist elements coupled with the action that is featured throughout. Kore wa Zombie desu ka? is a comedy show and it definitely succeeds there. The characters are voiced very well, especially Aikawa, who continues to show shock and disbelief at the random monsters he is forced to battle with and the ridiculous scenarios he is forced into. The art style and animation, while not among the best this season, are more than acceptable, with the monsters and the main cast being extremely detailed and animated very fluidly, especially in the action sequences. Aikawa\u2019s design is very basic, but this is most likely to contrast the detailed designs of the other characters and to show how he is still a normal student forced into a ridiculous situation.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d have to say though, that where the series falls short is the forced story and attempt to provide depth to the show. It might sound weird, but I honestly think that the show would be a lot better if the love story and any other attempts at emotional content were taken out. It might sound weird for me to spite any form of depth in a show, but it seems like it would stand better as a pure comedy, focusing on the surreal elements and the action sequences rather than the relationship between Aikawa and Yuu. Kore wa Zombie desu ka? works best as a simple comedy/harem/action series, I really do think the other elements get in the way. Character relationships would obviously still remain, but in the form of playing against each other in comedic situations and working together to defeat enemies, rather than empty and dull pseudo-romantic speeches.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Kore wa zombie desu ka? is a very enjoyable show. While the show wasn\u2019t too imaginative in terms of plot, the characters, concept and design do make up for it. The show doesn\u2019t really do much more than merge a number of different genres together (Magical girl series, Ninja series, Vampire series), but the result is still very enjoyable. While I wouldn\u2019t strongly recommend it, especially over the other incredible shows that aired in the Winter 2011 anime season, it is still a very well made series, and is still worth a watch.",

Ideas like this are the reason I fell in love with anime to begin with!\r\nI'd like to note that I watched both seasons but am only reviewing the first because I feel the second season is just more of the first.\r\nStory-6\r\n------------\r\nThe premise is great! The story itself is more of your typical harem stuff, with some supernatural elements of the show taking a back seat. While I enjoyed it, the character interactions is what most stood out to me.\r\nArt-7\r\n-----------\r\nI feel like where the art is good(the Tim Burton like characters and art[only example I can come up with]), itshould have brought everything into that art style. Instead we have some mediocre art mixed in with some of my favorite character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nGood Op and Ed. But please do not watch the English Dub unless that is just your thing(not harping on ya, cause it's my thing too. But i do enjoy both dubs and subs). I watched the first season in dub, and I gotta say it's pretty bad, especially compared to the sub, where everything just feels right. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nTotally cliche, but that's something I like at times. The show has good characters. Not great ones. But that's just fine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymenet-7\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nFun watch. Fun premise.

It's somehow stupider than that.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe first few episodes started out great because you do not know what stupid thing might appear next. They did a good job meshing up stupid combinations such as a magical girl zombie. You\u2019ll get a few chuckles here and there but after a few episodes, it abruptly shifted to a corny, boring romantic mystery drama that somehow feels rushed then finally for the final episode they shifted to a full out fanservice mode. \\n\\n\r\nThough, I must admit, the only thing memorable about this anime is its stupid catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m a zombie\u201d \u2026.and a magical garment girl. \\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNice animation and cinematography (lots of dramatic bloodshed and other sfx) but the usual forgettable character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nGood background music and other sound effects plus a pretty decent ed song.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/7)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 personalities are the usual \u2013 the same old characters that you may find in any harem anime (a guy surrounded by pretty girls and suddenly falling in love or drawn into him) with a twist of zombies, vampires, ninjas, magical girls and other stupid combinations. I must admit it is fun watching them at times but overall, with all the drama, their personalities doesn\u2019t quite add up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is one of those 12 episode anime that started out good and ended badly and somehow rushed. Is it worth watching? No, yes, maybe? If you hate poor romantic mystery drama, give up on it. If you like fan service, this show has a lot of it. If you just like watching for the sake of watching, then go for it. \\n",

Development between characters is sometimes is sometimes a little \"Meh\" standard harem drama and such.

The anime did spend quite a bit of time in the first half cramming in its share of ecchi however, it did mature a bit near the second half of the series.  There are a few things left unfinished in the end but overall, things went much better than I thought they would judging by the first 5 or 6 episodes.  The first half mainlydealt with fighting various monsters of the week but there was actual tension and various vampire related complications in the last few episodes which did help thigns quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nart: 7\\n\r\nPetty typical art of an ecchi/comedy anime.  it isn't the best art in the world but it isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nsound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening theme is pretty good, the ed is no where near what the op is but that's not too uncommon.  The voice acting is pretty decent, the voices fit the characters so it gets an 8.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: 7\\n\r\nAikawa Ayumu: The cross-dressing (not by choice) zombie, the male lead voiced by Junji Majima who was also Ryuuji from Toradora's Japanese voice actor.\\n\r\nHaruna: The original Masou Shoujo female lead.  Highly intelligent but also similarly arrogant, her very first meeting with the male lead resulted in her cutting him in half with a chainsaw; I guess she says \"hello\" a bit differently.\\n\r\nEucliwood Hellscythe (Yuu): The quiet necromancer.  There is a good reason why she doesn't talk much or show too much emotion, she's not just a Yuki/Tabitha/Rei clone.  She's probably the character that is most easy to sympathize with especially in the 11th and 12th episodes.\\n\r\nSeraphim: The ninja Vampire...  yes you read that right.  She hates the male lead... a lot.  Responsible for the other 1% of ecchi/yuri in the series.  There is a legit reason for this strangely enough which is revealed along with Yuki's introduction.\\n\r\nDai Sensie: Haruna's teacher Ariel.  Dragged Haruna down to Earth for tofu apparently.  She is mostly on the sidelines as she never really gets entangled into any of the scoobie scrapes that occur in the series; it may also be that she's pretty much the most powerful character outside of Yuu.\\n\r\nYoshida Yuki: she isn't introduced until ep 7 and uses soup as a weapon of war.  Serephim doesn't get along with her but Serephim seems to \"hate\" Ayumu slightly more.  Between herself and Serephim, the two of them have pretty much the same problems as far as their clans are concerned.\\n\r\nYoru no Ou: The other zombie created by Yuu only introduced near the end of the anime.\\n\r\nIt's kind of hard to say anything about this guy without spiling things but I'll try anyway: Yuu and Yoru know each other from way back in the past.  This of course, eventually causes problems for pretty much everyone.\\n\\n\r\noverall: 6\\n\r\nAlthough the series did improve considerably in the last few episodes, I don't think it outweighed the scchi from the first 5 or 6 episodes and there were a few clear weaknesses in the plot that didn't help.",

            "content": "Well let me start off by saying I have not watched a whole lot of Anime compared to some avid watchers, but I think I have a pretty good critical eye, so I will try my best to share an accurate opinion.\r\nI had some mixed feelings about this anime. I thought the plot had a lot of potential but lots of areas fell short for me. The biggest issue I have is anime is it lacks back-story on quite a few of the characters. It only gives minimal explanations to why some of the characters abruptly enter the story, and others leave much in thesame fashion. It didn't seem to explain much of anything to satisfaction. That being said it is only a 12 episode series, and I feel like the majority of 12 episode series run into this problem. It just ended up feeling like half a story to me, I have not read the light novels so I'm not sure if the story was condensed or changed to fit in a shorter time.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the comedy aspect. This anime seems to run the line between trying to take itself seriously and outright ridiculous. I didn't approach this anime looking for a series story, nor did I think i'd find one, but I felt some of the quirky comedy aspects kind of weakened and cheapened the more serious sections and should have been executed differently. \\n\\n\r\nThat seems like a whole lot of bad, but there is also some good. The characters personalities were very captivating and it was easy to make connections with them. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation and sound I felt they were both up to par, in fact I really enjoyed the animation style. I'm not knowledgeable on sound or animation so I'll leave it saying I didn't find anything that bothered me with either. \\n\\n\r\nI'd really like to give this anime an 8 overall, but I feel it was just a 7 (good).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So listen, I had a really hard time trying to start this review\u2026 partly because this show isn\u2019t a normal Zombie show and partly because so many people have reviewed it before me and given it the review of \u2018what the hell was it?\u2019. Even the way they show off a zombie is not typical; nothing like \u2018High School of the Dead\u2019 or \u2018Walking Dead\u2019. The zombies in this show\u2026 or should I just say Zombie as there is really only one\u2026 doesn\u2019t eat brains, go on a rampage, or try to kill everyone around him. How is that a good show? Well\u2026 like Isaid, the show isn\u2019t normal and hard to explain if I don\u2019t go into detail.\\n\\n\r\nOur first character is Ayumu Aikawa, or if you would like to call him typical high school boy stereotype number one then that would be fine too. The first time we even meet him, he basically spells himself out, then says he\u2019s a zombie like it doesn\u2019t mean anything at all. And it\u2019s true, if you took out the Zombie aspect to him, he would be pretty normal. I just don\u2019t actually understand the part that happens after he says he\u2019s a Zombie. What was the point of having his clothing fly off after he was hit by a truck? Anyway, the reason why he is a zombie is actually a rather sad story. He was killed by a serial killer after trying to protect someone. Then he was brought back to life by a young Necromancer and now stays by her side wanting to one day catch the person who killed him. Like I said, he has a rather tragic back story and yet we don\u2019t get much of that. Sure one or two times he would stop and think about it, but other then that, he spends his life just learning to cope with being a Zombie rather comically. Even more comically when he absorbs a magical girl\u2019s powers and is able to transform but I will get to that in a moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe next person I\u2019m going to bring up would be Haruna, one of the many girls who ends up living with Ayumu, hence the harem part of this show. She is a magical girl from a different\u2026 dimension?... who is learning how to be a magical girl though\u2026 school? The only real reason why she is actually in Tokyo was to get\u2026 Tofu\u2026 for her\u2026 teacher? Alright, so for her character, there is a lot I have to actually speculate (or ask why the heck it\u2019s even in the show to begin with) as they don\u2019t really do a very good time explaining it. Her power ends up being absorbed by Ayumu and for the whole show, she does nothing but complain about it, learn how the world works, and try to get her powers back. I don\u2019t understand why they put her into this show except for the fact that she ends up giving Ayumu her powers. Actually, the scene they show when she loses her powers reminds me a lot of \u2018Bleach\u2019 when Rukia gives Ichigo her powers in a way. The difference is that Rukia was actually a likeable character in that anime and Haruna just gets on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I didn\u2019t bring up Eucliwood Hellscythe second is the fact that she really doesn\u2019t have much of a presence in the first half of the show. She is one of my favorite characters and the only one that I can actually have feelings for as when they get into her back story, it is really sad and actually explains a lot more about her then the other characters. Hellscythe never speaks (although Ayumu always pictures her with this really cutesy voice) and will only write things down on a paper to express herself. All through the show, there are very few times that she will actually show any emotions at all, normally she just sits at the table in front of the TV and drinks her tea. I guess this is why I like her so much. When she does show even the slightest emotion, you can really feel that what is going on is important.\\n\\n\r\nThe last person I\u2019m actually going to put energy into talking about would be Seraphim. By the name, you can know exactly what she is, right? Well no\u2026 she isn\u2019t an angel, she\u2019s a Vampire Ninja. Yes\u2026 you heard me right, a Vampire Ninja. Don\u2019t look at me like that, I didn\u2019t make that up! I can only wonder just exactly what was going on with how they picked what she was, like they pulled it out of a hat or something. Anyway, her signature outfit to wear is a yellow spaghetti-strapped top showing off her midriff and dark blue jeans... (um\u2026 So\u2026 that\u2019s what a ninja wears in this universe it seems\u2026) She is also fights with a Katana and is always yelling \u2018Swallow Cut\u2019 (\u2018Swallow Return Strike\u2019 in the English Dub\u2026 which if you really look it up, its not what she says it is) as she is fighting\u2026 (Again, seriously. What the hell makes her an actual ninja?) Shall I also mention that she is the one with the largest breasts and they seem to like pushing them in your face as a joke? I know Japan\u2019s idea of what is funny is different then America, but still, I can\u2019t get away from sighing at this. \\n\\n\r\nSo let\u2019s go into the main aspect of this show, the fact that we have a male zombie turning into a Magical Girl. It is an awesome idea in concept, but with how this was executed, I am not all that sure. While I liked watching the show, I feel more like I watched the show to know more of Hellscythe\u2019s back story rather then for any of the other characters. Ayumu just seems bland as a main character, Haruna is really annoying, and Seraphim\u2026 I have no idea exactly what she is. I feel a bit sad that Hellscythe isn\u2019t the actual main character but then I do remember how she doesn\u2019t talk and know how hard it would be to write a story around someone like that. Maybe it is the mystery behind her that makes me want to watch the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is actually rather good. Studio Deen did a rather beautiful job for the most part. The only problem with the style they are using is the fact that it has been used countless other times. They aren\u2019t doing anything ground breaking with the designs of the characters, the action scenes\u2026 its just very typical. I give them props for not just throwing things together with squiggles and luckily every character keeps their proportions for most of the show which after reviewing so many other shows, the proportion thing is a bit of a blessing. The colors are very bright and happy even during some of the darker times that it basically keeps reminding me this is a comedy show. Sadly, that doesn\u2019t go well for the times that we are supposed to get emotional.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voice acting is actually pretty good to me, making it pretty enjoyable. The voices of the characters do seem to fit well with the personality and look of the characters making me believe that when I don\u2019t like a person, it\u2019s not just because of the voice. Ayumu is voiced by Austin Tindle and he has a little bit of a monotone going for him. Austin did a couple voices like Alzack Connell in \u2018Fairy Tail\u2019 and Ken Kaneki in \u2018Tokyo Ghoul\u2019. What makes me rather sad is that Haruna is voiced by a voice actress that I really like. Her name is Jad Saxton and she voiced the character Masako Hara in \u2018Ghost Hunt\u2019. She was really good in that one but here, it feels like she is sort of trying to force the energy into the character (I do give her props though that I did not first recognize her voice as that from \u2018Ghost Hunt\u2019). Like I said, this is one of the reasons that I believe it\u2019s only the characters I don\u2019t like and not the actual voices for those characters. It did surprise me though that many of the main characters were voiced by little known voice actors rather then large names. Most of the big names are set for either side characters or antagonists. Funimation has been known to put the bigger named voice actors like Vic and Todd Haberkorn into main character roles that it\u2019s nice to have characters that don\u2019t sound like someone from another series. The music isn\u2019t really something to write about as it\u2019s the same sort of stuff you would normally get for a comedy driven show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would not call this the best show ever, but it does have some strange and interesting parody changes. I give them props for there creative twist to a genre that was pretty much set in stone but the way they executed it was a little forced. From the many different characters that pop up, the situations they put themselves into, and the fact that there are so many genres smashed into this one show\u2026 it just feels like they were trying to hard. It\u2019s one to try and watch, but I wouldn\u2019t blame someone for not really getting into it.",

            "content": "Watching the apathetic zombie Ayumu shrivel in the sun and get sawed in half by a chainsaw wielding magical girl is pretty entertaining.  It was that unforgettable transformation sequence that hooked me though.  Something about watching Ayumu find himself dressed from head to toe in pink frills and lace and fighting a giant lobster just won me over.  Zombie showed, with that first episode, some creative and decent story writing that I just wasn't expecting from this type of show.  There is good banter between the characters and even to my surprise decent drama mixed in here and there.\r\nUnfortunately, the qualityof the writing didn't last. Around halfway through, the show started a descent into the realm of cliched and disappointing.   The comedy that originally made the series shine either devolved into silly jokes or just vanished entirely.  The main villain that eventually gets introduced just isn't appealing.  The fan service gradually becomes more gratuitous and the feel of the show falls into mediocrity.  It's really a shame, when Zombie is at its best there is obviously potential for something unique to grow, but the writing just falls flat in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAlso episode 12... I honestly don't know what to think about that one.  In fact, for all intents and purposes the show basically ends after episode 11.  The last episode is a random pool episode that turns into a who can be the biggest idol competition.  The only reason I can come up with for it existing is just to go all out with fanservice.  There are plenty of swimsuits and skimpy outfits for any who are interested to ogle at.\\n\\n\r\nI can't honestly recommend Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? for most people.  I enjoyed it for what it was and it is only 12 episodes.  Some of which are actually good.  So there isn't any harm in watching even if I think it could have been much better.  At most I would say to watch the first three episodes if you want some good comedy. Or if you want to gratuitous fanservice, just skip to the last episode.  Also watch the airwhale battle and call it good.",

(more fun together right?)\r\nThe story of this serie was great and easy to follow. A zombi/human together with a necromancer, Vampire and Pop idol look a like with a chainsaw. Well...weird things happens in anime so does this one. The story is all about the struggle life of the group with the main zombi character as much in the spot. Story is really well made and just the comedy parts was awesome. We laughalot with my friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was not to great for me. Only the special effect was awesome. I dont really like how the eyes were. And thats my personal opinion. I know some people likes it, i'm not.\\n\\n\r\nIntro and outro was fun and nice music. And the last song of the serie. was kinda emotional. You know what I mean when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were awesome. And great personas. First of all the Zombi main (Aikawa) person. A friendly guy who got killed and reincarnated. A big hearth and well...Clumsy at some moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe necromancer (Hellsythe) is to quiet. But that notebook is just funny. And the thoughts of the male main. Well sometimes a little bit to dirty.\\n\\n\r\nThe pop idol bla bla bla... Just chainsaw girl (Haruna) is one of my favorite girl main person in this serie. She act sometimes like a Tsundere but she is kinda different. For example she likes Aikawa. And is not afraid to kiss him. Funny moments happens alot with her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you want some fan service here she is Seraphim. She has a rude persona and well...She is irritaded how Aikawa is behaving sometimes. But she is also a vampire ninja. A nice person to girls and not a great chef.\\n\\n\r\nOw before I forget (just saw the other main girls). Yoshida the blond girl. And other side then Haruna she is also my favorite. Maby its better for me to dive into the body of Aikawa (hahaha). She nice girl and a good cook. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment for me was just by watching this with my friends. The was alot of fun in this serie. And the genre really worth it. Not much ecchie but good enough. With a overall score of a 7. Good and fun serie to watch if you like zombi, monsters and funny moments.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review,well i think i have picked a good anime to start! first let me give give my feelings for this anime-\r\n\" I am a zombie and a masou shoujo, now i am a worthless piece of trash!!!\"\r\nthis is a speech that almost made me laugh till my stomach hurt!\r\nabout the story- this is a story about a school going boy killed by a serial killer who is recently hunting in the neighborhood!then revived by a necromancer as a zombie! then he encounters a masou shoujo and somehow becomes the masou shoujo himself!later he encounters a vampire ninja,no twoof them!! and one of them suddenly becomes his wife because of his accident kissing! a lonely boy suddenly lives with three girls, oh that makes me jealous!!!!!! but i think in this case i am glad that i ain't in his shoes. They go on living their normal lives( i think normal isn't the right word) and fight megalos,a anti masou shoujo creature. in the middle he fights with the serial killer and later in the series at the end he encounters a fellow zombie who was revived by the necromancer who has a wish of death! then they fight for the necromancer! he defeats him and after that they lived happily ever after!or so it seems! thats the sum of the story. but this anime is far from it!\\n\r\nthe art of this story is pretty good! this a isn't exactly a action type anime but mostly focuses on comedy! i can assure you that this animes comedy is great! there are a little bit of romance no more like few touching scenes which are very beautiful and may bring tears! and last but least echhiness and the male character gets smacked for reason or maybe misfortune all the time which is nothing but hilarious. \\n\r\nthis anime has a beautiful background music in the touching scenes and in the comedy scenes!\\n\r\nThe main male character of this anime is Aikawa Ayumu! He is a highschool boy whose parents lived abroad and sents him weird stuff that he doesn't know!by the way ayumu is a zombie and masou shoujo and a disgusting piece of shit! He is a dumb character who fantasizes about the necromancer being his little sister and a cross-dressing weirdo! but rather than that he is kind-hearted,caring and has what it takes when the time comes. He is willed to protect Eu and wants to have peaceful life with no worries in the world!(that i think never happens to him)\\n\r\nEuclliwood hellscythe is necromancer who revived Ayumu!she also the strongest masou shoujo. She is so powerful that her words can kill anyone. so she wears gauntlets and writes her speeches rather than speaking. She is kind hearted and likes to drink to tea.\\n\r\nHaruna is self proclaimed genius masou shoujo who lost her powers to Ayumu. She is hot headed and a very simple minded person who cant remember anyone other than Ayumu's name and she excels at cooking egg omelets. \\n\r\nSeraphim is a vampire ninja. She is beautiful and has a great figure but not a great personality. she is foul mouthed and a little bit of tsundere character. She likes Tsubamegaeshi secret sword technique, she is skilled in Tsubamegaeshi secret sword technique and her hobby is Tsubamegaeshi secret sword technique. by the her cooking is dangerous than a nuclear weapon.\\n\r\nMaelstrom(real name Yoshida Tonomori) is also a vampire ninja.Unlike Seraphim she has a nice personality.because of a accident kiss with Ayumu she becomes his wife.( according to her clan rule) she tries her very best to cook for Ayumu and she is a clumsy character and her sense of decoration is weird! her name is always mistaken and her favorite speech is \"Don't call me Tomonori\"\\n\r\nthere are also few characters like Oritto,Ayumu's pervert otaku friend, Dai sensei, teacher of haruna's and Sarasvati, a high ranking vampire ninja.\\n\r\nthis anime has a variety of a unique character and they really fits the spot.\\n\r\nThis anime mainly focuses on comedy genre with little bit of action,romance and thriller.In my opinion this anime is great! so i really recommend it!!!!        \\n",

The zombie thing is kinda played out, but what this anime did was just reverse the traditional zombie and make it into a comedic stunt with another played out theme- Magical Girls... or so Magical Girl harem. \r\nThe story gets 7- It was funny, contained some mystery at the beginning and roughly around the end. The plot was decent and it did leave room for seriousness. \r\nThe art-7, it was filled with pretty pretty girls! If anything the anime did well with its artwork on the females.The fight and death scenes were good and a lot of blood. The defeat of the monsters were sparkly and really good-looking. \\n\r\nThe sound-a 6: The only time you hear music is the last episode- which is hilarious and yet beautiful. The background sounds were spot on with the gore, the weapon effects, and the ick sounds of parts being put back together.\\n\r\nCharacters a 7: Multiple characters, funny, added well to the plot, and the silver-haired heroine is soooo cute! You'll just want to hear her voice- and Haruna- is like a hyped time bomb. She's all over the place. Sera- is a bit mean and plays off another well-known and kinda cliche anime theme of ninjas and vampires. Makes you feel sorry for the hero of the story.\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall- good. I would rewatch if I have the time, and it's a good pick-me-up if you just need a laugh or see pretty/cutie girls who oddly enough like to go around without clothes. Makes you think- Is This A Zombie?",

            "content": "I went into this expecting a comedy, and it was pretty good to start. The guy becoming a magical girl was funny, and the excessive fanservice was even forgiveable. The characters were pretty stereotypical harem tropes, though, and it both devolved into a harem anime and dropped in overall quality about halfway through. Of course the plot was nonsense, but what really pissed me off is that even with all its ridiculousness, it tried to take itself seriously.\r\nIf you're going to make a series with a magical girl zombie boy and a vampire ninja as main characters, here's a tip: don't try to take yourselfseriously. It makes it stop being funny, but it sure doesn't make it moving or cool. Some plot developments seriously come out of nowhere, are never explained, and are obviously meant to seem cool or moving, but really just come across as annoying and wannabe edgy.\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time on this one.",

Now this can either be funny hard or hardly funny depending how audience likes his/her anime. Just watching the first episode should give the atmosphere of the whole series.\r\nAlthough there are actions time to time, I still find this anime categorized as \"love comedy\" because the storygravitates towards the male protagonist gaining more female characters' attentions throughout the story without him realizing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, contents are unique and bizarre, but events are somewhat cliche and are expected to be seen in love comedy animes. If you like light-chaotic-random-love-comedy, this is for you, and those who likes serious approach to story line, this might not work for you.",

            "content": "Note: This is one of my works from Sekijitsu\r\nArt\r\nI like how the art portrays each character individually. Sure Sera\u2019s breasts are WAY too big, but when these characters make those kawaii expressions (especially Yuki and Haruna), I can\u2019t say no. The art isn\u2019t too detailed (which I hate), nor is it too simple like Lucky Star. If Zombie had the same art as Lucky Star\u2026 not even I would take this show seriously.\r\nMusic\r\nThe use of the OST in the series is magnificent. The comedic scenes are accompanied by light and up-beat music, giving that extra intensity, while the serious scenes are intensified with great suspension!I certainly love the OP! I love heaps of songs just because they have a complicated guitar or bass riff. With this in mind, I also love the ED because of that enthusiastic dance from Haruna and not-so-enthusiastic dance from Yuu. If you thought that\u2019s the only reason I like the song, you\u2019re wrong. I also love many light and fluffy songs (K-ON! has great examples). Since the ED is one, this also relates to why I love the ED\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it\u2019s not as good as the art and music. Some might even say there is no story. Well although it has a great start, the series does fall down further along the path. I personally don\u2019t mind because the music and art which accompany the story help create great moments anyway. A great story has have a great starting, followed by a structured body, and finally concludes with an ending that will make you go \u201cwow.\u201d Sadly this series doesn\u2019t achieve that in the end. The structure is constant, yet the feel slowly fades and finally dies at episode 12. Plot points need to connect in an orderly way. Kore wa Zombie desu ka is able to achieve this while sticking to the story line. Creators are able to make the events flow the way they want them to flow. Still, because of the story, I admit the amount of wow factor is lacking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI will be honest; I enjoyed this show even if it has a bad story. As long as the story flows and has great character designs and music, I\u2019ll forgive whatever comes. Expectation-wise, I didn\u2019t expect much from this show to start off with. This might be one reason why I was able to enjoy it without really caring about the flaws. So that concludes my overall review on Kore wa Zombie desu ka. I hope you all enjoyed this little review I have come up with. If there are any problems, please comment down below. As for recommendations, I recommend Kore wa Zombie desu ka to those who enjoy comedy, action and some slice-of-life in their anime.",

            "content": "Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?, aka Korezom. Now that's a pretty interesting series. This review may contain spoilers along the way so if you're going to give it a read, do it at your own risk. With that out of the way, I'll admit, the series doesn't do anything to get out of the cliched ecchi harem based comedy/drama action packed anime, with pretty unoriginal characters and the formerly human MC who becomes some sort of a mythological creature. Thing is, most of the main characters fall into the same typo, more or less.\r\nNow, the concept this anime introduced is pretty interesting. Said MC AikawaAyumu becomes a zombie after being murdered by unknown serial killer and revived by overpowered legal loli necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, aka Yuu, (who happens to be a pretty great character, I could say even a rare for a kuudere). Then again, what anime main character doesn't lose his humanity to switch race, with Issei Hyoudou of High School DxD and Ken Kaneki of Tokyo Ghoul being headlines for these types of transformations? Then again, the fact that the former human main character turns into a zombie out of all fictional races is rather unusual, and well, pretty much mocks the concept of a zombie being a mindless creature who can't live unless he eats a human brain. Instead, in Korezom, a zombie is an undead human who can use his body at super speed, strength and healing ability. It pretty much did the whole cliched thing of -boy meets girl, stops being human, starts kicking ass and gets chicks into a harem- differently. At least when referring to the race the main character adopts. Cause if you refer to the harem trophies, they are annoying at worst and boring at best. Especially tsundere magical girl Haruna and borderline yandere vampire-ninja Sera. Also, I must say Ayumu absorbing Haruna's power and getting Masou-Shoujo abilities goes beyond hilarious, especially when he is pretty much forced to use this transformation to defeat monsters since his body, with all the regeneration abilities, is not able to withstand tougher attacks.\\n\\n\r\nAs a character, I must say Ayumu is one of a kind MC. As OP as he can be sometimes, you can't take him seriously when you see him battling monsters while crossdressing as a magical girl, and he's also perverted to a near-Issei level (well, except the sister complex he has for Yuu, and he actually tries to deny it). Still, unlike other main characters, he doesn't lose his head in the battle and go overly emotional or spout cliche crap like \"Imma kick ya ass\" (despite, well, having more reason to do so than many other luckier MCs); and instead shows a serious and sarcastic stance when in battle (when he doesn't whine about his girl outfit, that is). And you could even pity him at times, since he is reduced to a dog in his own household, and constantly subjected to more or less comical bullying from Haruna and Sera. In a comedic way, his fate is quite tragic despite how much of a lucky bastard he is. And I'm not even ironic.\\n\r\nAs for the other characters... Yuu: I see her as an interesting character. Well, being the forced emotionless kuudere that she is, she can at most deadpan or ignore Ayumu's antics, but she doesn't seem to mind his siscon delusions towards her. Cause if she did, she'd write it on paper, duh. Also, I find her the combo of that emotionless face and writing communication kinda cute. Tomonori: Heh, as cliched as the whole \"I'm your wife cause faction custom\" thing, I can't deny that she builds a cute romantic tension between her and Ayumu in trying to fall in love with him (absurd concept but she succeeds -_-). Not to mention her antagonistic moments were badass. Haruna and Sera: I don't even.\\n\\n\r\nStory. Starts with a cliche, but well, a guilty pleasure of mine is that I actually enjoy how the plot goes on from that point. With the crossdressing zombie meeting girls and kicking evil monster Megalo ass until some resemblance of a plot shows up. And this is where the most enjoyable, episode 7, is when Ayumu defeats Kyoko, the serial killer who murdered him, and kills her down to her last life which... he spares! Oh, and it's revealed Kyoko wasn't actually a yanigiri, she was just possessed by an evil spirit who was forcing her to do all that stuff. Great! Then the Evil from the Past arc with Yuu running away and her former apprentice King of the Night, fellow zombie, threatens to burn the world down unless he dies (gotta love this absurdity but hell being undead kinda gets boring). Ayumu's character development is also interesting in the said arc. Ever since that scene when Yuu doesn't take his hand so she flies away instead. Suffering a Disney death while taking a bomb on his head and explodes midair, getting pieces of his body put back together but he's too stuck in a Kanekish mindscape to actually wake up. So Haruna has to invade his subconsciousness and knock some sense into him. Before he goes to have Yuu return to him and kick the shit out of his fellow zombie. Oh well, said zombie gets beaten by Ayumu and his death wish is fulfilled by Yuu (RIP). Then Yuu speaks for the first time and swears to stay with Ayumu forever. Awww...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, well, is as good as a 2011 series could go, and the sound... who even watched this series and heard the soundtrack should actually be rewarded a medal. Enjoyment?...\\n\\n\r\nBesides all the stereotypical stuff, Korezom is actually an enjoyable anime for providing some good comic relief and interesting resemblances of a plot. It's a perfect anime to watch if you run out of ideas.",

Music and art are average, story is poor and doesn't hold up to even basic levels of scrutiny, and there are two likable characters in the whole show. The rest of the main cast is very very very cliche and even their cliches are poorly executed. The supporting cast are even worse and more annoying. For example, and slight spoilers ahead if youre planning on watching the show, the MC beats a bad guy whos killed 11 people 1guardian of the underworld the magical girl teacher comes to pick the baddie up. She then says good thing you didnt kill the baddie because then i would have killed you; THEN threatens him for saying she needs to try harder so her students dont go on serial killing sprees. As a punishment Mrs teacher wanted to give her extra lessons is all.... so the hero that almost died is threatened with death while the serial killer gets extra school work? Every single story thread goes along these lines, all nonsense just to make the MC suffer regardless of if it makes any sense.",

            "content": "Definitely one of the more out there harem ecchi comedy type animes.  I read a bit of the manga, and the anime seems to be a fairly accurate interpretation of the manga except its elaborated on quite a bit.  No clue about how it is compared to the novel yet.  \r\nThe comedy types in this show are a combination of nonsense, harem, violence, and embarrassment comedy.  \r\n-Nonsense meaning they say weird things which make no sense at all\r\n-harem comedy is obviously accidental groping of breasts followed by a kyaa and a swift dismembering\r\n-violence comedy has a lot to do with themain character being a zombie, since the protagonist can't die they don't hold back on anything\\n\r\n-embarrassment comedy being that the main character gets humiliated in front of his classmates a lot in rather extreme fashions.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is alright as I haven't seen them stop introducing core plot throughout the 2 seasons I've seen so far.  It seems like they are really tempted to go the route of ranma 1/2 though and just throw random episodes out there which they have done and seem like they are doing more often.  New harem members seem to be steadily entering the series at about the same rate they do in Sekirei.  \\n\\n\r\nThe arts mediocre, usually very little is animated in every scene.  Its typical shounen art with high quality images, but the animation is fairly weak.  They also take full advantage of the girls to give them super cute scenes which are elaborated on from the manga using really cute art and sound.  Nothing breakthrough about the sound either.  Pretty standard opening and ending music.  \\n\\n\r\nOf course the usual redeeming feature about an ecchi harem story is the characters.  This anime truly does paint a wide array of interesting characters from various walks of life with absolutely bizarre backgrounds and personalities.  Truly this animes most redeeming feature.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall its one of the best ecchi harem animes out there.  I would watch this 15 times over before I even bothered looking at To Love Ru or Rosario Vampire.....",

I started to like this anime as it started with many interesting characters and till the end you will get to see new characters which you will like for sure. This series has amazing artwork and characters, but it lacks the content, story and the enjoyment level is also not good if you compare it with other anime of the same genre.\r\nLet me break out each segment for you-\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nI know many of you will not agree with me,but I think it can be better than this. I would say they build up pretty good, but in the end how they ended the story just irk me. I want to point out some details, but i don't want to  put any spoilers in my review.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is actually pretty good. lots of fan service. :P\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI cannot judge it properly as I am Foreigner, but for me characters voice was a good match.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are pretty awesome character in this series like necromancers, Magicclad girls, Ninja vampires and of-course zombies. The characters are neatly built and each character has their own kick.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show is pretty much enjoyable. The Gags are funny, there may be many cliche you come across but still you will enjoy them. But I was not able to enjoy the show that much because of the story part and also the show may be funny but not Hilarious. There is a pretty much fan service for Ecchi lovers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall guys this is just an average anime, the concept is new and good, but not up to the mark. There is many good anime with the same genre like kill la kill, High School DxD, Angle Beats and many more. You are welcome to disagree, but i think I rated it fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, sorry if there is any mistake in writing as English is not my mother tongue. you are welcome to point out any mistake.",

You watch this series for its non-sensical fun, and you'll enjoy it. Who cares about the inconsistencies with the original zombie mythos when Ayumu is running and crying like a girl in a magical girl outfit while being photographed by people around him with their cellphones.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ecchi stuff, the standard lineup is here.

Sometimes, all it needs is to be just plain fun. After all, an anime's main responsibility is to show the viewer a good time, right? \"Is this a Zombie?\" is a fantastic series, but not because of its story, or its visuals or because of some thoroughly mesmerising soundtrack. No, \"Is this a Zombie?\"'s success lies in delivering one of the funniest anime you could find anywhere.\r\nStory & World(6.5/10):\\n\r\nThe story follows Ayumu Aikawa, a kind-hearted but very unlucky teenage boy who has recently been killed and resurrected as a zombie. Now, he lives with a cute girl named Eucliwood Hellscythe, or Eu for short, a Necromancer with uncontrollable power who brought Ayumu back to life after he was killed by a serial killer. Now, he's attempting to hunt down the killer, in order to make sure nobody else suffers the same fate he did. It's not long before he encounters Haruna, a Magical Garment Girl from another dimension. In a horrible turn of events, he ends up absorbing her powers, forcing him to fight the monstrous Megalos in her place and wear a frilly dress as he does it, while Haruna takes up residence in his house until her powers return. Things get even more complicated when a third girl, a vampire ninja named Seraphim, appears wishing to be the servant of Eu, though since Ayumu has already taken the position, she settles for being Ayumu's instead, though she doesn't act like a servant at ALL. And so begins the misadventures of this incredibly unlikely foursome, as we see both their daily lives and their various dealings with the supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might have guessed, the story does not take itself seriously. There is a massive amount of genre clich\u00e9s here and plenty of moments that go unexplained. The second season in particular is a bit of a mess, introducing a lot of new plot points and not really going anywhere with any of them. There are a few touching moments here and there, however, and the characters are really lovable (more on that later), but overall the story is easily the series' weakest link. \\n\\n\r\nThe world is also relatively unexplored. The most we ever really get told is that it's a 'world full of weird stuff'. There are magic, monsters, vampire ninjas and many other things, but we are only ever really given a basic outline of what these are. It's basically just our world injected with a bunch of random supernatural phenomenon and, ultimately, not particularly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8.5/10):\\n\r\nVisually, \"Is this a Zombie\" looks pretty damn good. The characters are all very well-drawn and the art style is distinct. As I mentioned before, however, the visuals aren't the reason you would watch this series, as there are a few camera problems here and there as well as occasionally stiff animations. It DOES look very good, just not outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is somewhat hit-and-miss. The opening and ending themes are rather forgettable and I skipped them every time. However, there are quite a few good themes to be found in here, particularly \"Play, Seraphim!\". The voice acting, on the other hand, is fantastic. As with most anime, I watched the show dubbed and most of the voices are really good, with all of the actors delivering their lines extremely well. And I would also like to note that this has easily one of the best scripts for an anime I have ever seen, with literally every episode having at least 4 or 5 quote-worthy lines. Overall, the sound is really pleasant on the ears, and one of the anime's greatest strengths.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.5/10):\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, the characters are really lovable. Let's start with Ayumu. From the very first episode, it\u2019s clear that the guy just cannot catch a break and while the stuff he goes though is hilarious, you can\u2019t help but feel for him at the same time. Hell, in the pre-opening scene, he gets hit by a car, is sent flying through several trees, loses all of his clothes and ends up buck-naked in front of two screaming girls, all because he was trying to save a cat from being run over. His luck doesn\u2019t get much better from there, being forced to dress as a little girl on several occasions among other things, and yet in spite of all of it, he remains a kind person throughout and doesn\u2019t let any of it slow him down for long, which you can\u2019t help but respect him for. Overall, he is a great lead character, especially with his constant snarky quips, which at times could give Kyon a run for his money.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if I were to pick a standout character for the series, it would have to be Eucliwood, who is also one the biggest reasons to watch the series along with the humour. We learn early on that her magic is extremely powerful to the point that it activates whenever she says anything, and causes her serious head pain whenever it activates. As a result, she has to suppress her emotions and communicates solely using a notebook. While the things she writes are fairly simple, usually referring to her appetite, Ayumu has a habit of interpreting them in a perverted way, having various fantasies about her. There are many of these throughout the series, and as an added bonus, the voice actor for the imaginary Eus is different in every episode. As for Eu herself, while seemingly emotionless, she soon proves herself to be the nicest character in the entire series. How nice is she? The events of the series began when she used her powers to resurrect Ayumu as a zombie, taking on the pain of being stabbed in the process, when she had only known him for a couple of hours at the most! Beyond that, she is incredibly cute. I mean, just look at her! All of this comes together to create a really unique and lovable character, and she is one of the absolute highlights of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two residents of Ayumu\u2019s household are the aforementioned Haruna and Seraphim. Unlike Ayumu and Eu, they are both pretty big jerks, who generally treat Ayumu like dirt in spite of the fact that he let them into his home. While they do help around the house, normally with cooking (which Haruna is very good at but Sera stinks at), they are also very demanding and rude, particularly Sera, who constantly calls Ayumu a maggot on basis of him being a perverted zombie. Thankfully, they both loosen up notably over the first season, and by the end I would say I actually preferred Haruna to Ayumu.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Besides Sera, there are two other vampire ninjas encountered throughout the series- Maelstrom, who comes from a rival clan of Sera\u2019s, and Sarasvati, Sera\u2019s superior. There\u2019s also Ariel, Haruna\u2019s teacher who is a serious oddball and almost disturbingly protective of her students. The problem is that, while most of them are likable enough, they don\u2019t really do all that much or just don\u2019t show up very often. One character in particular is introduced in the last two episodes and doesn\u2019t really contribute anything other than some tasteless fanservice, though your mileage may vary on that one. The villains are unexpected, but do add some decent flavour into an otherwise senseless story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nThis is definitely not a category the series falls short in. With the gut-bustlingly funny script and slapstick humour, \u201cIs this a Zombie!\u201d remains an incredibly enjoyable experience from start to finish, especially when complimented by the awesome action scenes. However, there are notably less action scenes in the second season, admittedly making it a bit of a disappointment when compared to the first season. That\u2019s not to say the second season isn\u2019t satisfactory- it\u2019s just that I feel they could have done a bit more with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\u201cIs this a Zombie?\u201d is about as absurd and inconsistent as anime can get, but it\u2019s very rare that you\u2019ll find an anime that is THIS side-splittingly funny, and the lovable characters more than make up for the stale plot. If you\u2019re the kind of person who watches anime solely for a compelling story, then this is not the series for you. But if you just want to have a good old laugh or unwind after a long day, then you need not look any further than the misadventures of Ayumu and his friends.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n6.5+8.5+9+8.5+9=41.5/50=8.3/10",

            "content": "I'm sorry to anyone who likes this show, this review of is this a Zombie? is certainly not directed to fans of the show, but Is this a Zombie might just be the worst anime I've ever watched in quite a while. But this is just my opinion, and I hope anyone who likes the show does not take my opinion on this anime too seriously.\r\nFirst of all, I think this anime actually had a good premise at the beginning. I mean, after the silly first episode where we are given the background for our main hero, a zombie cross dressing magical boy, we arethan introduced to a Ninja Vampire Girl, and this Ninja Vampire Girl wants to fight our Zombie Cross Dressing Magical Boy. And they do!\\n\r\nAt first I thought this would kind of be like a Weird Super Human fighting tournament where these weird characters fight each other and something about that is actually really original and creative. We see this Zombie Magical Boy use his Zombie state to gain an advantage in the fight such as severing his arm and using it as a projectile. It's things like this that show the shows true potential and really makes me wish it was better than it actually was.\\n\r\nAnd after that fight the show completely drops it's initial concept for a murder mystery that is really weak and ends like it was some kind of bad memory and than the final episodes are really bad. It's some kind of concert and there are some bad singing. I think the voice actors had some fun but I really don't think there was a lot fun left for the viewers.\\n\r\nI think Is this a Zombie was just not sure what it wanted to be, so at the end it copped out and did whatever it wanted.\\n\r\nI'm not sure what a lot of people see in this anime but for me it was a good concept gone sour. If you like this anime, I'm sure it was probably a lot of fun for you, but for me I'm sorry but I didn't like this anime. I liked the first few episodes but after that it gone down, down, down till I gave it a thumbs down.",

However, fate chooses who shall be thrown into the fray and learn these secrets, and there is nothing you can do about it.\" ~ Aikawa Ayumu\r\nI think this quote best describes how Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? (Later abbreviated \"Zombie Desu ka\") unravels on. Ayumu gets killed by a serial killer that is at large. From thispoint on his life starts to change rapidly as he is revived and turned into a zombie by a cute girl who is a necromancer. After this he sets out to find the one who killed him in life and avenge himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this Zombie Desu ka seem to have every type of personality there is, which in my opinion keeps the anime from ever getting boring; including a cute girl who doesn't speak, but writes what she says on paper.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance this anime my look like one of those normal, run of the mill supernatural anime, but you will be quite surprised at how the Zombie Desu ka plays out. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is quite good, giving not to shabby, but not too often ecchi shots but also doing an excellent job of blood colouring. I'd say it's just about right for your typical modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who was previously reluctant to watch this anime, I'd recommend this to anyone who loves the supernatural - this anime practically has everything supernatural.",

            "content": "Okay I want to say right off the bat that to enjoy what this anime has to offer you have to, like my friend always says: \"Leave you're brain at the front doorstep\". You can't go analyzing everything or else you really won't enjoy it at all. Sure the type of characters arn't very \"original\", and the fan service can be excesive.\r\n But honestly, there arn't a lot of \"original\" anime out there anymore now is there? I can honestly say that other then Puella Magi and maybe Steins Gate, the newer anime are pretty much all \"unoriginal\". Now that I made that clear Ican start with my review.\\n\\n\r\n So the story follows a young highschooler named Ayumu Aikawa (actually a sunlight fearing zombie) who's put through all sorts of situations with his friends Eucliwood Hellscythe (a necromancer), Haruna (a maso shojo), Seraphim (a ninja vampire) and Yuki Yoshida or Mael Strom (a ninja vampire). Fighting both Megalo's (giant animal monsters) and even others like themselves.\\n\\n\r\n So too sum up it's a harem/parody with a little Shounen adventure kind of twist in there. Because it's a harem I had to give it's story the rating I did because it's a harem, plain and simple. But personaly I liked the artwork because it fit it's characters and story nicely. It was a change from the artstyle that every anime seems to share now-a-days. \\n\\n\r\n Now for the characters, personaly, and my judgement might be clouded with old age but, I loved the characters! Not enough for a perfect score because I to have standards when watching anime, but still. The tsundere was a masou shojo with a chainsaw! Not a useless mage like Louise, or a magical samurai *ahem* Flame Haze like Shana. Unlike other Harems the main protagonist could actually pull his weight in a fight unlike Tsukune Aono from Rosario+Vampire or Yuuto Amakawa from Omamori Himari.\\n\\n\r\n So what I'm trying to say is in what the characters lake in depth they gain in attachement. You get attached to them and learn to love them during the story no matter how \"unoriginal\" they are. They aint no Goku or Haruhi, but they're still entertaining and loveable never the less!\\n\\n\r\n Even if it is \"unoriginal\"! If you can look me in the eye and tell me that you didn't chuckle when you saw that panty shot of Ayumu in a maso shojo, then I'll be really surprised. I recommend this series to anyone willing to take a break from all the hardcore series', to relax, have a good laugh and enjoy the anime for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nIt's no Naruto or Bleach but hell, it's to DIE for XD!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

You'll get so much more enjoyment out of it if you just take it for what it is.\r\nSecondly, It's a great take on the Shounen/Harem Hybrid.\r\nThree, despite it clearly mocking itself, there are some beautiful moments...mostly during montages over the group bonding.\r\nNext, the intro music rocks!\r\nLastly, I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole thing.",

            "content": "Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?! follows the recently deceased Ayumu as he begins life as a zombie, living with Eu, the necromancer who revived him, Haruna, a magical girl, and Sera, a vampire ninja. Ayumu soon absorbs Haruna\u2019s powers and becomes a magical girl himself. Our hero\u2019s party battles fleets of flying whales, crazy women, giant stuffed animals and golems using the power of a magical girl\u2019s chainsaw, leaves, and ramen.\r\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that most of this show doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever. But who cares? Making sense is boring. And Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka is certainly not boring. There werea few episodes in the middle where the show attempted to be serious and make sense (it actually didn\u2019t do too bad, either) but fortunately the creators abandoned this endeavor and went back to the ridiculousness that made the show so much fun to watch in the first place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOne thing which I found that the show does particularly well at is combining the plot (such as it is) with comedy. Anime often have a tendency to focus only on comedy or only on the plot exclusively, and they\u2019ll often end with a \u201cclimax\u201d of sorts which is entirely serious and drains all the fun out of the show. Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?! does an excellent job avoiding this: they even have the main antagonist tell a completely non-sensical joke and relive all the tension right at the peak of the climax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters start out seeming annoying: Haruna has a cheerful, genius-level idiocy and refuses to wear pants; Sera is only capable of cussing; and Tomonori takes the role of the young \u201cwife\u201d. But all of them eventually grew on me as they played more of a role in the show. Harun\u2019s genius became more idiotic, Sera\u2019s disses improved from the initially generic insults to ones more specific to Ayumu and the situation, and Tomonori was sat on by a humongous stuffed animal and transformed into a golem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend giving this show a watch if you\u2019re looking for some brainless humor.\\n\\n\r\nps: this review is NOT writen by ME. but i agre with everything this review says. so i decided to post it",
