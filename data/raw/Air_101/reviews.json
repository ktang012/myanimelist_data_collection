            "content": "Air\r\n~ The 1000th Summer...~\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nAir the story of Yukito Kunisaki, a young man carrying on his family's journey to find the \"girl in the sky\" and free her from a curse. Stumbling upon a sleepy coastal town, he meets three girls: Misuzu Kamio, Kana Kirishima, and Minagi Tohno. He comes to spend more and more time in the town, living at the Kamio residence with Misuzu and her adopted mother.\r\nSome may know, others may not, but Air is based off an ero visual novel by KEY. Thus, each of the main heroines (Misuzu, Kana, and Minagi) each have different scenarios to explore. The short animetries its best to explore each scenario, but since it was so short, it felt somewhat rushed and the arcs of Kana and Minagi felt somewhat detached. Thus why the story only gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I still rated it so high because the main story (the one of Misuzu) is simply beautiful. It's original, fresh, tear-jerking, and just beautifully done. I'll admit it, I cried at at the end. \\n\\n\r\nMost consider Air to be confusing when they watch and don't understand the Kanna arc. I myself got it the first time, but if you don't, just watch it over -- you won't regret it. Most understand it the second time and come to appreciate the series much more.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nKyoto Animation, the company that animated Air, did a stunning job as always. The scenery felt alive like I could just step in, everything flowed smoothly and they're weren't any inconsistencies. Air is set in the summer, and like to watch parts of it in winter when I feel cold -- that's how real it feels. The clouds and skies in particular were stunning, and kudos to them for that, since the sky and flying are important symbols of Air. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nI love, love, love the opening theme to Air (&quot;Tori no Uta&quot; [The Bird's Song] by Lia). It's beautiful and the mood and lyrics reflects all the emotions and events in the series. The ending theme (&quot;Farewell Song&quot; also done by Lia) as well complimented the story and plot wonderfully. The BGM was nicely done, giving off the perfect aura for whatever was going on when it was played. Kudos to the voice actors, also -- they did terrific work on their roles. The character's emotions were conveyed convincingly and they spoke with such emotion it could tear your heart out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in Air were all alive and I felt for each and every one's issues. The designs on them were varied and I never was annoyed by any character in particular (a nice change for once). However, the reason this rating isn't higher, is because since the anime was so short most characters did not receive the development they were in need of.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nI gave Air an &quot;enjoyment&quot; rating of 10. I don't let this affect my score, however, since it's really a personal thing -- someone who isn't a romance, drama, supernatural sort of thing probably won't like this. However, I loved Air every moment, from beginning to end. If you're looking for a nice romance with a touch of supernatural fantasy and great characters, I highly recommend Air.",

            "content": "If you&rsquo;re into drama and supernatural anime, then Air is for you. I actually quite liked it, in fact, I like it better than Kanon 2006. There were similarities between the two, like for example, I though the two series had similar characters. Yukito was a lot like Yuichi and Misuzu&rsquo;s story and predicament was a lot like Makoto&rsquo;s. Air&rsquo;s story is also made up of character arcs. I think Air has 3 or 4 character arcs and each arc focuses on one major character at a time.\r\nIt was a sad anime. The scene when Misuzu was crying out &ldquo;mama!&rdquo; has been embedded into myanime memories. While it was sad sometimes, there were a lot of funny scenes too. In fact, compared to Kanon 2006, I think Air is the funnier one. Air had a more supernatural theme compared to Kanon as well. Just wait and see what happens in episode 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just great. Misuzu is just adorable. I love it when she goes &ldquo;gao&rdquo;. Her story is also the saddest out of all the characters. If you&rsquo;re into cute anime animals like me, you&rsquo;ll probably like Potato the dog. Don&rsquo;t ask &ndash; just see for yourselves and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean. Yukito is great too. He&rsquo;s sarcastic, manly, witty and likable like all the other KyoAni leads. He is a lot like Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Yuichi from Kanon 2006. \\n\\n\r\nThey were so much alike I thought Yukito was also played by Tomokazu Sugita, but in fact Yukito was played by Daisuke Ono, who was Koizumi Itsuki of another KyoAni series, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I recognized Tomoko Kawakami&rsquo;s voice as Misuzu right away too, since I loved her work as Sayuri of Kanon 2006. She made Misuzu even more adorable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because it&rsquo;s KyoAni, the animation was just stellar. There&rsquo;s no arguing about that. Watching Air was pleasing to the eyes as well, because the scenes were very delicate and serene. The animation was also very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I would have to say that it&rsquo;s a lot similar to Kanon 2006 once again, especially the BGM. The difference is that I liked the music of Air more, because it was less dreary and it complimented Air perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI also have to note that I like the theme of Air TV, which is the importance of having a family. All of the characters are very close to their family members and you&rsquo;ll realize that if you watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this is one of the best KyoAni series I&rsquo;ve seen so far. I recommend this to everyone, even to those who don&rsquo;t watch a lot of dramatic/supernatural anime. If the story doesn&rsquo;t work for you, the visuals will.",

            "content": "Air is an anime series, with a great batch of characters to go with a beautiful and heart-breaking story however it can be a difficult story for some to follow. ^_^\r\nFrom the beginning it is pretty easy to tell that the show originated from an &ldquo;eroge / visual novel&rdquo;; with the ordinary guy coincidently meeting a girl that would change his life. Air is an anime with a very weird concept which can be pretty difficult to comprehend to begin with. The story basically follows Yukito, the male protagonist who gets to know three girls, each of them having something mysterious and peculiar about themand their past. It seems that they all are linked in some way to &ldquo;the girl in the sky&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s something they eventually discover. The problem is that behind all the excellent drama lies a very confusing story that can leave anyone thinking &ldquo;where the heck is this going?&rdquo; Yet the show still remains great to watch throughout, plus the 2 amazing OAVs are a bit of an extra.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is the best thing about this show as the story only comes alive with the spectacular visuals that are always on display. The character models are okay, with the cute girls having the typical &ldquo;moe&rdquo; look anime fans are used to. The environment is where the animation truly shines, with an incredible amount of detail put into every aspect and object.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the music doesn&rsquo;t really do much for the show and is barely even noticeable. At least it has a decent opening and ending theme song. Thanks to &ldquo;Kyoto Animation&rdquo; (the same company later responsible for Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon and Full Metal Panic!) the animation quality of the show remains the strongest aspect and can easily overshadow every other aspects, including the confusing storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a really interesting, short anime, which can be difficult to understand from the beginning but it improves as more is revealed later on. It always remains very emotional throughout, but the voice actors could have done a better job. So in the end, this can only be recommended to the most open minded romance anime fan or someone whose a fan of other KyoAni works, but I must warn you that this series will get fairly depressing.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Air is a rather peculiar and unique anime to say the least, it\u2019s indubitably one of Kyoto Animation\u2019s most inventive and ingenious series to date. This evidently should come as no surprise since this is an adaptation of a prized and cherished visual novel made by the adept and adroit studio known as Key, a subsidiary of Visual Art\u2019s.\r\nAir is an anime that pertains to a select breed of anime that strive to relay a considerably greater amount of occurrences and revelations to the viewer than one would reasonably anticipate out of a mere half season series. It\u2019s exceptionally high compared to what one ofits banal kindred would habitually consist of. Unfortunately, due to this ambitious and perilous tactic, the series suffers some notable as well as essential drawbacks, and it conspicuously shows it.\\n\\n\r\nYet despite the overwhelming plethora of considerable limitations that certainly should have been excluded from the very beginning regardless of the reasoning, this series still astonishingly manages to attain greatness, albeit to a certain degree. \\n\\n\r\nThough I obliged to address the concept to my fellow viewers that contradictory and disparate to the bulk of anime in existence, this particular series is very special in regard to that, based on what your own personal preferences are for what you seek in anime, will determine your individual impressions of the quality of Air.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who are compelled and oblige only specific aspects within a series to be adequate and efficient, then Air will absolutely satisfy you to the fullest extent, since after all this is indeed a very captivating anime. \\n\\n\r\nThemes: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne unrecognized and unsigned theme that is extant in Air is undeniably mystery, though this is inadvertent rather than actually deliberate, and is very detrimental to the development of the plot. The constant sense of aggravating bewilderment significantly hinders your level of cognition, but fortunately isn\u2019t quite to the unbearable extent of being imperious though. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless it still wistfully manages to prevail over and detract from the strong points of the series, resulting in an inadvertently jumbled and convoluted conclusion that leaves you somewhat perplexed, making you wonder what the main point(s) genuinely were.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was rather subtle though providentially not quite tenuous, it was very heartwarming and rousing, without incorporating any sense of archetypical sensuality (aka fan service). It\u2019s verily admirable how the romance was quite effectively and flawlessly executed in such a manner, considering Air was twain an adult visual novel as well as an eroge. \\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life is prevalent throughout the entire series, though predominantly integrated into the introduction and opening episodes. Despite the profusion of chaos, pandemonium and tragedy, as well as melancholy ambiance that prevails throughout the entire duration, slice of life still acquires a fitting place in Air, and deserves admiration for accomplishing such a feat.\\n\\n\r\nEvery Key adaptation acquires their impressive and majestic artistic, as well as imaginative excellence from the supernatural aspects that are incorporated into them, and Air is indubitably no exception to this inclination. However ironically this element of Air is what delivers the gradual and continuous sense of befuddlement, especially nearing the bizarre conclusion. If only the supernatural elements would have been utilized adequately and appropriately. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happens when you consolidate a rather comprehensive and intricate novel into only an incompatible half season adaptation, the inept result is merely an insufficient and convoluted anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the supernatural elements, Air\u2019s drama is virtually impeccable, no imperative flaws exist whatsoever. There is a bountiful variety of absolute awe-inspiring and defining heartbreaking as well as heartwarming moments that you will remember forever. No matter the magnitude of any particular predicament or occurrence, it\u2019s repeatedly presented in a glamorous and charismatic style.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again there is yet another theme is extant within Air that is queerly unrecognized for obscure reasoning, comedy. The comedy is tenuous throughout, but is very mollifying and is effective at alleviating, in addition to counteracting the gradual escalating climatic revelations being discerned by the protagonist(s).\\n\\n\r\nMain Points/Messages: 6\\n\\n\r\nConstructing an adequate review for Air\u2019s vague and indeterminate main points is a rather onerous challenge to confront, though I will do my utmost to reach that feat since I feel this anime deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nAir is very similar and akin to my previous anime review in regard to that, the main points are addressed in an evasive and indirect manner. It requires a considerable amount of attentiveness to notice them all, since their conferred abruptly and rather erratically. The reasoning for utilizing them in such an outlandish and audacious manner is enigmatic to me, and is anyone\u2019s guess. Likely the origin of this predicament is that numerous impolitic and imprudent alterations were required in order to adapt Air into only a half season, and quite frankly, Kyoto Animation definitely dropped the ball in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThough a profusion of avid fans of this adaptation and Kyoto Animation will indubitably loathe me intensely for stating this and will try their utmost to dispute and disprove this, there is absolutely no motive or even purpose for this faulty as well as negligent execution of addressing the main points/messages of the plot. Surely KyoAni could\u2019ve done more if they truly aspired to make this series greater, why they seemingly chose to neglect this notion and not give this exceptional adaptation the diligence it merited, we\u2019ll never know.\\n\\n\r\nPutting the flaws aside, the essential messages addressed through the dialogue occurring adjacent to climatic scenes are exceptional and extraordinary, regardless of the execution. The supernatural elements incorporated into the main points make it all the more glamorous and elegant, not to mention fascinating as long as you can tolerate a lack of thorough understanding and attentive constantly.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d be delighted to discuss in extensive detail each individual main point presented but I will refrain from revealing spoilers if possible, in accordance with the site\u2019s updated rules. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself as I\u2019ve previously stated is excessively variegated and convoluted, you simply won\u2019t wholly comprehend everything that transpires throughout its duration. Still the exiguous story somehow administers a sense of adequate uniformity and superb elegance, it\u2019s as if the series itself was unwilling and reluctant to allow itself to fall to the depths of ruin. Air is truly superlative and inspirational considering that this anime still managed to retain a compelling as well as distinguished story, despite the plethora of unjust limitations enacted upon its inception.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s meritorious and quite impressive how the voice actors implemented such a gratifying and exquisite performance with the script they were constrained to work with. Each individual character was very pragmatic and unique, absolutely no archetypes extant in Air whatsoever. They all are first-class examples of exemplary characters, vibrant, astute, and dynamic, they virtually resemble real homo sapiens. Overall the pristine quality of the characters is on par with other notable Key anime adaptations. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nConsidering Air was released in 2005, it\u2019s very alluring and angelic to say the least. The landscapes portrayed were ordinary yet hypnagogic, and very radiant. The character animations were aberrant without being disproportionate to be more appealing or to conform to a particular viewer type. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actor\u2019s well, voices themselves were adapted to absolute perfection for the characters they represented, truly magnificent performances executed throughout the entire cast. The general sound effects were adequate and alluring, in addition to being very well balanced. Another opulent as well as sumptuous aspect about Air was the imaginative and absolute breathtaking music present within every individual episode. It\u2019s quintessential for delivering the tone for the series, and does so flawlessly. The OST for Air is certainly one of the best I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s a true personal treasure to possess. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite the abundance of ridicule and bantering I\u2019ve bestowed upon this anime, it still was a very outstanding and accomplished series, despite how much it unfortunately simply couldn\u2019t achieve due to its design limitations. The auxiliary and subsidiary aspects are genuinely what sustained the quality and more importantly are what luckily sustained Air\u2019s virtue in addition to sophisticated excellence that its novel consisted of. This is certainly a distinguishing and adept anime, especially considering the unjust alterations enacted upon it, with a very imaginative, inventive, as well as ingenious plot that any anime fan should watch regardless of its aggravating drawbacks.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated, will gladly and readily listen to any comments and opinions of my reviews as to better future reviews. These reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not to merely state my impressions of it just for fun, thanks!",

            "content": "To say the least, Air is definitely one of the more unique anime made by Kyoto Animation. Air is based off one of Key\u2019s better known visual novels. However, compared to the other Key adaptations made by KyoAni, Air strives to do a lot more, in quite a few ways.\r\nLike I\u2019ve said, even with its limited half-season length, Air certainly doesn\u2019t lack content, with quite a complex plot. And seriously, the bare-bones ideas behind Air are fantastic \u2013 extremely thought-provoking and intriguing. In all honesty, Air certainly could have become a masterpiece, in all dimensions. \r\nUnfortunately, Air strives to achieve a little bit too much.And what I mean by this is the vast amount of content that really doesn\u2019t assist in developing the story in the slightest. The overall focus of the story seems too unclear, as relatively unimportant information is given way too much significance. With quite a few other minor issues, Air suffers from quite a few obvious flaws, and some less notable problems. I\u2019d like to say that it\u2019s a \u2018minor train wreck\u2019, but that would be slightly too harsh. (Do note that I have not seen the movie or the visual novel at the time of writing this.)\\n\\n\r\nBut before I delve too far into the story, I\u2019ll admit that the production values (animation, art, sound) absolutely amazing. Not surprisingly (considering the title Air), the sky and the overall landscape are fantastically done. The story itself takes place in a relatively quiet, rural area, and the scenery normally not seen in urban cities are beautifully drawn and animated. These vibrant backgrounds give Air a sense of elegance not quite present in other anime. Combined with the concept of angel-like winged beings, it provides Air with a very suitable atmosphere to develop the story on. Character motion, for the most part, is also very fluid and realistic. Of course, the characters also come with KyoAni\u2019s typical \u2018huge chins\u2019. Fortunately, this isn\u2019t as exemplified to make the character anatomy look disproportional, compared to for example Toei\u2019s Kanon 2002. Considering this was released in 2005, in this sense it\u2019s certainly a great work of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, for the most part, also supplement the overall atmosphere for the story. To say the least, both the opening and the ending are beautiful songs fitting for an \u2018angel-like\u2019 (I\u2019ll probably be using this term a lot) anime like Air. Particularly the ending \u2013 titled Farewell Song, it brings a nice, calm sense of closure. Similar things can be said about the background music throughout the episodes. The voice actors also voiced their respective characters amazingly; each different voice was easily distinguishable, and brought out the character\u2019s personality in an intriguing way.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite its high production values, the story of Air suffers from a lot of inherent issues. To start off, the side characters\u2019 arcs. This may be slightly subjective, but in all honesty, the two character arcs (Minagi and Kano) serve no inherent purpose to the plot. I never particularly liked this \u2018arc-oriented\u2019 style of storytelling, but the problems of that sort of writing are much too prominent to overlook here. I don\u2019t think Minagi or Kano made a single appearance after the first seven episodes (aside from the recap episode). Now, I probably could have disregarded this if the other two characters\u2019 interactions actually assisted in developing the main arc. But they dont. The first two arcs contribute too little to no meaningful purpose. Although the main arc (Misuzu) is somewhat developed in the first seven episodes, upon careful inspection you\u2019ll realize that almost all of the development with Misuzu and Yukito occurs when they\u2019re alone. Practically, most of episodes two through seven could be removed, and the story would be still comprehendible as it is now. I haven\u2019t watched the movie yet, but since it doesn\u2019t focus on other character arcs, I would probably prefer the movie. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the last recap episode serves little to no purpose in the story. Following up from before, it almost seems as if they included the last episode to deceive the watcher from thinking the other characters were sidelined. And if there were a choice (as there is here), logistically speaking it would make much more sense to recap over the main arc instead, since much of the important content appeared in the main arc (not to mention it was somewhat confusing and puzzling to understand).\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me back to my main point of Air putting too much emphasis on the wrong things. If the producers had enough of a budget to even include a recap episode, why not spend an extra episode for the main arc? Similar things can be said about the side arcs. With the main arc already cramped as it is, it would make sense to do so. Compared to Kanon and Clannad, the visual novel for Air is significantly shorter, so the producers certainly could have fit Air into a 13-episode season and have it become a masterpiece, if it weren\u2019t for the wrong emphases.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Air isn\u2019t all just a train-wreck. At the very least, for the most part the drama is pretty well done, despite a slightly dysfunctional plot; the drama is quite realistic. The slice-of-life portion of the anime is also quite good (not considering the first two character arcs), with sensible development and a decent introduction to the main characters. Also, considering that the visual novel was an eroge, there\u2019s almost no fanservice or anything of the sort. There\u2019s also surprisingly little romance, which actually helps the plot.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the most controversial part of Air is certainly the writing. The writers of Air took \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d to a completely new level. There are so many subtle references that the watcher may even become overwhelmed. From what I can tell, many people dislike Air because it\u2019s confusing. Indeed, it\u2019s definitely confusing, especially if it\u2019s the first time watching it. It\u2019s highly recommended to watch the main arc multiple times, just to catch all the plot references you may have missed. Like many others, I found it quite confusing the first time through. But it\u2019s very intriguing. Again, it\u2019s very elegant how all the plot elements are introduced. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of time (due to improper emphases), it turned out more like a train wreck instead of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters (disregarding the fact that I find no purpose in the first half of the show), they\u2019re quite varied and interesting. The stereotypical characters don\u2019t exist in Air, each character with a unique personality. The characters also have realistic emotions, and their actions have meaningful purpose. \\n\\n\r\nAs for my enjoyment, I honestly was ready to drop the show around seven episodes in, just because the first two character arcs were that dull and uninteresting. But fortunately, it does become more thought-provoking and intriguing further in. It\u2019s very imaginative, and the supernatural elements and elegant atmosphere certainly assist in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, KyoAni had a great foundation for Air, but unfortunately, through emphasis on the wrong things, the initially superb ideas became a minor train-wreck. Depending on your preferences, you may or may not find Air to be intriguing. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the scores:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so if you so wish, please leave me some comments! Any constructive feedback is greatly appreciated.\\n",

            "content": "When I was told by one of my friends that everybody should see Air at least once in their lifetimes because it was so good, how could I refuse. This was a person I trusted and who introduced me to Ghost In The Shell. WOW.. Wasn't he wrong. A lot of people have given Air rave reviews, but I found it to be boring and at times, down right annoying.\r\nI found the story slow, repetitive and predictable. The major \"Twists\" could be seen from a mile away. The best parts of the story were the short and sweet subplots and flashbacks which I must admit,were quite entertaining. But the main story of Misuzu really just annoyed me.\\n\\n\r\nI did think the overall art work in the series was good, it's not my normal taste in style but I thought it was cute and worked well, though some of the characters did seem a little underdrawn, even unfinished, but I liked it, it was a pleasurable change to the perfect well rounded style we tend to see everywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters overall were well presented and all had distinctive interesting personalities. Unfortunately Misuzu annoyed the hell out of me, her annoying voice, bad habbits, The fact that she had a mental age at least 7 years prior to her physical age, and overall demeanor were so bad that it overshadowed the rest of the good characters and made them unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing I feel I need to say about the characters is Potato, This quirky little puppy is reason alone to sit through the 13 episodes of crap. You are much better off just typing his name into a youtube search and watching the little clips they have of him.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the 4th or 5th episode watching this Anime became more like work than a passtime, the only reason I watched it through was that my friend was so convinced that it was the greatest thing ever, I assumed that somewhere something happened that made things fall into place and I'd start to enjoy it. Unfortunately this was only a pipe dream.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't recomend this anime. Though to some people it must have more meaning or appeal than it did to me, as it has many many other rave reviews.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do decide to pursue this anime, I wish you luck.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I can be known for despising moe with the pure unbridled passion of a thousand blazing suns. BUT! I thought it only fair to explain why I hate it with a review of possibly the best show that moe has to offer up. \u201cSo, why the bile, JesuOtaku, what\u2019s wrong with the heartwarming moe story?\u201d you may ask. You may not have asked that nicely, but whatever. \r\nWell, before I get into that, I should probably praise all the things Air does right that make it by far my favorite moe title. Don\u2019t get too excited, that\u2019s likelooking in a dirt pail for me and picking out a \u201cfavorite\u201d worm to use as bass bait. \\n\\n\r\nAir is emotionally a rewarding experience. Unlike in most moe shows, the other characters actually express Misuzu\u2019s trademark moe quirks: the mental retardation, animal noises, strange tastes, and clumsiness, to be really weird and cause for real concern instead of just finding them charming. This makes her character more accessible, and on the whole the characters in Air are relatable enough to make the emotional gut-busters of the conclusion truly gut-busting. The story is emotionally honest, raw and unflinching, and will have many individuals clawing for their Kleenex when they least expect it. I was genuinely touched by Air\u2019s conclusion, and my heart is a dried brown potpourri ball fit only to spice up the lavatories of a state penitentiary.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Air is smashingly well-animated, something enthusiasts of Kyo-Ani have come to expect, as they produced the famous Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya among other girl-aimed shows with the budget and finesse usually reserved for boy-aimed shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is oddly intricate, usually light, feathery orchestral ballads that never overtake the action onscreen, but flow underneath it subtly enough to work well, and the same can be said of the fluffy opener and closer. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in both languages is sufficient, with moments of greatness. The three main roles are cast nigh perfectly in the dub, with Luci Christian making an incredible star turn as Haruko, as if I didn\u2019t like her enough as an actress, her work here is phenomenal and as I said, Vic Mignogna and Monica Rial sound born to play Yukito and Misuzu respectively, never missing a beat. The rest of the cast is fairly average to melodramato-bad, but you know what, they aren\u2019t important. \\n\\n\r\nHow could I possibly say the other characters aren\u2019t important?\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI must, for I must bring out the ugly stick now. Yeah, I was moved by this story, but that\u2019s because Air basically planted its petite well-animated foot up my backside and shoved me on my face, which of course just watered up from the abuse. You MUST turn your brain off to think this is a good story. It would be vile enough with the number of badly written platitudes that pop up now and again, but the plot, no matter how you slice it, is CONTRIVED and MANIPULATIVE, and therefore, so is the emotion that you feel when you watch it. The other girls never serve any purpose to the main conflict, in fact, I want someone to messagel me and tell me WHAT purpose they honestly served at ALL except to serve the schoolgirl fetish population. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I went there, because moe is Freudian. It is created innocent so the male viewers won\u2019t feel bad fantasizing about the nonexistent fanservice that is fed to us through arbitrary tragedy rather than panty shots. I know there are women that enjoy it and also men that enjoy it in a non-dirty fashion, but that\u2019s not what it was created for, you bet your sweet potatoes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters have an inexplicable tragic past or terminal disease that is usually tied to the supernatural and rarely has anything to do with the main idea of the story, if there even was one to begin with. Air tries to have a point, but only obtains one in the relationship between Haruko and Misuzu in the very end that I sorely wish had been the focus of the entire show instead of the typical boring boy learning about helpless girls in town pattern that proved pointless when all was said and done. That\u2019s also a staple of the hentai games these shows came from... \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, all Air really does is exploit your tear ducts without giving you a reason as to why anything happens, besides the words \u201cmagic,\u201d \u201cgods,\u201d and \u201cdestiny,\u201d which I will follow with the words \u201cdeus ex machina.\u201d And also the words \u201cscrew that.\u201d If I\u2019m weepy at the end of something, I want it to be because the story meant something to me, because I learned something about the characters, maybe even about life, if that\u2019s not too heavy to consider. I don\u2019t want it to be because, yes, I was sucker-punched by pretty art, pretty music, and good acting pasted on a plot with all the finesse of a bad fanfiction written by that fetish guy I mentioned earlier. You know who you are. Go ahead, give me a good reason WHY there are so many girls near death or madness in this show, so I can stop beating this poor dead horse and let it gallop back to its home on the set of Days of our Lives! I recommend this to moe fans, really I do. After that, I recommend you click off this review and scan your TV for Lifetime channel where you will find live-action versions of the well-written drama presented in Air.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a beautiful title where the tears and angst really are only ink-deep. Still, the pretty exterior and tenderness did trick me. It held my interest every step of the way until I stepped back and saw how silly it really was, so I\u2019ll be kinder to that favorable result.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW THAT CAN BE SEEN HERE:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ib-l3CIbv8\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Air was the first of the Key / Kyoto Animation series and in my opinion, it's the one that has left the most indelible mark. Running on an ethereal kind of magical realism and raw human emotion, it is a roller coaster for the heart that, even three years later, I can't bear to forget.\r\nAir is about a young girl named Misuzu Kamio, who meets a drifter named Yukito on the first day of summer. Misuzu wants to make Yukito her friend and so she offers to let him stay at her place with her and her mother, Haruko. Yukito reluctantly takes advantage of herhospitality, and in doing so, learns that Misuzu may be a clue to something he's been looking for.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, the story progresses gradually, focusing on the characters, including other girls Yukito meets. Each girl brings another piece of the puzzle to the story. What's so wonderful about the story is how multi-faceted and multi-layered the story is. Because it is so densely packed with vital information, some of it gets lost along the way. This gives the series a massive amount of rewatch value until you can gather all the pieces and understand the entire story yourself. Of course, this doesn't mean you have to watch the series repeatedly to enjoy it. It's just a good idea to watch it more than once if you want to understand everything.\\n\\n\r\nThough the players in this magical tragedy are moe cliches, each is given certain aspects to their personality that set them apart. In most cases, each character comes with a backstory with the intention of ripping out your heartstrings. This may seem overdramatic for some viewers, but I think it works. Especially as it makes some not-so-enjoyable characters early on pretty darn amazing in terms of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThough it was Haruhi that put Kyoto Animation on the map, Air offers the same lush fluid animation that the studio is now revered for. The character designs are quite wonky, especially regarding the eyes, which are abnormally huge even by anime standards. A blending of Key's design and KyoAni's style, the character look won't appeal to everyone, but you can't fault the quality of the rest of the production.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is accompanied by a grand soundtrack. This is one thing that really sets Air apart from other game adaptations in that the anime keeps the soundtrack of the original game rather than create it's own. This was a brilliant move as the many pieces of accompaniment are epic on an emotional scale, from the OP music, to the background pieces, and especially the unforgettable insert, &quot;Aozora&quot;, from the final episode. The soundtrack works perfectly every time, every scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of my favorite anime of all time. Extensive replay value, raw often brutal emotion, set against a rich animated tapestry and set to one of the most beautiful soundtracks known to anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Air a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Air was the very first anime from the amazing due Key/Kyoto Animation, and it was definitely one of the best romance/drama animes that you can find out there.\r\nStory: I'm not gonna lie, this story made no sense to me, I watched all the episodes and was left thinking WTF IM SO CONFUSED? but after rewatching it I slowly began to understand it more. The tragedy of Misuzu and the whole theme of flying and freedom and destiny was pretty cool and the story ended up being an enjoyable one despite the complexity behind it.\r\nArt: OMG...Air has to be THE best looking anime I have everseen, everything on this show was just stunning gorgeous and the colours were bright and alive. The sky and the water and the characters and the background were all just a feast to the eye and made the show VERY pretty to look at. The sky being a main theme looks so great you wish the real sky would look like that once in a while. Kyoto Animation never lets a show have less than perfect animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I dont really have much to say about this section since I was mostly just WATCHING the show than LISTENING to it. But the background songs really made the show enjoyable and sad to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Other than Yukito I never got attached to any character and its understandable since these type of shows focus on a certain girl for a set number of episodes and this being only a 12 episode series (ep 13 a recap) you just dont get the chance to truly get used to the characters since their airtime is relative short. But other than that it was still sad to watch their tragedies/problems unfold\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was a great show to watch, I wish it wasnt so confusing otherwise I would've given it a higher score but Air is still a show I sometimes rewatch because of how pretty it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one show that does not disappoint and is definitely STUNNING to look at, it was because of Air that I started to watch more Visual Novel adaptations, specially if they were from the dynamic duo Key/KyoAni",

            "content": "Oh boy, I'm not gonna be popular after this, meethinks. I saw the japanese version, btw.\r\nWell, I think you can immediately tell what I thought about this and downvoted me respectively. Cool, whatevs. But I really did not like this series...mostly. Haven't seen anything else from this series, I believe it's based on some visual novels or whatever. I don't know, but these 13 episodes were ulitmately not a good experience by themselves at least.\r\nThere is technically an overall story to all of this. It's a shame it's far too vague and pointlessly cionfusing in an attempt to be deep. I mostly get what theywere going for but it just didn't work. It was just boring and with some painfully obvious sky, above the clouds, birds etc. metaphors all about the same general idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a different story. Normally I complain in a series that the secondary characters aren't used enough. This series has the opposite problem. Those 3 other girls that aren't Misuzu I honestly can't stand. It is the perfect mix of the most generic and boring comedy from them, followed by some poorly written tragedy. The 2 \"sisters\" story is honestly one of the best examples ever of making tragic events combined with magic and suicide symbolism...and being boring. It's just dialogue not said by any human being and I can't stand it. I just feel somewhat depressed watching it, yet at the same time bored. And it really feels like it's trying way too hard to be deep and annoys me. So by episode 6, I was hating this series (and while previous episodes were better, they weren't that much better). And I came into this series expecting it to at least be good, so I was truly dissappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then those characters were basically never seen again, focused on characters that mattered and it got better real quick. I was actually enjoying it after that. Flashback episodes with character names I can't remember had characters that were fun and kinda funny and enjoyable to be around and not depressionly boring. My god, that was fun. They have an adventure and find her mother. I liked those characters for what they were. It wasn't like amazing but I liked it, and I do admit I like any sudden increase of action in a series that at first has none. The ending of that story was silly but ok.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we spend the rest of the series focusing on Misuzu and her mother. Again, some weirdness, but the sad parts work. I can see why her mother acted as she did and her struggle with her relationship with Misuzu felt genuinely touching. Not to mention the twists, while kinda dumb, made you sad but not bored this time. You wanted to see both characters are ok, which is always important, I think especially for a series like this. I was not exactly in tears but it was really sad, a good story, I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course the big final episode is a recap...wait what? Really? Couldn't let the show end on a high note I guess or it was used to advertise some sequel OVA or I don't know. The point is that I hated the first half but kinda liked the 2nd half for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok. I don't know, the faces I didn't exactly like but...the art was ok. It was too bright at times but it still looked decent. Sound was mostly ok, although the voice acting could get annoying for those secondary characters I don't like. But that's made up by the performances of Aya Hisakawa and the late Tomoko Kawakami. Misuzu's aunt is the best character and the voice acting helped...or maybe vice versa. But I did buy from her voice the drama of those last few episodes. Misuzu herself was also good, a role that could have been annoying is made genuinely sweet yet tragic. Most of the rest are just ok, not worth mentioning at all really. Same with the music, but that being said, I really like the OP. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, maybe this series isn't one made for me. But one of my favorite series is the fairly depressing Welcome to the NHK!, which was written infinitely better and got how to make characters act and talk like real people more than almost any fiction I've ever seen. This show, rarely got remotely close sadly. And I know a decent amount of people who agree so at least I know I'm not alone. It isn't an awful series if you can get past episode 6, and in fact if you ignore episodes 2-6 I would likely call it a good series. But those episodes were awful, could not enjoy it at all, and the rest of the series was unable to make me fully forgive that. And I've kinda not interested in other series that I at least assume are similar anymore.",

But that\u2019s not really cri\u00adti\u00adcism, is it. It\u2019s just some\u00adthing I didn\u2019t like. It\u2019s like cri\u00adti\u00adciz\u00ading Hanamaru Kinder\u00adgardenbecause no real child has the depth of  know\u00adledge Hiiragi has. It\u2019s like \u201cso? that\u2019s what makes her awesome!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire second half of the show was basic\u00adally one huge sob drama story. Everything was tossed in to make this story even more sob-inducing than before. I\u2019ll keep away from spoil\u00ading any\u00adthing but mak\u00ading the lead female char\u00adac\u00adter sicker with every passing epis\u00adode and mak\u00ading the mother feel even more attached to her with each epis\u00adode felt way too manip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adive. Not that there\u2019s exactly any\u00adthing wrong with being manip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adive. Often it\u2019s the sign of a good story teller. But never once did I give a fuck what happened to any\u00adone in that show. Some people get sucked in incred\u00adibly eas\u00adily into sob stor\u00adies and for them, Air con\u00adstantly throws them moments to feast upon. I sup\u00adpose you could say that Air needed more epis\u00adodes to make me care about these char\u00adac\u00adters but I don\u2019t buy that. Double the epis\u00adode count and all I can see hap\u00adpen\u00ading is doub\u00adling the amount heart\u00adbreak\u00ading situ\u00adations involving Misuzu.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t care and fail to ever care about these manip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adive sob stor\u00adies. I liked Clan\u00adnad for the double blow of excel\u00adlent storytelling and the char\u00adac\u00adter of Tomoya, but rarely cared that much about the sob stor\u00adies bey\u00adond how they fit\u00adted into the story. Air never felt like it was com\u00adpos\u00ading a coher\u00adent, well struc\u00adtured story. It was just fling\u00ading these bloody baawwww situ\u00adations at the screen over and over and never once did I care. In fact, I can only think of one time I did care. That was when that winged girl was try\u00ading to juggle for her mother. As someone who\u2019s quite good at jug\u00adgling myself, I know the pain of hav\u00ading to con\u00adstantly pick up those blas\u00adted things, although I get the feel\u00ading that wasn\u2019t what I was meant to be sad about.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series wasn\u2019t exactly that bad either. At least it cre\u00adated the atmo\u00adsphere of sum\u00admer well and I quite liked the lead male char\u00adac\u00adter. If the second half of the story had con\u00adtin\u00adued the for\u00admula of \u2018guy spend\u00ading two epis\u00adodes chat\u00adting, two epis\u00adodes solv\u00ading magical prob\u00adlems for these girls\u2019 I might have made some unenthu\u00adsi\u00adastic review where I said it was a rather aver\u00adage anime. But the second half wasn\u2019t that at all (they turned my favour\u00adite char\u00adac\u00adter into a fuck\u00ading crow!). The baawww heap\u00ading is what made me severely dis\u00adlike the series, which is also why oth\u00aders love the series. Hence it\u2019s not really cri\u00adti\u00adcism of what it did wrong. Just what I didn\u2019t like about it.\\n",

And from where I stand today, I have to say, I really liked Air.\r\nThe story was very good and it flowed at a continuous speed so that was good.  The art was nice too although the characters did look very cartoonish at times because their eyes were like 3/4 of the size of their face and it did bother me a little bit that all these young girls had heaving chests.  Minor details Iguess.  \\n\\n\r\nEach character is so different yet so similar, drawn together by the town, the history and lonliness sprung from some misfortune.  I thought it was ironic how such a beautifully drawn anime can bring to life the darkest of human experiences - pain, sadness and lonliness.  A classic freeze frame that I always envision when I think of Air is Misuzu standing on the ocean dam reaching for the sky with the ocean breeze blowing past her.... she did her best.... so watch it!",

Upon first look this may seem like your typical \"boy meets a bunch of women---perverseness ensues.\"  Trust me though, this anime is far from that. \r\nThe story revolves around the legend of \"the girl in the sky,\" who is said to carry the entire world's burdens. Enter Misuzu Kamio, a typical little girl that likes dinosaurs and lives with her mom in a quiet little town, but who may also have some sort of connection to the legend. She lives mostly a solitude life in her town, that isuntil one day when a stranger happens to visit the small sea side residents. Who finds out that their meeting is not just a mere coincidence. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design and art style is smooth, sharp and just purely detailed! I especially liked the character's eyes in this series. That along with a memorable soundtrack and surprising plot twists, this is definitely a series you should pick up. Only downside I could think of was, its short and the story and ending can be a bit on the confusing side. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all though,if you found what I said interesting, then you can't go wrong with this title.

Air is an anime that has recieved much praise from many people and I just have to say; it must be me who is in the wrong in thinking this anime is below mediocre, it must be me right?\r\nWhen I first started watching Air I had rather high expectations and you know what? They were shattered right off the bat. The first episode did not deliver the way I had thought it would, the only thing it delievered was good animationand art yet characters that were so unbearable that if it hadn't been for all that praise by so many people, I'd dropped the anime after the first episode. In retrospective I should have.\\n\\n\r\nI fundamentally like anime, I like almost all genres when they are executed well with some redeeming points as a good storyboard (or even a storyboard at all), good screenplay and/or good characters and character development. But you see, when an anime fail in delivering any of these the way you expected them to be delivered you start to wonder. I can agree that some of the issues this anime address are interesting, or would have been if the two main characters hadn't been such drags. Seriously where did they find the two main characters? I am absolutely certain there must be some factory that produces mediocre bland characters that you can just copy and paste into your story-lacking anime. In a word you can describe this anime as boring.\\n\\n\r\nMany people like this anime though, many see it as one of the best ever made, many find deep meanings and important themes and issues being addressed in a wonderfully executed manner, but you know what; you're wrong.",

            "content": "The 1000th Summer sure was one of dramatic events, intriguing people and gorgeous landscapes.\r\nThat pretty much sums up the three greatest aspects of AIR, yet another anime that'd been on my personal to watch - list for years before I actually got down to it. Better late than never, as is once again proven in this case.\r\nI was rather sceptical at first when I began watching the show, despite my initial belief I'd like it since, you know, I'd planned on watching it in the first place. My fears were reinforced as what I was bombarded with during the first few episodes were things I'vegrown to dislike very muchly in anime: moe characters, overcute faces, irresponsible parents and other lame cliches of Japanese cartoons. Thus my willingness to watch the show dimmed to the point I almost gave up, watching only an episode every now and then almost solely for the sake of finishing what I'd started. Ultimately I ended up marathoning the last seven episodes in one night; a feat which speaks for itself for someone who's used to watch that many episodes in as many weeks.\\n\\n\r\nNo, the irritating moe-ness of the characters didn't go anywhere. No, the \u00fcber childish faces with gigantic eyes and tiny mouths didn't grow into tolerable proportions at any time. No, the careless parents didn't develop into Mr. and Mrs. guardian of the year overnight...quite. But the better qualities of the show which became more prominent as the series went on overrode almost completely any and all disgust I have for such superficial issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe gorgeous artwork of the anime is one of those qualities that is evident from the very beginning. Lush colors of the deep blue sea and sky, the green of the forests and the yellow of the fields all together reach the goal of showing us an ethereal summer at it's very peak. Something which surely comes in handy in a show where one of the main motifs is that sunny and warm season of the year. The show's highlighted summery atmosphere is not exclusively limited to the daytime sceneries either, for the brilliant sunsets where the world seems to be in fire and the hot nights alive with festivals are depicted so captivatingly one can almost feel the summer through the screen alone. No wonder so many have recommended this anime to be watched precisely in this time of year.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, as many have become accustomed to with the combination of Key and Kyoto Animation, is filled with mysteries. On one hand it arouses interest to go on watching the anime and find out what's going on. On the other it evokes frustration and anger as not all of the storyline's oddities are so easily comprehended in stride (or at all). I for one had to go over all the MAL summaries and character profiles to be sure I'd gotten _most_ of it correctly. Patience is a virtue here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was one aspect of AIR which I was pleasantly surprised with later on. On some occasions I truly felt like the show was taking distance from some of the most typical character cliches seen in anime: Haruko, though a single-parent female, ain't your typical loving and all-can-do big sister for Misuzu, instead exercising in behavior both jerk-ish, cowardly, and cruel at times. Misuzu's father, though having \"abandoned\" his daughter a long time ago, isn't presented as an all-around dickhead with no compassion or other redeeming qualities whatsoever. For what little he's got screen time anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main couple, Misuzu and Yukito, I can easily recognize their charm as well, even though they weren't quite my favorites. Misuzu is this very young, sweet, and lonely girl who's desperate to make friends yet is unable to do so for the special conditions she has. I suspect there are very few anime fans who cannot identify with her in that regard. Yukito on the other hand is a fine specimen of the relatively small group of tsundere males seen in anime, though I confess I didn't feel any connection with him at times - I couldn't have declined Misuzu's pleas to play with her the way he did at all. ;-; The more minor characters Minagi, Michiru, and Dr. Kirishima had their own, well-done story-arcs, but the characters themselves remained rather thin and generic to me. Props for Kanna, Ryuuya, and Uraha, though, their own small story was very warm and touching.\\n\\n\r\nDrama is something you can never count out when dealing with KyoAni's adaptation of a Key-work, and drama is aplenty in AIR as well. On some points the show truly clutched at my heart nastily as I watched the characters struggling in their personal affairs - whether it was about them stewing in their own stupidity or desperately trying to do what they knew to be the right thing. Many a time I found myself staring at the screen mouth open, my mind either screaming of cheering at the characters. This level of viewer's emotional involvement with the story is always a merit in its favor.\\n\\n\r\nAIR has also some powerful messages about life in general to deliver, ranging from the value of family to the art of appreciating what you're given. For the sake of keeping away from spoilers I won't go into great detail in this area, but there's one fitting quote that stuck in my mind which surmises quite well one of the show's themes.\\n\\n\r\n\"I wonder how many years it took us to get here. We had so many opportunities to see this beautiful scenery. What the hell were we doing?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe musical efforts invested into AIR deserve an honorable mention as well. I recall no scene which would've lacked the proper background tunes to help it reach its full potential, and both the opening and ending songs are memorable with their soaring vocals, atmospheric lyrics and catchy melodies. Admittedly I'm personally in the habit of nearly always skipping both credits, but this time I felt a bit bad for doing so. Which speaks volumes of the series' musical score in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I believe AIR is a very good choice for the next short anime-series you might want to watch. It asks only for your patience and observation. In return you get a wonderfully animated show with candy for your eyes, touching emotions on your heart, and another memory for your summer.",

Air forces a complex plot on the viewer that doesn't fit well, which leads to its downfall.\r\n   Air's story starts out pretty simple, but soon takes some emotional turns with characters we've barely met. The logical choice would be for our MC to leave or ignore these girls who need help, but he becomes ever so close into figuring out his mother's  tale. 1 cour was not enough to fill even 1 route from the VN and in turn, leaves the anime viewerconfused as to what's happening. 3/10\\n\\n\r\n   The art and sound are excellent for the time, and still hold up today. The animation would still be considered nice to look at now, and the music is very emotional and works in favor of the writers wishes. 7/10 art and 6/10 sound. \\n\\n\r\n   The characters aren't anything amazing. Right at the start, we meet almost an entire harem for our MC, each with stereotypical traits and problems to be solved. This creates a predictable sense I don't like to have while watching a show for the first time. MC on the other hand is interesting and fun to watch; if only he found his way into a better plot.  4/10\\n\\n\r\n   I did not enjoy this as much as similar pieces (Kanon 2006 and Clannad). It was simply a bunch of sentimentality for characters that haven't been fully developed. The anime was boring after a while and confusing at that. 2/10 for enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\n   Overall, this is an average anime for our time. It did not excel enough to stand out, and is left in the dust by better SoL drama romances that came out after it. Not bad, but not worth the watch. The VN is a better option here if you want to enjoy the story to its fullest. 4.4/10",

It had alot of potential, but in the end it took a severe swerve onto the wtf-highway.\r\n Air is about Yukito Kunisaki, a young man who travels looking for a woman his mother had told him about in a story. On his travels, he meets Misuzu Kamio. The two become good friends, but a disease bed-rids Misuzu and leaves her fighting for her life.\r\n Now, up until that part, everything in the anime had been good, all the makings for a great ending. Until of course, as you'll see, it turned for the worst. As Misuzuis on her last legs, Yukito comes in and sacrifices himself to save her (it was a very hard-to-explain turn of events, and even if I told you it would spoil it).\\n\\n\r\n You are then sent on a long and boring arch of the life of a group of three living in Feudal Japan, and as before, its hard to explain and would spoil the anime.\\n\\n\r\n So now back to the main story, what do you find? A crow. Thats right, we are now following the life of a freaking crow. Yukito reincarnate, yea, but still a freakin crow. We go into this screwed up kind of recap where we see what we already watched, but now through a crow's eyes. Except now Yukito (who is not in crow form) runs away instead of helping Misuzu. \\n\\n\r\n Now we watch a few, final episodes watching Misuzu's condition decay and eventually have her *spoiler here* die. Then thats it, aside from a part where Yukito (in crow form) sets out on a journey to find the flying woman, again. But this time as a crow. Yea, a crow. This is how they end the anime.\\n\\n\r\n Air had good potential and its episodes leading up to that giant wtf-moment of an ending, heck it was a great anime up until then. Yet the ending totally washed any good feeling I had for this anime out, and all around was a really bad ending. \\n\\n\r\n I personally would not suggest watching this anime unless you like watching good episodes only to be given a horrid excuse for an end, but then again is up to you.",

            "content": "Key is famous for creating lovable characters that you come to like, and then ripping your heart with feels.  If you know anything about Key than you probably have heard of Clannad, Kanon and Air.  Each of them are harems (one guy goes after several different girls and eventually ends up with one of them), and usually each heroine is given their own subplot.  What makes Key better than 90% of these type of narratives is all of them usually amount to something; whether it is an overarching theme (Kanon) or an effective way to lead into something more (like Clannad AfterStory).  Air however... is disjointed and isn't as clear in its direction as the other two, but it had the potential to be something really amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 (above average)\\n\r\nClannad was more grounded.  Kanon is a mix between reality and supernatural.  Air takes the slice of life genre and attempts to go more to the supernatural side.  The first half of the story is your typical harem, and is in my opinion pretty mediocre.  Air tries to give each of its 4-5 heroines a sub plot in the span of 6 episodes... and the result is a hit and miss.  There was one potentially interesting story about a girl who may have had some real psychological issue, only to disappoint me by turning it into a \"supernatural phenomenon\", which ended up being surprisingly dull.  This isn't to say that supernatural elements can't be interesting.  In fact one arc at the end of the first half was well done, and just when I was starting to get used to it... they change the direction of the series completely.  One of the biggest problems I have with Air is that the first half barely amount to anything, and the characters that were built up are completely forgotten in the second half!  This results into 2 disjointed halves that don't mesh well.  This sudden awkward change in pace and direction leads to a cluttered and somewhat unfocused experience.  Fantasy is thrown in, the core relationship focus changes, and... a really strange transformation occurs (???).  This may sound like Air fell off the rails and became a train wreck.  But when the last few episodes came together, it blew me away.  These last three episodes are fantastic, packing a really powerful emotional punch, and even reaching heights that can compare with their best work.  It explores a complicated mother-daughter relationship, that I really don't see a lot in this medium of story telling.  It also culminates in what is, in my opinion, a really powerful bittersweet open ended ending.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 (good characters overall, but a little mismanaged)\\n\r\nThe \"main character\" is a weird looking hobo named Yukito that goes around trying to get money as a puppeteer and fails miserably.  While he sounds interesting, he doesn't have much character development.  In fact, in the second half he is... shall I say... ignored.  The side characters are also not very memorable and don't have much relevance in the big picture.  However, the cast really shines with Misuzu and Haruko.  Misuzu is a kind, clumsy girl who finds Yukito and helps him out by letting him stay at her place with Haruko.  Initially, she seems to be a stereotypical not-so-bright naive blond girl, but when you find out something about her and follow her development in the second half... you will be surprised when she becomes a character you admire and really care about.  Haruko is the mother that adopts Misuzu and isn't the motherly type.  She doesn't seem to care much about Misuzu and appears to be incredibly irresponsible, and this creates an interesting dynamic that is explored brilliantly in the third act.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 (masterpiece)\\n\r\nSome of Key's best music.  Uses violin :) one of my favorite instruments.  Complements the setting perfectly, and delivers well on the dramatic front.  Also has a core theme that is very memorable and that I listen to regularly!  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10 (excellent)\\n\r\nReally impressive for a 2005 anime, but the real reason this scores high is not how good it looks but how it is used.  It creates a fantastic setting full of mystery and wonder that perfectly complements the story they are trying to tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 (mixed)\\n\r\nFor everything I liked there was something I didn't like, resulting in a mixed bag.  Overall, I admire Key for trying something new and attempt something outside what this genre usually presents.  If you enjoy their other works, I think you will enjoy it, but be ready for an unexpected turn in the second half.  While many people felt this is where it went downhill, try to give it a chance, because while it is a little clumsy, the vision they tried to reach was really admirable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (good)\\n",

Maybe if I was familiar with the game, but I'm not and the same could be said for many of the viewers out there. The story was simple enough and quite beautifully laid out for about the first half of the series, then it took a spiraling nose-dive into complete confusion. There was a side story set in feudal times that seemed very interesting but didn't fully connect with main storyline, as did afew other side stories. This series was just way too short for what it was trying to accomplish.",

It's very gentle, but yet not a really cutesy anime. All of the characters are very sweet and loveable, making it very hard to find a favorite character. It's got a very touching storyline, although it is quite sad. It's a very beautiful sadness though. One that everyone would cry at, but yet it's so gorgeous.\r\nIt's not hard to get attatched to everyone in it. They all have something about them thatwould remind you of anything that makes you happy.\\n\r\nPure, heartwarming, enchanting, beautiful, each of these words can very much describe this amazing anime. The emotional impact this anime portrays is a most inspiring one, and one that will lift your heart up high into the Air.",

            "content": "Air\r\n~ The 1000th Summer...~\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nAir the story of Yukito Kunisaki, a young man carrying on his family's journey to find the \"girl in the sky\" and free her from a curse. Stumbling upon a sleepy coastal town, he meets three girls: Misuzu Kamio, Kana Kirishima, and Minagi Tohno. He comes to spend more and more time in the town, living at the Kamio residence with Misuzu and her adopted mother.\r\nSome may know, others may not, but Air is based off an ero visual novel by KEY. Thus, each of the main heroines (Misuzu, Kana, and Minagi) each have different scenarios to explore. The short animetries its best to explore each scenario, but since it was so short, it felt somewhat rushed and the arcs of Kana and Minagi felt somewhat detached. Thus why the story only gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I still rated it so high because the main story (the one of Misuzu) is simply beautiful. It's original, fresh, tear-jerking, and just beautifully done. I'll admit it, I cried at at the end. \\n\\n\r\nMost consider Air to be confusing when they watch and don't understand the Kanna arc. I myself got it the first time, but if you don't, just watch it over -- you won't regret it. Most understand it the second time and come to appreciate the series much more.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nKyoto Animation, the company that animated Air, did a stunning job as always. The scenery felt alive like I could just step in, everything flowed smoothly and they're weren't any inconsistencies. Air is set in the summer, and like to watch parts of it in winter when I feel cold -- that's how real it feels. The clouds and skies in particular were stunning, and kudos to them for that, since the sky and flying are important symbols of Air. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nI love, love, love the opening theme to Air (&quot;Tori no Uta&quot; [The Bird's Song] by Lia). It's beautiful and the mood and lyrics reflects all the emotions and events in the series. The ending theme (&quot;Farewell Song&quot; also done by Lia) as well complimented the story and plot wonderfully. The BGM was nicely done, giving off the perfect aura for whatever was going on when it was played. Kudos to the voice actors, also -- they did terrific work on their roles. The character's emotions were conveyed convincingly and they spoke with such emotion it could tear your heart out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in Air were all alive and I felt for each and every one's issues. The designs on them were varied and I never was annoyed by any character in particular (a nice change for once). However, the reason this rating isn't higher, is because since the anime was so short most characters did not receive the development they were in need of.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nI gave Air an &quot;enjoyment&quot; rating of 10. I don't let this affect my score, however, since it's really a personal thing -- someone who isn't a romance, drama, supernatural sort of thing probably won't like this. However, I loved Air every moment, from beginning to end. If you're looking for a nice romance with a touch of supernatural fantasy and great characters, I highly recommend Air.",

            "content": "If you&rsquo;re into drama and supernatural anime, then Air is for you. I actually quite liked it, in fact, I like it better than Kanon 2006. There were similarities between the two, like for example, I though the two series had similar characters. Yukito was a lot like Yuichi and Misuzu&rsquo;s story and predicament was a lot like Makoto&rsquo;s. Air&rsquo;s story is also made up of character arcs. I think Air has 3 or 4 character arcs and each arc focuses on one major character at a time.\r\nIt was a sad anime. The scene when Misuzu was crying out &ldquo;mama!&rdquo; has been embedded into myanime memories. While it was sad sometimes, there were a lot of funny scenes too. In fact, compared to Kanon 2006, I think Air is the funnier one. Air had a more supernatural theme compared to Kanon as well. Just wait and see what happens in episode 8.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just great. Misuzu is just adorable. I love it when she goes &ldquo;gao&rdquo;. Her story is also the saddest out of all the characters. If you&rsquo;re into cute anime animals like me, you&rsquo;ll probably like Potato the dog. Don&rsquo;t ask &ndash; just see for yourselves and you&rsquo;ll know what I mean. Yukito is great too. He&rsquo;s sarcastic, manly, witty and likable like all the other KyoAni leads. He is a lot like Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Yuichi from Kanon 2006. \\n\\n\r\nThey were so much alike I thought Yukito was also played by Tomokazu Sugita, but in fact Yukito was played by Daisuke Ono, who was Koizumi Itsuki of another KyoAni series, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I recognized Tomoko Kawakami&rsquo;s voice as Misuzu right away too, since I loved her work as Sayuri of Kanon 2006. She made Misuzu even more adorable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because it&rsquo;s KyoAni, the animation was just stellar. There&rsquo;s no arguing about that. Watching Air was pleasing to the eyes as well, because the scenes were very delicate and serene. The animation was also very smooth.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I would have to say that it&rsquo;s a lot similar to Kanon 2006 once again, especially the BGM. The difference is that I liked the music of Air more, because it was less dreary and it complimented Air perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI also have to note that I like the theme of Air TV, which is the importance of having a family. All of the characters are very close to their family members and you&rsquo;ll realize that if you watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this is one of the best KyoAni series I&rsquo;ve seen so far. I recommend this to everyone, even to those who don&rsquo;t watch a lot of dramatic/supernatural anime. If the story doesn&rsquo;t work for you, the visuals will.",

            "content": "Air is an anime series, with a great batch of characters to go with a beautiful and heart-breaking story however it can be a difficult story for some to follow. ^_^\r\nFrom the beginning it is pretty easy to tell that the show originated from an &ldquo;eroge / visual novel&rdquo;; with the ordinary guy coincidently meeting a girl that would change his life. Air is an anime with a very weird concept which can be pretty difficult to comprehend to begin with. The story basically follows Yukito, the male protagonist who gets to know three girls, each of them having something mysterious and peculiar about themand their past. It seems that they all are linked in some way to &ldquo;the girl in the sky&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s something they eventually discover. The problem is that behind all the excellent drama lies a very confusing story that can leave anyone thinking &ldquo;where the heck is this going?&rdquo; Yet the show still remains great to watch throughout, plus the 2 amazing OAVs are a bit of an extra.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is the best thing about this show as the story only comes alive with the spectacular visuals that are always on display. The character models are okay, with the cute girls having the typical &ldquo;moe&rdquo; look anime fans are used to. The environment is where the animation truly shines, with an incredible amount of detail put into every aspect and object.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand the music doesn&rsquo;t really do much for the show and is barely even noticeable. At least it has a decent opening and ending theme song. Thanks to &ldquo;Kyoto Animation&rdquo; (the same company later responsible for Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon and Full Metal Panic!) the animation quality of the show remains the strongest aspect and can easily overshadow every other aspects, including the confusing storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a really interesting, short anime, which can be difficult to understand from the beginning but it improves as more is revealed later on. It always remains very emotional throughout, but the voice actors could have done a better job. So in the end, this can only be recommended to the most open minded romance anime fan or someone whose a fan of other KyoAni works, but I must warn you that this series will get fairly depressing.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "Air is a rather peculiar and unique anime to say the least, it\u2019s indubitably one of Kyoto Animation\u2019s most inventive and ingenious series to date. This evidently should come as no surprise since this is an adaptation of a prized and cherished visual novel made by the adept and adroit studio known as Key, a subsidiary of Visual Art\u2019s.\r\nAir is an anime that pertains to a select breed of anime that strive to relay a considerably greater amount of occurrences and revelations to the viewer than one would reasonably anticipate out of a mere half season series. It\u2019s exceptionally high compared to what one ofits banal kindred would habitually consist of. Unfortunately, due to this ambitious and perilous tactic, the series suffers some notable as well as essential drawbacks, and it conspicuously shows it.\\n\\n\r\nYet despite the overwhelming plethora of considerable limitations that certainly should have been excluded from the very beginning regardless of the reasoning, this series still astonishingly manages to attain greatness, albeit to a certain degree. \\n\\n\r\nThough I obliged to address the concept to my fellow viewers that contradictory and disparate to the bulk of anime in existence, this particular series is very special in regard to that, based on what your own personal preferences are for what you seek in anime, will determine your individual impressions of the quality of Air.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who are compelled and oblige only specific aspects within a series to be adequate and efficient, then Air will absolutely satisfy you to the fullest extent, since after all this is indeed a very captivating anime. \\n\\n\r\nThemes: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne unrecognized and unsigned theme that is extant in Air is undeniably mystery, though this is inadvertent rather than actually deliberate, and is very detrimental to the development of the plot. The constant sense of aggravating bewilderment significantly hinders your level of cognition, but fortunately isn\u2019t quite to the unbearable extent of being imperious though. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless it still wistfully manages to prevail over and detract from the strong points of the series, resulting in an inadvertently jumbled and convoluted conclusion that leaves you somewhat perplexed, making you wonder what the main point(s) genuinely were.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was rather subtle though providentially not quite tenuous, it was very heartwarming and rousing, without incorporating any sense of archetypical sensuality (aka fan service). It\u2019s verily admirable how the romance was quite effectively and flawlessly executed in such a manner, considering Air was twain an adult visual novel as well as an eroge. \\n\\n\r\nThe slice of life is prevalent throughout the entire series, though predominantly integrated into the introduction and opening episodes. Despite the profusion of chaos, pandemonium and tragedy, as well as melancholy ambiance that prevails throughout the entire duration, slice of life still acquires a fitting place in Air, and deserves admiration for accomplishing such a feat.\\n\\n\r\nEvery Key adaptation acquires their impressive and majestic artistic, as well as imaginative excellence from the supernatural aspects that are incorporated into them, and Air is indubitably no exception to this inclination. However ironically this element of Air is what delivers the gradual and continuous sense of befuddlement, especially nearing the bizarre conclusion. If only the supernatural elements would have been utilized adequately and appropriately. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what happens when you consolidate a rather comprehensive and intricate novel into only an incompatible half season adaptation, the inept result is merely an insufficient and convoluted anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the supernatural elements, Air\u2019s drama is virtually impeccable, no imperative flaws exist whatsoever. There is a bountiful variety of absolute awe-inspiring and defining heartbreaking as well as heartwarming moments that you will remember forever. No matter the magnitude of any particular predicament or occurrence, it\u2019s repeatedly presented in a glamorous and charismatic style.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again there is yet another theme is extant within Air that is queerly unrecognized for obscure reasoning, comedy. The comedy is tenuous throughout, but is very mollifying and is effective at alleviating, in addition to counteracting the gradual escalating climatic revelations being discerned by the protagonist(s).\\n\\n\r\nMain Points/Messages: 6\\n\\n\r\nConstructing an adequate review for Air\u2019s vague and indeterminate main points is a rather onerous challenge to confront, though I will do my utmost to reach that feat since I feel this anime deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nAir is very similar and akin to my previous anime review in regard to that, the main points are addressed in an evasive and indirect manner. It requires a considerable amount of attentiveness to notice them all, since their conferred abruptly and rather erratically. The reasoning for utilizing them in such an outlandish and audacious manner is enigmatic to me, and is anyone\u2019s guess. Likely the origin of this predicament is that numerous impolitic and imprudent alterations were required in order to adapt Air into only a half season, and quite frankly, Kyoto Animation definitely dropped the ball in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThough a profusion of avid fans of this adaptation and Kyoto Animation will indubitably loathe me intensely for stating this and will try their utmost to dispute and disprove this, there is absolutely no motive or even purpose for this faulty as well as negligent execution of addressing the main points/messages of the plot. Surely KyoAni could\u2019ve done more if they truly aspired to make this series greater, why they seemingly chose to neglect this notion and not give this exceptional adaptation the diligence it merited, we\u2019ll never know.\\n\\n\r\nPutting the flaws aside, the essential messages addressed through the dialogue occurring adjacent to climatic scenes are exceptional and extraordinary, regardless of the execution. The supernatural elements incorporated into the main points make it all the more glamorous and elegant, not to mention fascinating as long as you can tolerate a lack of thorough understanding and attentive constantly.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d be delighted to discuss in extensive detail each individual main point presented but I will refrain from revealing spoilers if possible, in accordance with the site\u2019s updated rules. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself as I\u2019ve previously stated is excessively variegated and convoluted, you simply won\u2019t wholly comprehend everything that transpires throughout its duration. Still the exiguous story somehow administers a sense of adequate uniformity and superb elegance, it\u2019s as if the series itself was unwilling and reluctant to allow itself to fall to the depths of ruin. Air is truly superlative and inspirational considering that this anime still managed to retain a compelling as well as distinguished story, despite the plethora of unjust limitations enacted upon its inception.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s meritorious and quite impressive how the voice actors implemented such a gratifying and exquisite performance with the script they were constrained to work with. Each individual character was very pragmatic and unique, absolutely no archetypes extant in Air whatsoever. They all are first-class examples of exemplary characters, vibrant, astute, and dynamic, they virtually resemble real homo sapiens. Overall the pristine quality of the characters is on par with other notable Key anime adaptations. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nConsidering Air was released in 2005, it\u2019s very alluring and angelic to say the least. The landscapes portrayed were ordinary yet hypnagogic, and very radiant. The character animations were aberrant without being disproportionate to be more appealing or to conform to a particular viewer type. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actor\u2019s well, voices themselves were adapted to absolute perfection for the characters they represented, truly magnificent performances executed throughout the entire cast. The general sound effects were adequate and alluring, in addition to being very well balanced. Another opulent as well as sumptuous aspect about Air was the imaginative and absolute breathtaking music present within every individual episode. It\u2019s quintessential for delivering the tone for the series, and does so flawlessly. The OST for Air is certainly one of the best I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s a true personal treasure to possess. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite the abundance of ridicule and bantering I\u2019ve bestowed upon this anime, it still was a very outstanding and accomplished series, despite how much it unfortunately simply couldn\u2019t achieve due to its design limitations. The auxiliary and subsidiary aspects are genuinely what sustained the quality and more importantly are what luckily sustained Air\u2019s virtue in addition to sophisticated excellence that its novel consisted of. This is certainly a distinguishing and adept anime, especially considering the unjust alterations enacted upon it, with a very imaginative, inventive, as well as ingenious plot that any anime fan should watch regardless of its aggravating drawbacks.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated, will gladly and readily listen to any comments and opinions of my reviews as to better future reviews. These reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not to merely state my impressions of it just for fun, thanks!",

            "content": "To say the least, Air is definitely one of the more unique anime made by Kyoto Animation. Air is based off one of Key\u2019s better known visual novels. However, compared to the other Key adaptations made by KyoAni, Air strives to do a lot more, in quite a few ways.\r\nLike I\u2019ve said, even with its limited half-season length, Air certainly doesn\u2019t lack content, with quite a complex plot. And seriously, the bare-bones ideas behind Air are fantastic \u2013 extremely thought-provoking and intriguing. In all honesty, Air certainly could have become a masterpiece, in all dimensions. \r\nUnfortunately, Air strives to achieve a little bit too much.And what I mean by this is the vast amount of content that really doesn\u2019t assist in developing the story in the slightest. The overall focus of the story seems too unclear, as relatively unimportant information is given way too much significance. With quite a few other minor issues, Air suffers from quite a few obvious flaws, and some less notable problems. I\u2019d like to say that it\u2019s a \u2018minor train wreck\u2019, but that would be slightly too harsh. (Do note that I have not seen the movie or the visual novel at the time of writing this.)\\n\\n\r\nBut before I delve too far into the story, I\u2019ll admit that the production values (animation, art, sound) absolutely amazing. Not surprisingly (considering the title Air), the sky and the overall landscape are fantastically done. The story itself takes place in a relatively quiet, rural area, and the scenery normally not seen in urban cities are beautifully drawn and animated. These vibrant backgrounds give Air a sense of elegance not quite present in other anime. Combined with the concept of angel-like winged beings, it provides Air with a very suitable atmosphere to develop the story on. Character motion, for the most part, is also very fluid and realistic. Of course, the characters also come with KyoAni\u2019s typical \u2018huge chins\u2019. Fortunately, this isn\u2019t as exemplified to make the character anatomy look disproportional, compared to for example Toei\u2019s Kanon 2002. Considering this was released in 2005, in this sense it\u2019s certainly a great work of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, for the most part, also supplement the overall atmosphere for the story. To say the least, both the opening and the ending are beautiful songs fitting for an \u2018angel-like\u2019 (I\u2019ll probably be using this term a lot) anime like Air. Particularly the ending \u2013 titled Farewell Song, it brings a nice, calm sense of closure. Similar things can be said about the background music throughout the episodes. The voice actors also voiced their respective characters amazingly; each different voice was easily distinguishable, and brought out the character\u2019s personality in an intriguing way.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite its high production values, the story of Air suffers from a lot of inherent issues. To start off, the side characters\u2019 arcs. This may be slightly subjective, but in all honesty, the two character arcs (Minagi and Kano) serve no inherent purpose to the plot. I never particularly liked this \u2018arc-oriented\u2019 style of storytelling, but the problems of that sort of writing are much too prominent to overlook here. I don\u2019t think Minagi or Kano made a single appearance after the first seven episodes (aside from the recap episode). Now, I probably could have disregarded this if the other two characters\u2019 interactions actually assisted in developing the main arc. But they dont. The first two arcs contribute too little to no meaningful purpose. Although the main arc (Misuzu) is somewhat developed in the first seven episodes, upon careful inspection you\u2019ll realize that almost all of the development with Misuzu and Yukito occurs when they\u2019re alone. Practically, most of episodes two through seven could be removed, and the story would be still comprehendible as it is now. I haven\u2019t watched the movie yet, but since it doesn\u2019t focus on other character arcs, I would probably prefer the movie. \\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the last recap episode serves little to no purpose in the story. Following up from before, it almost seems as if they included the last episode to deceive the watcher from thinking the other characters were sidelined. And if there were a choice (as there is here), logistically speaking it would make much more sense to recap over the main arc instead, since much of the important content appeared in the main arc (not to mention it was somewhat confusing and puzzling to understand).\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me back to my main point of Air putting too much emphasis on the wrong things. If the producers had enough of a budget to even include a recap episode, why not spend an extra episode for the main arc? Similar things can be said about the side arcs. With the main arc already cramped as it is, it would make sense to do so. Compared to Kanon and Clannad, the visual novel for Air is significantly shorter, so the producers certainly could have fit Air into a 13-episode season and have it become a masterpiece, if it weren\u2019t for the wrong emphases.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Air isn\u2019t all just a train-wreck. At the very least, for the most part the drama is pretty well done, despite a slightly dysfunctional plot; the drama is quite realistic. The slice-of-life portion of the anime is also quite good (not considering the first two character arcs), with sensible development and a decent introduction to the main characters. Also, considering that the visual novel was an eroge, there\u2019s almost no fanservice or anything of the sort. There\u2019s also surprisingly little romance, which actually helps the plot.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the most controversial part of Air is certainly the writing. The writers of Air took \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d to a completely new level. There are so many subtle references that the watcher may even become overwhelmed. From what I can tell, many people dislike Air because it\u2019s confusing. Indeed, it\u2019s definitely confusing, especially if it\u2019s the first time watching it. It\u2019s highly recommended to watch the main arc multiple times, just to catch all the plot references you may have missed. Like many others, I found it quite confusing the first time through. But it\u2019s very intriguing. Again, it\u2019s very elegant how all the plot elements are introduced. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of time (due to improper emphases), it turned out more like a train wreck instead of a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters (disregarding the fact that I find no purpose in the first half of the show), they\u2019re quite varied and interesting. The stereotypical characters don\u2019t exist in Air, each character with a unique personality. The characters also have realistic emotions, and their actions have meaningful purpose. \\n\\n\r\nAs for my enjoyment, I honestly was ready to drop the show around seven episodes in, just because the first two character arcs were that dull and uninteresting. But fortunately, it does become more thought-provoking and intriguing further in. It\u2019s very imaginative, and the supernatural elements and elegant atmosphere certainly assist in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, KyoAni had a great foundation for Air, but unfortunately, through emphasis on the wrong things, the initially superb ideas became a minor train-wreck. Depending on your preferences, you may or may not find Air to be intriguing. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the scores:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so if you so wish, please leave me some comments! Any constructive feedback is greatly appreciated.\\n",

            "content": "When I was told by one of my friends that everybody should see Air at least once in their lifetimes because it was so good, how could I refuse. This was a person I trusted and who introduced me to Ghost In The Shell. WOW.. Wasn't he wrong. A lot of people have given Air rave reviews, but I found it to be boring and at times, down right annoying.\r\nI found the story slow, repetitive and predictable. The major \"Twists\" could be seen from a mile away. The best parts of the story were the short and sweet subplots and flashbacks which I must admit,were quite entertaining. But the main story of Misuzu really just annoyed me.\\n\\n\r\nI did think the overall art work in the series was good, it's not my normal taste in style but I thought it was cute and worked well, though some of the characters did seem a little underdrawn, even unfinished, but I liked it, it was a pleasurable change to the perfect well rounded style we tend to see everywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters overall were well presented and all had distinctive interesting personalities. Unfortunately Misuzu annoyed the hell out of me, her annoying voice, bad habbits, The fact that she had a mental age at least 7 years prior to her physical age, and overall demeanor were so bad that it overshadowed the rest of the good characters and made them unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing I feel I need to say about the characters is Potato, This quirky little puppy is reason alone to sit through the 13 episodes of crap. You are much better off just typing his name into a youtube search and watching the little clips they have of him.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the 4th or 5th episode watching this Anime became more like work than a passtime, the only reason I watched it through was that my friend was so convinced that it was the greatest thing ever, I assumed that somewhere something happened that made things fall into place and I'd start to enjoy it. Unfortunately this was only a pipe dream.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't recomend this anime. Though to some people it must have more meaning or appeal than it did to me, as it has many many other rave reviews.\\n\\n\r\nIf you do decide to pursue this anime, I wish you luck.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I can be known for despising moe with the pure unbridled passion of a thousand blazing suns. BUT! I thought it only fair to explain why I hate it with a review of possibly the best show that moe has to offer up. \u201cSo, why the bile, JesuOtaku, what\u2019s wrong with the heartwarming moe story?\u201d you may ask. You may not have asked that nicely, but whatever. \r\nWell, before I get into that, I should probably praise all the things Air does right that make it by far my favorite moe title. Don\u2019t get too excited, that\u2019s likelooking in a dirt pail for me and picking out a \u201cfavorite\u201d worm to use as bass bait. \\n\\n\r\nAir is emotionally a rewarding experience. Unlike in most moe shows, the other characters actually express Misuzu\u2019s trademark moe quirks: the mental retardation, animal noises, strange tastes, and clumsiness, to be really weird and cause for real concern instead of just finding them charming. This makes her character more accessible, and on the whole the characters in Air are relatable enough to make the emotional gut-busters of the conclusion truly gut-busting. The story is emotionally honest, raw and unflinching, and will have many individuals clawing for their Kleenex when they least expect it. I was genuinely touched by Air\u2019s conclusion, and my heart is a dried brown potpourri ball fit only to spice up the lavatories of a state penitentiary.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, Air is smashingly well-animated, something enthusiasts of Kyo-Ani have come to expect, as they produced the famous Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya among other girl-aimed shows with the budget and finesse usually reserved for boy-aimed shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is oddly intricate, usually light, feathery orchestral ballads that never overtake the action onscreen, but flow underneath it subtly enough to work well, and the same can be said of the fluffy opener and closer. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in both languages is sufficient, with moments of greatness. The three main roles are cast nigh perfectly in the dub, with Luci Christian making an incredible star turn as Haruko, as if I didn\u2019t like her enough as an actress, her work here is phenomenal and as I said, Vic Mignogna and Monica Rial sound born to play Yukito and Misuzu respectively, never missing a beat. The rest of the cast is fairly average to melodramato-bad, but you know what, they aren\u2019t important. \\n\\n\r\nHow could I possibly say the other characters aren\u2019t important?\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nI must, for I must bring out the ugly stick now. Yeah, I was moved by this story, but that\u2019s because Air basically planted its petite well-animated foot up my backside and shoved me on my face, which of course just watered up from the abuse. You MUST turn your brain off to think this is a good story. It would be vile enough with the number of badly written platitudes that pop up now and again, but the plot, no matter how you slice it, is CONTRIVED and MANIPULATIVE, and therefore, so is the emotion that you feel when you watch it. The other girls never serve any purpose to the main conflict, in fact, I want someone to messagel me and tell me WHAT purpose they honestly served at ALL except to serve the schoolgirl fetish population. \\n\\n\r\nYes, I went there, because moe is Freudian. It is created innocent so the male viewers won\u2019t feel bad fantasizing about the nonexistent fanservice that is fed to us through arbitrary tragedy rather than panty shots. I know there are women that enjoy it and also men that enjoy it in a non-dirty fashion, but that\u2019s not what it was created for, you bet your sweet potatoes.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these characters have an inexplicable tragic past or terminal disease that is usually tied to the supernatural and rarely has anything to do with the main idea of the story, if there even was one to begin with. Air tries to have a point, but only obtains one in the relationship between Haruko and Misuzu in the very end that I sorely wish had been the focus of the entire show instead of the typical boring boy learning about helpless girls in town pattern that proved pointless when all was said and done. That\u2019s also a staple of the hentai games these shows came from... \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, all Air really does is exploit your tear ducts without giving you a reason as to why anything happens, besides the words \u201cmagic,\u201d \u201cgods,\u201d and \u201cdestiny,\u201d which I will follow with the words \u201cdeus ex machina.\u201d And also the words \u201cscrew that.\u201d If I\u2019m weepy at the end of something, I want it to be because the story meant something to me, because I learned something about the characters, maybe even about life, if that\u2019s not too heavy to consider. I don\u2019t want it to be because, yes, I was sucker-punched by pretty art, pretty music, and good acting pasted on a plot with all the finesse of a bad fanfiction written by that fetish guy I mentioned earlier. You know who you are. Go ahead, give me a good reason WHY there are so many girls near death or madness in this show, so I can stop beating this poor dead horse and let it gallop back to its home on the set of Days of our Lives! I recommend this to moe fans, really I do. After that, I recommend you click off this review and scan your TV for Lifetime channel where you will find live-action versions of the well-written drama presented in Air.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a beautiful title where the tears and angst really are only ink-deep. Still, the pretty exterior and tenderness did trick me. It held my interest every step of the way until I stepped back and saw how silly it really was, so I\u2019ll be kinder to that favorable result.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW THAT CAN BE SEEN HERE:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ib-l3CIbv8\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Air was the first of the Key / Kyoto Animation series and in my opinion, it's the one that has left the most indelible mark. Running on an ethereal kind of magical realism and raw human emotion, it is a roller coaster for the heart that, even three years later, I can't bear to forget.\r\nAir is about a young girl named Misuzu Kamio, who meets a drifter named Yukito on the first day of summer. Misuzu wants to make Yukito her friend and so she offers to let him stay at her place with her and her mother, Haruko. Yukito reluctantly takes advantage of herhospitality, and in doing so, learns that Misuzu may be a clue to something he's been looking for.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, the story progresses gradually, focusing on the characters, including other girls Yukito meets. Each girl brings another piece of the puzzle to the story. What's so wonderful about the story is how multi-faceted and multi-layered the story is. Because it is so densely packed with vital information, some of it gets lost along the way. This gives the series a massive amount of rewatch value until you can gather all the pieces and understand the entire story yourself. Of course, this doesn't mean you have to watch the series repeatedly to enjoy it. It's just a good idea to watch it more than once if you want to understand everything.\\n\\n\r\nThough the players in this magical tragedy are moe cliches, each is given certain aspects to their personality that set them apart. In most cases, each character comes with a backstory with the intention of ripping out your heartstrings. This may seem overdramatic for some viewers, but I think it works. Especially as it makes some not-so-enjoyable characters early on pretty darn amazing in terms of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThough it was Haruhi that put Kyoto Animation on the map, Air offers the same lush fluid animation that the studio is now revered for. The character designs are quite wonky, especially regarding the eyes, which are abnormally huge even by anime standards. A blending of Key's design and KyoAni's style, the character look won't appeal to everyone, but you can't fault the quality of the rest of the production.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is accompanied by a grand soundtrack. This is one thing that really sets Air apart from other game adaptations in that the anime keeps the soundtrack of the original game rather than create it's own. This was a brilliant move as the many pieces of accompaniment are epic on an emotional scale, from the OP music, to the background pieces, and especially the unforgettable insert, &quot;Aozora&quot;, from the final episode. The soundtrack works perfectly every time, every scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of my favorite anime of all time. Extensive replay value, raw often brutal emotion, set against a rich animated tapestry and set to one of the most beautiful soundtracks known to anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Air a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Air was the very first anime from the amazing due Key/Kyoto Animation, and it was definitely one of the best romance/drama animes that you can find out there.\r\nStory: I'm not gonna lie, this story made no sense to me, I watched all the episodes and was left thinking WTF IM SO CONFUSED? but after rewatching it I slowly began to understand it more. The tragedy of Misuzu and the whole theme of flying and freedom and destiny was pretty cool and the story ended up being an enjoyable one despite the complexity behind it.\r\nArt: OMG...Air has to be THE best looking anime I have everseen, everything on this show was just stunning gorgeous and the colours were bright and alive. The sky and the water and the characters and the background were all just a feast to the eye and made the show VERY pretty to look at. The sky being a main theme looks so great you wish the real sky would look like that once in a while. Kyoto Animation never lets a show have less than perfect animation quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I dont really have much to say about this section since I was mostly just WATCHING the show than LISTENING to it. But the background songs really made the show enjoyable and sad to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Other than Yukito I never got attached to any character and its understandable since these type of shows focus on a certain girl for a set number of episodes and this being only a 12 episode series (ep 13 a recap) you just dont get the chance to truly get used to the characters since their airtime is relative short. But other than that it was still sad to watch their tragedies/problems unfold\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was a great show to watch, I wish it wasnt so confusing otherwise I would've given it a higher score but Air is still a show I sometimes rewatch because of how pretty it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one show that does not disappoint and is definitely STUNNING to look at, it was because of Air that I started to watch more Visual Novel adaptations, specially if they were from the dynamic duo Key/KyoAni",

            "content": "Oh boy, I'm not gonna be popular after this, meethinks. I saw the japanese version, btw.\r\nWell, I think you can immediately tell what I thought about this and downvoted me respectively. Cool, whatevs. But I really did not like this series...mostly. Haven't seen anything else from this series, I believe it's based on some visual novels or whatever. I don't know, but these 13 episodes were ulitmately not a good experience by themselves at least.\r\nThere is technically an overall story to all of this. It's a shame it's far too vague and pointlessly cionfusing in an attempt to be deep. I mostly get what theywere going for but it just didn't work. It was just boring and with some painfully obvious sky, above the clouds, birds etc. metaphors all about the same general idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a different story. Normally I complain in a series that the secondary characters aren't used enough. This series has the opposite problem. Those 3 other girls that aren't Misuzu I honestly can't stand. It is the perfect mix of the most generic and boring comedy from them, followed by some poorly written tragedy. The 2 \"sisters\" story is honestly one of the best examples ever of making tragic events combined with magic and suicide symbolism...and being boring. It's just dialogue not said by any human being and I can't stand it. I just feel somewhat depressed watching it, yet at the same time bored. And it really feels like it's trying way too hard to be deep and annoys me. So by episode 6, I was hating this series (and while previous episodes were better, they weren't that much better). And I came into this series expecting it to at least be good, so I was truly dissappointed. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then those characters were basically never seen again, focused on characters that mattered and it got better real quick. I was actually enjoying it after that. Flashback episodes with character names I can't remember had characters that were fun and kinda funny and enjoyable to be around and not depressionly boring. My god, that was fun. They have an adventure and find her mother. I liked those characters for what they were. It wasn't like amazing but I liked it, and I do admit I like any sudden increase of action in a series that at first has none. The ending of that story was silly but ok.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we spend the rest of the series focusing on Misuzu and her mother. Again, some weirdness, but the sad parts work. I can see why her mother acted as she did and her struggle with her relationship with Misuzu felt genuinely touching. Not to mention the twists, while kinda dumb, made you sad but not bored this time. You wanted to see both characters are ok, which is always important, I think especially for a series like this. I was not exactly in tears but it was really sad, a good story, I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course the big final episode is a recap...wait what? Really? Couldn't let the show end on a high note I guess or it was used to advertise some sequel OVA or I don't know. The point is that I hated the first half but kinda liked the 2nd half for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok. I don't know, the faces I didn't exactly like but...the art was ok. It was too bright at times but it still looked decent. Sound was mostly ok, although the voice acting could get annoying for those secondary characters I don't like. But that's made up by the performances of Aya Hisakawa and the late Tomoko Kawakami. Misuzu's aunt is the best character and the voice acting helped...or maybe vice versa. But I did buy from her voice the drama of those last few episodes. Misuzu herself was also good, a role that could have been annoying is made genuinely sweet yet tragic. Most of the rest are just ok, not worth mentioning at all really. Same with the music, but that being said, I really like the OP. Good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, maybe this series isn't one made for me. But one of my favorite series is the fairly depressing Welcome to the NHK!, which was written infinitely better and got how to make characters act and talk like real people more than almost any fiction I've ever seen. This show, rarely got remotely close sadly. And I know a decent amount of people who agree so at least I know I'm not alone. It isn't an awful series if you can get past episode 6, and in fact if you ignore episodes 2-6 I would likely call it a good series. But those episodes were awful, could not enjoy it at all, and the rest of the series was unable to make me fully forgive that. And I've kinda not interested in other series that I at least assume are similar anymore.",

            "content": "The prob\u00adlem with cri\u00adtiquing Air is that the many reas\u00adons I have for not lik\u00ading it are also reas\u00adons why oth\u00aders do like it. A small example of this would be the extent this show went to show how imma\u00adture Mis\u00aduzu was. It went to quite ridicu\u00adlous extremes. The sum\u00admer diary, the teddy dino\u00adsaurs, the \u2018will you play with me\u2019, right up to the point when she cut her hair, she could have just as eas\u00adily been 6 years old and I wouldn\u2019t have bat\u00adted an eye\u00adlid. But that\u2019s not really cri\u00adti\u00adcism, is it. It\u2019s just some\u00adthing I didn\u2019t like. It\u2019s like cri\u00adti\u00adciz\u00ading Hanamaru Kinder\u00adgardenbecause no real child has the depth of  know\u00adledge Hiiragi has. It\u2019s like \u201cso? that\u2019s what makes her awesome!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire second half of the show was basic\u00adally one huge sob drama story. Everything was tossed in to make this story even more sob-inducing than before. I\u2019ll keep away from spoil\u00ading any\u00adthing but mak\u00ading the lead female char\u00adac\u00adter sicker with every passing epis\u00adode and mak\u00ading the mother feel even more attached to her with each epis\u00adode felt way too manip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adive. Not that there\u2019s exactly any\u00adthing wrong with being manip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adive. Often it\u2019s the sign of a good story teller. But never once did I give a fuck what happened to any\u00adone in that show. Some people get sucked in incred\u00adibly eas\u00adily into sob stor\u00adies and for them, Air con\u00adstantly throws them moments to feast upon. I sup\u00adpose you could say that Air needed more epis\u00adodes to make me care about these char\u00adac\u00adters but I don\u2019t buy that. Double the epis\u00adode count and all I can see hap\u00adpen\u00ading is doub\u00adling the amount heart\u00adbreak\u00ading situ\u00adations involving Misuzu.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care. I just don\u2019t care and fail to ever care about these manip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adive sob stor\u00adies. I liked Clan\u00adnad for the double blow of excel\u00adlent storytelling and the char\u00adac\u00adter of Tomoya, but rarely cared that much about the sob stor\u00adies bey\u00adond how they fit\u00adted into the story. Air never felt like it was com\u00adpos\u00ading a coher\u00adent, well struc\u00adtured story. It was just fling\u00ading these bloody baawwww situ\u00adations at the screen over and over and never once did I care. In fact, I can only think of one time I did care. That was when that winged girl was try\u00ading to juggle for her mother. As someone who\u2019s quite good at jug\u00adgling myself, I know the pain of hav\u00ading to con\u00adstantly pick up those blas\u00adted things, although I get the feel\u00ading that wasn\u2019t what I was meant to be sad about.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series wasn\u2019t exactly that bad either. At least it cre\u00adated the atmo\u00adsphere of sum\u00admer well and I quite liked the lead male char\u00adac\u00adter. If the second half of the story had con\u00adtin\u00adued the for\u00admula of \u2018guy spend\u00ading two epis\u00adodes chat\u00adting, two epis\u00adodes solv\u00ading magical prob\u00adlems for these girls\u2019 I might have made some unenthu\u00adsi\u00adastic review where I said it was a rather aver\u00adage anime. But the second half wasn\u2019t that at all (they turned my favour\u00adite char\u00adac\u00adter into a fuck\u00ading crow!). The baawww heap\u00ading is what made me severely dis\u00adlike the series, which is also why oth\u00aders love the series. Hence it\u2019s not really cri\u00adti\u00adcism of what it did wrong. Just what I didn\u2019t like about it.\\n",

The art was nice too although the characters did look very cartoonish at times because their eyes were like 3/4 of the size of their face and it did bother me a little bit that all these young girls had heaving chests.  Minor details Iguess.  \\n\\n\r\nEach character is so different yet so similar, drawn together by the town, the history and lonliness sprung from some misfortune.  I thought it was ironic how such a beautifully drawn anime can bring to life the darkest of human experiences - pain, sadness and lonliness.

Enter Misuzu Kamio, a typical little girl that likes dinosaurs and lives with her mom in a quiet little town, but who may also have some sort of connection to the legend. She lives mostly a solitude life in her town, that isuntil one day when a stranger happens to visit the small sea side residents.

They were shattered right off the bat. The first episode did not deliver the way I had thought it would, the only thing it delievered was good animationand art yet characters that were so unbearable that if it hadn't been for all that praise by so many people, I'd dropped the anime after the first episode. In retrospective I should have.\\n\\n\r\nI fundamentally like anime, I like almost all genres when they are executed well with some redeeming points as a good storyboard (or even a storyboard at all), good screenplay and/or good characters and character development. But you see, when an anime fail in delivering any of these the way you expected them to be delivered you start to wonder. I can agree that some of the issues this anime address are interesting, or would have been if the two main characters hadn't been such drags. Seriously where did they find the two main characters? I am absolutely certain there must be some factory that produces mediocre bland characters that you can just copy and paste into your story-lacking anime. In a word you can describe this anime as boring.\\n\\n\r\nMany people like this anime though, many see it as one of the best ever made, many find deep meanings and important themes and issues being addressed in a wonderfully executed manner, but you know what; you're wrong.",

Better late than never, as is once again proven in this case.\r\nI was rather sceptical at first when I began watching the show, despite my initial belief I'd like it since, you know, I'd planned on watching it in the first place. My fears were reinforced as what I was bombarded with during the first few episodes were things I'vegrown to dislike very muchly in anime: moe characters, overcute faces, irresponsible parents and other lame cliches of Japanese cartoons. Thus my willingness to watch the show dimmed to the point I almost gave up, watching only an episode every now and then almost solely for the sake of finishing what I'd started. Ultimately I ended up marathoning the last seven episodes in one night; a feat which speaks for itself for someone who's used to watch that many episodes in as many weeks.\\n\\n\r\nNo, the irritating moe-ness of the characters didn't go anywhere. No, the \u00fcber childish faces with gigantic eyes and tiny mouths didn't grow into tolerable proportions at any time. No, the careless parents didn't develop into Mr. and Mrs. guardian of the year overnight...quite. But the better qualities of the show which became more prominent as the series went on overrode almost completely any and all disgust I have for such superficial issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe gorgeous artwork of the anime is one of those qualities that is evident from the very beginning. Lush colors of the deep blue sea and sky, the green of the forests and the yellow of the fields all together reach the goal of showing us an ethereal summer at it's very peak. Something which surely comes in handy in a show where one of the main motifs is that sunny and warm season of the year. The show's highlighted summery atmosphere is not exclusively limited to the daytime sceneries either, for the brilliant sunsets where the world seems to be in fire and the hot nights alive with festivals are depicted so captivatingly one can almost feel the summer through the screen alone. No wonder so many have recommended this anime to be watched precisely in this time of year.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, as many have become accustomed to with the combination of Key and Kyoto Animation, is filled with mysteries. On one hand it arouses interest to go on watching the anime and find out what's going on. On the other it evokes frustration and anger as not all of the storyline's oddities are so easily comprehended in stride (or at all). I for one had to go over all the MAL summaries and character profiles to be sure I'd gotten _most_ of it correctly. Patience is a virtue here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was one aspect of AIR which I was pleasantly surprised with later on. On some occasions I truly felt like the show was taking distance from some of the most typical character cliches seen in anime: Haruko, though a single-parent female, ain't your typical loving and all-can-do big sister for Misuzu, instead exercising in behavior both jerk-ish, cowardly, and cruel at times. Misuzu's father, though having \"abandoned\" his daughter a long time ago, isn't presented as an all-around dickhead with no compassion or other redeeming qualities whatsoever. For what little he's got screen time anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main couple, Misuzu and Yukito, I can easily recognize their charm as well, even though they weren't quite my favorites. Misuzu is this very young, sweet, and lonely girl who's desperate to make friends yet is unable to do so for the special conditions she has. I suspect there are very few anime fans who cannot identify with her in that regard. Yukito on the other hand is a fine specimen of the relatively small group of tsundere males seen in anime, though I confess I didn't feel any connection with him at times - I couldn't have declined Misuzu's pleas to play with her the way he did at all. ;-; The more minor characters Minagi, Michiru, and Dr. Kirishima had their own, well-done story-arcs, but the characters themselves remained rather thin and generic to me. Props for Kanna, Ryuuya, and Uraha, though, their own small story was very warm and touching.\\n\\n\r\nDrama is something you can never count out when dealing with KyoAni's adaptation of a Key-work, and drama is aplenty in AIR as well. On some points the show truly clutched at my heart nastily as I watched the characters struggling in their personal affairs - whether it was about them stewing in their own stupidity or desperately trying to do what they knew to be the right thing. Many a time I found myself staring at the screen mouth open, my mind either screaming of cheering at the characters. This level of viewer's emotional involvement with the story is always a merit in its favor.\\n\\n\r\nAIR has also some powerful messages about life in general to deliver, ranging from the value of family to the art of appreciating what you're given. For the sake of keeping away from spoilers I won't go into great detail in this area, but there's one fitting quote that stuck in my mind which surmises quite well one of the show's themes.\\n\\n\r\n\"I wonder how many years it took us to get here. We had so many opportunities to see this beautiful scenery. What the hell were we doing?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe musical efforts invested into AIR deserve an honorable mention as well. I recall no scene which would've lacked the proper background tunes to help it reach its full potential, and both the opening and ending songs are memorable with their soaring vocals, atmospheric lyrics and catchy melodies. Admittedly I'm personally in the habit of nearly always skipping both credits, but this time I felt a bit bad for doing so. Which speaks volumes of the series' musical score in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I believe AIR is a very good choice for the next short anime-series you might want to watch. It asks only for your patience and observation. In return you get a wonderfully animated show with candy for your eyes, touching emotions on your heart, and another memory for your summer.",

            "content": "In a short summary, Air tries to do too much in it's limited time and flops. Air forces a complex plot on the viewer that doesn't fit well, which leads to its downfall.\r\n   Air's story starts out pretty simple, but soon takes some emotional turns with characters we've barely met. The logical choice would be for our MC to leave or ignore these girls who need help, but he becomes ever so close into figuring out his mother's  tale. 1 cour was not enough to fill even 1 route from the VN and in turn, leaves the anime viewerconfused as to what's happening. 3/10\\n\\n\r\n   The art and sound are excellent for the time, and still hold up today. The animation would still be considered nice to look at now, and the music is very emotional and works in favor of the writers wishes. 7/10 art and 6/10 sound. \\n\\n\r\n   The characters aren't anything amazing. Right at the start, we meet almost an entire harem for our MC, each with stereotypical traits and problems to be solved. This creates a predictable sense I don't like to have while watching a show for the first time. MC on the other hand is interesting and fun to watch; if only he found his way into a better plot.  4/10\\n\\n\r\n   I did not enjoy this as much as similar pieces (Kanon 2006 and Clannad). It was simply a bunch of sentimentality for characters that haven't been fully developed. The anime was boring after a while and confusing at that. 2/10 for enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\n   Overall, this is an average anime for our time. It did not excel enough to stand out, and is left in the dust by better SoL drama romances that came out after it. Not bad, but not worth the watch. The VN is a better option here if you want to enjoy the story to its fullest. 4.4/10",

            "content": "Air, unfortunatly, was the worst anime I've ever watched. It had alot of potential, but in the end it took a severe swerve onto the wtf-highway.\r\n Air is about Yukito Kunisaki, a young man who travels looking for a woman his mother had told him about in a story. On his travels, he meets Misuzu Kamio. The two become good friends, but a disease bed-rids Misuzu and leaves her fighting for her life.\r\n Now, up until that part, everything in the anime had been good, all the makings for a great ending. Until of course, as you'll see, it turned for the worst. As Misuzuis on her last legs, Yukito comes in and sacrifices himself to save her (it was a very hard-to-explain turn of events, and even if I told you it would spoil it).\\n\\n\r\n You are then sent on a long and boring arch of the life of a group of three living in Feudal Japan, and as before, its hard to explain and would spoil the anime.\\n\\n\r\n So now back to the main story, what do you find? A crow. Thats right, we are now following the life of a freaking crow. Yukito reincarnate, yea, but still a freakin crow. We go into this screwed up kind of recap where we see what we already watched, but now through a crow's eyes. Except now Yukito (who is not in crow form) runs away instead of helping Misuzu. \\n\\n\r\n Now we watch a few, final episodes watching Misuzu's condition decay and eventually have her *spoiler here* die. Then thats it, aside from a part where Yukito (in crow form) sets out on a journey to find the flying woman, again. But this time as a crow. Yea, a crow. This is how they end the anime.\\n\\n\r\n Air had good potential and its episodes leading up to that giant wtf-moment of an ending, heck it was a great anime up until then. Yet the ending totally washed any good feeling I had for this anime out, and all around was a really bad ending. \\n\\n\r\n I personally would not suggest watching this anime unless you like watching good episodes only to be given a horrid excuse for an end, but then again is up to you.",

            "content": "Key is famous for creating lovable characters that you come to like, and then ripping your heart with feels.  If you know anything about Key than you probably have heard of Clannad, Kanon and Air.  Each of them are harems (one guy goes after several different girls and eventually ends up with one of them), and usually each heroine is given their own subplot.  What makes Key better than 90% of these type of narratives is all of them usually amount to something; whether it is an overarching theme (Kanon) or an effective way to lead into something more (like Clannad AfterStory).  Air however... is disjointed and isn't as clear in its direction as the other two, but it had the potential to be something really amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 (above average)\\n\r\nClannad was more grounded.  Kanon is a mix between reality and supernatural.  Air takes the slice of life genre and attempts to go more to the supernatural side.  The first half of the story is your typical harem, and is in my opinion pretty mediocre.  Air tries to give each of its 4-5 heroines a sub plot in the span of 6 episodes... and the result is a hit and miss.  There was one potentially interesting story about a girl who may have had some real psychological issue, only to disappoint me by turning it into a \"supernatural phenomenon\", which ended up being surprisingly dull.  This isn't to say that supernatural elements can't be interesting.  In fact one arc at the end of the first half was well done, and just when I was starting to get used to it... they change the direction of the series completely.  One of the biggest problems I have with Air is that the first half barely amount to anything, and the characters that were built up are completely forgotten in the second half!  This results into 2 disjointed halves that don't mesh well.  This sudden awkward change in pace and direction leads to a cluttered and somewhat unfocused experience.  Fantasy is thrown in, the core relationship focus changes, and... a really strange transformation occurs (???).  This may sound like Air fell off the rails and became a train wreck.  But when the last few episodes came together, it blew me away.  These last three episodes are fantastic, packing a really powerful emotional punch, and even reaching heights that can compare with their best work.  It explores a complicated mother-daughter relationship, that I really don't see a lot in this medium of story telling.  It also culminates in what is, in my opinion, a really powerful bittersweet open ended ending.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10 (good characters overall, but a little mismanaged)\\n\r\nThe \"main character\" is a weird looking hobo named Yukito that goes around trying to get money as a puppeteer and fails miserably.  While he sounds interesting, he doesn't have much character development.  In fact, in the second half he is... shall I say... ignored.  The side characters are also not very memorable and don't have much relevance in the big picture.  However, the cast really shines with Misuzu and Haruko.  Misuzu is a kind, clumsy girl who finds Yukito and helps him out by letting him stay at her place with Haruko.  Initially, she seems to be a stereotypical not-so-bright naive blond girl, but when you find out something about her and follow her development in the second half... you will be surprised when she becomes a character you admire and really care about.  Haruko is the mother that adopts Misuzu and isn't the motherly type.  She doesn't seem to care much about Misuzu and appears to be incredibly irresponsible, and this creates an interesting dynamic that is explored brilliantly in the third act.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 (masterpiece)\\n\r\nSome of Key's best music.  Uses violin :) one of my favorite instruments.  Complements the setting perfectly, and delivers well on the dramatic front.  Also has a core theme that is very memorable and that I listen to regularly!  \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10 (excellent)\\n\r\nReally impressive for a 2005 anime, but the real reason this scores high is not how good it looks but how it is used.  It creates a fantastic setting full of mystery and wonder that perfectly complements the story they are trying to tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10 (mixed)\\n\r\nFor everything I liked there was something I didn't like, resulting in a mixed bag.  Overall, I admire Key for trying something new and attempt something outside what this genre usually presents.  If you enjoy their other works, I think you will enjoy it, but be ready for an unexpected turn in the second half.  While many people felt this is where it went downhill, try to give it a chance, because while it is a little clumsy, the vision they tried to reach was really admirable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (good)\\n",

Yes, \u201cAir\u201d is host to some of the most jaw-droppingly breathtaking art style I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Most of the shots comprise of wide, scenic views to capture glimpses of the beautifully animated sky, which is so expansive and gorgeous, that is becomes a character and presence itself throughout the course of the show, also tying into one of its major themes. These shots and backdropsof the shifting sky add to the grand folklore of the \u201cgirl in the sky\u201d, adding a majestic, but enigmatic power to the story.

His interactions with the various girls around the town are based mostly on his decisions to fill his stomach, but as the show progresses, he begins to grow an attachment to them, and we witness a great character arc that leads into a truly heartbreaking finale. The chemistry works particularly well with Yukito and Misuzu, but also Misuzu\u2019s guardian and aunt, Haruko, who is a raging alcoholic that becomes good friends with the protagonist. There\u2019s a sense of family here that\u2019s quite strong, even though it\u2019s pretty subtle. It\u2019s especially evident in the latter half of the show, but the first half I feel is where it truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has a very calm way of revealing itself, never forcing anything vital down your throat, but rather letting you decide how much plot you want at your own pace. It\u2019s a very meditative approach to usual narrative tropes seen in most romance genres, but \u201cAir\u201d insists on being patient, and hence, the audience has to be able to be as patient to capture the essence of it all. However, for those looking for a fast-paced, plot-heavy anime, this isn\u2019t the one for you. Even given it\u2019s relatively short 12-episode running time, there\u2019s so much space to breathe (pun not intended) that you\u2019re able to just sit back and let the gorgeous animation, characters, and light plot just soak in. To add to this incredibly atmospheric tone of the show is the music, which compliments it very well. It consists of mostly piano ballads over a soft techno-esque beat that adds a dreamy layer next to the animation. The combination of all these factors in any given scene where characters are facing the ocean view admiring the clouds and sky or just simply walking through town, is unbelievably euphoric. It definitely has a way of sucking you in. Though, not much can be said about a pretty rough few episodes\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThese episodes happen somewhere in the middle of the show, as it decides to take a time leap back into the past, tracing the origins of the \u201cgirl in the sky\u201d. See, what was great about the first half of the show is just how much this mysterious figure is mentioned, which creates a menacing but quite intriguing allure about her. The supernatural undertones work amazingly. As soon as this time leap into the past happens, it introduces us to a slew of characters that more or less destroy this allure perfectly set up before. It was unnecessary, but moreso, very dull and contrived. It was quite a kick back for people like myself who were really invested in the show, then it decides to introduce a new setting and characters at the drop of a dime. It\u2019s jarring, to say the least, and not nearly as interesting as you might think. Thankfully, this only last around two episodes before it takes us back into the main plot, where a random twist of inexplicable events occur that almost destroy this pre-conceived mindset of the mystery of the first half, but it has its special way of being funny while simultaneously breaking you down into tears, so I\u2019ll give it that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \u201cAir\u201d is one of the most visually unique anime I\u2019ve seen. It has breathtaking art style with a grand vision of the sky above a small town, adding to a powerful allure and mystery that compliments the legends of Yukito\u2019s \u201cgirl in the sky\u201d very well. The soundtrack is beautiful, combining haunting piano melodies with soothing trance beats (in what amounts to something akin to ATB), and the characters are very likable and have great chemistry. However, it\u2019s second half falters in many ways when it decides to be an entirely different show and genre, which will polarize a lot of people. It\u2019s only for a few episodes, but its impact leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mouth. Nonetheless, it manages to conclude itself in a kinda satisfactory way as the protagonist isn\u2019t exactly given the greatest of endings, but at the same time, leaves open a world of possibilities as to what lies beyond the vast oceans and skies of the world. I highly recommend seeing this one if you\u2019re a fan of supernatural romances that have a sense of beauty and fresh quality to them.",

This might be personal to me more than anyone else but the breathtaking soundtrack and visuals, and the story and unique characters all on the backdrop of a solitary summer make me feel so many emotions, not only to the amazing story that has roots over hundreds of years but how stuck it is in a summer of the mid-2000s,when the anime came out. I have so many fond memories of both that time and my experiences in anime, and they make for an amazing combination.\\n\\n\r\nJust like any other Key or KyoAni show, Air is incredibly saddening at times, yet comedic and dramatic amongst others to boot. It is a very prominent precursor to Clannad and Clannad: After Story in these departments, so if you like those then give Air a shot. Air is unique in it's setting and how it chooses to deal with it's characters, and that is why I love it so much.\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty standard and nothing special when it comes to casual scenes and the basic character designs, more along the lines of same old from a KyoAni show. But the backdrops and the depictions of the Winged Maiden throughout the show that truly take your breath away and are absolutely outstanding. The story could be paced a little better in my opinion, but it is immensely enjoyable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Air is a delightfully nostalgic trip into the past with an enjoyable storyline and unique characters and motivations. I highly recommend it for the experience.",

            "content": "Air ~ 1,000 Summer Review * \r\nWell, I've wrote many reviews just not on here... And I have to say this may be a little harder to write. There's really nothing wrong with this show its a beautiful piece of art ~!!  \r\nAir was originally a visual novel published by Key and adapted into a 13 episode anime by Kyoto Animation (the same studio behind Full Metal Panic! and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya). The anime follows a young traveling puppeteer named Yukito, as he comes to a quiet town on the coast. Here he meets a number of the town's inhabitants, most ofwhom happen to be high school girls. At this point, Air seems lightweight enough: it could easily be summed up with \"guy walks around talking to cute girls,\" and looks more like the beginning of a harem anime than anything else. Do not be fooled by this easygoing start, however - Air is anything but \"light.\"\\n\\n\r\nInitially, Air splits its focus between three of the high school girls. However, two of these girls end up with small, self-contained story arcs that don't really seem to add too much to the story. Both of them are entertaining, yes, but they don't seem to add anything to the real focus of the story: Misuzu's arc. Misuzu is a cheerful yet lonely girl and is the first person in the town that Yukito meets. However, as the two grow closer, Yukito discovers why Misuzu never seems to be able to make any friends: Every time she gets close to someone, she starts to have a mental breakdown. And as Misuzu starts to grow weak and sickly, Yukito realizes that Misuzu is remarkably similar to a girl his mother had been searching for; a winged girl who was fated to die young and alone. Each of these arcs combine elements of drama, tragedy, comedy, and romance, and it can get a little overwhelming at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you think this qualifies as a plot rollercoaster, all of the above happens within the first seven episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're familiar with other Key visual novel-based anime, then you probably know to expect an element of fantasy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the next arc (yes, there's more), a sequence that pulls the setting back to a thousand years ago, where a samurai named Ryuya and an attendant named Uraha help a truly winged-girl named Kanna to escape a life of imprisonment in a shrine. While the previous arcs present the viewer with a jumble of confusing ideas and plot elements, the flashback arc manages to tie all of these elements together in a way that not only works, but made me go \"Oh wow,\" as I started to connect the dots and see the strings that tied all of the plot elements and arcs together. It is a truly skillful show of storytelling, and it clears all of the confusion as it drives the series into its final, climactic arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe production quality of Air can only be described as \"excellent.\" Visually, the series is top-notch, with animation that one might expect to see in a film. But what really stands out about Air is its soundtrack. Whereas many anime series tend to leave music as an afterthought, Air takes the opposite approach. The series is full of exceptional scores, most of which were composed especially for either the game or the visual novel upon which it is based, and all of a quality that is rarely found in an anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Air Complete Series DVD set that I received for review is notably missing the thirteenth and final episode of the series. However, \"final\" here is something of a misnomer, because as I understand it, the thirteenth episode was simply a recap episode of the last arc, which concludes with episode twelve. In addition to the full series, though, the set contains two additional episodes, collectively titled Air in Summer. These two episodes accompany the flashback arc, filling in scenes and fleshing it out a bit more. While entertaining, Air in Summer mostly consists of lighthearted humor, and while entertaining, isn't really necessary to the completion of the series.\\n\\n\r\nReally, Air is a rare feat. While many anime series can spend hundreds of episodes tying up plots, Air manages to pack an incredibly complex story into only twelve. While it may seem overwhelming at times, by the end of the series, all of the plot threads tie together into a single, complete, and immensely entertaining drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRead more at http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/anime/6931-Anime-Review-Air#BxCO3h6vjW8OmQXx.99",

            "content": "So it's another Key/Kyoani series, and you're searching for the magic you found in Clannad/Kanon, but you're not sure if it's really worth your time. \r\nIn this review, I will be comparing AIR with the other Key Productions, Clannad and Kanon a lot. Honestly, I only watched AIR because I disliked Clannad and Kanon(2006), and didn't want to be biased when discussing these Key/Kyoani productions. So, basically I had a bad first impression of the series. But I finally decided to watch it in the end. and AIR is just Awesome! \r\nStory (10/10)\r\nOf course, the very essence of Key's harem animes are touching stories. andthis theme is very similar in AIR as well, so fans of Clannad and Kanon would surely love the story too. However, there are a few big differences in AIR compared to Clannad and Kanon. Personally, Kanon and Clannad's stories, especially the goodbyes, are always sad, depressing and tear-jerking. a sad episode will leave you in a slump for days. On the other hand, in AIR, the goodbyes are so beautiful you can't help crying and smiling at the same time. \\n\r\nAnother difference is in the miracles/supernatural part of the stories. For Clannad and Kanon, the miracles and supernatural things that happen are usually never explained and leave us in the dark, and most of the miracles are very separate/unconnected with each other. But in AIR, the whole story is connected, and there is also a side story which explains the miracles/supernatural things which happen perfectly and beautifully.\\n\r\nThe plot twist for AIR is also very well done and leaves absolutely no room for any complain, although it would be very surprising at first. Well, a plot twist is supposed to be surprising, and it also shows how creative the plot is, because I really never would've seen it coming.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation(9/10)\\n\r\nAIR has a tendency of stressing on dark lines, especially for the characters, which makes them look a bit out of place against the backgrounds sometimes. However, it does a very good job making the city come alive for audiences(the city in the setting exists in reality). the character design is also comparable to Kanon and Clannad imo. There are some ppl who might say it's old and those eyes are too BIG, but look at Kanon 2006 and Clannad. It hasn't changed much, and it's beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)\\n\r\nAIR's OPED are quite well done, and very heartwarming. the music and bgm is also very well used. It doesn't feel overdone, and is pretty much natural. The Voice Actors are not really the best. one of the characters' voice feels unnatural and forced. however, this isn't very apparent, so i'm not really complaining. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10)\\n\r\nAIR doesn't have as many characters as Kanon and Clannad, but for a 13-episode anime, it's more than enough, and the character development feels so much deeper and more meaningful. The 3 main girls are very unique compared to each other, and are very amusing to watch. Not just the main characters, but the side characters grow so much. Unlike Clannad and Kanon, in which a girl disappears and life just goes on for everyone, AIR really shows the changes in the characters after the events. \\n\r\nThe characters in the side story are also very interesting, unique, and loveable. Their character development is explained in more detail in the DVD specials. \\n\r\nIn terms of popularity, AIR characters have very few fans when compared to Kanon and Clannad characters. I do not think this is due to the character design/development, but more to the publicity and fan distribution. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) \\n\r\nWhen watching animes, my enjoyment level usually depends on my mood and first impression of the anime. Hence, it is very amazing that AIR managed to really changed my mind about it even though I decided to watch it reluctantly. In a way, AIR is a miracle to me. The casual jokes made me laugh, the girls made my heart jump, and the goodbyes made me cry and smile at the same time. An anime I enjoy so much is very rare for me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nAIR is just so beautiful and so close to heart. It really makes the world seem brighter to you, when you remind yourself of the endless sky, sea, and AIR's 1000 Summers.\\n\r\nI really wish more people would watch AIR and realize the beauty and miracles in it, which I couldn't find in Kanon or Clannad.",

            "content": "Air, like Clannad is based off a visual novel by Key but unlike Clannad it falls flat on the viewer.\r\nThere's nothing wrong with the art, sound and story of Air. The story is an interesting concept and at first I was excited to watch this series. I hoped it would be like Clannad, and also, my boyfriend was telling me to watch this series and he normally has good tastes. It started to feel like a chore after only a few episodes.\r\nMy problem with Air is that it needed to be longer. If it was longer, I believe that would have fixed the major problemsthat I have with this series. The story centres around the main character helping three young girls with their troubles. Since this also created by those that made Clannad, expect drama and tragedy to be apart of these girls' lives.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I don't have a problem with tragedy as long as the character development is okay, as opposed to being melodramatic or manipulative into making you think you care about the character... Well, Air seems kind of like a mixture of the latter two things I said. Not enough time is given to develop the characters before their drama is introduced and absolutely no time at all is given afterwards to see how they changed after receiving help from the main character, with the exception of the main character, Misuzu. If the whole series focused on Misuzu from the start without needing to include the other side characters' stories, I think it would have been better. The sudden turn of events that affects Misuzu near the end seem rather sudden...\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the series has a few episodes devoted to back-story inserted right into the middle of it. It was a change of pace... but a slow, boring one. I think it would have been more bearable to watch if the back-story was chopped up into little snippets sprinkled throughout the first half of the season, but alas, it was not. Instead we are forced to watch some random characters that appear out of nowhere for a few episodes before returning to the true story of Misuzu.\\n\\n\r\nMisuzu was truly the only thing I cared about in his anime. As a character she is interesting, and the most well developed, and pretty unique despite being a \"cute, clumsy and childish\" girl.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end I give it a 6/10. If you are a fan of Clannad you'll probably like this, despite it's failings.",

            "content": "I usually don't drop anime,but this show made me simply bored.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nVery confusing.I like stories with supernatural elements,but this one just made no sense at all. The first two episodes started out good,but after that it was confusing and hard to follow. Also,half of the episodes are fillers. The girls introduced in the filler arcs,just disappeared after their problem gets solved,making them useless. The story itself was unique and had potential,but they showed it in a confusing way,making it boring to follow. It's also pretty predictable. I instantly knew Misuzu was the girl Yukito was looking for.\r\nArt  6/10\r\nI honestly didn't like it. The backgroundswere done nicely,but the character's faces looked very out of proportion to me. I guess that's a personal thing,but I didn't enjoy the anime for its visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was good. I liked the opening theme and the other music fitted the atmosphere of this show very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMost characters were pretty dull.\\n\\n\r\nYukito was just your typical nice guy,trying to help everyone he sees.\\n\r\nMisuzu was kind of unique,but very annoying at the same time.\\n\r\nKano was just really pointless. They could have made her a good character,but she instantly gets forgotten after her arc.\\n\r\nMinagi is kind of the same,while she has a bit more emotional story,she's just a filler in the end. Also,the way she talks sounds so soulless to me.\\n\r\nMichiru was the most entertaining character to me.Her happiness and energy just makes me smile while watching her scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI really did not get much enjoyment out of this. Air had its moment,but none of them actually made me cry or feel very emotional. I just didn't feel the connection with the characters,probably because there wasn't much character development at all. The art wasn't very enjoyable either.......neither was the story. Half of the time I didn't get what was going on and it felt like a mess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nTo me,Air is like Clannad with less comedy,less character development and an more confusing story. In My opinion it just tries too hard to make you feel emotional.   If you enjoyed Clannad or enjoy magical stories that are emotional this anime might be for you...\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this anime,but I found it kinda boring.  I guess it's just not my type of show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It may seem a little confusing at first, but you'll understand it more when you watch it a few more times. The story goes with an arc feature which segments the main character's lives and development as they progress along and familiarize with other people. \r\nAir was visually beautiful and has a wonderful storytelling setting. It was narrated in the viewpoint of the main character Yukito, and how his life was changed by one girl. Its a very good anime with an awesome storyline, but like I said confusing atfirst view. It may take a while to completely understand the story in detail. Its a sad story, but worthwhile to watch. Definitely watch it and see for yourself!",

            "content": "Why did I choose Air, which is essentially the prototype Clannad? The opening theme was pretty cool, and I figured I could poke fun at the character designs; poking fun being my machete that I use to indiscriminately cut through the layers of crystallized sap to get to the juicy meat of the series.\r\n However, after I cut through all the aforementioned sap, there was hardly any meat for me to gorge myself on. It was like prying open a giant clam to get to a pearl, only to find it conveniently replaced by an I.O.U and a cinderblock.\r\nIn Air, a struggling puppeteer named YukitoKunisaki has arrived in a small coastal town to ply his trade. He\u2019s in search of a flying woman who his mother told him about, for reasons that are explained later. One day, while at the mercy of the harsh sun, a clumsy moeblob named Misuzu offers him a drink and a place to rest against all common sense. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there a friendship is forged which lasts a few days, Misuzu\u2019s dreams seem to take an adverse effect on her health, and Yukito acts as the catalyst for a lot of crazy shit. If you\u2019ve played any dating sim at all, or watched any dating sim adaptation, the setup will be all too familiar.\\n\\n\r\nI wish I could say that the plot is transparent and practically nonexistent, favoring instead the \u2018Cute girls do cute things\u2019 approach. It would\u2019ve been easy to wrap things up with a witty quip like \u201cThe plot in Air is as visible and substantive as its namesake.\u201d But no, this is Key Visual Arts; a company that has to shoehorn personal drama and supernatural occurrences in whenever possible to tug heartstrings, regardless of how well placed such plot devices are. And they\u2019re stuffed into every available crevice that they can be stuffed in, severely diminishing the impact.\\n\\n\r\nAll 13 episodes are crammed so full of details and plot points that it\u2019s almost suffocating. And for the first half, it even has the gall to not succeed with the drama, compounding the problems exponentially.\\n\\n\r\nIn the series\u2019 defense though, the main plot isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s actually even touching at points, especially in the last few episodes. Not even close to the point of making me cry, but the second half is a compelling drama that I can find little to complain about. I may not have liked it as much as I would\u2019ve hoped, seeing as there was still so much crammed in that didn\u2019t need to be, but there isn\u2019t anything to really attack. No, for a number of reasons, the majority of my plot complaints are reserved for the first two thirds and the story arcs that comprise them.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the well laid out, well paced main arc that explains Misuzu\u2019s general oddness in relation to her past and the dreams that she\u2019s having, the first two are highly concentrated, irregularly paced messes that come off as more than a little sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is anything that I can deride plot-wise above everything else, it\u2019s that things get resolved too easily, and just to get the message across that \u201cLIFE\u2019S A MIRACLE\u201d, or \u201cMEMORIES AND FAMILY ARE IMPORTANT.\u201d Most of these people just need to talk about their problems and they seem to magically disappear. It doesn\u2019t make Yukito look useful, even when it should.\\n\\n\r\nRather than being a direct part of what he sets into motion, he\u2019s just a bystander like the audience, left gawking at what his presence has unleashed. Hell, in the last half he\u2019s entirely relegated to bystander in an unlikely form. While he\u2019s a decent enough character, certainly my favorite of the entire ordeal, it\u2019s when he\u2019s forced into stepping aside for Misuzu and her aunt to resolve their problems that the show really hits its stride.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Air is gorgeous. The music is moving (Again, pointing anybody toward the opening who hasn\u2019t heard it yet), the backdrops are beautiful, and the animation is mostly fluid. The one area where it starts to get a bit iffy is with the characters, which will be explained further later in the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves run the spectrum from boring and trite to not quite boring, but far from Character of the Year material. Of special mention is Misuzu, who fits in one of my two criteria for acceptable moe in anime:\\n\\n\r\n- The character has subtle traits that contribute to their personality as a whole, rather than remaining disjointed and just there to make them seem unique. Example: Akari Mizunashi from Aria.\\n\\n\r\n- It\u2019s explained to be the direct result of some kind of mental or physical impairment, and thus can\u2019t be helped. Example: Misuzu\\n\\n\r\nMisuzu does many, many annoying things: She trips over herself constantly, she has a verbal tic that makes her sound like a dying cat, she cries whenever she gets close to somebody, she acts way too childish for her own good and has the social grace of a nine year old, and she remains unfailingly nice despite her self-imposed isolation from the world at large.\\n\r\n However, none of this is directly her fault, so it\u2019s infinitely more tolerable (Unlike Yui from K-ON, who I can only assume is more than a little touched in the head). Despite all this and her overall lack of usefulness, Misuzu remains difficult to hate as a whole. I even caught myself caring about her fate in the end, and that almost never happens with these kinds of shows. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh at some things that I don\u2019t think I was meant to, or plugging in that Baywatch music during every instance of slow motion running, but my sympathy for her was true.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few instances of conversation that were just laughable or not what any person, regardless of normality, would have. For instance, Yukito finally gives in to Misuzu\u2019s incessant demands to play cards with her. When she lays out the cards, she has a freakout and starts breaking down.\\n\\n\r\n Rather than getting help or asking if she\u2019s alright while going over to comfort her, he sits there dumbfounded and asks if she\u2019s crying. It ruined what could\u2019ve been a jarring, yet heartrending scene.\\n\\n\r\nAir TV is good. It isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s far from mediocre. A rushed and cluttered first half isn\u2019t made up for by a mostly excellent second half, but it almost comes close. Basically, if you liked Clannad or Kanon or pretty much anything that Jun Maeda has penned, yet you haven\u2019t watched this anime for whatever reason, Air should be right up your alley. And if not\u2026 well, check it out anyway. If you noticed all my uses of the word moe in this review, that should clue you in. In the end, it\u2019s a competent and memorable, if imperfect series.",

            "content": "I just had to write a review for Air because this was honestly one of the most confusing animes I have ever watched.\r\nStory (5/10)\r\nThe story is about a dude named Yukito and how helps out a bunch of stray animals...er I mean girls. In addition to Yukito's new animal rescue center, he is looking for \"the girl in the sky.\" Makes about as much sense as it sounds.\r\nKey's animes are usually really formulaic. You have this one guy with absolutely no testosterone (unless you play the visual novel) surrounded by a bunch of girls who are either dying, or have some sort problem only theguy can solve. \\n\r\nAir is no exception, and just like Clannad and Kanon, Air has some supernatural elements as well. But unlike Clannad and Kanon, the\"magic\" in Air is very poorly explained. In fact, the supernatural aspect of Air is so poorly explained that the last five episodes made absolutely no sense. I seriously wonder what the main conflict of the story was, because the ending did not make it clear whether whatever the conflict was was resolved or not. It just...ended. \\n\r\nAir also suffered from one of Key's problems which I call, \"the abandonment of little girls.\" No,  Yukito doesn't abandon them, the story does. Once each girl's arc is finished, that's the end of her. She will not appear for the rest of the anime, in fact, It'll be like she never existed at all! In conclusion, Air's predictable and confusing storyline made the show less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (6/10):\\n\r\nThere's nothing really to say about this. The background is animated well, but the characters look kind of weird to me. Like they have squashed faces. Of course this is extremely subjective. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10) \\n\r\nThe opening and closing were perfect for the tone of the anime itself. I have no complains with the voice acting itself, I watched nine episodes subbed and one dubbed. The dub sounds fine, not annoying at all.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (4/10)\\n\r\n This is were the shortness of air really affects it. Like I said previously, each of the characters were introduced, became friends with Yukito, Yukito would solve their problem, and then...they would disappear. This was due to the thirteen episode limit, so there wasn't a satisfying amount of character development. The personalities of the characters themselves were very bland. \\n\\n\r\nYukito: This guy pretty much has no personality. He adopts the cliched \"nice guy\" personality that is were uninteresting. Yukito was more of a plot device than a character.   \\n\\n\r\nMisuzu: She reminds me of Sakura from Naruto. Basically she doesn't want to burden anyone and has minimal social skills. On the other hand, she is a very interesting character and is concerned about people. So I guess I can't hate her. \\n\\n\r\nKano: I barely remember anything about her because she was the first arc. It would have been nice if she appeared even once after her arc ended, at least I'd know she was alive. \\n\\n\r\nMinagi: Probably my favorite character in the series, her story is truly sad and she has an interesting personality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (5/10) \\n\r\ni was really enjoying this at the first half of the series, but the other half ruined it for me. It was just too confusing and I couldn't focus on the episodes properly because I was wondering, \"What the hell is going on?\" Unlike most of Key's other works, Air didn't really pull on my heartstrings and I was constantly bored towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (6/10)\\n\r\nA six is fair and that is what Air is. The anime did have it's moments, but it really wasn't that good. I think people should only watch Air if they have very good comprehensive abilities, or they are really big fans of Key. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First let me just say that I love Key's anime. Kanon (2006), Clannad+AS, Angel Beats!, etc., I really enjoyed and loved them all, cheesiness and all (I'm looking at you Kanon). But Air just wasn't that good. I wanted it to be, and it certainly had the potential, with an interesting plot base and great music and art, but overall it just falls flat. None of the standard Key heart wrenching moments really got to me, excepting the final climax moment, which is by far the most well done part of the anime. Some much potential was wasted in this anime, resulting in a ratherclunky mess.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\r\nThe story is good enough starting out. Yukito is a wandering puppeteer who carries on his family's tradition of seeking the legendary \"Girl in the Sky\". He stops at a quaint seaside town where he meets three girls, Kano Kirishima, Minagi Tohno, and Misuzu Kamio. Sounds like your typical Key anime right? Well, it is, but the only problem is that none of the characters are any good! Yukito is like Tomoya from Clannad without the likability. He's cynical and makes snide remarks much like early Clannad Tomoya. But he really never gets any better. Not to mention the frustrating turn his character takes late in the anime that is not only confusing but just stupid. The girls are all cardboard and uninteresting, with Kano and Minagi getting 2 episodes each for charecter development and their arcs. Not a lot of time to really make them any more interesting. And Misuzu, who is the deurotagonist of Air along with Yukito, is your standard Moe charecter, and is rather uninteresting, even by Key standards. The story tries to hard to be complex to the point where it's confusing and stupid. I refer once again to the change Yukito goes through late in the series. It's explained at the very end of an episode and very poorly at that. The story was interesting at first but got derailed by stupid plot choices and twists. \\n\\n\r\nOverall for Story/Charecters: 3.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nNow comes what Air does well. The animation and art are solid, coming from KyoAni, who is one of the best studios to call when you want a high quality looking anime. The soundtrack is gorgeous and very fitting to the moods the anime sets up. I watched the dub, which is pretty good, but I can't speak for the sub, but I assume it is good as well. Not really much to say here, I never had a problem with the animation or the soundtrack/voices. All solid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for Art/Sound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I watched Air, I kept pausing to do something else and got back to \\n\r\nwatching it 10 minutes later. That should sum up how much I enjoyed the series. It was decent and even good is some parts, but the rest just sucks. It drags and drags until I'm barely even watching it any more, I just looking at the moving picture on the screen. In short, I didn't like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for Enjoyment:3/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n Air could have been great. Honestly if it were 26 episodes long, it would have the time to make me actually care about the characters and develop them more. But it's 12 episodes, with 1 summary episode. Not enough time to make me care about otherwise bland characters. I was disappointed  in this anime, as it's gotten really good reviews and the considered by some to be Key's best offering. But, sadly, I did not like it. Now don't let my opinion get in your way of watching it. Maybe you'll get something out of it that I didn't. But overall, I never liked Air, and I probably never will.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 4/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I am absolutely in love with it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is very unique and genuine. You follow around the new guy in town, named Yukito Kunisaki. He meets a girl named Misuzu with a very strange past. It's almost painful to hear about it. Such a beautiful and kind girl with such a hard life. The story moves at a very fast rate, as it is too short to move slow.\r\nArt:\r\nKyoto Animation did this, so obviously it is going to be amazing butwow. The art and animation is flawless. Beautiful!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme \"Tori no Uta\" sung by Lia is amazing. My favorite opening theme of all time. The score mostly consisted of piano tracks and electronic keyboards, but it fit so beautifully with the show. The insert song \"Aozora\" makes me tear up everytime I hear it. And the ending theme, \"Farewell Song\" is one of my favorite songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere are very few characters in this series, but they are all incredibly important. Yukito is the main lead with other leads being taken by Misuzu, Kano, and Minagi, all with a different story. Very sad and touching stories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf I didn't enjoy this I don't think I would keep re-watching it over and over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBeautiful story and I highly recommend this to anyone, even if they don't like anime.

            "content": "Air is an anime based off of an Eroge, or erotic game. No, I have not played the game, but it's pretty disturbing when you notice that most of the major female characters look and act like they're around thirteen or fourteen years old. Fortunately, the anime removes all the erotic content. So the real question is if the story aspect is strong enough to gain appeal by itself or if the game was only somewhat popular for the shameless and disturbing sex appeal.\r\nThe story revolves around a young traveler named Yukito who arrives in a small village. He collapses from hunger and ends upmeeting a strange girl named Misuzu who offers to let him stay at her house. Yukito quickly gets caught up in the strange events surrounding several girls in the village, including Misuzu. The story is pretty simple, but it's very sloppily written. There are several episodes that exist solely for unnecessary exposition, I call it \"unnecessary\" because you should have figured out all the details that are relevant to the major plot if you've been paying any kind of attention. Then there are important details, like the thing with Sora, that are glossed over and don't make much sense. The ending could have been really strong, but the last few minutes of the twelfth episode are just really random and stupid and then there's a pointless recap episode. As I said, very sloppy work.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are pretty flat. They only play a major role in a couple episodes and then they fade into the background. You aren't given time to acclimate to them or any real reasons to care about them. The only characters that you have any incentive to care about are Misuzu, Yukito and Haruko. To be fair, the three of them do get some really good interactions and develop nicely over the course of the series, but the lack of depth or development for the other characters makes those few episodes surrounding them rather pointless. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent. The character designs are pretty well done, but the backgrounds look pretty bland most of the time and there are a few moments where the art visibly degrades for no real reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting isn't bad but it isn't anything special either. There aren't any really spectacular performances nor are there any really terrible performances. It's all very mediocre. The music is really soothing and does suit the series pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. All of the major interactions between female characters explores a familial bond, mostly maternal. You get some interaction between Misuzu and the other girls, but she's more of a passive observer during those moments and she doesn't really interact with the other girls.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Air is a 5.4/10. It's mediocre overall. It has some charming moments, but the writing is really sloppy and every truly good moment is offset by several pointless and/or downright stupid moments. If you like Kanon you'll probably enjoy this as well, albeit slightly less. Otherwise, you may want to try it since it's short and does have some charm, particularly in the last couple episodes (not counting thirteen). Just be aware that you're going to have to slog through a lot of pointless interludes to reach those moments so you might just want to skip it.",

            "content": "\"The 1000th Summer\"... I still get chills down my spine whenever I see or hear that phrase. The moment I saw that single sentence, I knew I found another great masterpiece by Key.\r\nEven though I had to watch the series twice in order to fully understand the entire story, it was personally better watching it the second time. Not only did I understand it more, I cried even more. Let's face it, those who don't cry while watching Clannad, Kanon, Angel Beats, or Air either hate showing emotions, or they have no soul. That's exactly what I love about Key though, their work is soemotional that you can't help but cry. Watched this with like 5 of my friends, not one of us were embarrassed when we started crying. We didn't care who we were with, we just let it all out.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, no anime could make me cry as much as I did in Clannad, but this was a close 2nd or 3rd. I wish that this show was more than 12 episodes with 2 OVA's, but I'm still glad that it was made either way. I guess the reason I say that is because there were only 3 story lines, so there were only 3 girls, so I guess it's just unusual for something made by Key, usually they have at least 5 or 6 stories in the show, but I still loved each one.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories were each really good, above all I think Misuzu's story line was the best, but that's just my opinion. What I liked about each one was that each of the characters were dealing with something either sad or painful in their life, and I don't mean I like that they're in pain or anything, I'm saying I think that it makes the show better if they have that kind of stuff. Some of the episodes kind of dragged the story out a little bit, but it isn't really a big deal, it was still good.\\n\\n\r\nLike the rest of Key's work, their artwork is always top grade. The character art was really good, I liked how each character was designed, and the scenery was beautiful. My favorite part of the scenery would have to be the ocean, in fact, I am pretty sure that's what Key was going for when they made Air, judging from how much the ocean is mentioned in the show. Very smart.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that Monica Rial was the last person that I would have expected to become the voice of Misuzu, just because in the Japanese version of air, she seems like a really shy and quiet girl, and just thinking of what kind of characters Monica Rial acted as (Renge from Ouran HighSchool Host Club, Shiro from Deadman Wonderland, Konoka from Negima!?, etc.), I guess I just thought of her as the actress to act as hyperactive girls, but I gotta say I was impressed how well she did. Her and Vic Mignogna were the best actors in the show, I always love their work. The rest of the voice actors/actresses matched their characters just how I expected, and I was really happy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, gotta love them all. Yukito is cool and funny,, Misuzu is adorable, Potato is cute (for an alien bred dog), etc. Also one of Key's strong suits. The ability to make awesome characters for their shows.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a lot, the OVA's were a little bit slow, but good. I got really emotional throughout the show, and I'm guessing anyone who got emotional with the rest of Key's work, I'm almost 100% sure you will in this too. If you are truly a fan of Key, you gotta watch Air. The Key Experience isn't complete unless you watch Angel Beats, Clannad, Kanon, and now Air.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped.",

            "content": "\"I guess people can't live without their memories, but I don't think it's possible to live on nothing but memories, either. Everybody has to wake up from their dreams sometimes.\" - Michiru\r\nNow with videographix! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ0e-7SSI00\r\n\"Do YOU have magical powers?\r\nAre you now or have you ever considered becoming a broke vagrant?\r\nWell, fret no more! In Bum Simulator 2005, you can be all of these things- and for your troubles, a myriad of schoolgirls with health problems and terrible home lives will flock to you! \r\nSuch things like feeding yourself from the garbage and finding a dry bridge to sleep under will never be a problem again!They'll give youmoney, invite you into their homes, and feed you, all for free! Life has never been better!\"\\n\\n\r\nUntil life hits you right in the tragedy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\\n\\n\r\nAir is 10 years old this year, and while not a bad looking show by any means, it has moments of weakness. There are a lot of great qualities about it though, especially the backgrounds and scenery. Occasionally the character models fall off and drop to a very low detail level and there are more than a few stillframes and pans over them, but overall a nice looking show- even if I don't care for the enormous bug eyes that take up a third of each female character's face. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this is about as good of a performance as one can get from Monica Rial and Vic Mignogna. Vic sounds appropriately indignant, bored, and playfully angry, along with an emotive performance, befitting of a young man who actually cares about his female companion's well being. \\n\\n\r\nI've long maintained that Monica Rial was best in Panty and Stocking, but I might have to reorder my list after this. I did not know that she was capable of playing a dramatic, tragic, and nuanced role as she did in Misuzu. She was legitimately awesome in this; totally believable in the role of an immature, wistful, and sick, but hopeful young girl. \\n\\n\r\nThere were no hammy performances, and no false-feeling emotional scenes- every bit of it was all one could have hoped for in a heartfelt drama. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Air is the true beauty- with soft, melancholy piano melodies, and a mixture of ethereal, airy sounding background music, including an excellently fitting opening song, \"Tori no Uta\"; (Bird's Poem) that combines danceable bass beats with the celestial qualities of the vocals and string sections. \\n\\n\\n\r\nContrivances and Story: \\n\\n\r\nI think the whole show could be described as a very long, very thin Red String of Fate. This theme of long distant past events affecting the present day is fairly common in media, however, Air's usage of it relies on several plot conveniences that I just cannot forgive. I understand that they were trying to make the plot into a tragic love story, but the means by which they use to get there are, honestly, poor, and would have functioned much better and been more believable with only very slight changes to the story. \\n\\n\r\nI was following along well up until episodes 8 and 9. I lost it when the plot decides to make an unexpected jump off a cliff straight back in time a thousand years. That one paragraph of exposition at the end of episode 9 mostly straightened it out, but still, the show was about 70 miles into a 100 mile trip, flipped on the left blinker and cruised straight out of the country and into the ocean. \\n\\n\r\nI was, and am certainly not alone in being totally lost in 8 and 9, didn't know who the characters were or why I should care that this character's mother died; I just really didn't know why I was supposed to care about these characters you force on me for two episodes in the middle of a story- with very little explanation as to why it's important, only to have the supposed importance of it absolutely quashed in the end in favor of a emotionally manipulating tragic ending. \\n\r\nThe show had just spent the last 7 episodes building this relationship between Misuzu and Yukito up, only to hand me three new characters who, by the end of the show, aren't even that important. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this trip in time was supposed to make me feel bad for the winged people because they were used as weapons?? What kind of tacked on tragedy is that? Why can't people just hate them because they have wings?? Why do these people even need to have wings? Why can't they be just some minority that the feudal Japanese of the time discriminated against? \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis little episode also introduced the absolute thirstiest chick I've ever seen in anime. \\n\r\nWoman to her best friend's lover: \"Ryuuya, there's only one way to help Kanna now, you and I must have a child together.\"\\n\\n\r\nOkay seriously? The lover and best friend of the afflicted winged person have to have a child so that the child of their great great great grandchild's grandchild's great grand child MIGHT end up helping the reincarnated form of your friend??? \\n\r\nWhat made them think that was going to work??? \\n\r\nWhat if one of the kids 200 years down the line decides, \"you know what, screw this girl in the sky garbage, who even cares?\" and it ended there?\\n\r\nWhat about infertility? \\n\r\nWhat if one of the descendants got cholera and died before they had children? They didn't have Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccines back in 994 AD. \\n\\n\r\nThe show relies on this convenience heavily, only for it to totally come apart and mean nothing at the end! \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story could have been revamped with a much simpler, yet equally tragic plot without relying on these extreme conveniences for melodrama: make the main heroine just ill, with a hereditary terminal disease instead of inheriting a cursed soul that her body can't contain. Male character who's unaware of her condition and just thinks she's a bit strange befriends her, they develop a relationship, and then it changes from a cute love story to a terrible tragedy of lovers. The other characters do their best to help treat it, to no avail, and eventually (if you want your magic tie-in), through some circumstance, a miracle happens, and the girl is saved, or- maintain the tragedy and she becomes more ill anyway.\\n\\n\r\nNone of this thousand year old curse nonsense that even MANIFESTS ITSELF AS A DISEASE! No ridiculous \"my descendants will help save this person's reincarnated form in the far future!\", and no stupid reincarnation. Magic in shows is fine, but this show takes a couple pages out of the rule same book Code Geass got its internal consistency from. \\n\\n\r\nMinor Gripe:\\n\\n\r\nI don't even remember how Kanna KNEW WHERE HER MOTHER WAS! She said in the beginning that she didn't even remember her mother, and then she and her friends magically knew where to find the mother because of the female best friend's magical \"woman's intuition\" equivalent of GPS tracking. \\n\r\nAnd a guy becomes a crow. \\n\r\nSeriously, I can't make this up. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 6\\n\\n\r\nI want to like Air, because it's a pretty sweet story about tragedy, but there were some so incomprehensibly stupid moments about it that broke it for me. In spite of a forgettable cast of supporting characters and a few plot threads that really don't go anywhere, I'll give it a pass, because it's a nice little story, and I enjoyed it for the most part- it just could have done with some good editing before it was put to paper in the form it came out in.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Y'know everybody holds the idiot ball from time to time. Except this one girl played keep away with it... Forever. She took it home and never gave it back.\"\\n",

            "content": "The sky may represent endless beauty and wonder, but it doesn't take rocket science to fathom this as shown in this quaint lil' show.\r\nKey's first adaption is quickly looking to be like FMA 1st series; overlooked for newer stuff, under appreciated for subjective reasons that insult its worth, and undeserved treatment as being taken as the \"lesser\" ver. of the new stuff.\r\nFor shame.\r\nAir isn't rocket science, but compared to how many half-assed premise based moe fodder gets churned out every single season these past 2-3 years, it feels like it is!\r\nBut I won't start a holiday over passable entertainment so don't worry.\r\nRight off the batAir does two things that both, subsequent Key series and recent moe, wrote off:\\n\r\n1. Connect with the character with easygoing, folksy behavior.\\n\r\n2. Allows the thematics to come from simple understandable passions.\\n\r\nOur hero, Yukito may be the lead, but he doesn't really care at first for why he can do uninspired magic tricks; he's just using it to feed himself.\\n\r\nSo he comes across a town that is as simple and mysterious as the air itself and becomes \"acquainted\" with three girls.\\n\r\nNo, they do not love him within 1-2 eps.\\n\r\nNo, they do not make him lunch after he does something shallow (he takes it! WA HA HA!)\\n\r\nNo, they do not place him higher than people they've known for years- wait. There's other people that know the heroines?! Wow... in most other series, we just have the underaged characters and that's it... fascinating...\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Air keeps itself in check; to be cute is only half of its gain, the other half is to solidly mystify.\\n\r\nSo Madoka is labeled with doing the same, but why?\\n\r\nAir may not be heavy on plotting, but means do justify the ends it wants; think of a wishy-washy Spielberg film where you know its melodramatic, but within reason.\\n\r\nYukito is ambiguously aged which serves his case as being a lightly seasoned wanderer, and plucky enough to associate with such spirited teens.\\n\r\nThe heroines' passions are all based on unconditional love that which they've cherished but has remained stagnant.\\n\\n\r\nIntelligently, Yukito isn't used as the \"answer\" so much as the overlooking catalyst; once a heroine has her affairs settled, they \"move on\".\\n\r\nSo abandoning some heroines to expand upon another might be considered \"convenient\", but I wouldn't rule it out as being brainless. There's worse... (Clannad...)\\n\\n\r\nMade in '05, Air is a treat of its time; KyoAni's destiny was set from here.\\n\r\nEarthy lighting, breeziness fitting of its ocean side, distant sweeping camera angles of town and beach. This is a trademark to be milked and milked so one could watch this to see roots of a now \"classic\" technique.\\n\\n\r\nAir's OP is, in my book, legendary. It's spirited; like the heavens. It's unrelenting; like the gusts. And it's resonating; like....... wind chimes..... :P\\n\r\nThe END is disappointingly conventional so the less said, the better.\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, it feels like a video game at times but almost to an idiosyncratic point; perhaps Jun Meada was playing it safe here but at least it doesn't add an extra layer of pretentiousness that invades later series.\\n\\n\r\nAir's eclectic blend of lesser parts comes out to be emotionally satisfying for those who're inexperienced with moe, and for those that don't like cutsy OTT.\\n\r\nThis, obviously, makes it much more accessible to a wider audience and doesn't even have any fanservice! (the one positive trademark about the Key franchise is thankfully preserved)\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a piano (the show, not the soundtrack), but it makes an honest and sustainable entry to modern moe.\\n\r\nWhether it stands the test of time however depends on whether its values are recognized and defended against.\\n\r\nYour welcome. :)\\n\\n\r\nLetter Grading Time (LGT)\\n\r\nStory: B (does what it sets out to do with solid footing all the way)\\n\r\nArt: A- (the template is crinkled up and worn now, but it feels fresh here despite the age)\\n\r\nSound: B- (eh, a little humdrum and overused [think Naruto] but that OP ROCKS!)\\n\r\nAnimation: B (touch and go, but sturdy)\\n\r\nCharacter: C+ (typical for moe, but with greater reinforcement and wittier humor)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: B- (typical for moe, but, like the story, matches sentiment with intent more so than not)\\n\r\nOverall: B (if you like moe, pay respect to its roots. if you're curious, good as place as any)",

            "content": "Whenever a person writes a paper for school, they always start with a rough draft. They read it over a few times to check for grammatical and punctuation errors. Then, they will show their paper to their peers to get advice, take it to their school\u2019s writing center for review, and perhaps read it out loud to themselves. Until the words flow on the paper just right, and the point of the paper is made clear, the paper should not be turned in. \r\nThe way the story of Air is told kinda feels like the rough draft for Kanon (2006), which would then become improvedin Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you look at my profile, you will see that I am very fond of Kanon and Clannad, being my 5th and 1st favorite anime respectively. Just in case you\u2019re not in the know, Air is the first among three Kyoto Animation adaptations of Key visual novels (Air, Kanon, and Clannad). Going into Air, I knew that I had already experienced the cream of the crop, but how far behind in quality Air really was to its peers was very disappointing to me at the time.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the review part, I will suggest that you only watch Air if:\\n\r\n   a.) You\u2019re a big fan of romance/harems\\n\r\n   b.)\tSupernatural elements in a slice-of-life anime don\u2019t bother you\\n\r\n   c.) You have already seen Kanon (2006) and Clannad\\n\\n\r\nLet me make it extra, extra clear that I highly suggest you watch Kanon and/or Clannad before you watch Air. It would be a shame if watching Air soured your tastes to the genre of anime, rendering you unable to enjoy its successors. I will also make some comparisons between the three anime, and there will be some spoilers coming up.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of Air, the story shapes up to be a very straight-forward harem anime. We have the main-male protagonist (Yukito) who randomly gets caught up with a few females, but there is that one girl that sticks out among the rest (Misuzu). Then, after that, we have 13 episodes of Yukito helping all of the girls that wish they could be main characters with their respective problems until Yukito and Misuzu realize that they love each other, get married, have children and live happily ever-after.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I wish Air could have gone down like that, but the thing is that Air tries to make things way too complicated for itself. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the first few episodes, that\u2019s kinda how things happen. The relationship between Yukito and Misuzu is the main focus while two other girls make some brief introductions. Normally, these two girls would get their own arcs of 4-6 episodes to develop their characters, while also being long enough for the plot to progress adequately. The problem is that instead of arcs, each girl gets a whole two episodes to cram in some development for them so they can seem important. That\u2019s not to say that these episodes are bad though. I actually enjoyed the first episodes of the show. Still, the ultra-fast pacing of these episodes sucks out a lot of the fun. Many will be outright turned off by this. In fact, there is something else about Air that turns me off.\\n\\n\r\nTime to make the comparison between the members of the KyotoAni trinity, so some spoilers incoming.  \\n\\n\r\nAll three members of the KyotoAni trinity have some number of supernatural elements. In Clannad, while they were there, they were by no means excessive. There was the end of Fuko\u2019s arc, Misae\u2019s backstory with the cat, the Illusionary World, and the ending. Supernatural was sprinkled around over 40 episodes to increase the depth of the story, but Clannad mostly just felt like a romance/slice-of-life. With Kanon, the supernatural was not used as conservatively. The arcs belonging to Makoto, Mae, and Ayu (especially Ayu) had a moderate amount of supernatural. With the exception to the end of Mae\u2019s arc that revealed she has superpowers or something, it still didn\u2019t bother me. However, Air has way too many supernatural elements for me to take it seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Air ends up using so much magic in my opinion is that it tries to be more complicated and convoluted than it should be. There\u2019s a decent bit of magic used in the beginning, but at episode 7, it starts to spiral out of control. Yukito starts getting all of these crazy flashbacks and whatnot, and that\u2019s when the plot shifts from this century to 1000 BC. The sudden time shift is very shocking. While it does relate to the plot just a little bit, we go from harem anime with supernatural elements to a story about a cursed girl with magical powers being rescued by a samurai in medieval times. Still, once I got over the shock, I did enjoy the next two episodes a little bit. Next, the setting shifts to the present time, and you realize that the previous episodes have little to no impact on the main story. Yukito becomes a bird because lulz, and the remainder of the story is about the relationship between Misuzu and her mom. And it didn\u2019t help that I found the last few episodes of Air to be pretty boring. \\n\\n\r\nOne could blame Air\u2019s shortage of episodes available for the story not succeeding, but the truth is that Air really doesn\u2019t know what kind of story it wants to be. It drastically shifts from harem/romance to some kind of fantasy anime, and then back to a drama between Misuzu and her mom that seems virtually unaffected by the rest of the episodes. If the anime just stuck to one of those things for 13 episodes, it probably could have succeeded at all of them. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I just kinda trashed Air, I really did see Air as an insight to the process of creating Kanon and Clannad. Without it, we might not have gotten the quality of what turned out to be my favorite anime. There are also some good things about Air. If you\u2019re tastes are similar to mine, you will find the sense of humor in Air\u2019s first few episodes refreshing, and Yukito is a pretty good main in my opinion. I mostly liked the side characters, and the song in Air\u2019s opening will stay in your head for days. Even so, I still have to come to the consensus that Air is just a bare-bones average anime.\\n\\n\r\nJust to reiterate, do not watch this anime if you already know you don\u2019t like the genre, or if you haven\u2019t seen its successors. Watching Air is like reading a classic novel; you watch it as a way to see how it influenced others. But, if you don\u2019t want to watch it, that\u2019s fine too. I watched it just because I felt obligated to. But who knows? Maybe you will receive Air better than I did. \\n",

Eventually, the dinosaur loving girl Misuzu shows up, and she asked Yukito to play with her and they became friends. As the time passes by, another two girls that were covered with mysteries appeared, and they became Yukito's acquaintances. The story's quality was a mediocre+ for me notwithstanding having different realistic themes. Some of the episodes were repetitive. The new things here are the \"Gao\" word that was made by Misuzu and the three main heroines wished to flyin the sky. Other than that, nothing's special. It's only another ordinary supernatural anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8) - The characters were well-explained because of the character arc. Every arc focuses on one major character but that makes other characters feel like they're left behind. Their personalities were quite unique but not superior.\\n\\n\r\nMusic(7) - For a dramatic anime, the bgms fits every scene. The OP and ED matched the series, but they are not exceptional since the music of Air was somewhat similar to other Key/VisualArts project.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8) - The places are realistic, the blending of the colors are good. I just don't like how they draw the eyes of the female characters because it's too big. Also, what's with that placement of the mouth?\\n\\n\r\nOverall(7) - As a whole, Air is only an ordinary dramatic anime that didn't interest me that much(well, just a little). I'm just surprised how the story ended. Dramatic/supernatural/tragedy lovers will probably watch this.",

            "content": "Air is an unforgettable experience that tells a story which seems simple yet complex simultaneously. Like a dream, there seem to be layers of meaning. As the story unfolds, simple objects take on symbolic significance and one must rewatch the show in order to see these clues, while some aspects of the experience remain cloaked in mystery.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAir takes on several interesting plotlines, but the only drawback is that it is only thirteen episodes. Therefore, it does not have enough time to fully develop some aspects of the plot. The show is told in a rather non-traditional manner with some plot elements not revealed untilmuch later in the show and others barely explained. After watching the show again, I appreciated this aspect more, but the style can throw you for a loop the first time. I think this could have been cleared up with more episodes. It also might seem annoying that while some episodes seem to consist of little happening, the dramatic moments seem to rush by without proper explanation. This might have been intended, however. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis is some of Key's best animation with a wonderful colors, and great contrasts between light and darkness. All the scenes are breathtaking and perfectly create the mood of the scenes which vary from dark and brooding to sunny and dreamy. The scene where Misuzu and Yukito stop to play in a stream near dusk is my favorite. The only cons are that as in Key animation, the characters look very similar and have very large eyes, which may not appeal to all viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAir has one of my favorite soundtracks, that is mostly electronic, but has some nice piano pieces. The opening is also amazing and draws you in from the start. The music is diverse and definitely another strong point of the show. The voice acting was also great in Japanese. I have not seen all of the English dub, but what I saw was not comparable to the original. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\n The individual characters are not the strongest point in this anime. None of the main girls really stand out, except Misuzu who morphs from being the typical cutesy heroine to a very tragic and pathetic character, who still remains believable. Haruko, the aunt is also a very compelling character, whose develops throughout the show. Yukito is interesting, but not the most original. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI have to only give this anime an 8 for enjoyment, simply because it is one of the more depressing series I have watched. There are several moments that are just excruciating, but of course beautiful in their sadness. I also disliked how once a character's story was finished we did not see any more of that character. I would have liked a less episodic style. It is definitely more enjoyable the second time, when you start to understand the symbols and intricate nature of all the details. I appreciate the effort put into the story.",

            "content": "Surreal. Dreamy. Tragic. Breath-takingly beautiful.\r\nI had put off finishing Air TV for years on end (and shame on me!) because the movie really really depressed me....and I really didn't want to feel like that again until I had a good chunk of time off from work and social events so I could wallow in my grief in peace.\r\nBut I was wrong. Air TV is practically soothing compared to the tragedy of the movie. (The movie is not bad by any means but the ending is very painful, emotionally.)\r\n[b]Story[/b]: It has a 9 because tbh I didn't care that much about Kano and Hijiri's story, asthey're my least favorites. I'm just shallow like that. :) ALL the other stories I really liked. They had my full attention and I remember skipping the ending quite a few times to hurry and get to the next episode.  (I watched this for six hours in one sitting and it did not feel that way at all!)\\n\r\nOthers who have not played the game or are not familiar with Key's way of story-telling might be put off or confused. Certain events will raise questions...but if you are patient and give your full attention, the answers will be revealed to you in time. The most important thing is: [b]Air is not told logically, it is told like how the best dreams are manifested.[/b]\\n\\n\r\n[b]Art[/b] Oh my lord; the [i]art[/i]. Air by itself is a work of art; probably the most romantic of its kind. The characters? Adorable. The scenery? Gorgeous. The animation? Even more so.\\n\r\nNot [i]everyone[/i] will like the female character art; I won't lie. It's unique but the girls' faces may take some getting used to. Yukito, the male protagonist is bishounen perfect in the best example I can think of: pretty golden eyes and silver-haired, yet retains all his manliness so male viewers won't feel annoyed. I read in one of the Air artbooks that Key felt this was of utmost importance. *laughs* Yes, indeed!\\n\r\nAs for the girls, sometimes they look very cute and sometimes you may find yourself wishing that their noses were just a [i]little[/i] bit further down from their eyes. It's a minor thing though; their cute antics with their cute voices are sure to win you over soon enough. The long, Rapunzel hair on many of the girls, [i]especially Misuzu[/i] is well-worth mentioning; the way it [i]flows[/i]........boy am I jealous. XD\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and scenery are full of beautiful, romantic visuals: stars, sunsets, sparkling oceans, and white cloud-filled brilliant blue summer skies. You could just gaze at them for hours......the way Misuzu the title heroine does. :)\\n\\n\r\n[b]Sound[/b] Outstanding. The theme of Air is the sky and flight and I honestly don't think the opening theme could have captured this more precisely. I've listened to it over and over. Whoever composed it is a freaking genius. Lia's graceful vocals are most appropriate. \\n\r\nThe seiyuu are all fantastic. Tomoko takes Misuzu's cuteness and ups it about five more notches. Daisuke is great as Yukito. I really liked Kanna's seiyuu as well; her way of speaking traditional, very old Japanese is quite charming as is Haruko's heavy Osakan accent. \\n\\n\r\n[b]Character[/b] This gets 10 for the mainest of the main characters because I just love them that much. This includes Misuzu and Yukito for the top two spots, followed by Haruko and the main three from the feudal era. I adore Misuzu; she's the epitome of moe. I don't think you'll meet another moe heroine who can steal your heart faster than Kamio Misuzu. Maybe I'm biased...but look, she's popular for a reason. *laugh*\\n\r\nI absolutely love Yukito too. Level-headed and mature (most of the time) he's just the perfect counterpart to Misuzu's cute, childish eccentricities and this makes nearly every scene of their interaction visual gold. Even from just their first meeting, you never want them to be apart. Misuzu's relationship with Haruko is heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time....and you don't want them to be apart either. \\n\r\nRyuya, Kanna, and Uraha are just plain fun. I enjoyed watching them far far more than I thought I would! There are some great comical moments...which is really nice because sometimes you need a break from the heavy themes of the present story. And it DOES get heavy. If you're looking for something light-hearted with cute love triangles, look elsewhere. Air isn't one of those; though it might fool you into thinking otherwise with the first two episodes.\\n\r\n[b]Brace yourself.[/b]\\n\\n\r\n[b]Enjoyment/Overall[/b]\\n\r\nAre you a romantic? Do you like to dream? Do you like to see magical happenings with symbolic explanations and miracles and spiritual themes?\\n\r\nIf yes, [b]Air is absolutely for you.[/b] It's very special to me and will remain in my top favorites for years to come.",

The first couple of episodes might be a bit hard on some, especially if you\u2019re like me and aren\u2019t exactly watching what at first appears to be a slice of life anime every other day.\r\nFrankly Air does have that slice of life feeling dominating it until it lands into more supernatural territory and even after that there\u2019s still plenty of elements that can connect it to slice of life genre.The story does get going once third episode comes along and for a few episodes it feels like you\u2019re following a set of somewhat connected events leading to one big event that is Misuzu\u2019s story. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d go into spoiler territory if I went further into the story, but I can safely say that it is an emotional story. There\u2019s a deeper meaning behind the scenes and even when you completely understand what\u2019s going on there are plenty of subtle messages. There are also quite a few situations you can relate to to an extent, hopefully not to the same extent, but I believe we can all relate to some moments where you simply feel alone, or have a conflict with someone you care about. \\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s the gist of it, Air is a good anime, a very good one that I would recommend watching even if you don\u2019t have a habit of watching slice of life.",

            "content": "I wasn't too keen with the anime at first. The factor that made me continue to watch this anime was its sound. This is probably true for many first time viewers: you watch Air because of the prowess of one or two of its production elements. However, my views have changed once I watched all 13 episodes.\r\nWe are first introduced to Kunisaki Yukito. Yukito is in search of a girl with wings who flies in the sky. He travels town by town looking for this girl. Finally, he settles down at a small seaside town. During his stay, he meets three girls that may bethe girl that he is looking for. From there, the anime develops a story that may be deeper and more complex than you have ever imagined it to be. Not only does this anime explore romantic love but the love of a sibling, mother and a friend as well; this is what sets Air apart from all the other anime. Make sure to keep tissues within reach while watching Air.\\n\\n\r\nNever has the sky looked so beautiful and magical yet so real in an anime. The surroundings are splendidly done; none too bright nor too shallow. The surroundings perfectly complement the scenes throughout the entire anime. The movements of the characters are so fluid and minute. Character design is consistent: great from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned previously, Air's sound captured me. The OP and ED songs were magnificent. The background music was just amazing. It plays at the right time to give this anime an even glossier finish. Probably one of the very few anime soundtracks that make me feel so connected and emotional just listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot help but love all the characters in Air: from the lonely Misuzu to the adorable Potato. Each character has their own personality and a sad story to couple it. Although Kano and Minagi (the other two main female characters) are only given a short amount of time for their arcs, it was ample enough for one to like and feel empathy for the character. I can probably say the same for most of the supporting cast. As for Misuzu, I cannot help but feel pain myself watching her through her ordeals. I, personally, don't think she deserved this kind of life (just like her guardian, Haruko thinks).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I grew to like this anime not only because of its sound, but because of the anime itself. I have never expected something so deep and complex to come from an anime. Most of the times, before I knew it, the front of my shirt was wet. Perhaps the anime that will tug my heartstrings the most.",

On the contrary i  loved Clannad , Canon etc. So it's not like i'm biased against it or something.\r\nConcerning the Story and the Characters\r\nFor me story and characters are 95% of an anime. If those are great then the anime is a certain winner. If those suck, no matter how great the art or the sound the anime is gonna suck too. \r\nHere we have incoherent story-telling, with the story itself being quite confusing. Several points of theplot are left unexplained or the explanations come too late. I mean i found myself watching whole episodes wondering wtf is going on, only to find out at the end a (usually) poor and not very satisfying explanation. \\n\r\nAs for the characters there really isn't much to say.Apart from the fact that the best and most interesting one gets transformed to a crow(!) there are also many other problems like the main heroine , Misuzu, being retarded beyond any redemption or the side heroines not having enough development. This led to another problem as well. Watching such uninteresting characters i couldn't feel any sympathy for them. I didn't really care for their problems which made the dramatic aspects of this anime seem way too forced to a point of being laughable.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the Art and Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok in general. Nothing to complain about but nothing impressive either. The sound was probably the best part. I liked the songs and the voice acting was ok.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Overall\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art and sound are fair, the story and characters are POOR. I started with great expectations only to be horribly disappointed. I didn't drop it just because i was curious whether something unexpectedly great would happen in the end, something that would justify all those great reviews with 9s and 10s. Unfortunately nothing happened. It was pure bad.\\n\r\nI'd certainly recommend to avoid it.",

Also, sometimes there's too much going on and things seem a bit rushed trying to cover all the stories at once with Yukito, maybe they tried to cover too much in a very short anime.\r\nArt (5): Nothing special, the scenarios were pretty and the characters agreeable, but nothing out of the average.\r\nSound (6): Nothing special either for me, well, the opening and ending arenice, and fair enough, the opening began to grow on me towards the end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7): The characters were very different and particular, yet I'll give a low degree because many of them varely got the chance to start shining when their story ended. To be fair I'll say Yukito is a very dear character and his little puppet is great and has a lovely background story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): I'll be honest, everytime an episode ended I needed to watch the next one just to see what would happen next or what the hell was going on, so, it will probably keep you interested through the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): If you enjoyed the drama, complicated darksides and the bits that were open for interpretation in H2O and Higurashi, you'll probably enjoy Air.",

            "content": "When he was young, Kunisaki Yukito's mother told him of a winged girl in the sky. Yukito's family has been searching for this girl for generations upon generations. Finally, Yukito's journey takes him to a small seaside town where he meets Kamio Misuzu, a girl who is eager to make friends with Yukito. Yukito ends up staying with Misuzu and her mother, Haruka, while he searches for the girl in the sky. In the town, however, there are strange occurrences, and as the days pass by, Misuzu starts to have strange dreams. What is the truth behind Misuzu's dreams and her failing health? And howis everything connected to Yukito and his journey?\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters  (9/10)\\n\r\nIt all began when Yukito met Misuzu, a teen school girl with a very childish personality. Misuzu lived alone with her aunt (who never had any time for her), after her parents were separated. She never made any friends at school mainly cause whenever Misuzu became too close with a person she would break down. No one really got to know Misuzu well, until the summer she met Yukito. It was also the summer when she started getting these mysterious dreams..dreams of \"her other self\" flying in the sky, following a path to somewhere. Each night the dream would lead her further down the path, leaving her in confusion and curiosity. Though she never realized the further into the dreams she went each night, the more she faded away by day. Yukito's relation with Misuzu seemed to make her weaker and weaker. Her health started to fail and her dream was drawing to an end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also focuses on two other girls who're just as mysterious as Misuzu.\\n\r\nKano, and Minagi. Both were \"different\", and lived tragic lives. Yukito was positive that one of the three girls must have been the Angel or \"The Girl in the Sky\" his mom had been searching for, but he didn't know which one. So as the summer passed, Yukito grew closer to each girl.. and found out about their sad and tragic pasts that have come back to haunt their\\n\r\nfutures.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, since I don't want to spoil the whole plot, I wont say too much more. Though the plot sounds very sad and depressing, there's quite a few scenes in there that will make you laugh out loud, and the ending will leave you in tears, well at least it did to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nFinally! An anime where the school uniform is actually different!..Anyways,\\n\r\nThe art for this series is terrific, the characters are well drawn. Every movement is very detailed and clear. Like how they concentrated on their hair, how each strand of hair moved in the wind. Each character was drawn to suit they own personality so well.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are truly amazing! Especially the sky, the clouds look almost real! Some really beautiful scenes in there, it just looked so organized and clean. I adore this style and the artwork they used in Air. It's really awesome!\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe beginning theme song is very good, Tori no Uta, quite catchy actually. The scenes they put in there go well with the song. It's sung by Lia, who also sang the ending song. The ending song is not bad, though the video is pretty boring. It's just a sunset. Personally I like the beginning song more. The background music is awesome, fits well with each different scene. It really sums everything up and adds so much more emotion to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of each character bring them alive, like Misuzu's voice, so Kawaii!\\n\r\nand it fits their personality well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nI think Air puts on an awesome show, though it can get a bit confusing near the ending, it's still very good, mysterious and magical. Great for all ages, and I would definitely recommend this anime, even if you're not into drama or that kind of stuff, you just gotta watch it to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the story is very unique and different. It's not just \"bad guys\" and villains, or 'happy-happy'endings where the good guys always win. It's all about a curse and a legend. They tell the story through many characters views, and even go into the history of the legend/curse for a couple of episodes! I think it's very original, that's what I like about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is leaves you speechless, the characters are cute, the plot is interesting, plus there's a bit of everything in there,love, magic, tragedy, humor, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it's the best anime in 2005 yet! It sure is one of my favorites from that year! So, guess what I'm going to say, YES, totally recommend this ANIME. Thank you and I hoped you liked the review.",

            "content": "Air was definitely a wonderful anime, I think that it was very well done, and can safely put it in the category of things Jun Maeda worked on that I absolutely adored and couldn't get through without tearing up. Breaking it down:\r\nStory: Air's story is very well done, it is full of moments that can make you laugh with characters that feel like old friends, and then cry with characters that have unfair lives. It is a story that I enjoyed, although I found it to be quite confusing at times, and had some plot holes at others. Taking all of this into account, Istill think that it was great and a giving it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art and visuals in this anime do not disappoint, they rarely do in these. I liked the drawing style used in this anime (as I did with the others), it being among one of my favourite styles. 10/10 for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in this anime did not disappoint. Anything that the anime may have lacked in story fluency was made up for by the stunning soundtrack that followed it, I can classify the soundtrack, especially Aozora, as some of the more beautiful songs that I have listened to, and bothered to buy afterwards. 9/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were very well done in this anime, having many of them be quite intricate and well written/built without it feeling forced or too-perfect in their designs. All characters had lots of development, and the introduction of several new characters in the Summer Arc, partway through did not make me feel as annoyed or confused as they usually do, instead I think it was quite refreshing to have a change to some new characters that were fun and I loved being around them (especially after doing research on their voice actors). 10/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this anime, and after finishing it I felt like I had lost an important part of my daily dose of beauty, but I had also found something even greater within this story, it's own themes and morals have definitely left a lasting impact on my person. 10/10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: To summarise, I greatly appreciated this anime, as I have all of the other works that Jun Maeda has been in (that I have seen thus far), being one of my favourite people in the staff of anime industry, and this anime managed to meet my already high expectations. Overall 9/10. Gao~!",

Let\u2019s go through my praises and then my criticisms. My biggest praise is the sound design for Air. The moments where I felt most investsted were those that had a soundtrack playing. The Ending was easily skippable but that\u2019s besides the point. My second praise is the characters and their personalities. I really enjoyed the moments with the supporting cast and found that was where I enjoyed most. This bringsme to my biggest critism. The story. As each supporting cast\u2019s problem was solved, they just disappeared from the anime entirely. I get they moved on and them leaving was explained, but after the supporting cast was gone, I was left with Ms. Blondie and Mr. Protagonist. (I apologize but I\u2019m really never good with names) Mr. Protagonist was fine as I enjoyed his presence in Air and Ms. Blondie is just kinda annoying at this point. (This point being Ep 12) Once Mr Protagonist was gone I had to slug my way to the end, finishing a full \u2018nother anime before moving onto episode 8, and then I finally finished it all tonight. Being blunt here, once the supporting cast was gone, the show lost any and all emotion I had with it. I had feelings for the cast of characters who ended up leaving, only to come back for a recap episode in Ep 10. In episode 11 I got invested twice for a reason I could not explain until the end of Episode 12 and that is, \u201cI got invested, because there was another person there\u201d. Just having 2 people in an entire episode can become boring, especially when one of them was greatly glossed over for the majority of the season. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say: say you buy a game, and once you pop it in you are immediately thrusted into the action, and throughout the entire game you have nothing about the world or characters explained to you. Sure the game might be fun, but it would feel incomplete. That\u2019s what the latter half of the show felt to me. In the end, 5/10. I apologize to all those who deeply love the show.",

            "content": "Basically you can sum up AIR in two words, magic and drama.\r\nBut let\u00b4s get to the details.\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nThe anime starts with Yukito Kunisaki. Yukito is a traveler... well, more of a bum.\r\nHe travels from town to town. He owns money by performing a trick he learned from his mother.\r\nHe sits down at the side of the road and tries to get attention of children passing by.\r\nThen he let\u00b4s a doll make some moves, without touching it or using strings.\r\nSo basically he\u00b4s using magic.\r\nAlso i think he\u00b4s using magic to not get catched by the police.\r\nWell, it might be just me, but i whould instantly callthe cops if i saw a guy like him, who wants\\n\r\nto show a special \"trick\" to some little children...\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Yukito gets to a small village.\\n\r\nThere he mets several girls.\\n\r\nThey all happen to have serious problems.\\n\r\nMostly psychological problems, or serious family issues.\\n\r\nYukito gets involved with the girls and starts to help them.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is divided in four story-arcs. Each one featuring Yukito and two to three people of the village.\\n\\n\r\nCharakters 7/10:\\n\r\nMost of the charackters are stereo-types.\\n\r\nSome are more interesting, but, like i said, most are stereotypes.\\n\r\nFor example, the innocent, naive and clumsy little girl, which acts so cute and \\n\r\nsweet that you\u00b4ll get toothache just by looking at her.\\n\r\nOr the very reliable older sister  type.\\n\r\nOr the hyperactive little tomboyish girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe charackters featured in the, let\u00b4s call it \"flashback\", in episode \\n\r\nseven to nine are by far the most intersting charakters of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe art is quite good. The colors are bright.\\n\r\nSometimes there are CGI-elements or whole scenes.\\n\r\nIf you think about the year, AIR was made it doesn\u00b4t look to bad, but the CGI didn\u00b4t age well,\\n\r\nespecially when you think about the fact, that the CGI-effects weren\u00b4t neccessary most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoiment 9/10:\\n\r\nWell, AIR was simply made to make the audience feel sad.\\n\r\nAnd in this aspect it succeeds.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the comedic parts are quite predictable because of their sereotypical nature.\\n\r\nSo, if you want to enjoy AIR, you have to watch it because you like drama.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the first two arcs are actually quite boring.\\n\r\nBut with the seventh episode the anime gets rolling.\\n\r\nFirst with the really interesting characters from episodes seven to nine, which i mentioned earlier\\n\r\nand the final arc, which is really something else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nThe problem of AIR is definitly the first half.\\n\r\nThese two arcs are totally unneccassary and don\u00b4t add anything to the second half.\\n\r\nJust like the annoing charackters featured in them.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you are able to endure them you are rewarded \\n\r\nwith a really strong second half and a great resolution of the final arc.",

            "content": "The story line is rather cute and sad, part of the trinity of Key Animation. I am really sad that this show is so short. They don\u2019t seem to take enough time to flesh out the story lines or the characters. There are way too many girls that are really strange and you never really get much story line about them. The only girl you get to know is Misuzu but she doesn\u2019t have much personality except for the whole girl in the sky thing.\r\nThey also never talk about the girl in the sky much even if she was supposed to be the main focusor even give us an answer about her. The answer we do get comes too late in the story line and it leaves more questions than answers. It\u2019s mostly about what strange effect happens when someone finds one of her feathers but even then I don\u2019t quite understand it. Are the feathers some sort of wish maker and if so, then why does it always end up in sadness?\\n\r\nThe ark with Minagi Tohno feels very out-of-place in a sense and as though it was rushed. There really was no backbone to the story and the ending, though it made me cry seemed rather out-of-place.\\n\r\nAll in all, this story is really slow and hard to keep watching; sometimes almost dull in some parts.\\n\r\nThe animation is rather pretty, bright and colorful. Unfortunately, some of the characters are actually lacking a bit and I\u2019m not really happy that Misuzu\u2019s mom looks more like an older sister instead. All the artwork is pretty much fan based. Potato the dog doesn\u2019t even really look like a dog too which threw me off. The beginning has a lot of aspects of a beginning for a visual Game rather than an actual anime so it means that it looks good and helps set the mood of the show.\\n\r\nThe music is beautiful, both the beginning and ending made me want to find the actual music. The background music is sometimes not very loud and hard to hear, mostly consisting of silence or sweet gentle feelings. The montages that help make time pass seem to be used way to often with the same sappy song. The voice actors are good but some don\u2019t seem good enough. I have to say, I like the English voice actors better than the Japanese, probably just because I\u2019m more used to English voices.\\n\r\nI like this but it is rather slow and I don\u2019t think I will be watching the whole show at once again. I may watch one or two of my favorite episodes though.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I decided to write this review because, from what I've seen, most of them speak of how great this anime is and how much they loved it, and I just thought I'd share another perspective.\r\nIt didn't start all that badly with the main character Yukito. He was funny and really likable (not to mention cute), and I found myself laughing out loud with him and that puppet of his. He is the reason why I give the anime a 6 and not a 4.\r\nHowever, I found the other characters really uninteresting, and the plot revolving round them was extremely eye-roll inducing, at least forme. Once the problem was revealed, it was ridiculously easy to predict the rest of the plot.\\n\r\nOne story I thought was actually pretty neat was the Feudal Japan one. That is probably because it spent less time trying to induce you to start crying and more time being entertaining (not saying there aren't supposedly tear-jerker moments in it). All of the 3 characters were much more likable, including the princess/winged girl a.k.a Misuzu's past incarnation. She seemed to be a much stronger girl than meek Misuzu - which, despite what anyone says, I mostly pitied, and I don't think that should be the main emotion you feel towards the driving character of a series. I mean, sure, you can feel sorry for her position, but she should fight back and stay strong and whatnot, right? At least, that's the kind of character I root for.\\n\r\nIt went downhill fast when *SPOILER* Yukito turned into a crow. How could they do that to the best character in the anime?! Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a really dramatic anime with burdened, fragile girls, this is for you. However, I won't be going round advertising this one for anyone else.",

            "content": "Air is an extremely difficult show to rate as you would others since an individual's enjoyment is largely dependent on whether or not they understood what the bloody hell actually happened. It's certainly a confusing show, but whilst it may have failed miserably in some aspects, it doesn't do as poorly as my overall rating might make a person think.\r\nWe'll start with the positives.\r\nOf course, being from KyoAni, the visuals are stunning. Even though the character designs (with their large eyes, bizarre hair and pointy noses typical of KEY) could throw off a viewer, each character is still well-animated and the backgrounds look beautiful. Heck,even the sky in the opening sequence is gorgeous viewing. Yes, the animation might fall far short of the stuff we have coming out today, but considering that Air was made around eight years ago, it's really very good next to other stuff of its time.\\n\\n\r\nThe music adds to this atmosphere: not just the opening and ending themes, which are naturally good, but also background music. There is nothing particularly unusual about it, but in its simplicity it really shines, and not a single piece fails to evoke the right mood for the scene it's played over.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in terms of actual content, the show is...\\n\r\nI hesitate to say 'poor' because it tries. It tries so hard to tell us a different, inventive story, and in the originality stakes it certainly did a great job. But that's just the problem: the show tries so hard to be different that it ends up losing a lot of viewers in the process, because it gets incredibly bizarre and doesn't seem to have any real sense of direction.\\n\r\nThe ending of every story arc is very rushed- sure, we always have our resolution, but it's never fully made clear why or how the resolution came about. And before we've had time to fully comprehend what just happened, there's a new plotline to focus on. Maybe this just really isn't the sort of show you're meant to marathon in one sitting as I did, but I found this jarring. \\n\\n\r\nAnd, unfortunately, the characters suffer too. This is possibly the saddest thing about the series, because most of the characters were very likeable and interesting, but we never got to see a lot of real depth to them and this would really have made the series more gripping and involving than it actually ended up being. The last two or three episodes did actually become more absorbing emotionally, and might even bring a tear or two to the eyes of some viewers, but it was too late by that point for it to make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate that the issues with a poorly explained plot and poorly developed (albeit likeable) characters was mostly down to the fact that Air only had twelve episodes in which to tell its story, but I get the feeling that if Air had been more focused in regards to whose story it wanted to tell and how, it could have been a much better series. It's just a pity that the lack of focus mixed with the short length meant that Air failed in the aspects a show like this relies on most heavily.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'd never say that Air is an awful show or that people should never watch it, because its redeeming qualities do shine through and I know that other people have genuinely really enjoyed the show as much as I'd hoped to.\\n\r\nBut I certainly wouldn't put it on a 'must watch' list, because as animes go, this is one that's worth the watch on a rainy afternoon, but could probably be missed overall.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Confusing Plot, Amazing Music and Backgrounds, Lovable Characters and this is what you get. . . \"\r\nSome people love it and yet some people hate it. Everyone has different opinions and I respect that, but I really love this show and here is my review and opinion why I consider this show a masterpiece and most memorable show that I have seen. \r\nAir is my first entry to the works of Kyoto Animation and Key and after this I got obsessed with their other works like Kanon, Clannad and After Story. It's also my first introduction to the drama genre of anime and it reallycaught me off guard when I watched this one. So let's get started my quick review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThis is one of the highlights of this show. Unique and confusing though it's nearly impossible to understand in just one viewing. But still it has a beautiful, original and strong plot that is hard to find nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nKyoto Animation really never fails to amuse me in this part. The background art and characters are drawn smoothly. The art reminded me how beautiful our world is with those Skies, Birds, Sunsets and Seas. It's so pleasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn one word: Magnificent! Lia really did a good job in this one. The opening and ending song makes my eyes became watery every time I heard it. They also did a good job in dubbing and those background music. It's really hard to describe in words those sounds. I advice you to wear a headphones while watching to appreciate it even more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI love all the characters. Especially Misuzu and Yukito. Minagi and Kano are also remarkable and have their own different story in the show. They really did a good job with Misuzu and her mother. From the first episode and until the very last I can feel the development in them. Those \"Gao\" and V sign is the most memorable part that I will remember for life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIt's really hard to enjoy the series with a confusing plot. And I'm one of those people, I need to pause for a while and think for a moment to fully understand per episode. Still I enjoyed the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nA masterpiece. No other anime shows brought me to tears like this one. Just like I said it's not for everyone. Deep, Complicated and Beautiful I can see my self re-watching this again but not now, not tomorrow and not next week. Maybe when I'm already prepared to cry again. I'm happy that I accidentally watched this show. It's a gem of the drama genre. Thank you Key!\\n\r\nThank You Kyoto Animation! Thank You Misuzu!",

            "content": "I personally have seen this anime multiple times, and recommend it to everyone. I don't care that it's based for a H game, with that ton of anime these day are based off H game that give no reason to automatic prejudge it. I found this to be a series that draws you in and doesn't let go. With that lets break things down shall we.\r\nStory:\r\nIt's great and very emotional at times. But it one of those anime's that has a secondary story in it to explain and add onto the original story. But be ready cause the thing i loved about this is thatit isn't your happily ever after anime as every character has there dark secrets. I will explain that more one i get into the character section. But ill leave this at every 1000 summers a girl is born with a fate that is predestined and can't be changed.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIncredible is the word, me and my friend have alway joked of the whole HD anime thing saying what even the point of it. This is one of the extremely few exceptions to that. As this anime is so extremely well made that you can watch it in HD and actually see a large difference. If you want just youtube the intro opening song, when i first watch this series along time ago they had the intro and my computer at the time was no were near powerful enough to play the full graphic intro.  Here is a Youtube link that has it in 1080p http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HvzpstRN64 . There is a extreme gap in quality (720p and 1080p i see no difference and i have a dedicated 1 gig video card with 1080p HD setup). Just that should be all the proof need to set why i have this set as a 10.\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound is great, i love the intro and ending theme song. The Intro song has forever been scarred into my hard with deep emotions from how good the anime was. Plus i loved the voice actor choices at-least for the Japanese version. Misuzu had such a perfect voice actor. Over all it couldn't have been better.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThey has a story for everyone of the main characters, none of them were simple backgrounds either. The character were all well explained and were intertwined with the rest of the character and story. They went into very well detail for all the main characters and explain their purpose in the story very clearly. If they were to cut a character the whole story would fall apart. That is how well they used each character to their highest potential. You loved each of the characters as if they were all the #1 main character.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThey kept me on that roller coast of emotion till the very end making me think if i could ever handle a ride like that again. But it was on of those even if it pure torture to my heart i had to see it again. The character were just created so in-depth that it made the whole series run smooth like watching a movie that you couldn't take your eyes off.  All i got to say it this is one of the few anime you go to find me ever rating an across the board 10.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review\\n\r\nSilent Voice \\n\r\nI.N.H. Reviews\\n",

            "content": "*** This comment may contain spoilers ***\r\nWell I must say I am impressed with this. Very impressed. I am very glad for that review that was posted that sparked my curiosity to check this Anime out, I did. Between the rocky road trying to stream this from YouTube , and hopping around YouTube finding the many parts, I enjoyed this. It's a hauntingly beautiful Anime, not since Fruits Basket has a such an anime moved me so much.\r\nNow this is again one of the few Anime's that have made me cry my eyes out at points, that is how emotionally pact it can get. ButI think this is the only Anime that has made me bawl on the spot! I had to pause and get tissues! Some moments you just paused and let it all sink in. Chills ran down my spine at many points. And my gosh when Misuzu got out of her wheel chair and walked to her mothers arms and just collapsed and finally died, or when Misuzu runs to Haruko crying &quot;Mama!&quot; I never cried so hard while watching Anime. No really I was in tears I had to pause and get a tissue! And not only that, it's funny at times. A great mix of drama with comedy relief balances out this Anime very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work is some of the finest with out a doubt in my mind.  Brilliant cinematography was used, it was stunning to see such masterful and beautiful work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd ah the characters, Misuzu she's so cute, and it's so funny the way she always falls flat on her face, she's so lovable and your heart goes out to her, and you just can't help but fall in love with all the characters, yet there are some you just want to bop on the head at times until you see their true nature but non the less great ensemble cast, one of the best I've seen.  And dub wise while I was a skeptic it wasn't so bad.  \\n\\n\r\nImpressive music. A good drama like this needs a good music score and the three composers pull it off nicely. And a very catchy opening theme pulls it together nicely. Sometimes I can't help but think of the music from the movie Hook, they almost sound alike at times. :D  But anyway, again a very nice original score, provides a strong soundtrack for the series.  And the opening theme sets the perfect atmosphere to it.  \\n\\n\r\nWell overall I can say I'm really enjoying this series. What more can I say, it's truly Award Worthy.",

            "content": "Light spoilers ahead, though not too many to ruin the story of the anime until later on. Also, this review will be one of the most vague ones I have written in a long time, due in part to me being extremely confused when watching Air and the information feeling a bit scattered until I read up on it after finishing it. So, please bear with me.\r\nAir is an anime that will not fail to deliver an amazing story. However, I feel that some aspects of the story were a bit rushed and that the anime randomly jumped from one point to the next attimes.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this much, to start off. The beginning arcs were very well done with Yukito meeting the other girls, reminding me heavily of Clannad in this regard (and going so far as to have three girls look exactly like the main ones from Kanon in every way, shape and form) and I have not watched that one in quite some time now.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, most of the anime consists of the usual generic comedy tidbits that is known of Kyoto Animation before really digging into the deep stuff shortly after. This includes the protagonist, Yukito, having humorous interactions with a majority of the female cast, before mostly spending his time with Misuzu at the beginning for a little while.\\n\\n\r\nThis will be familiar to fans of Kyoto Animation already, but Yukito has at least one happy time, deep bonding moment and sad departure with each of the main female leads. It is the basic formula that is to be expected of this company and it is still just as enjoyable here as it was with their other critically acclaimed works.\\n\\n\r\nMajor spoilers ahead.\\n\\n\r\nBut, things get a little hazy when I hit little over the halfway point and we were abruptly thrown into the Kanna arc, which I thought was a departure from what the company usually does. In this arc, Ry\u016bya, one of the guards of the shrine, becomes the protector of Kanna, a winged person whom was given various duties worthy of her position. She wished to reach out to her long lost mother, whom she believed to be deceased. Knowing this, Ry\u016bya and Kanna's caretaker, Uraha, set their goals to help Kanna achieve her wish and prevent her from traveling to another territory.\\n\\n\r\nLater, after what feels like some filler stuff with generic, cheesy story formula following suit with basic comedy scenes, Ry\u016bya and Uraha picking on Kanna and so on, we finally reach the location of Kanna's mother. From here, they rescue her and she is immediately killed by the guards, followed by a release of her powers that frightens the guards and they see the winged persons as enemies.\\n\\n\r\nKanna, not wanting her friends to suffer, decides to fly into the sky so that they can escape. However, a curse is placed upon her, preventing her from attaining eternal peace and she is instead reincarnated over and over.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, Ry\u016bya learns from Uraha that he has succumb to an incurable disease that will slowly take away his life until he withers away into nothing. Knowing this, Ry\u016bya wishes to create an offspring that can help the reincarnated Kanna find eternal happiness. As such, he and Uraha wed and have a child, whom carries this tradition forward until we reach Yukita in the modern time of the anime, whom is trying to aid Misuzu.\\n\\n\r\nThough never explained too well in the actual anime, Misuzu is the reincarnated form of Kanna in the present time and, due to having the soul of a winged person inside of her. She slowly dies due to her vulnerable body being unable to attain its power and we find this out near the end of the anime. Or, rather, near the middle before we are abruptly thrown into that Kanna arc for little under a quarter of the anime length.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has much more to it, but I would rather not spill too much of that here and simply say that you should give it a chance if you are into intricate plot patterns, as this anime will throw a lot of those at you; one of which, I just elaborated upon quite heavily here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I simply addressed a bit of the story of Air without trying to spoil too much of it, then warned of a major spoiler that I proceeded to tell and how it links to the main story. Also, I love its soundtrack a lot and some of the piano songs are beautiful to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nI will be completely honest here. The main reason why I did such a bland job with this review is due to how confused I was with the story of Air. I intended for this review to be deep, mainly because two Kyoto Animation works are some of my favorite drama anime and I love them a lot, but Air had a story that was a bit different and harder to follow for me until I researched it after finishing up the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I did cry during the arc with Misuzu and Haruko and I understood everything when Haruko went on about what she was really doing. It was amazing and I never thought I would cry tears of happiness well watching an anime when this arc came around. I recommend this to any fans of Kyoto Animation, especially Clannad or Kanon fans. It has a similar atmosphere and soundtrack ideas of the other two, in that the originality of them and fit are almost too perfect.",

It is also the first one to be adapted by Kyoto Animation and well, you could say that this was their test run more or less.\r\nYou might like this anime if:\r\n-You really enjoy romance anime\r\n-You are a fan of other Key adaptations\r\n-You are looking for something sad\r\n-You are looking for something fresh\r\n-You are looking for a show with a great OST\r\nYou might dislike this anime if\r\n-You dislike romance anime\r\n-You don't like supernatural things in romanceanime\\n\r\n-You want to get into romance anime\\n\r\n-You disliked the other Key adaptations\\n\r\n-You can't stand moe\\n\r\n-You don't like when an anime switches to a different setting randomly\\n\r\n-You don't like unfinished and unexplained stories.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nYou see, the story isn't honestly that bad for the most part, but when episode eight hits, it goes downhill. The next two episodes after that don't help either. It switches to a different setting, tells a different story, just to somehow tie it in afterwards and try to explain its convoluted plot with it. The only thing that this achieves, is providing even more questions and even fewer answers. Not only that, but it ruins the mood, the tempo and the entire story. This could have been easily avoided, by presenting that arc at the begginig, or in the second episode. I'm sure no one would have a problem with that. Instead, what we get is this random transition that failed to capture my interest at the very least. Other than those episodes however, I don't have anything againts the story. Hell, it even made me cry. The comedy was good, I got a few good laughs out of it. Overall, it's a decent story, but there are some really weird choices in storytelling, that can't be excused.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 7\\n\r\nWell, it is moe. Girls with huge eyes, cute animals etc. Nothing really stands out, it does its job fairly well. Animation is pretty much the same, though there were a few visual gags that got me to smile here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAs usual, Kyoto Animation does not disappoint when it comes to the OST. It is beautiful and touching, creates atmosphere, fits the scenes. Overall there's nothing bad I can say about it really. Bonus points for the tearjerker of an opening as well.\\n\r\nPro Tip: Put the opening on 1.25 speed so you can dance while you cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe cast is easily likeable, like most of Key's characters. Of course if you don't like cute girls, that fall on their face at times, you might not like it, to each their own, but if you go into this anime, you should probably expect that already. Anyway, the characters, that at beggining seem stereotypical, actually take interesting turns for the better the more you get to know them and sometimes their development did take me by surprise. The main hero is also quite different compared to the other Key leads, because he is not a sarcastic bastard for the most part, so that was also a breath of fresh air (heh). Why not a ten then? Well, there was that whole thing with changing the cast all of a sudden and that sucked, that's why. Overall, a great, lovable cast, with some really good development at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nSo, this would probably be lower if not for the fact that my humanity took the upper hand again and decided to make a dry sponge out of me at the very end. While for the most part I just pushed forward, enjoying myself only from time to time, the ending really got to me. There were also the ocasional sparks of good humour and I did like the cast. The thing is, that I can't overlook all the bad stuff it did, because if not for some storytelling decisions, that didn't appeal to me personally, this would probably be much higher. Overall, I enjoyed it when I enjoyed it, but when I didn't, I was really mad at it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nAir is pretty much a test run. For the time, when not a lot of really good romance anime were out, this probably was amazing, but after the new stuff  showcased how can you really tell a great story, without supernatural elements or all over the place pacing, you can't help but to look at it as just something worse. This show has it's moments, quite a few of them in fact, but it fails to mantain a steady flow and at times it feels like it just wanted to be too much. Not a bad anime, but if you are not a fan of the other Key adaptations, this will not get you into them, or change your mind about them most likely. However, there is a chance, that if you go into it with a correct mindset, with not the biggest expectation, you might just find it to be something more than it was for me. I really hope that that's what will happen.\\n\r\nAs always, this is only my opinion and I highly reccomend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Air in one word, is gorgeous. It's gorgeous in every single way from its visuals to its music to its story. It's a series I really liked the first time around and upon rewatching it several years later I liked it even more. Admittedly, given the lack of action/combat/violence this kind of anime isn't for everyone, but if you aren't an adrenaline junky and enjoy anime focused on story and characters and have an appreciation for anime as an art form, I really couldn't recommend Air strongly enough.\r\nArt-\r\nThe presentation of Air is IMMACULATE. I challenge you to find an anime with a superior presentation asa whole, nevermind one that came out over a decade ago as Air did. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the scenery is breathtaking and artistically beautiful and the music and art play together absolutely flawlessly. Animations are crisp and smooth and it is crystal clear the animators and the director paid tremendous attention to detail. I would give the presentation of Air as a whole the absolute highest possible score.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, along with the visuals, is the other part of an anime's presentation and as mentioned in the previous section, I'd definitively give the presentation of Air a 10/10. In the sound department you've got one of the best of the best in the business in Vic Mignogna voicing the main character, followed closely by proven, talented industry veterans in Monica Rial, Luci Christian and Kira Vincent-Davis.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is magical- as a whole one of the very best I've ever heard in any anime of any genre- and fits absolutely perfectly with the rest of the presentation, completing the trifecta of art/animation, voice acting and sound/music that makes or breaks a presentation. Several songs are truly memorable and worth adding to your playlist. In particular \"Wing\", \"Bird's Poem\" and \"This Place\" were huge standouts for me that I've listened to countless times independently, but this is truly a \"can't go wrong\" kind of soundtrack with winner after winner and I highly, highly recommend listening to the entire soundtrack for anyone even remotely interested in anime music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the story is the only imperfect part of Air. Right out the gate I want to say that the story is gorgeous (just like every other part of this anime), it's way deeper and more complicated than you'd expect from this kind of anime (which I absolutely love and view as a positive thing) and it'll take quite a bit of critical thinking and reflection to truly understand the plot as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nSo what's the problem? Well, the last part of what I just stated is the biggest issue. The base premise of this anime is very, very simple. However, the bigger picture plot and its resolution is quite complicated and it is perhaps not explained clearly enough for a number of viewers to truly understand all of it. I think part of it is Air trying to maintain its omnipresent sense of magic and mystery, which I thoroughly enjoyed throughout the anime, and I also think they intentionally wanted certain aspects of the show to be left to artistic interpretation, but they may have taken this a little too far. I think it'd be fair to assume a number of watchers, especially first time watchers, would not entirely understand the resolution of this anime or why specific things did or did not occur. The resolution of this anime could definitely be a bit more clear.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I should note, while I personally did not feel this way and really enjoyed the ride from start to finish, objectively I can see how one could view this anime as having pacing issues. It isn't in any rush to divulge its mysteries or get into the main plot and for those who need something a bit more uptempo in order to be entertained, perhaps Air wouldn't be exciting enough or fast paced enough for that kind of viewer. I watched this most recently with my wife and she felt it had a bit of a slow start and she'd have preferred the overarching plot be investigated sooner.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is likely the trickiest and most subjective aspect of Air to evaluate. This anime is not for everyone, and I suspect most viewers will either be absolutely awe struck as I was or will view this as quite mediocre and nothing special with very little in between. This is a show for those who appreciate visual beauty, anime music, anime as an art form and a deep, emotionally affecting plot. This is not an anime for those who need combat/violence/blood, those who need high energy or uptempo shows in order to keep their attention or those who are looking for pervy fan service. Personally, I really, really liked this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nThe gold standard for presentation, a surprisingly deep and complex plot with moments that will inevitably hit you right in the feelings and a sense of magic, mystery and artistic beauty that is unbelievably hard to replicate, Air is simply a breathtakingly gorgeous anime as a whole. It's not for everyone, but if this review leads you to think this is probably the kind of show you'd enjoy then this is an absolute must watch.\\n\\n\r\n+IMMACULATE presentation- exceptional voice acting, music and animation throughout\\n\r\n+Excellent story- simple premise, very deep/complex application\\n\r\n+Genuinely emotionally affecting\\n\\n\r\n-Bigger picture plot is very complicated and potentially difficult to understand\\n\r\n-Slower paced and less action than certain viewers may prefer\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 9\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9.5",

            "content": "Before going into Air, I was perfectly aware that many people deem it as being the weakest of the Holy Trinity. But, yet I decided to watch it because I was craving some KyoAni. And to be honest, this anime had me hooked- but only during the first six episodes- after which it went so downhill fast that I became more depressed by that than any of the tragic moments in this anime. And that my friend, is a huge problem.\r\nAir, for me personally wasn\u2019t as emotional as I wanted it to be- but it did still did make me go. \u2018Aww\u2026that sucks.\u201d But, thenagain after five seconds later, I\u2019ll just completely forget about it. The pacing in Air was just awful to say the least- and it's pacing is some of the worst I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nNormally, I like shows that tend to be fast paced- but Air\u2019s speed was like five times that of any other normal anime. It\u2019s like they tried cramping so much material into only twelve episodes. Air had several arcs which all had potential of being something memorable. However, they all fell flat due to the poor execution of it. Arcs that should have been four episodes long were instead less than two- but yet despite that flaw I still thought Air was something enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nBut, then even finding enjoyment in this anime came to a bitter end- when the story decided to completely take place in a different time period. This was in order to somewhat explain Misuzu\u2019s reason for being sick and also Yukito\u2019s search for the winged maiden. Those episodes however felt really boring to me- and I couldn\u2019t care less about those characters in that certain arc. Giving them screen time, instead of our main protagonists felt like a complete waste to me. Speaking of which- let\u2019s talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike, Yuuichi from Kanon or Tomoya from Clannad- Yukito doesn\u2019t have that big of a harem to brag about . It only consists of Misuzu, Kano, Minagi and Michiru even though the latter didn\u2019t have the honour of being featured in the opening credits. To be honest, none of the supporting characters stood out to me- but they were okay in my opinion. Nothing good or bad. The three characters that I did care about was Yukito, Misuzu and Haruko. Like, this anime would have been a whole lot better if it just focused on them and their daily life and struggles with Misuzu\u2019s illness.\\n\\n\r\nYukito to my surprise was distinguishable from Tomoya and Yuuichi- but he did have that same charm those other two did. He was very likeable for a main character and I also really like the bond he had with both Misuzu and Haruko. Sadly, his bonds with the other girls weren\u2019t as well handled though. Misuzu is just a really sweet girl- and she contributed to some funny moments earlier on this anime. Her relationship with Haruko was really good and if this anime had more episodes to further develop it- then maybe there relationship would have garnered more praise from me. But, during the final episodes- seeing them together did tug at a couple of my heartstrings at least.\\n\\n\r\nAlso what the hell is Potato? Is it a dog or a Pokemon as it keeps saying Pico Pico?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it\u2019s pretty decent- given the anime came out almost 11 years ago. I guess, what I liked about the animation the most was the way it made the clouds look realistic. The scenes with sunsets were nice to look at too from time to time. The animation did a good enough of job creating the eventful summer that the story takes place. I liked the character designs too but the colouring of some of the characters hair just didn\u2019t feel natural to me. I wonder if that makes sense- because the hair looked very subpar to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for Air is one of my all-time favourite things from this anime. It is my second favourite Key opening and for good reasons too. This opening makes me want to fly, no kidding and I never dared to skip this opening. Lia\u2019s singing was so lovely and so she better sing the opening for Rewrite too. The intro with the clouds just makes my shoulder do some weird dance. The opening is just amazing to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, before I assign the show with a score- I must sing praise of the dub. Unlike the Clannad dub- this one is really good- but I guess that would be because it was done by Funimation. Vic Minogna was really good as Yukito- and Monica Rial too shined as Misuzu. But, my favourite performance was definitely Luci Christian as Haruko. This is one of those roles where Lucy Christian doesn\u2019t voice a cutesy high school girl- and she does an excellent job at that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Air had a lot of potential- but sadly it got all wasted away in my opinion. Even if I did enjoy the first half- the second half was just so messy- not to mention the  info dumps on the Winged Maiden that has some connection with both Misuzu and Yukito was not helpful- and iit was something I didn\u2019t appreciate. In fact, what they did to Yukito towards the last couple of episodes actually made me mad- but I can\u2019t tell you cause that would be a spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nThe only bits of this anime that made me sad where the ones regarding Misuzu and Haruko- whereas the rest had no impact on me. That was mainly due to the fact- that the arcs revolving around certain characters were rushed and so it didn\u2019t give me much time to grow attached to them enough to care about their situations. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind- it pains me to give Air TV a 5 out of 10 and that you should probably SKIP IT. I really wanted to like Air as much as Kanon and Clannad- but I guess somethings are not meant to be. I don\u2019t however hate this anime- it\u2019s just it was very disappointing in my eyes. Also, do you completely disagree with my points, because it\u2019s fine, if you do cause we do have differing opinions and I am aware that all a lot of people love this show and it sucks that I am not part of that group.\\n",

            "content": "AIR is one of those uber-popular animes that just about everyone who's into anime\u2014from the casual watcher to the straight up otaku\u2014seems to know about, and I think that the level of recognition that it has is well deserved. Whether or not you are into shoujo [girly] animes, subject matter aside, this is still an anime is worth taking a look at, it has: excellent art, good music and all the key elements for a good story, drama, romance, comedy and a bit of action.\r\nART/Animation \t\r\nThe art style is very modern, everything is very clean with smooth lines and very bright colors. You can tellthis show was done by the very best of anime artists and the latest of art/CG technolgies. Very beautiful, picturesque scenes of sky, water and nature. Movement was flawless, most obviously when it came to hair and fabric movements.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound\\n\r\nThe music wasn't great but it wasn't bad...it was standard J-POP dance beat but it was also very catchy....I had the song stuck in my head for a while afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nStory \t\\n\r\nThis is such a great and original story, yet I'm not quite sure what exactly what the story is about since it's told from so many varying perspectives. I guess it would suffice to say that it's about a winged girl who's up somewhere in the sky. She's imprisoned or suffering or both, I'm not quite sure but she's been in that state for a very very long time. The complexity of the story rests with the fact that this story about the girl is revealed bit by bit from the different persepectives of each character beacause they are all\u2014in some way\u2014affected or have had their lives influenced by this winged girl. But this is what makes the story so great and original, they way it was told....the narration, it was very original and never boring nor repetitive. The subject really doesn't matter if you look at HOW the story was told/structured and how well they pulled it off. In fact, the subject was of little consequence since it's pretty obvious the direction of the story focused more on character development rather than an overt act of rescuing the winged girl.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \t\\n\r\nAll the characters were very likable and each had their own moving tale to tell. Each of the characters, even the males, seemed very normal, very human and very vulnerable.....and eventho there's a bit of magic and superpowers in the show, there were no obvious heroes or villans to speak of. Character designs were done with the obvious intent of being cute as is chiefly with shoujo animes....big eyes, lots of hair and frilly clothes also, they all kind of seemed to have the same faces, to be precise there seemed to be only two face model types for the females and one face model/type for males....but it isn't annoying or anything, since the cast is relatively small.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show, eventho it was only 13 eps. I think that most people will too. Buy it. Keep it. Rewatch.",

            "content": "Air is a beautiful anime from start to finish, you will get emotional, you will feel for the characters and you will get drawn to the story.\r\nSotry - The story of Air takes place in a ficitonal town where Yukito Kunisaki hopes to find the 'girl in the sky', a goal each generation of his family has passed on for a thousand years. During his stay in this town, he hopes to makes money by using a special form of puppeteering that can make his puppet move without him touching it. Also during his stay here, he meets multiple female characters whom each have aninteresting tale to tell and certain strange events befall upon them. One in particular is Misuzu Kamio. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The animation is filled with bright colours left, right and centre. An enjoyment for your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I really love the soundtrack for Air. The opening song and each individual tune that is played throughout the series, really sets the scene and the mood of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Yukito and Misuzu are the main characters for this particular anime. While the others somewhat play a prominent role. Don't get me wrong though, it is not like X character is only thrown in the show only to be written off for no particular reason, no, nothing like that at all. But carrying on about Yukito and Misuzu, they share a real special bond in this anime. At first it might seem like a general friendship, but then it develops and blossoms into something more...not a boyfriend and girlfriend relationship, but still pretty darn close...No kissing scenes if you are wondering.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I throughly enjoyed this series. Each episode holds a story in its own right and an emotional attachment at the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - If you don't like the whole 'crying' thing, then this anime is not for you. There are no fight sequences, no transformations, none of that stuff. But if you are looking for something deep, emotional and something that will pull on your heart strings to make you cry (I know I did) then this is a great anime for you. The bond between Yukito and Misuzu is really something special. Loved every moment of it.",

            "content": "Yukito Kunisaki is on a journey, seeking a girl with wings who flies in the sky, as mentioned in a childhood tale. During this journey, he settles down in a small town, trying to make some money. There, he meets a strange girl named Misuzu. Misuzu quickly makes Yukito her friend and invites him to stay with her. Yukito decides to stay in the small town, and continue searching for the winged girl his mother had searched for in her life.\r\nThe story of Air is creative from what I've seen in anime. A puppeteer traveling to search for a winged girl in the sky? That'screative. I was a little bit confused about the crow / bird / reincarnation part near the end of the anime though but I got the hang of it. The ending of the anime made me tear and I can relate to Misuzu with her loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the biggest problem of the anime. A lot of people think Air is the most terrible anime Key made because the art is terrible. I thought the art was decent. It wasn't perfect and it wasn't ugly... It was okay.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good, once again it isn't \"perfect\".\\n\\n\r\nThe character is my favorite part of the anime. They're so unique! A girl sick from her dreams, a reincarnated bird, a winged girl in the sky, and a puppeteer on a journey! Thus, -some- of the characters (my opinion, Michiru) were really annoying and I felt like leaving the room, I loved them even though...\\n\\n\r\nOverall I LOVED this anime! It's one of my favorites. I liked how the logo of Air (the girl and the boy holding hands) had nothing to do with the anime but they did show it towards the ending. I will always remember this anime no matter what. One of the saddest animes I've seen.\\n\\n\r\n~The 1000th Summer~",

The story is quite sad thoughtout but not predictable at the least. It always made me guess what was going to happen. The plot was thought out very well. It was nice to see an anime that didn't really have any concept of another.\r\nArt 10/10: The drawings were incredible. They were all very bright and sharp. I loved how they created the characters.

            "content": "You know, I could say that this is the first time I\u2019m reviewing something from the Key/Kyoto trilogy of moe anime but then again, I watched Clannad a month ago but I do understand the formula to most of these shows to an extent. Some people will complain about the story, the characters, the moe designs of every female character and how sappy it might be. Who knows? That might be true once I watched it but I\u2019m the type of guy and reviewer that\u2019s open to anything type of genre of whatever I\u2019m watching or listening.\r\nWhen Yukito Kunisaki's mother died, she left him withtwo things: a talent for puppetry and stories of a lifetime search for a girl with wings who flew through the sky. Yukito takes on the quests as his own, eventually finding himself in a small town where he does odd jobs and looks after a clumsy girl named Misuzu to earn a living and place to stay. Though Misuzu also dreams of a winged girl and harbors several odd quirks, she is not the only girl/young woman in town with a story and boatload of peculiarities. Teenage Kano has a personality disorder that may or may not be related to a curse borne since childhood, Kano's adult sister Hijiri had to finish raising her after their parents died, Misuzu's hard-drinking biker-chick mother feels unfit to serve the role, and so forth. Gradually Yukito finds himself wrapped up in their stories while trying to figure out if any of the tantalizing allusions to a girl with wings mean anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will agree that this is one of the saddest anime that I have ever seen but it is also the sappiest anime that I\u2019ve seen, mainly due to the story in some parts was overdramatized and it left me not caring as much as the show wants me to, not that most of the feelings you get from this were justified.  The main storyline of the show is the basic line of this vagrant meeting a bunch of characters that are more likely one-time characters that you might forget about in the next episode and then in the second half of this 12-episode series, there was another flashback storyline that lasted about 2 episodes which stumble me for a bit, like they wanted to make a show like that but only fill that part for so little time.  Then there\u2019s Misuzu\u2019s sickness, which was never really explained thoroughly and I think by them not explaining what she\u2019s gotten, it\u2019s supposed to make us more concerned for her but really it still raises some questions to whatever she\u2019s got. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, characters are fairly balanced with a good amount of personality traits in them but the secondary characters are largely forgotten in the second half for Misuzu\u2019s arc when she was sick and even the main character Yukito wasn\u2019t much of a presence in those episodes, not that it matters, because he wasn\u2019t exactly a character that I actually worry about often. Yeah, he\u2019s smarmy in the beginning but soon he turns into a different man, but I totally expect that in this type of show. Haruko, Misuzu\u2019s mom (well, foster mother or aunt) is pictured as someone who was just stuck with Misuzu after her real parents either died or something like that but sooner or later, she and Misuzu do get close as a small family, but to say more would be spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is fairly great in this part of the show, although I have some gripes with that and the character designs, being that most of them looked younger than they are, like Haruko looks like a teenager than who I suspect be a 30-something woman. I know it\u2019s a small town but it just felt like it was barely living like the mentioned characters only inhibit this town. Character designs are very moe as suspected in an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music overall fits the tone of the series, although it\u2019s not as manipulatively sounding as the show is, it\u2019s very relaxing to hear, especially both the opening and ending theme songs and they are both singed by Lia, who\u2019s also the singer for another Key series, Angel Beats. The ADV Films dub was an alright effort but not nearly enough to call it impressive. Vic Mignogna, Monica Rial and Luci Christian do deliver great performances but the others were either theatrically hammy or just awful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Air can be sappy at some times but as it tries to make you feel sympathy, you are left with a feeling of confusion, unbalance, and just not being into the story or characters as much. I say that you should give it a chance for yourself before you turn it away but if you liked this kind of anime, you might like it but for others, I suggest you avoid at all costs.\\n",

            "content": "Oh man, where do I begen?\r\nThe 10000th summer. \r\nAir was quite something, I know a lot of people in the anime community that hate this anime, and others who say its poetry in motion, and others say that it is, the saddest anime ever made. With so many mixed reviews I decided to watch it and make my own opinion. Since it was so short, I decided I would watch it in one day, I started at 9 am and finished by 1 in the afternoon. And for the rest of the day, I was in a drift, just thinking about this show.\r\nThere are fourkinds of stories in this show. The one of the puppet master who travels to a quite seaside town were he meets a shy young girl who is very sad, and dreams of seeing the winged girl in the sky. Over the course of the show, the girl encounters a huge hurtal that changes the relashinship of her and her mother. That, to me was the saddest part of the show, were I had to wipe my eyes a couple times. It was just so beautifuly done, great voice acting. The fourth story tells how the girl in the sky came to be, its sort of like a subplot/OVA that they slipped into the show, but it works, and I always like a little backstory for all my characters when I'm watching anime. \\n\\n\r\nI think Air's message is that where there is happiness, there must also be saddness. They go hand-n-hand. The happiness of motherhood also has its sadness, being alone can have its benifits, but after awhile its not really worth it and the only way to be happy is make friends. But even those friends can hurt you, its like a double bladed sword. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Air was a trip. I neither loved it, nor hated it. The creators got their point around in 13 episodes, each one played out fantasticly as the story progressed. I do have to say, it didn't live up to the hype it had been getting. I really don't see why it would be a crime not to watch it. The art work dosen't really fit with the atmosphere of the general show. And the ending was kind of a let down. But Air is very human, it deals with real human emotions and struggles. So if you're into that, go ahead and watch it. But bring some tissues. \\n\\n\r\nTake care everyone. \\n\\n\\n",

While that is partly the case, looking at it objectively, there is a lot to love about this title.\r\nSo what makes Air so special?\r\n~ An Unforgettable Encounter ~\r\n\u201cSeawall\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to forget the vivid image of Misuzu standing atop the seawall, yearning for the sky, as Yukito wakes and sees her standing there. This is the moment I realised there was something different about this show. Clouds, ocean and wind are all painted together in this one scene that serves as avisual introduction to the themes to be presented down the road.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ A Multi-Layered Storyline ~\\n\r\n\u201cSimplexity\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of Air\u2019s story is the age-old dictum of less is more; or rather it is a great example of \u2018complexity born of simplicity\u2019. The plot, without really spoiling much, boils down to trying to free a cursed winged being, whose soul reincarnates constantly. I feel even that is over-simplifying it, but it\u2019s the characters that make this story so touching and humanly relevant. Air is, in essence, about love, and it\u2019s many manifestations.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, without spoiling anything, we are presented with love between parent and child, man and woman, siblings and a love that cannot realistically be categorised, but is nevertheless one of the most profound in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Air\u2019s ending is unusual for an anime in two aspects (no spoilers). One, is that it is bittersweet and combines an equal amount of tragedy and joy \u2013 though you\u2019ll still cry your heart out, I can almost guarantee that. Second is that it makes you think, makes you want to watch it again and pick up more details about the plot (adding to the re-watch value) and invites discussion. So rarely do anime present the viewer with something that isn\u2019t a straight, no-brainer ending that this is \u2013 if you\u2019ll excuse the pun \u2013 a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I strongly suggest that you go into watching Air with the mindset that it doesn\u2019t treat you like a dunce; it will require thinking and re-watching for you to understand all of it. Many people discount the plot as \u2018confusing\u2019 and therefore badly written. But it is, in fact, quite to the contrary; Air is a simple, yet complex and intelligently written, tightly written story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ No Less Unfortunate, a Protagonist ~\\n\r\n\u201cEmpathy\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMisuzu is one of the most, if not the most empathetic character in existence. Jun Maeda and the other writers at Key know how to make you feel for their characters. There\u2019s a reason Misuzu is my favourite character of all time and that reason is empathy. Empathy can be established if a character adheres to the following:\\n\\n\r\nMisfortune befalls the character\\n\r\nThey are kind\\n\r\nThey are funny\\n\r\nThey are relatable\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching, you\u2019ll know which of those Misuzu falls into, and they just happen to be some of the characteristics that evoke the strongest feeling of empathy towards a character.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ The Sound of a Seaside Town ~\\n\r\n\u201cAtmosphere\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI can say nothing other than that Air excels in the sound department. I only noticed it on my last re-watch, but the sound design in Air is incredible. After a bit of research I noticed that it was released with 5.1 surround sound, the only one of the Key/3 (Air, Kanon [2006] and Clannad + After Story) to be given this lavish treatment. Furthermore, Ted Jensen, a very high profile mastering engineer helped in this endeavor and wow, does it sound great.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design plays a huge part in establishing the beautiful, melancholic atmosphere of Air and I know next time I watch it, it will be in the comfort of my new 7.1 surround sound headphones.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, taken directly from the visual novel is also amazing. It also plays a huge part in establishing the atmosphere, with \u2018Natsukage\u2019 playing at Misuzu and Yukito\u2019s first meeting, making it all the more memorable with this beautiful piano piece. And I\u2019m not sure how they do it, but Key manages to make synths fit so well into the mood that I actually appreciate the fact that they\u2019re there. That is to say nothing of the equally wonderful opening theme, written and performed by Lia, who has never let me down.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ A Picturesque Sky ~\\n\r\n\u201cPainting\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe art, like the sound; is amazing. It\u2019s difficult to believe this was released in early 2005. Air was made in the period where digital colouring helped make anime look much more refined and polished, but was not yet tainted by the addition of a myriad of special effects. This gives it a very warm, pure, visual character that suits the story perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe clouds and ocean are beautifully rendered and are as much characters in the story as the human characters are themselves. The character designs themselves are some of my favourite, as I absolutely adore Key\u2019s character designs. They aren\u2019t for everyone, as the \u2018bug-eyes\u2019 can turn some people off, but I can\u2019t really say anything objective about this other than \u201cI really like them\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~ Finale ~\\n\r\n\"Adieu\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where subjectivity reenters the picture. Air will always, and forever be my favourite anime series. Nostalgia will only serve to reinforce that fact. I hope I\u2019ve convinced those who seem apprehensive, or do not appreciate the beauty that is this story to watch it with the right mindset.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed the review ^_^\\n\\n\r\nNow go, watch; for she is waiting in the air\u2026\\n",

I dont want to spoil any plotline or anything of that manner, but I totally recommend this, I'm a guy, and I was in tears with the last episode, I was so hooked on the characters and how the plotline expanded and involved throughout such a short time space. The soundtrack borrowed from the original infamous eroge game really did highlight the anime's characteristics and what it was truly capable of. Iloved how each and every single episode expanded on each character in depth and detail, and I am definately going to watch this again (hence buying the DVD boxset).

            "content": "Okay, ill probably take some heat for this review, but this should be said.\r\nAir has all the makings of being a gread anime, there was only one problem: It Sucked.\r\nNow lets talk about why I think that this did in fact suck. For starters, as ive already implied, there was potential for something truly magical, but it never happens. This anime couldve been the poster-child for the phrase \"cut the shit!\" because after the halfway mark I found myself thinking this at least once every thirty seconds over the course of the second half of the show(do the math and it comes out to about3600 times this though crossed my mind).\\n\\n\r\nSome more problems are that there was a questionable beginning, the plot climaxed far too soon, and only about half the viewers knew half of what was going on half the time! In addition the characters spend more time talking about their dreams than Martin Luther King Jr. (yes that just happenned) and I get that the dreams were supposed to be symbolic, but after a certain point you dont care anymore, and they just become a burden.\\n\\n\r\nI was sad at the end of this, but not in a good way. When im sad or crying at the end of an anime I want it to be because the story touched, or changed me somehow (examples would be angel beats, or clannad) NOT because I was sad/pissed that I just wasted time watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nI will end on this: the story was cut far too short, given more time i think that they couldve taken this somewhere; this just goes back to what ive been saying about wasted potential. The end (if you stick around long enough to see it) is quite touching (that is if you understand it) but that in no way salvages the ruined hulk of this show.\\n\\n\r\nPS- the marks I gave Air are based on the fact that I knew what was going on, and I am recognizing that there was potential, had I not understood it they wouldve been far lower.",

It had an impressive pedigree, its sister show Clannad is among one of my favorite anime shows. As such I put myself around to watch it. I can say with some certainty, that all in all it was disappointing. \r\n      The story was a train wreck beginning to end. Our protagonist with irksome hair is the aimless drifter, who hashappened into the town which serves as the setting. The thing is he is not aimless at all. In fact he has the lucid and reasonable goal of find a flying woman that his late mother talked about in the stories she told him. With that very obvious goal in mind he just wanders about in search of her. When he arrives in town he meets several girls each with an issue of there own. Here is where the story takes a very Clannad turn. He spends an episode or two helping the girls with there problem, and then they never appear again. Even saying that, he doesn't actually help anyone do anything. As a matter of fact he doesn't do much of anything throughout the series. The first girl, the energetic girl who is great with animals, who may I add also had wings sprout from her back is just about forgotten the over the next few episodes. You know nothing serious. The next girl, who is also the only girl I was close to liking, has an imaginary friend of sorts and a mother who doesn't know she exists. While this is all happening our ditsy heroine is busy doing nothing as well. \\n\r\n       Writing this out reminds me how terrible this show is. Also I am out of room to type so final thoughts, Don't bother watching this series unless you wish to bore yourself.",

However comparing to the plot development of other anime, Air doesn't have the capability to step up to the plate. The characters were fine and all developed very well, music and art were good for their time period of release. (Spoiler Alert). \r\nThe only problem I found was the plot twist of when Yukito \"dies\" to save Misuzu. The plot twist and development of this event ruined the anime for me, other than the fact thatI was looking for something sad to watch, watching this after Anohana didn't help. \\n\r\nOf course this is all my own personal opinion whether you choose to think I'm just a total jackass or not is up to you. \\n\r\nAir in its own aspect was a really good original story with an interesting way of taking a stab at the anime business. Ignoring the fact that it was adapted from an Adult Visual Novel and PC/Console game which included erotic scenes, it did its job and is one of the few anime that you can find to take a break from the standard shounen or shoujo.",

The only reason I kept watching was because of the Opening song tbh.\r\nUntill I got up to around episode 7. Everything began to change, you can feel something sad is about to happen and sense a build up of some sort you no longer see Misuzu as a dumb klutz but instead you see her as a very cute kind generous loving caring free spirited did I mention cute? Girl.\r\nI'm going to try to not spoil this animeas much as possible since it's important not to know the plot till you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is at first very difficult to follow as you're wandering who is who's recarination or what does the girl with the wings do or why does the girls with the wings have to fly in the sky... Makes very little sense but don't panic, use your imagination and sit through the 13 episodes of the anime before you decide anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. This anime has one of the saddest epic emotional endings I ever seen. Seriously this anime isn't even romance and you're like crying inside.\\n\r\nThe magic of Kyoto animation is that make little things appear like a huge deal and once you get used to that kind of atmosphere the anime is extremely emotional.\\n\r\nBut in a logic point of view compared to rl tragedy movies this anime is probably nothing compared to the hardships of what is displayed in most rl movies however rl movies don't have characters like Misuzu, rl movies don't have the magical atmosphere nor the bright use of colours and the super cute characters which totally change you.\\n\\n\r\nDon't judge this anime by it's cover, watch all 13 episodes and most likely you'll fall in love like I did.",

            "content": "Air TV is the prequel and first impression of melancholic and deep emotional harem anime. Where Kanon and Clannad (also harems) are developments after Air and have further story development. Honestly, I did love this anime very much, but there were too many small various downfalls that led to give it 8. The story plot at first appears all jumbled and distorted, and it becomes more clear down the road; but in a slow manner that people must use their own logic to come with the ideas. \r\nStory:  To tell the truth, this show really needs to be re-watched a couple of times toget the full idea of what Key (developer of all three animes) is trying to project. That's why most people turn away from this kind of show because it's hard to determine and is not a &quot;in your face&quot; answer. Also, since it is only 13 episodes, they could only put much into the show; and I think there really seems no exact closure which is very disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Misuzu, Yukito and the other girls in the anime are drawn and created so well. One thing especially well known by Key is their drawing of &quot;glassy eyes.&quot; To me, that is one of their most dramatic artistic aspects. And the detail in each scene and movement, is shown perfectly; by not revealing a pause in the readers' viewing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Key also has an amazing ear for developing small soundtracks to go with a certain scene and depicting the moods. The main song themes, Tori no Uta (Bird's Poem), Farewell Song, and Aozora (Blue Skies), were all sung by Lia but the lyrics were developed by the software company's main scenario writer, lyricist, and musical composer, Jun Maeda.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: One downside to some harem animes, like this one, is that there are many different girls. Each one has their own situation and much character development is brought. But as soon as the girl's situation is finished they are sort of &quot;tossed away&quot; and are not brought up much in the anime anymore. Key has done that matter in Air for most the time. Sometimes there are too many different characters brought up in the scenes, its very questionable as is to what their purpose is; but  in the end, the girls are benefiting each other to creating a more full character development for the next girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime really isn't one that you would see straight 13 episodes in one day because of the intense emotion and problem-solving is very draining of the brain. But if Asian dramas suit you, then Air fits perfectly within that category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: My own ranking for this was actually a 9 earlier, but as I wrote this review, it shows that Air TV is still and was only a pre-show of what Key's animes would become. That is how Kanon and Clannad turned about because they were the further tuning and corrections of Air TV. Honestly, if Kanon made you cry, then Air will melt your heart even more. Even with only 13 episodes, if took my breath away and left one of the deepest marks emotionally. If you think anime is all blood, action or romantic comedy, then this show is most certainly not for you. I still consider one of my top favorites and a wonderful break from all the generics.",

            "content": "(This review is spoilerfree)\r\nHow strong can a mother's love be? How far can a daughter reciprocate that love? Air is a good take on how powerful a mother-daughter relationship can be.\r\nThe most powerful theme presented by Air, without a doubt, is the bond between a mother and a daughter. We are then presented by \u201cmini-arcs\u201d involving the girls, Kano, Minagi, Kanna and also Misuzu. \r\nWhile the stories are undeniably touching (mostly thanks to the brilliant soundtrack behind the scenes), their impact cut short by how quick the pacing can sometimes be. In only 12 episodes (episode 13 is merely a recap anda commercial for Air in Summer, damn it), much to my chagrin, we aren't given much exposure to the each of the girls. \\n\\n\r\nAs such, characterization suffers, most notably to Kano and Minagi, whose arcs actually provide very little significance to the overarching plot. In a way, I believe that this happens because Air is based on a visual novel, by seeing their arcs to the very end, we get to see a feather float up into the air and dissolve into the air in the form of shiny particles. With my little experience with Key's visual novels (most notably Clannad), this is a way to determine your \u201ccompletion rate\" and how close you are to the real and final ending of the game. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that Air is a dating-sim game, and an eroge, to boot. In the game, you can choose one of the 3 main girls - Kano, Minagi and Misuzu to target and make her your lover. Ultimately the real and final ending is actually, Misuzu. So she takes up most of the screen time and we will spend more episodes reaching the conclusion of her arc, which puts a dampener onto the other two girls\u2019 arcs, a sad thing if you like them more. \\n\\n\r\nSupernatural elements are heavily featured here, and to a point I felt that it did not bode well with the how the show is trying to blend that into a slice-of-life show. All the dramatic incidents are all supernatural and in some way, it makes difficult to connect with the characters as whatever happens to them, won't really happen in real life. It may work better should the supernatural side be heavier, but unfortunately, the slice-of-life vibes are way too overpowering that I felt like these two themes are like oil and water.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is, viewers expecting a romance show should turn away, for the end product of Air yielded zero romance, which is weird for a dating-sim visual novel that features eroge. The most powerful theme that viewers should look forward for, is mother-daughter. I'd say this might make a decent viewing with your mom during mother's day (lol).\\n\\n\r\nPresentation wise, as expected from the soundtrack by Jun Maeda, dude knows how to create tear jerking moments using powerful music, not to mention the songs can get very memorable and inflict sufficient tear jerking damage simply by listening to it. \u201cTori no Uta\u201d is a very popular and revered song among the anime community, and it is not difficult to see why, for it is indeed one of the best openings I've ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nThough, I am still begrudged by the fact that, the vocal version of \"Natukage\" is nowhere to be found in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the animation could have been better. During the age of Kanon, Air and Clannad, the animation design from Key can be quite horrific - unusually large eyes on the heroines that are too far apart, and terribly small nose and mouth. The resulting face can be quite revolting, but at least Kyoto Animation did a very good job to tone that down as much as they can so it's not too cringeworthy.  However, aside from the grotesque faces, other things can pretty well made. \\n\\n\r\nMy final problem with Air, is the poor ending that leaves me very, very dissatisfied. I was hoping that episode 13 can be an alternative ending or something but sadly, episode 12 is the real and final episode. Still, it is a decent show if you want something that reminds you how great moms can be.\\n\\n\r\nFinal result: 6/10 fair. \\n",

I will be reviewing all the slice of a life anime's i've seen so far, so don't mind adding me as a friend if you are just like me a big fan of slice of a life anime's and want to discover more> \r\nAh... Air. Let's start with my personal opinion. For me it turned out not great. It might turn out great for you. But this is something that made me dissapointed. \r\nDon't get me wrong i didn't hit my head or something.The most reviews around here are really positive about it. I will explain in this review why I didn't like it. \\n\\n\r\nStory, \\n\r\nThe first Key classic formula story. This is where story's like clannad and kanon have to thank about the way they are. And i can understand that people would love this kind of story. But there's just to much wrong here in this story. A girl that just allow's some hobo to live in her house. And the mother agree's with this. Then the story goes really slow. Nothing special happend's really. and then it suddenly turns into something weird. (I don't want to spoil stuff) But you get a view of an old ancient story. And that it affects the main story. That's uhm.. Interessting. But then the complete story replay's. It just felt so rushed. When the last episode hit's the credit's it just made me think whadufaq? Did i missed something. So i decided to watch the movie and yeah. Same thing but a little different. I am sorry. But it's not my fav anime i've seen. Sorry key. Here's a 6. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nSomething that key never dissapointed me. It's awesome drawed and i'm a big fan of this kind of art. Can't really tell more then that i'm giving this an 8. \\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nSame as the art. It's good. Doesn't really stand out. But it's not making my ears bleed. Here's an 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nAs for the male mc. I alway's can find some sort of connection with them if they are from a key anime. But this one just made me the feeling that it was one big douche. I didn't really like this person. \\n\r\nAs for the girl. She's actually the first one that made those weird sound's. As you have Uguu from clannad. And Wafuuu! from Little buster's. you have Gao (sound that a dinosaur make's) That's one of those thing's that i enjoy from key anime's. Some small connections with other anime's. I give it a fair 6.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. \\n\r\nLike i said before the ending just destroyed it for me. I've never been so dissapointed with an ending like this. Specially when it had allot of potentional in the start. So sorry here's a 5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. \\n\r\nIf you are a big fan of key i would say you can watch it. Also if you like anime's where you have to use ur brain give it a shot. But there are so many more anime's that just gave me a much better feeling while watching it. And after i finished it.",

It is also one of their earlier works; succeeded by kanon and clannad the following years.  The moai fad many people like and remember, and good music.  The characters and story are somewhat forgettable, but the whole series had the lightness of floating on air.  You won't watch it and say it's one of the best anime, but it's good at what it does and does it well.  Vic Mignona (Edward Elric) and (Broly) voiced the lead.  It'san anime I would watch again and recommend.  KyoAni is one of my favorite anime studios with high quality animation.  Because they don't rely on violence to show power or fan service to show charisma.  If you watch Air you're not an airhead, but to accept the transcience that is life.",

            "content": "Air is (yet another) KyoAni anime adapting a KEY Visual Novel, just like Kanon 2006 and Clannad.\r\nIn my opinion, Kanon feels like a prototype of Clannad (in the sense that they have similar structure, storytelling and themes). As for Air, it felt like less than a prototype for Kanon, as it takes similar stories, but without the level of writing or structure of the other series.\r\nSTORY\r\nYukito is a traveller looking for a \"winged girl in the sky.\" He settles in a town where he meets several girls, and (of course) each girl has tragic backstories that we get to learn one after another.\r\nThe setting wasquite interesting. Whereas Kanon and Clannad were rather realistic (despite the supernatural elements, the stories and their themes were deep and ground-to-earth), Air chooses to be a complete dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe prominent theme is \"Sky\". Yeah, this is definitely not a deep theme, especially compared to Kanon (which theme is \"regrets\") or Clannad (which theme is \"Life\" as a whole). Where Kanon and Clannad can be Life lessons, there's nothing to learn from Air.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not what brings the series down to me. The worst is the huge lack of detail and explanation. The series is short (12 episodes) but still has plenty stories to tell. As a result, each story is wrapped up in 2 episodes, leaving no time to develop either the characters or the story. Everything felt rushed, which ultimately destroys any kind of impact the story could have.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, the stories are nice, but way too fast to have a huge impact like Clannad or Kanon had.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nIt's the same style as Kanon and Clannad, a bit less polished as it is a bit older, but it's not ugly. Only the animation was quite bad sometimes, but this is minor in this series.\\n\r\nOverall nice, but not exceptional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nI love the opening. It is dreamy, catchy, and in the end, memorable. As for the OST, I like the main theme, but overall I found the music less memorable than that of Clannad or Kanon. That said, it does fit the scenes and never breaks it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the seiyuus. Overall they're not bad... except Misuzu's mother. Most of the time she just annoyed me, and in the final episodes she utterly destroyed the drama. She was so off sometimes!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nI loved Misuzu, and I liked Michiru's story. Kanna was very fun to watch as well. As for the others, I didn't find them particularly attaching. But this is due to the very short time we get to know each of them. I'm sure it would be better in the VN, where each story takes more time.\\n\r\nAs for the MC, I found him very unlikable. Although he was fun to watch in the beginning, and in the end I did like his story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nJust like Kanon and Clannad, Air is fun but still has tragic stories. But it is way too short for what it has to tell, so everything is rushed, which destroys all the impact the series could have.\\n\r\nAir is very dreamy, so it may be the best to escape reality ; but on the other hand, it has nothing to teach, which brings it down compared to its \"sisters\".\\n\r\nOverall I would say it is worth watching after Kanon and Clannad, but without expecting the same level.",

It started out as this light hearted comedy, which you think nothing of it, THEN, THEN, it just takes this drastic, dark, sad turn. By the 6th episode, your eyes are puffy and nose running. The animation was beautiful, the storyline, the historic factors and the secrets of the town and the people. I had to take plenty of breathers from this show because it became too overbearlingly sad at times. I had so many mixedemotions by the end. That final episode is the one that gets you. Watch at your own risk if you're prepared for a good cry.",

It had good romance, a good story line and great characters so this anime for me is a 10/10 as it was the very first anime to make me cry. Back in 2013, I was depressed as hell due to all the bullying I was going through. \r\nWhen I started watching it, the opening was one of the most beautiful openings I didn't skip. Not only did it reach my expectations, but it made it even better.\r\nThe characters were particularly memorable. Misuzu especially. She was one of the most unforgettablecharacters I've ever seen. The story line was very touching even though it's very short. I had to stop at episode 11 just because of the super sad episode. I continued at the final episode and the ending was just depressing.\\n\\n\r\nI liked Air the most as it was more short, precise and watchable. Even though Air ended almost 10 years ago, I want to know about more of the characters like Kanna, Yukito and etc.",

As the story evolves Misuzu's becomes more sick because she isn't allowed to love somebody [just like Kanna the winged girl from 1000 years ago -] as she constaly dreams about her other half...I won't spoil much but in the end Both Misuzu and Yukito's dies.\\n\\n\r\nNow...I have to say for 13 episodes I cried kindda alot...At Kanna's arc, at Yukito's death, when he momentanly transformed back to a human beeing from a crow just to say to Misuzu that he love's her, and finally...I cried just like a little girl at Misuzu's death T_T [I'm man enough to confess that -].\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was a bit hard to understand at the begining, but as the story evolved I understand what was hapening and such...\\n\\n\r\nTo end this...the situation seemed ripped of from real life...I really like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautifull and some interesting landscapes.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was gorgeos.I allready downloaded to my PC the OST pack.The OP/ED was magnificant.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters wre pretty interesting and funny...but I felt all the emotions they've been trough.But the character I liked the most was Kanna [I am trully fascinated by her...and that's why for the first time I added to my favourite character a girl that I only see her 2 episodes -]\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nEnjoyed to the fulles\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nA pretty nice anime romance but saddly too short >.",

            "content": "~The 1000th Summer~\r\nSTORY:\r\nThere are a lot of people always put this anime at the bottom when comparing them to the other two anime that are part of the Key Trilogy, and I can definitely see why as well as well as a missed opportunity of appreciation.\r\nIf you don't already know, Key anime are adaptations of Visual Novels by Key Visuals. \r\nAs for its story, its standard stuff when it comes to Key Animes, with a male protagonist with many females getting their own arcs, each one having some sort of supernatural/drama bend that is most likely sad in some way, if there is one thingthis anime and other Key Adaptations do the best is making you cry.\\n\\n\r\nNow everything is going great, many arcs are clearing up, being resolved and when we get into Misuzu's Arc, it goes to a different setting...\\n\\n\r\nMedieval times...\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that this anime did wrong, its this, as:\\n\\n\r\n-They didn't tie it in well with the actual plot. \\n\r\n-Plot slows down, causing very spastic pacing.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is a reason why they did this, as the Visual Novel was broken up into three different parts:\\n\\n\r\n-Dream\\n\r\n-Summer\\n\r\n-Air\\n\\n\r\nAs the Summer section goes through the whole Princess Kana mess fairly well, and it actually has been transferred well onto screen in the Air Motion Picture, but this is this and that is that. \\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how they tried to stay true to the Visual Novel it is attached to it, but it could've been done, MUCH better, and its a shame because when the Air section comes in, it ends off with a bitter sweet ending and generally, it ended off well, but it was the storytelling in between that was just aggravating, because there are more accurate portrayals of this adaptation of the section.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nExecution: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn't for that one major miss, it would've saved it from such an, \"average-good\" score.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nAs for Animation, its Kyoto Animation, despite it being the oldest one with it being a little less detailed per usual with older animation, but Kyoto animation is what it is, and even back then the art is really high in quality and to be honest, really cute...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSay all you want, Kyoto Animation is what is it, and I like the art design.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, most of the music is nice, but mostly forgettable, except for the Opening (Tori No Uta) which is one of my favourite openings ever.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with that there is another song worth mentioning, \"Aozora\" which is perfectly placed at the end, my house is still flooded.\\n\\n\r\nDub:\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, there are some really good parts, as well as very eh parts.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters such as:\\n\\n\r\n-Yukito\\n\r\n-Haruka\\n\r\n-Misuzu\\n\\n\r\nAll have some really nice takes in the portrayal for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDub - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if the music wasn't all remixes of the intro, it would get an 8 (except for some stand out song that were few and far between).\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:8/10\\n\r\nEXECUTION:6/10\\n\r\nART:9/10\\n\r\nMUSIC:7/10\\n\r\nDUB:8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 4/5\\n\\n\r\n\"The direction is there, but the path is filled with twist in turns, but near the horizon, you see a light, will you take that path?\" -Nerpco\\n",

That being said, it's not necessary to say that this show's plot is conveyed well so that you feel the emotion it is supposed to make you feel.\r\nThe animation is crisp and shows motion very well.  The shadows and highlights are done perfectly, but it's not overpowering.  Kyoto Animation did a wonderful job animating this series.  So well, that the art surpasses the quality of that from the visual novel it is based on.\r\nEach of the characters are uniqueand have a very interesting story to tell.  Although it is obivous that Misuzu's story is the most important one, do not let the others go without the same amount of attention.  On the contrary.  Each of them are wonderful and worthwhile, as well as enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this anime is perfect, meaning it guides the story and helps you feel the mood of the story.  The opening theme reflects the content of the show very well, and that is based on the audio alone.  The ending theme song is somewhat lacking, but that's not very important, as it is what ends each episode instead of starting it off.\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is beautiful, a very carefully constructed piece of art that is refreshing and warms you up.",

That alone is impressive, especially if you know me well. \r\nHow exactly do I describe Air? Well, first off, it is not eroge, you don't have to worry about that. Yet in a way, this is one of the more adult animes that I have seen. Air is somewhat of an arthouse piece. It doesn't feel the need to explain its themes, the story is fuzzy at points, and I would be lying if I said that I succinctly knew justwhat the hell everybody was talking about 100% of the time. But if you give this show a chance I promise that it will be worth it. I will not go into the plot, not only because the guidelines to the left of this word processor are sternly telling me not to, but also because the plot is meant to be seen through the show. Just take my word on this, it is offhandedly clever. The characters are also very endearing, from Yukito the wandering puppeteer to Potato the dog. The dub acting is really good as well. If you want to see the best performances that Vic Mignogna and Luci Christian have ever given, look no further than here. If you want a drama that can go from innocent fun to heart wrenching drama effortlessly, go here. Air is an odd specimen, but it is also one of the best animes that I have seen.",

Key's style is unique, but amazing with the scenery and what not, and they always pick the best music for their scenes. \r\nI think the characters were okay; only Misuzu was really developed. The other two heroines are a little flat and don't show multiple sides of themselves. The MC was similarto Clannad and Kanon's: he's financially and socially weak, but he has a kind heart and wants to help all the heroines. \\n\\n\r\nI know most people review the story first, but I wanted to save it for the end. Will Air make you cry? Probably. The story is extremely emotional, and I'm a fan of sad animes (obviously I don't watch them too too often) so I liked it, but from a plot-based viewpoint, the story is a bit confusing. There are some contradictory details, and that combined the sudden ending makes for a very unsatisfied feeling after watching it. It's not like Clannad or Kanon where there's definite closure; the story just kind of stops which is unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say Air was not as strong as Kanon or Clannad, but still definitely worth a watch if you like fantasy (there's a ton of magic) and emotional stories.",

            "content": "At its core, Air is a story about motherly love. All the stories are in one way or another connected to this theme. Characters trying to relate to their mothers, characters trying to be good mothers, it gives the show a strong heart and some of the most genuine drama that anime has ever put to the screen.\r\nWe follow Yukito, a modern vagabond with psychic puppeteer-powers... so we know right from the start there will be magical elements in the story. It's pretty obvious it was based from an eroge due to the cast of one male and several girls, but it manages to distanceitself from the harem-genre by removing itself from the clich\u00e9s like the school-setting and generic protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has no fear of going against typical story-telling structure, as proven by the last third of the show, which may or may not confuse some people at first, but makes it all the better after several viewings and connecting the dots.\\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of the first of the three girls, I felt Key pull at my heart-strings as they're known for. They've managed to tell their story in its entirety in just 13 episodes and brought their characters to their limits. Combine this with a great soundtrack and superb direction that knows just how time every beat, and you have a near perfect drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a show I could never recommend enough.",

            "content": "Wel, Air an anime based on a visual novel for adults, an anime that call my attention by saying that is one of the greatest in love story and by its popularity but that left me with certain doubts about what the producers wanted to express with this anime. \r\nSTORY\r\nWith the story of Air I have doubts, as I say early, this because when I started watching it has some like twisted forms to view how the plot wants to be developed since it has a division of arcs. The story starts with Yukito a Magician from the streetsand then he encouters Misuzu a girlthat seems like dumb but that really has suffered a lot. As a the story goes by you'll see that more characters will be shown and each one related to the ''Air'' itself. With this story simply has some forms to twist the viewer's  mind in certain way. Because The plot has  like miniplots (Like 3 I guess) that will make you bored you since when I saw this series the plot was too linear for me. The characters didn't show that form of ''Love'' and ''Relationship'' cause The settings and themes weren't show in a way that the audience could understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe first miniplot was the one that hate most because it doesn't developed in a way that the characters show how they wanted to be in the Air. They just like ''feel'' to be there. Because it doesn't show right away of what they suffer. That until the episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe second miniplot simply made me say WTF? Cause you change from the present to the past in which that shows why the Air is united with this story but simply it doesn't that apports something brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nThe Last one was the one that finally make the story at least to be safe because it is told from a ''different'' character and what happen to the characters after the second miniplot. This is the one that shines the most since it reveals the characters true feelings and what they have being suffering. Simply great this one.\\n\\n\r\nART.\\n\r\nThe Art is simply great. It reminded me of the times when I saw anime as a kid simply beautiful and showing a great interest cause it holds a form of indicate everything to the characters up to the scenario. Simply brilliant. The only think I hate was the character desing of the face but that in the characters part.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND.\\n\r\nAnother great thing. Because it contains a feeling of peace with every instrument that the musicians used. Perhaps the OP/END are not of my taste because it's music that is too slow and will not make part of my mood.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS.\\n\r\nWell they are well desing with the art that shown but The only problem that I see as I say that their faces were too small to be drawn with those big eyes. Besides that, the problem that I see with every character is that they suffer in a way but show it in a form randomly cause they didn't want to say it and even to die with it. That's what I saw in everyone there.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT.\\n\r\nIt is not bad but you have patience since this thing twist every part of the plot. I enjoy in some sort of way but it just like of Boring, Sorprising, Randomness,sadness and WTF? forms of viewing it. I like it but the producers should'nt have done that form of way maybe they could do it directly but hidden at the same time, to make a plot incredibly awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 Since the ending is incredible but the forms and arcs ruins great part of this anime cause its confusing. So if you want to the play with your watch this.\\n",

The reason for the story getting an 8 is I feel sometimes its too slow or too rushed and sometimes the pacing just isn't perfect. The characters were a bit too cutesy and cliche but the voices matched their personalities, as KyoAni is also known for their good choice in voice actors. I overall enjoyed the anime and cried a little at the end :) (Hey who didn't?)",

There were things i liked, and things i didnt, of course, like any other anime.\r\n   I didn't like how the side characters didn't tie in with the main plot, which involves Misuzu. I also saw no point in the fact that the guy turned into a crow, because it didn't affect Misuzu's fate much. For the side character's plot, I felt that they could've gone into a little more detail, especially with the girl with the ribbon onher wrist ( I forget her name) and how she got possessed. \\n\\n\r\n   This anime made me cry so much, my tissue box was gone within 5 episodes. I enjoyed how it dipped into the paranormal to create a surreal feeling that mixed in well. Happy moments made me cry, sad moments made me cry. The story was tragic, but even so there was a sense of possible hope too. It showed emotions raw and unflinchingly clear and the fact that there isn't always a happy ending. \\n\\n\r\n   The art and music was outstanding. The art was beautifully detailed and was eye candy. The music, while at the same time light, also had a sad tone to it. Just listening to some of the music, such as the ost Natsukage, brings tears to my eyes. Definitely added to the beauty of the anime.",

            "content": "Air is a series I still cannot completely accept was based off of a visual novel; When placed amongst other VN-based anime series, it is incomparable. It lacks all of the generally present harems, ecchi, and a female cast that all happen to go off the deep end over the same exact guy. Instead, what we have here is a plot lacking mostly all originality. The back of the DVD box says it perfectly; \"An elusive girl in the sky...does she even want to be found?\" As much as I would also like to tell you I actually stole that from Gerard Way's nightstand, thatpretty much sums up our overdone fantasy plot. However a very, very important and often forgotten fact Air proves is that you needn't always seek pure originality. Sometimes, a well written script, well crafted cast and good, moody score can carry a series far above it's respective genre. I commend Air for being completely cliche, but doing so in a way that makes it a wonderful watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory; 9. As hard as it is to type, let alone tell another person, this visual novel based show has one of the best written plots and scripts I've yet seen in anime. I was caught completely off guard once I was about three or four episodes into this series. The plot develops well, and a turning point that initially registered as a series ruining tragedy for me eventually became one of the best arcs of the series for me. Yes, I did say arcs; In thirteen episodes, Air spans three arcs, and does so successfully. The ending is emotional regardless of the viewer, and that is again thanks to a stellar script supported by a genuinely likable cast. The ending still pulled my heart strings. All three times I watched it. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt; 8. Key's VN series may not appeal to everyone, however they are undoubtedly some of the most fluently animated series out there right now. However, Air is a bit older than it's brother series such as Clannad, and although still visually acceptable, has a select few visual flaws. You may notice...why am I even trying to sugarcoat this? You will, if you have eyes, notice the fish-like characters, a perfect example being Misuzu and her mother. The eyes are so much further apart than need be; also, the colors are almost completely consistent, however here and there they seem to dim out. This I attribute to the series age, however, it's still part of the score. On a positive note, Air's character designs were top notch. Of the many school uniforms I've seen over the years thanks to anime, these are some of the better, less perverse ones (much more realistic). The series landscapes, in an inexplicable way, grow on you. They managed to capture a feel that lingers between reality and a video game. It was very unique, which I greatly enjoyed. The town definitely emitted a strange wonder, which worked perfectly for the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 9. As expected from drama, piano and string themes are found thought the show. However, as is not usually the case with these types of series (I am looking at you, romcom harems...) the BGM did not make me wish I had been born deaf. It was not too special, but the fact that it didn't harm the series was a great help to my enjoyment of it. Also, the opening was fitting. Not my cup of tea, but not glossy pop like I usually get to hear out of anime OPs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 9. Another cool milestone Air has created was that our main protagonist is not a tool, not a womanizing douche, and really...not much of anything. He is properly fleshed out, but enough detail is left out that it almost allows him the ambiguity of becoming anyone; namely, you can really easily slip yourself into his shoes. I can't with words explain how they did it, but Air is really an adventure you can often forget you are not actually part of. The style which the main male was portrayed in was really unique, and worked wonders for the show. As far as the direct/supporting cast, Misuzu, Kanna, and her mother are all incredible characters. They were developed beyond what you would ever expect from such a series, and the end involves characters you would never have predicted at the series beginning. The summer arc, Kanna's, fit into the series like a puzzle piece. I was initially skeptical, however this arc was well thought out and played greatly into one of the shows greatest moments, the ending. Really, the character depth combined with the critically important storyline made this series one you can't miss.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall; 9. You may have missed it before, but I have watched Air three times. It is still just as gripping and enjoyable as it was the first time, and with it's re-issue in a very nice thinpak, it is the best 40$ you could ever spend on anime. Air is by no means my favorite anime, and is also far from the most original story you have seen; however, the sheer effort that went into making it as good as possible and greatly exceeding the expectations set for it's genre make it the Shakugan No Shana of VN Romcom/Harem series. In the end, Air proves that even if originality is dead, there's nothing wrong with a little well-planned repetition!",

Instead the last arc of the anime was more unique and to be honest with you, I think the final scene of this anime made me cry more than Clannad which made me cry a lot\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThough it has it's flaws and even having quite a boring start. I wuld say that the story is good although a bit complicated, especially when the time I watched this I was expecting it to be likethe previous Kyo Ani/Key titles Kanon and Clannad where the main guy gets the girl but this anime did not focus on that instead focusing on family. Although I did not understand the arc where they went back during ancient japan, I'd still say that this anime deserves a 9/10 rating\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the earlier titles of the KyoAni/Key series so I understand that their art is more akin to the style of Inuyasha (which kyoani also worked on during the olden days).\\n\r\nI'd say that art is not really the strongest  that this anime  has to offer\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough not as memorable as the Clannad OST, The soundtrack of this anime still is one of a kind. it never fails to bring the feels, especially on the last scene. Once the music starts rolling, tears unkowingly fell from my eyes and my chest felt really tight and I had goosebumps all over my body. I' d say that the soundtrack of this anime deserve a high rating\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 \\n\r\nCharacterwise I think they gave most of the characters development, especially the main girl. I just felt that the main guy's goals are a bit complicated, does he like the girl, ? or is he just a guardian of some sorts. either way I think they still gave a good job on characters in this anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nIt was a bit complicated but it was still a very enjoyable ride for me, if it wasn.t I wouldn't have finished it. I still watch the final scene from youtube up to this day, I really love that part. and it was the saddest \"Goal\" of my entire life\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nA bit complicated but still worth it adaptation of Kyoto animation based on a Key visual novel, I suggest that you do not drop this anime and watchi t until the end and I promise that you would not regret it.",

If the had added a few episodes to this series it could have beenvery succesful, maybe making a deeper relation between the main characters just to end with a little of a happier more meaning full ending.   i wouldnt recommend this at all for someone looking for a good ending.  \\n\\n\r\np.s. im drunk now as i write this review and i know most people wont find this review helpful :)",

The music is very relaxing and beautiful, and depicts the emotions of the show extremely well. The art is equally as stunning. Everything is very vibrant, providing the show with that feeling of life it meant to give off. \r\nThe story itself was breathtaking. It's so simple on the surface, yet still so meaningful. The gentle, dramatic themes of the series were very emotional and you're able to relate to the situation in question, even if it's not what you're facing or if it just isn't realistic, simplybecause of the deeper meanings. Rarely have I been so moved by a series as I have by Air. I strongly recommend it to those who haven't seen it.\\n\\n",

Personally, I liked it for it's drama, but from time to time, I found myself lost in the story. In the beginning it seems to be a pretty funny cast of characters, but over time you realize that this story is pretty sad. And not to ruin the story, but once you get into it, almost half of the characters disappear.\r\nAside from that though, the drama in this anime is crazy sad and gets you to start talking to charactersin on screen in a way you thought only crazy people would (seriously it will), hoping that individuals would take another path.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I give this anime a 8/10 due to it's heart wrenching drama, but for other viewers, give this anime at least three episodes, then if you don't like it drop it and if you like it, it gets better.",

            "content": "AIR is an anime from KyoAni and adapted from Key's/Visual Art VN like Clannad and Kanon. At first, i watch this anime because i have watched clannad and yeah that anime was awesome and nominated as the best anime ever. Because i know that AIR and Kanon are from Key's as well, i decided to take a look at this anime. As expected from KyoAni and Key's, this anime was awesome too, although clannad is superior because it has more simple story and more length. Well, to the reviews.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story of Yukito as MC that had told by his mother to find the girlin the sky and help her. The story is beautifully made by Key's although when adapted to anime, its confusing so that you must see this anime twice to understand the story. But relax, the enjoyment is still there although the story is too fast and confusing. And im sure the story of AIR is as good as Clannad except that the story packed with 13 episode so sometimes it feel rushed. And yeah KyoAni know how to make a good drama anime : by removing fanservice and ecchi things from it. AIR is hentai game/VN from Key's, but not when adapted to anime. A very huge assets for this awesome anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell this is 2005 anime so the art aren't so beautiful but its good. And as expected from KyoAni, the animation is so smooth and the ocean are beautiful. The art is good so that you will enjoy every scene of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good. Tori no Uta as this anime OP song are good. When i have watched this anime, and then again i hear this song i can feel the sadness from this anime and almost cried. Amazing. And there is a beautiful song that can bring the atmosphere of sad scene and can make you cry, seriously. So i think the sound is a proud thing for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nVery Good ! This is why i like AIR beside from sound and the story. We can feel the character development among the main character. There's a character that have been annoying to me since i first watch this anime. But in the end that person have a HUGE character development and have a HUGE role too. That character development alone can make me cry. Especially in that scene where The Main Female and this person share their beautiful feeling in the ocean. Overall, the characters in this anime is decent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell, because the story is confusing and a bit rushed, i feel a little enjoyment when watching episode 1 to 10. But start from episode 11, i feel a lot of enjoyment (or should i say *cough*sadness*cough*?).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from KyoAni Trio (Clannad, Kanon, AIR). This anime doesn't fail to make me amazed. The scene, Beautiful Ocean, Good Story, Good Music and Good Drama. I think when i have watched clannad, i won't find other anime that can make me cry like i watched clannad. But i was wrong, i cry a lot too when i watch this anime. Not to give you a spoiler but, this anime a bit different in Ending than Clannad and Kanon. You will see when you have watched it :)",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nThe story of Air is a unique warm hearted tale which sent me through a roller coaster of emotion. I thought the story was both creative and unique considering I have yet to find an anime with a similar plot. The story began light hearted and mysterious, which willed me to complete the anime, I found myself smiling throughout and wanting to see more. Although the story is as I said above, the ending wasn't very rewarding for me, I'd say more but I'd like to prevent giving spoilers. Granted the story is fairly confusing and I did find myself sometimes re watching small segmentsto get the jist of what was going on. As expected from Key Visual Arts, the creators of the visual novel \"Air\", they have made a beautiful tale which builds you up only to knock you back down with pure emotion!\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is your typical Key Visual Arts animation with the insanely large eyes and immense attention to detail; it may take a while for some to get used to this style of art but you will soon find yourself loving it. The art overall is consistently beautiful and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe sound isn't much to be desired, being a short anime of 13 episodes it doesn't have an array of opening or endings, however the 1 opening and ending it does have were fairly good and catchy. The background music during the animation wasn't poor but not exactly the best I've ever heard either.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThere weren't many characters but the ones I saw were pretty good, each was shown an in depth back ground story which made you love even the characters you didn't like to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs an avid Key Visual Arts anime lover, I really enjoyed this one too. There wasn't a moment I got bored and I ended up watching the anime all in one day. It interested me and willed me to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nOverall I believe Air is a wonderful fantasy tale that is heart warming, emotional, and creative, making me feel so much in just 13 episodes! I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it, especially if your a fan of other Key Visual Arts projects such as Kanon, Clannad, Little Busters and Angel Beats.",

            "content": "Misuzo is an annoyingly happy and hospitable girl, doing her best to get Yukito to stay at her house and be her friend, including using cunning tricks against her aunt, Haruko. She's like a robot, using Gao every time she's about to cry or troubled, tripping easily, asking a whole bunch of questions, and acting silly which somehow gets people to care about her? What? I mean why would the aunt at first disbelieve Yukito's reasons to stay and then believe him?\r\nToo many tsunderes in the show makes it not that good even if there's fun to be had elsewhere. The amateruish writing makes Aira show that we've felt like we've seen before. Yukito is tsundere, sometimes acting cold and other times, acting likeable, making him quite inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nMisuzu is a butt, at first I thought I would like her but she just turned out more foolish than I expected! She lies, whines and makes a big deal out of small things she could've fixed, constantly stops the world for Yukito just to play with him, unrealistically optimistic and seemed too nice. She also keeps too many secrets! Come on, Misuzu could\u2019ve been well-executed, too! Being the innocent, childlike girl sounds cool but she needs to grow up!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters such as Minagi seem like they serve little purpose but could\u2019ve been well-executed. I mean, none of the characters are that good, the best is probably Yukito because he can be funny getting annoyed with that annoying Misuzu! The auntie is the clich\u00e9 of the neglectful caretaker acting like an idiot but then turns caring too fast. Michiru is too loud and obnoxious. And what's the point in Kana?\\n\\n\r\nThe show descends into melodrama, which is a bit too much for me, I guess not well-directed. I feel that the series should\u2019ve shown some of that overly forgetful Misuzu at school! I mean, she takes care of animals? How so?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, well, it\u2019s beautiful. The series is beautifully produced but Misuzu\u2019s eyes when she was crying in the card scene made her look like she was going to fall out! Though, the character design looked dated. \\n\\n\r\nMisuzu's voices the only one annoying? Well, yeah, they're supposed to be. Maybe it's the directors' fault. Michiru's is well... annoying in the dub. Luci Christian is unrecognizable as Haruko. \\n\\n\r\nToo bad that Air is a sub-par series best to watch if you're bored.\\n",

            "content": "I love Kyoto Animation and have watched almost everything they've done since this show came out. I also love that they adapt most of Key's visual novels, and this show, Kanon, and Clannad are some of the most entertaining and moving shows I've seen. Air is the earliest KyoAni Key adaptation, however, so it was interesting to see how they started, since I had watched both Clannad and the 2006 version of Kanon before seeing this show.\r\nThe story is mysterious and has a sort of wistful feel to it. It's not entirely explained, and there is a touch of the supernatural involved with each characterarc, and the setting of a seaside town was very relaxing most times. It also has a sad ending, and it was fairly moving, but it didn't manage to make me cry.\\n\\n\r\nThe art still looks good despite being 10 years old, and I have a thing for the art style of Key novels, and KyoAni reproduces the style very accurately. Some people may be turned off by the female characters' abnormally large eyes, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a beautiful but anguished sounding song, and the ED was good but not as memorable. The BGMs are all well crafted and fit the mood, and I like the synthetic sound a lot of them have. The English dub was well done, and Luci Christian's performance as well as Vic Mignogna's were outstanding. I am planning on rewatching this show in the Japanese dub so I have no comment on its quality yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a mixed bag, but I found Haruko to be the most enjoyable one out of all of them. Her story of being Misuzu's \"mother\" was very heart-wrenching to watch and she felt like a very down-to-earth person trying to live their life the right way. Misuzu is a clutzy, but lovable girl who has some tragic fate and mostly ends up being someone to feel sad for, which then also makes one feel sad for her mother, Haruko. Yukito, the protagonist, was an interesting character, and though we don't find out much about him, I like that most of who he is is kept shrouded in mystery. He has a simple backstory and he's a man on a mission to find out about some lady in the sky that his mom talked about. And he does puppet shows. But he ends up getting fairly downplayed near the end of the show. Any romance (as it is one of the genres tagged for this show) is not really developed, and I can really only say there were some vague \"feelings of affections\" between Yukito and Misuzu flying through the air at most. Also, there is a pair of characters that appear in flashbacks from ancient Japan that are somehow related to the characters in the modern day story, and their interactions are fairly enjoyable. They make a cute couple in my opinion, but their story also ends tragically if I remember correctly.\\n\\n\r\nI would say enjoyed this show, but not as much as either Kanon or Clannad, which both have more or less the same premise, albeit reimagined. Befriend a bunch of strange girls, help them with their unusual circumstances, move on until the main climax arc with main waifu. I only watched Air because I figured I owed it to myself as a KyoAni fan to go back and see some of their earlier stuff (I'm a little scared of going any earlier than this though). Overall it was a short, sad story that stuck with me for a little while in the way that stories that feel like, though they ended, you wish you could have done something to help the people that went through what they did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an entertaining show to watch if you want something slow and intriguing with a tragic end that is close to being amazing, but falls short due to some strange production decisions near the last few episodes.",

Now his mother had past down this story of the girl in the sky for generations, and have been always looking for her. Yukito's mother passes away, and he makes it his goal (as his ancestors did) to find and help this \"Girl in the sky.\" So he eventually travels to this one town and through certain events meets up with a girl named Misuzu. NowMisuzu is you basic, cute, clumsy girl, but there is something special about her. Apparently since meeting Yukito, she's been having dreams of flying through the sky. The story from there breaks off a bit, but stay on track with Misuzu along the way, but you also hear the stories of Kano and Minagi, who are two other girls in the town who's problems you help with. After aiding then, you continue on with Misuzu and learn more about her dreams. Also with a few episodes thrown in about the story of WHO the winged girl is. And after that mini recap, you continue on with Misuzu and finish off her story. It gets extremely sad from that point on.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to see my full VIDEO review on it, here's a link.\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8zKCxAqfMA",

            "content": "Overall\t\r\nIt's like I've always said; anime should be kept short. 13 episodes is plenty enough to tell any story, no matter how complicated and ambitious. Make that 12, by the way. Episode 13 is just a quick fast-forward recap of the whole series. Episode 12 is really the last one.\r\nA very interesting setting with great characters, good graphics and told in a wonderful way. \r\nI loved the mood throughout the series. It reminded me of Haibane Renmei or the old PC game Sanitarium; A light and innocent approach, but with an undertone of hopelessness and doom. I don't know how they did it, but ittruly was great.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\t\\n\r\nI didn't actually like the character design; all the girls are too doll-like with oversized eyes and huge chins. Ok, big eyes is normal in anime, but this was extreme. I think the design made the characters look unpersonal.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, that doesn't matter. You will love all the characters anyway. An impressive feat by the creators.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically, AIR looks great, especially \"natural\" effects like clouds, sunbeams, stars and the like. Just a little minus for the somewhat dull character design.\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nMusic was ok at first, but now when I have had it for a couple of days in my MP3 player, it really has stuck. Especially the ending theme, which I now consider one of the best anime themes ever. The music overall has an elevating feel to it that really fit the story.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was awsome. It really made the characters come alive, and every emotion is enhanced greatly by the voice talents.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nYou will not understand all of what is going on, but it is an ambitious and well told story. Lots of loose ends, though. \\n\\n\r\nAIR is very well directed and paced. There are no fillers at all (except for the whole episode 13, which you can ignore) and every second is captivating. I found it impossible not to watch the whole series in a streak.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just a bit sad that they didn't use episode 13 to explain some of the loose ends instead of recapping the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I am fully satisfied with this story. So much, in fact, that I don't think I'll watch neither the movie nor the Summer special. I think AIR TV told the story the way it was supposed to be, and no extras feels necessary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nWhile not looking that great, every single character is likable. In hindsight, though, I don't really get what part some of them played in the story. This means some of them could be cut out to make the series even shorter and more effective. But I'd not like that. I loved all the characters and do not regret getting to know them, even if they didn't contribute that much to the plot.",

The main character is pretty different from the others but since this is a Romance anime the female protagonist is cliched almost to the extreme. She's your typical clumsy girl who's also pretty and very nice, and who will even let a stranger stay in her home. One thing that some ofthe anime industry suffers at is the storyline and characters that they develope.\\n\r\nThe art was reasonable, but I thought that having the females have bigger eyes than the males was pretty old school. The sound was alright, the voice actors weren't bad.\\n\r\nThe characters in this were cliched, except the main character I suppose.\\n\r\nOverall I didn't really like this anime because it was cliched, and I prefer something more creative, but if your still unsure of watching it after reading this then try it for yourself. \\n",

And that's exactly what it is.\r\nThe story follows a girl named Misuzu who decides her summer vacation is going to be special. She's going to make friends, and it's going to be awesome! It doesn't sound very interesting...but there's a whole lot more to Misuzu's goal. We learn about her classmates, a traveller named Yukito, Misuzu's auntie Haruko, and a tragic story of the past. It's all very unique and heart wrenching...I cried all the time when watching AIR, and if you using up boxes of tissues, you will love AIR's story. \r\nLike Clannad and Kanon 2006,AIR's art and animation is gorgeous. The character designs are nice, the colours are vivid and pleasing to the eye, and everything is so nicely drawn. There's a lot of skies and wind blowing...and it's all beautiful. The only problem I had is the supersuper shininess of the eyes and hair, and sometimes the eyes were a bit strange...but it's not a big deal since this shows up in a lot of other anime.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the music and voice acting of AIR are phenomenal. AIR is really emotional...and the sound delivers all the emotion perfectly. Listening to the last few moments of AIR can make me cry, even if I'm not watching the video and I don't even understand Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nI really, really like the characters in AIR. Misuzu is so sweet and innocent, I love her so much that I feel my stomach drop a little thinking when I think of what she's been through. Haruko and Yukito are so lovable, I want the three of them to be together forever. The side characters though...they're just \"okay\" for me. They're actually a bit boring...they had good stories, but they were just the \"calm Ojou\" and \"genki girl\" type. I liked them, but I didn't love them.\\n\\n\r\nI gave a 10 for enjoyment, even though I hated this anime for making me cry so much. But I loved that it made me hate it. Personally, I love tragic stories. I spent hours glued to my screen with tears in my eyes and tissues on hand, but I couldn't stop watching. I started to care for Misuzu and Haruko's happiness that you would've though they were real. AIR is a fantastic anime, and you should really watch it. There's a reason why when you ask for a sad anime, pretty much everyone says \"AIR.\"\\n\\n\\n",

It led me to watch more of these types of anime in hope that I would find anything more like this. \r\nBut this anime is indeed one-of-a-kind.\r\nOverview: Set in three arcs, this anime focuses on Yukito Kunisaki and Mizusu Tohno, an unlikely pair with a relationship that goes back one thousand summers. \r\nYukito is a traveller looking for a certain \"girl in the sky\" he was told about by his desceased mother. He finds himself befriending the clumsy Misuzu along with encountering two other interesting female characters. As the mysterious legend aboutthe \"girl in the sky\" Yukito is searching for unravels, tragedy begins to take place...\\n\\n\r\nStory: This anime is meant for anyone looking for a highly emotional story. It is the perfect length as well. There is not one episode, not one line or moment that is unnecessary. Everything is beautifully planned to create a touching, heart-warming sotry.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character art is somewhat mediocre, but does not take away from the overall quality. The scenic art, however, is STUNNING. The sky, the sea, the peaceful town setting will make you yearn for summer.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is just unbelievebly beautiful. It adds more to the emotion. Listening to the music alone could make a person cry.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Is this enjoyable? For anyone looking for something to sob over, something beautiful, something memorable, this is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, AIR is an engraving experience that should not be missed for a mature fan.",

            "content": "One of the less known visual novels of \"Key Studios\" that was adapted, comes \"Air\"! Now like most \"Key\" productions, you have the tragic story build up, with the supernatural element near the end to conclude the Anime. One of the things \"Key\" really does bad when it comes to their shows, is when they enter the supernatural genre. They have a hard time explaining things to a point of where it does not make sense, not only that. But in this show's case, it really ruined the way they told the story of the main characters.   \r\nThat's where I'd say the showcollapses, it's when it comes to pacing and explanation. Along with telling the story in a more settle understanding way. Now the cast is pretty ordinary, although they were able to give the supporting females a little arc to themselves even in only having 12 actual episodes.  Out of all the \"Key\" works, \"Air\" probably had the worst art and designs for their characters. Which is understandable seeings how it was made in the early 2000's. The scenery however was splendid, and that with the soundtrack, always brought a nice feeling to me. It always made me feel calm and ironically in the sky.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, this was a decent show. It could of flowed better with the story and made the characters a bit more interesting. But yeah, I still enjoyed it, and thought it was somewhat sad to see end. So overall, I'll give \"Air\" a 7.1/10. If you love shows with tragic stories to conclude, you will probably enjoy this.",

            "content": "Gao!\r\nAir is one of three KEY visual novels adapted by Kyoto Animation.  Out of the 3 adaptations, this is the one I remember the least.  Clannad and Kanon 2006 were both exceptionally fantastic series, being emotionally gripping and beautifully told.  So naturally, I had pretty high expectations for Air when I first heard it was made before the two series in question.  Unfortunately, I can't say that Air captured the same feeling I had when watching Clannad and Kanon.  So today, I look at KyoAni's first attempt at an adaptation, Air.  Enjoy.\r\nStory: 4/10.\r\nYukito Kunisaki is out to find theWinged Maiden, a old tale that his mother told him about as a child.  He passes through a small town that he didn't expect to stay in very long, as he meets Misuzu Kaimo.  This mysterious girl invites Yukito to stay with her.  As Yukito continues to stay in this small, quaint little town, he starts to realize something: Could the Winged Maiden be closer than he thought?  The first 10 episodes of the anime are pointless; some sarcastic guy with ridiculous hair helps a girl with their problems, and once their character arc is over, you never see or hear from them again.  This  is Air's biggest problem, character development.  I'll get more in detail about  the characters further down the track, but for now, let's talk about the feels.  The most interesting arc in the show is Mizusu and her mother's story, showing how powerful a mother's love can be.  It was so powerful and moving, I actually had to call my mother to tell her that I love her.  Unfortunately, the anime doesn't focus much on these characters, deciding to focus more on girls we don't give a crap about, an unnecessary flashback arc, and a recap episode at the VERY END.   The flashback arc in particular was a complete mistake.  They could have easily explained these two episodes in about 5 minutes; granted, it would have taken some time to refocus, but they should've done that anyway to give Misuzu and her mother their proper story.  Add this with the incredibly pointless side character arcs that do nothing to develop Yukito's character, and half of the show was nothing but a waste of time.  You could probably skip episodes 2-6 and still understand what's going on.  The biggest problem with Air's story is the fact that it's way too ambitious.  It tries to take on many ideas at once, and ultimately falls flat on it's face.  KyoAni eventually fixed all these problems with Kanon, and perfectly avoided them with Clannad, but that doesn't excuse Air for causing those problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to adapting a visual novel, the one job Air had was to make me care about the characters.  If you don't care about the characters, then you won't care about  what happens to them; whatever happens will go over your head, and you're sitting there thinking: \"Was that supposed to make me cry?\"  You can probably guess by my tone, I didn't care about the majority of Air's cast, save for Misuzu.  Even still, all she does for the first few episodes is fall over, drink peach juice and say \"Gao!\"  Later on in the show, I grow more attached to Misuzu's character, but by that time, the show is near it's end.  I cared about her, but not even close to how much I cared about Nagisa or Ayu from Clannad and Kanon.  Air doesn't devote enough time to the main cast, instead deciding to have the side characters take the spotlight for a majority of the series, and even still, their arcs are very uninteresting.  The anime somehow achieved a middle ground, leaving both the main cast and the side cast extremely underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe biggest praise I can give Air is it's atmosphere.  The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and the art, while it may be dated for some, is still fantastic.  Keep in mind, this anime came out in 2005.  The art and sound alone make this series worth watching.  Character design comes down to personal preference; if you don't like the huge eyes and bushy face, so be it.  The OST keeps a great balance of soothing and spiritual, matching the melancholic atmosphere the show.  Finally, for all you dub watchers out there, Air's dub is actually pretty good.  It's one of the few KyoAni dubs that doesn't want to make me tear my ears out.  Looking at you, first season of Clannad.  Overall, the art and soundtrack is fantastic, and while the anime itself may not have lived up to the beauty of the two, it was a pleasure nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\r\nAir isn't terrible; there's nothing about this anime that will make you think less of KEY's other adaptations, but the anime isn't that good, either.  This series has a lot of potential; it has an interesting story that mostly fails to deliver, characters too unexplored for me to care, and an amazing feel to it that the rest of the anime mostly fails to capture.  It could have easily been as great as it's successors with a few plot tweaks, a change in focus, and more character development.  I feel like Air would have done a lot better if it were longer than 13 episodes.  Air was a drama with missed potential that should have been a lot better than what it could have been, and doesn't hold up compared to it's predecessors.  At the end of the day, Air may make you cry, but you really have to ask yourself: Why are you crying?  Is it because the characters on screen are crying? Or is it something deeper?\\n\\n\r\nAir gets a C-\\n",

            "content": "Ugh.. Air..\r\nAlright two things first  :\r\n1) Air TV could and SHOULD have been a 26+ episode series.\r\n2) Air, had it not suffered from a goddamn awful execution, could have been a nice series  maybe even close to the level of  Ano Hana : The Flower We Saw That Day.\r\nSo, is this worth your time ? Is it enjoyable ?\r\n..Meh..maybe ?\r\nAir TV is a eroge/romance visual novel developed by Key. Responsible for the anime series adaption  is studio Kyoto animation.\r\nAfter having dropped the anime series 4 times throughout the years and driven by how enchanted I am by the music (specifically theopening song) and the whole atmosphere that surrounds the series I decided to stick with it.\\n\\n\r\nStory ---> 6 ( Promising )\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Guys.\\n\r\nWho the f knows what this show is about ? \\n\\n\r\nWhat is the plot, really ?\\n\\n\r\nIs it the romance between Yukito and Misuzu ?\\n\r\nIs it the problems of the surrounding cast and how Yukito helps them out ?\\n\r\nIs it the story of Kanna, a priestess-like winged girl and Ryura, the samurai guard ? \\n\r\nIs it the curse that is placed upon Kanna that causes her to suffer throughout reincarnations ?\\n\r\nIs it Misuzu's relationship with her mother ? \\n\\n\r\nNo really, what is Air about ?\\n\\n\r\nA looot of plot elements were introduced and never developed, a bunch of subplots were never explained. I guess the synopsis though would be something like this :\\n\\n\r\nYukito Kunisaki is a handsome young traveler (had to add handsome cause everyone in this show fits the bishoujo/bishounen archetype which makes them gorgeous) who goes around in towns and throwing puppet shows trying to make money of that.(he fails) He has one goal in mind : to find the winged girl that is in the sky. He meets and befriends Misuzu Kamio, a naive absent minded and quite adorable girl, that soon reveals to him that she has been having weird dreams that feature a winged girl that is in the sky. Misuzu calls this girl '' the other me '' and is greatly affected by whatever is happening to her.\\n\\n\r\nDo you sense supernatural ? Oooh yeaah~\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is interesting and when it's given proper attention it becomes even more interesting. Winged beings that carry the dream of the world, dreams that harm the dreamer, romantic elements and magic.\\n\\n\r\nBut its exactly in developing all those subplots that Air fails. \\n\\n\r\nIt just decides that it wants to achieve a little too much. It wants to develop all themes and ends up fully developing none. The show's ending doesn't answer anything BUT BUT it manages to make you cry. (if you re willing to forget the rest)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters ---> 5\\n\\n\r\nNot a fan of moe, not a fan of series with tons of girls (dont wanna say harem cause Air is technically not a harem yay) , not a fan of cliche stereotypical characters.\\n\\n\r\nBut~\\n\\n\r\nI did find Yukito more interesting than a typical harem lead and I think that's because I clicked with his whole '' travelling performer that fails at being entertaining  '' thing.  He does however try to fix everyone's problems and wow he succeeds. \\n\\n\r\nMisuzu is cute, childish , naive and retarded, like what you'd expect from a moe character. She deals with psychological burden and is sort of a dramatic character. The thing that I did enjoy is how everyone treats her. Nobody is shown close to her, (apart from her mother who thinks her behavior is problematic) no one thinks her moe attitude is charming. She is truly alone and lonely and the series ,I think, succeeds in getting that across. \\n\\n\r\nI also have to admit that I liked the dynamic between the two characters.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else was either boring or brought nothing new to the table.\\n\\n\r\nI firmly believe that if Kano and her sister did not exist no one would have cared. They did not add anything to the overall feeling of the series.\\n\\n\r\nMinagi and Michiru are not great characters but I did enjoy their backstory. I feel it was rushed though and should have developed in more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHaruko is okay, not a bad character and I think the part that focuses on the relationship between Misuzu and her is probably the one that shines most from the whole story. It should have definitely been longer, or been introduced earlier in the series. It does make you emotional but it also manages to make you confused as to why this relationship between the two was not introduced earlier on. It seems important enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt -->7\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say, I liked the art. At times it was gorgeous and other times simplistic af. Yes, the huge eyes become hard to take seriously at times.  It did however fit in the series' setting and atmosphere. Very few complains about that part of the show. I realize some people may find the art not very appealing and I understand it I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound --> 9\\n\r\nI cant even begin to explain how much I love this show's opening theme. It has become an all time favorite. The soundtrack over all is great, compliments the show well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how the show did not end up being a harem show, even though the harem elements are evident, Yukito shows clear preference for Misuzu and quite early on I might add. I also think the last few episodes that focus on Misuzu and Haruko were nicely done and they should have been more of a main focus of the series. Air TV seems to be able to do drama/tragedy right only if it decides that that's what it wants to do. Soundtrack is a huge plus to this series overall enjoyment. The plot elements that Air introduces are not bad , in fact they re quite decent and if developed correctly would have made a beautiful series that fans of the genre would come to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \\n\\n\r\nBad pacing, plot holes, unnecessary characters, not enough screen time, unexpected plot changes derive a lot from this show's enjoyment. I definitely understand people that give Air a lower score than 6 cause quite honestly, the flaws that it has are not easy to forget or forgive.\\n\\n\r\nI must say though that I do not hate this show, in fact I liked some aspects of it such as the setting, the atmosphere and the melancholic/nostalgic/tragic feeling that surrounds it.  I could say this is a guilty pleasure of mine. I might even rewatch it in the future , who knows. \\n\\n\r\nSo, is Air TV worth your time?\\n\\n\r\nYes -> if you like moe, romance, drama, supernatural elements in your romance, simple characters and an overall soothing feeling in your series.\\n\\n\r\nNo -> if you hate any of the above + unexpected plot twists, unexplained stories + endings and if poor execution annoys the hell out of you.\\n\\n\r\n(Im new at reviews! Please do contact me if you wanna discuss the series or give some kind of feedback! )",

Basically, a character named Yukito is traveling, looking for a legend/tale that he heard from his mother. He's passing by a town, making money via his puppet shows, or at least attempting to. He meets a girl named Misuzu, and the story starts to unfold...\r\nArt:\r\nWhen does KyotoAni go wrong in the art area? The fantastical eyes, attention to small details, all of it!!\r\nSound:\r\nThe OST in general was fairly memorable, but not outstanding. The OP was catchy and inviting, butthe I generally skipped the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nUnderstandably, the characters don't really grow or have any character development, the anime being only 13 episodes and all. But for it's length, the characters are interesting, making you want to constantly watch more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed another Kyoto Animation anime, though I watched Clannad + Clannad After Story first and Kanon 2006 first. I highly recommend this anime.",

Although some side characters didn't contribute to the story, and that's why I gave the characters a score of 8. This is a very appropriate anime for all ages. The ending was very sad in my opinion, but we are all different so I don't know how you would feel. It was able to bring insight on how the main character ended up the way they did. While still bringing an unexpected end to the anime eventhough it was one to be expected earlier on in the series. As for the voice actors I have watched this Dubbed, and Subbed in English. Both are good, although I feel that the Japanese voice actors did a better job at portraying the characters. Overall I give this series a 10/10.",

            "content": "If u're a fan of these mini series, what i might write here might not be please you and the fact is that for me, the story plot kinda messed up and the characters are not really that memorable and have a certain personality that distinguished them.\r\nStory : 5/10\r\n- to be honest, i understand the plot of the stories is a bout a girl named Misuzu who happened to be the incarnation of Kanna ( the winged maiden) that had been cursed to somehow have a sad life full of pain and this guy name Yukito who is the descendant of Ryuuya and Uhara waskinda destined to make her happy, ( either by giving her a happy memories or break the curse). But somehow in the end, Yukito decide to leave and only left her a doll that kinda have some sort of power and stuff that will become Misuzu companion since both them can't be close together or both of them will die. The point is that, I'm not sure where this storyline is going, YES we do learned the history about Kanna and how Misuzu is the incarnation that will redo the curse all over again. Not sure what the solution of the anime, and the storyline is pretty much messed up. I started to skip each second on each episode 10 to 12. by far, my favorite episode is 8 to 9, that tells the story about ryuuya,uhara and kanna back then.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 5/10\\n\r\n- the art is moderate, although there is no certain elemnts on each characters that reminds me and have an impact on me. But overall it is nicely done, since it's kyoto animation afterall. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 5/10\\n\r\n- I don't really enjoy the OP and ED .\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 4/10\\n\r\n- the characters have so much slacks. No offence but the main hero and heroine really doesnt have a special personality that attracts me to them except for Ryuuya and Uhara. They have this sparkles in their character that makes me attracted to them. Meanwhile, Kanna and Misuzu are both childlike. If it's Michiru then it's fine since she is still a child but somehow I just had this thing for characters who can't stand up for themselves, it bores me to death since I like independent and strong characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 4/10\\n\r\n- I haven't reach the climax of this anime yet, infact i dont even know which part is the climax. I still need more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 4/10\\n\r\n- I'm not satisfied yet. The fact that saves this anime for me is episodes 8 and 9 itself. It perfectly tells the history behind the curse. But for tohno arc and kano arc is not related at all. It just Misuzu pity them and decide to give them help with the feather, heck i dont even know . Anyway, this is just based on my views, depends and other viewers on how they feel when they watched. This is merely my personal opinion.",

The detail and backgrounds are crisp and create a very unique mood combined with the OST. The overall look of the rural ocean town makes me want to live there. Ifyou're looking for a calm scene to relax with after a long stressful day of classes/work, look no further than the blue ray release of this show. Though a bit dated by 2015 standards, it still is a very relaxing setting.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the characters have very wide faces and are unrealistically thin, but the lighting, vivid colors, and attention to detail in the animation more than make up for this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound track is very open with lots of pads and reverb in the mix, creating a very \"air\"-like open feel. It goes perfectly with the calming scenery and the innocent personality of Misuzu. I really like the opening song and an insert song is played perfectly at the climax of the show. The voice acting includes many veteran VAs and they do a terrific job at bringing out the characters. Daisuke Ono ftw.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAt first, this series seems to go really slowly. There are a lot of moments that seem slice-of-life, with the characters reflecting while the camera pans around some beautiful scenery. It takes time to build but, if one uses the time to reflect on the themes and what is actually happening, it is worth it. There isn't much humor or flirting in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are essentially two interconnected stories in this anime, that of the modern relationship between puppet-player Yukito and a mysterious girl named Misuzu and their ancestor/pre-incarnations one thousand years ago. This is told in three arcs with the second one being of the pre-incarnations. This plot sequence is masterfully done as the watcher slowly makes sense of what occurred in the first arc and comes to realize what will happen at the end. Be prepared for some very emotional moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion is one to remember. It leaves certain questions unanswered and begs the watcher for a second watch. I ended up spending a good two hours after finishing this just thinking about the ending and its implications. Well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters in the modern portion of the series are very likable. The development of Yukito is very well done. He is looking for a \"girl in the sky\" and the ocean town has three girls whom all seem to have something to do with that girl. What will happen as he grows attached to them? I also really liked Misuzu as her innocence and clumsiness combine with her \"gao\" phrase to create a very lovable character.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is a very mysterious yet calming series that is definitely among my favorite animes. It makes one think about reality and what it means to be alive. I've watched this multiple times and still pick up new subtleties and themes. Overall, double thumbs up for Air TV.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is both a laid-back show and a thinker's show. You can sit back and enjoy the perfect harmony between the atmosphere and the BGM, or you can ponder the themes that underlay the show. Either way, assuming that you're not liable to get too comfortable and fall asleep, it will be a fun ride.",

The comedy is a bit weak, and the first girl's problem a bit opaque, but I remain hopeful for the rest. Overall, it's no _Clannad_ of course, but given that it was one of the earlier series, I liked it more than I expected. (And as ever with Maeda, some of the music is fantastic.) As episodes passed, Misuzu remained tolerable and maybe even improved to be quite possibly the singlemost 'real' female character in any Key work I've seen (admittedly, not saying much), and to my considerable surprise, she didn't simply 'get better' or be magically healed. (The ending worked a lot better in _Air_ than _Angel Beats!_, where it had felt like a betrayal of much of the meaning of the disappearing.) I don't think it's *better* than _Clannad_ because the humor never was quite as good, and the side-stories definitely inferior to even Kanon's side-stories, but the main story is easily comparable.",

            "content": "Air is, to say the least, an entertaining anime. This is the first of the Key anime, which includes the likes of Kanon, Angel Beats, and Clannad. While Air is a pretty damn good anime that foretells some of the conventions of future Key series, it\u2019s not as good as any of the newer ones.\r\nKey anime of the romance department typically involve a single guy who is forced into a situation where a bunch of girls with issues need his help. This stems from the fact that Air, Clannad, and Kanon are all based on visual novels, and visual novels have multiple girls you canget with. So the anime\u2019s attempt to tell each girls story while focusing only on a single romantic thread for our main hero. Air is different from its future incarnations as it doesn\u2019t as much focus on that idea of multiple girls needing help solving their mental issues. It has three girls in it, two of which are the focus of maybe four or five episodes total. The others are divided into a really strange feudal Japan segment, a segment with our hero and the heroine, and a another segment between the heroine and her mother. It\u2019s not typical of what will come, and I appreciate that especially.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the \u201cGirl in the Sky\u201d, an angelic figure who has constantly been forced to be in pain through incarnation after incarnation. She is forced to die every time she gets too close to someone and reincarnate again. A man has followed her every reincarnation to attempt to free her of these horrible bonds. His soul is stuck in the body of a crow and he can become a human vagabond in his attempts to free her.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have Yukito, the vagabond, and Mizusu, the girl in the sky. Mizusu has no close friends, no close family, and pretty much lives her life as a lonely klutz. But when she meets Yukito during one lovely summer vacation she may have found her greatest friend and the catalyst for her finally feeling accepted. He moves in with Mizusu and her drunken and rather inappropriate aunt, Haruko, and tries to help Mizusu be freed from her eternal bond. During that time he gets a part time job at the local clinic and helps the owner\u2019s sister as she is being possessed (did I mention Key anime have really weird supernatural plotlines?). He also helps a girl whose sister has been dead for years yet her ghost has been following her around since she died.\\n\\n\r\nThe two arcs with the girls aren\u2019t particularly great. Neither is memorable and both are seriously shadowed by those stories told in Key\u2019s later anime.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the last half the story shifts to feudal Japan where we learn the origin of the angel girl and the man who tries to save her. These episodes aren\u2019t half bad, but really ruin the pace and interject very abruptly. It doesn\u2019t feel right.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc is of mother and daughter. Well, aunt and daughter. Yukito is a crow who is made to watch as Haruko makes amends with Mizusu and claims her as a daughter rather than a niece. This is the best part of the entire anime, a very touching and well executed arc that builds on the character of Haruko and makes her the most likeable character of the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending isn\u2019t the greatest. Now, I\u2019m all for a sad ending, but I felt kind of cheated. I hate when an anime is just a small part of a bigger story and we really don\u2019t see that story concluded. It\u2019s just part of a story, a segment of a whole. And while Air contains a good enough story and characters, I want to see what happens to those characters and how the story plays out. Does the Girl in the Sky ever get freed? I really want to know the answer to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character department is pretty sparse of anything worth mentioning. As I said,  the two girls at the beginning are decent enough characters with decent enough stories, but they really don\u2019t matter in the long term and their characters are not real exciting. This is doubly so for the main characters. Yukito is pretty dull all around. He\u2019s what I like to call a cardboard character. He\u2019s flat as a pancake and doesn\u2019t shine at all. The same can be said of Mizusu. While she displays emotions, she\u2019s a typical cry baby with an issue that needs to be resolved. I wasn\u2019t really a fan of hers.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, I grew to enjoy the character of Haruko. While at first I liked her as the drunken, idiot aunt taking care of her sister\u2019s daughter, as you learn more about how she has had to distance herself from Mizusu, you grow to like her and feel empathetic to her having to stay away from a girl she really does love. As Haruko finally steps into the motherly roll and despises the fact she hadn\u2019t done it sooner, you continue to love her. And as Mizusu loses her memories of her mother (she loses her memory of a person if they grow too close), and is nearly returned to her real family, it\u2019s enough to bring you to tears as she struggles to return to her aunt\u2019s arms, the woman she considers her mother.\\n\\n\r\nFor Haruko\u2019s character alone, the series is worth watching. While the ending, as I said, isn\u2019t at all what I had hoped, nor is the rest of the show too special, the final stretch is good and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can\u2019t give an enthusiastic recommendation as this is only going to appeal to fans of Key or romance in general, but I can say it\u2019s a pretty good anime. The opening is really fantastic, the animation is good, the story is okay, and the characters are okay, but taken as a whole it\u2019s a fun little experience. Not particularly as memorable as later Key anime, but it still contains the heart that you\u2019d expect.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and try and find the Kanon characters that show up in one episode. It\u2019s a pretty cool cameo!",

            "content": "If you've watched a lot of more recent animes, going back in time to watch AIR will most likely be a bit painful.  AIR has some seriously rough edges.\r\nStory(6) - The story is about the strange supernatural events/sickness surrounding these feathers that are shown (briefly) and how they are all related to Misuzu's strange supernatural sickness.  Pretty much all the events with side characters are just distractions from Misuzu's main story which doesn't pick up until the roughly the last third of the show.  The way in which the supernatural sickness/events were executed was just so poor that many viewers will bescratching their heads for the first part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nRoughly half way through the show just when you are wondering what the heck is going on with these strange feathers and the supernatural events surrounding them you are warped back in time and new characters are introduced.   You then get to learn the story behind the strange feathers you saw in the first half.   You learn that the feathers are \"shards\" of a female demigod like being that was cursed by monks on her deathbed.  The feathers from this beings body being cursed and holding some kind of supernatural qualities that end up causing the prior events in the show are now explained (albeit poorly).\\n\\n\r\nFinally the story wraps up with the sick girl Misuzu (who is the partial mortal reincarnation of the cursed god like being, this is why she is sick) finding what she was looking for.  This is where a huge enjoyable amount of character growth for Haruko makes your investment in the show worth all the mediocre parts of the first half of the show.  Haruko decides to become Misuzu's parent by adopting Misuzu from her brother (Misuzu's dad).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters (5) - Mostly mediocre with a few standouts.  The real problem with AIR is the poor characterization, all the girls are just card-board cut-out archetypes with the exception of Haruko who at first seems flat but gets a huge development boost during the second half of the show.  The other exception is Yukito who does a pretty good job when the other voice actors for the females give cringe worthy performances but is mostly there as a Deus Ex machina to shape events of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between Haruko and Misuzu during the last portion of the show is ultimately what saves AIR from drowning in plot holes and the poor performances from the female cast during the first half of the show.  Yukito also gets a mention for making the first half of AIR bearable to watch with the poor to mediocre/average performances for most other female characters besides Haruko.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7) - The art is mostly fine for the time it was made, no real annoyances.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6) - The sound is where things fall down a bit it's mostly in the poor voice acting and not really the music, there is just some really bad performances phoned in for the characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment factor (7) - While air has huge problems and gaping plotholes and lots of bad writing there is enough redeeming features in the second half of the show to make you not regret watching this.\\n\\n",

Air is just one of their many classics.\r\nI admit, I have only recently watched Air after seeing the works of Kanon and Clannad (which are both absolutely fantastic btw). Air will make you think; not only about the plot or characters, but about your own life as well. So many themes in this anime are applicable to modern society.\r\nAir provides insight deeper than a typical anime. After watching, I can almost guarantee a change in perspective upon certain things. The anime is addressed in about 3 arcs, but there are overlapping sections as wellas revisited ones. Each character explores a different side of human nature, and though it may seem innocent to start, the darker side starts reveal itself as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few parts in which you may grit your teeth. Not in a bad way necessarily, but with so many conflicting feelings and ideas of story, it makes you decide in what you believe in/wish to happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHopefully I haven't given away too much, but for any fans of Clannad or Kanon, then Air is definitely right for you. It shares similar traits from other Key works, and can be understood easily on the emotional and conceptual level.",

It contains a broad view and excludes any possible spoilers.\r\nWell lets start out with I don't like this show, I am writing this because I am bored but I am righting a fair review not a hate review for people who want to watch Air. \r\nstory 6\r\nThe story for air was decent, there wasn't anything particularly bad about it and I probably would have given story an 8 if it wasn't for one major plot hole. Well its not a plot whole per say but something very strangehappens near the end of the series that may cause you to want to put a bullet in your brain. I don't want to spoil it for you but I am just warning you its there, and for me it completely killed the show. But enough about that, the story is about a man named Yukito who is essentially a homeless person who uses magic to preform puppet shows on the streets, but it doesn't sell very well. One day he meets an awkward girl named misuzu who is till in school. So Yukito lives with misuzu and there are some side plots about some other girls with sad stories (like clannad). But the main plot is that misuzu is cursed and Yukito basically tries to break the curse and it is a pretty touching story. (the show explains more i don't want to spoil it :P)\\n\\n\r\nart and sound 7\\n\\n\r\nwhats there to say its pretty average if you ask me, it isn't particularly amazing but by no means bad.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 5\\n\\n\r\nI gave characters five because this is only a thirteen episode anime and it has like two subplots. There was just simply not enough time for characters to develop, save a couple near the end of the show. So mediocre for characters seemed fitting there wasn't anything particularly amazing about a single character.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 6\\n\\n\r\nwell it was enjoying, at parts. The first two subplots seemed pretty dull and if you can get past those and the plot hole near the end (god I hate that) then you might get a kick out of this show. I particularly like the part when it flashes back to fuedal japan and shows the life of Yukito's ancestors.\\n\\n\r\noverall 6\\n\\n\r\nit was a fair show. If your looking for something short just to kill time I'd recomend this, but only if your into the whole sad story anime types. I ussually dont watch animes like this so on MAL i think i gave it a 4 or 5 but if you are a fan of this kind of genre then by all means go for it, you will probably like it. \\n",

The main character meets lots of people throughout his time in a small quiet seaside town. There he does his act with a doll that he controls and makes money off of it. He eventually meets Misuzu who invites him into her house so he can have a place to sleep. He of course stays throughout the series and this is where the story begins to pick up with the winged maiden. Misuzu becomes sicker and sicker with no cure and no way ofever living through it. Eventually she ends up dying and this is the absolute saddest anime I have ever seen. If you don't cry at the end of it then you are definitely not human. The ending i would have to say gets a little confusing but still not enough that I would only give it a nine. It is still a very engaging story and would suggest it if you are into anime like kanon 2006.",

So far the story has me a little interested but nothing spectacular. The art kinda annoys me because this is one of those animes where the girls have there mouths up to high on there faces, but besides that its ok. One thing so far iv seen in the anime iv liked the most is the Characters, there personalities are some thing iv seen before, however, They are the personalities i love. As for the Enjoyment, id have to give it a thumbs up sofar as its not bland what so ever and acually makes me chuckle. Lets just see if my review will be the same when im done.",

            "content": "To be perfectly honest, Air was an impulse purchase for me. I wanted to try out a new anime and essentially bought this because it was only $15. It looked interesting though, at least from what you can get from the back of the box. I took it home, tossed it aside for later, and realized recently that it had been sitting in my anime pile for a few months now. I remembered it because I has picked up Kanon recently, (which I will be watching soon), and was told it was made by the same people who had made Air. So I decided thatbefore I watch Kanon, I would watch Air since it was only 12 episodes. I\u2019m glad I did.\\n\r\nAir is essentially a show about growth. Growth of feelings, growth of courage, but more fully, growth of character. Each and every character in this anime goes through different trials, and comes away a better person because of it. We have the main character, Yukito who was always something of a loner, until the kind and rambunctious Misuzu comes into his life. She merely wants to be his friend, but Yukito has no desire to be involved with her. She takes him into her home, with her rowdy mother, and their relationship grows from there. Then there\u2019s Kano, a school-mate of Misuzu, with her own mysterious past, followed by Misagi, who\u2019s family is malfunctioning. Of course we have the ever annoying little brat, Michiru, whom whenever she spoke I wanted to mute the TV, but even she had my sympathies when her story gets told. You see, each resident of this small town has a story, and you find out all of them throughout the series. My favorite has to do with Misuzu\u2019s mother. It\u2019s a touching story, and it even managed to make me shed a tear. Very few anime\u2019s, much less media in general, cause me to do this, so I give high accolades to ones that can. \\n\r\nOf course, no anime is without its problems. As mentioned above, a couple of characters kind of annoyed me. Misuzu\u2019s voice is rather high, and to hear it often was problematic. It\u2019s common in anime to have a high-voiced girl, but it tends to bother me. Then there\u2019s Michiru\u2026. Oh god there\u2019s Michiru. She was the loudest, most irritating character by far. I was glad she wasn\u2019t a prevalent character. \\n\r\nAlso, this is only a minor gripe, but the sound seemed to be a little quiet, as I had to keep the volume turned up higher than I normally have it. Not a real problem, but worth mentioning. I also was not a huge fan of the two episodes that basically travel back in time. Sure it fleshes out the story more, but it seemed out of place in an otherwise standout anime. \\n\r\nBesides these, the show was fantastic, and a worthy addition to any collection. I\u2019m glad I took a chance on this anime, and look forward to their other works. I highly recommend this anime.\\n",

            "content": "AIR is different to what I expected. As beautiful as it is technically, it's story is more on the character-development slice-of-life drama than story orientated. For this reason, it is quite slow and loses some points in the entertainment department, at least until episode 7. Recommended to those who like drama anime.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nNo flaws here. Shiny, nicely colored, fluid, movement... detailed backgrounds. This show has it all. I can only imagine how gorgeous it must look on a big screen on DVD. The character designs all have big eyes, which may not appeal to some, but I found it very cute. The only downside is Ithought the main characters mother was her sister initially. \\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are nice, the opening being the best 9/10. \\n\r\nThe background sound is mediocre, sometimes even terrible if you take out the opening theme they repeat a couple of times. It is much like Elfen Lied in this respect. Some of it sounded like cheesy elevator/advertising music. For a drama series I expected better. If only Yuki Kajuira composed the music!!!\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nVery interesting story here. It is cute, original with a very childlike premise. There are confusing twists and turns, that many don't like. They make you speculate and think though, which is a plus in my books. It certainly has more detail than you would expect from Episode 1, and many anime don't expand beyond that, so bonus points. \\n\\n\r\nIt mixes drama, fantasy and romance together. It is a very cool combination, with a bit of everything for people to enjoy. A similar theme to Full Moon Wo Sagashite is present throughout: live life to the fullest, and cherish the ones you love. It is very touching :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nGreatly developed and altogether relatable and likable. All of them have their little stories to tell, quirks (spoilers!!! Dinosaurs seemed like a symbol for Mizusu's soul being very ancient and long lived) and are nicely drawn. I love Yukito and Mizusu, they are very adorable together. \\n\\n\r\nThe useless characters were the ones at the start of the anime who just disappeared around episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this anime at a drop of a hat. It certainly isn't for everyone. \\n\r\nI would recommend this anime if you are looking for a more character orientated, sweet, \"realistic\", \"slice of life\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nI'd watch this over Fruits Basket any day.",

            "content": "AIR: Some plot points are not established well, so the story becomes somewhat confusing.\r\n     Like any generic visual novel adaptation, the story follows the formulaic approach of having a male protagonist surrounded by female characters -- characters that he would be helping from a particular problem. This has been exploited in the first half of the series, where he has been involved with the problematic lives of Kano Kirishima and Minagi Tohno. I must admit that these story arcs have been able to trigger some emotional reactions. However, they are not that outstanding, for the unfolding of events is mediocre atbest. The pacing is really slow that it comes to the point that almost literally nothing is happening to move the story to the right direction. There are too many random ordeals that don\u2019t contribute to the overall story. It\u2019s a good thing that the emotional sequences make up for this trait. The other good thing about these arcs is the fact that Minagi Tohno\u2019s story arc doesn\u2019t start abruptly. It has been established during Kano Kirishima\u2019s story arc, so the transition has been smooth.\\n\\n\r\n     This smooth storytelling doesn\u2019t last long, however. In the second half of the series, the story takes an awkward turn. It suddenly diverts its attention to a medieval sequence that stretches for about two or three episodes. Sure, this is a significant part of the series, for it explains the back-story behind \u2018the girl in the sky\u2019. But I can\u2019t help to see it as problematic because it starts too abruptly. Aside from that, it has also failed on effectively linking itself to the original story, but its attempts to do so is evident. This fact has turned the storytelling very rough and the plot very disorganized.\\n\\n\r\n     After the medieval sequence, the story goes back to the modern day, as abruptly as how it diverts its attention from it. Like the first half of the series, this has been able to trigger subtle emotions. In fact, it has been more effective on doing so. However, it is far from perfect, and the major contributor to this is its failure to establish some plot points. Some plot points are so not established that they make the unfolding of events very confusing. In truth, the idea of \u2018the girl in the sky\u2019, the very idea that the whole story is paying homage to, is the most confusing plot point. Again, the medieval sequence is to be blamed for this.\\n\\n\r\n     As for the characters of the series, they\u2019re not very deep, but not bad either. The only problem I have with them is that some of them don\u2019t have proper closure. They just disappear as if they didn\u2019t even exist. In short, the characterization of this series is not very remarkable. However, the opening theme is not the same case. I don\u2019t always include opening themes in my reviews, but Air\u2019s is worth noting. Even though the video is of generic visual novel adaptation, its music is still so commendable that it is enough to make the opening theme worth praising.\\n\\n\r\n     Overall, Air has some serious potential. The concepts it represents are very interesting, and the only problem is their execution. Perhaps if the series has been longer, it would have had the time to properly express its ideas. It\u2019s just too bad that the series is so short that even some of the characters are left out just to make room for the major chunk of the overall story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor more anime reviews, character analyses, and first impressions, visit pageprophet.blogspot.com.",

            "content": "Air is a series regarding which I have some mixed feelings - mostly positive.\r\nIf nothing else, this surely is one of its own kind. Rather simply, it begins to establish the characters personalities, through their interactions, specially with the main character. There is some slightly odd feeling regarding these at first, although they are all quite 'likeable', they are also exotic and unusual somehow. \r\nThe background of three characters shall be dealt with, one by one. Basically, the concept of this series is to reveal that behind the seemingly vulgar town and its vulgar girls, there are many things to be exposed. It chooses todo it through unexpected slices of fantasy, showing how tradition and curses somehow influence or are related to their problems in the present. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the strength but also the weakness of this series could lie in the way such parallels are established. Whilst some viewers might feel discouraged by the unexpected plot resolutions, and find its fantasy touch a bit \"off\", such intersection of fantasy and psichology, of old and modern ages is arguably well executed. \\n\\n\r\nBut I will say this: even if you find yourself in total disbelief for this series, watch it to the end. You will change your mind. Air's two first subplots are but a teaser to where it truly stands out: the second half of the Anime deals with a third girl - Misuzu. In it, Air truly delivers with excellency a superb drama, that is as emotionally packed as few are, with some of the most heartfelt takes ever done in anime,  at Elfen Lied level (without the gore or brutality).\\n\\n\r\nIf the first half were as good, Air would earn a perfect 10. As it isnt', it earns a 9.\\n",

            "content": "Air, it was kind of sad and enchanting....\r\nStory - 7/10 It's about some guy who has these \"powers\" to control this puppet without using strings or anything.  And then there's the chick with the wing stuff.....  I don't get it.  It's confusing, I feel like they're trying too hard to make it romantic and elegant.  They could have gone more into the story about the girl and the wings, and ... it's just plain confusing.  I'm not going to list too much of the confusing parts or I'll spoil it, so let's just keep it at that.  \r\nArt -8/10  Ah... Key art, beautiful and nicely shaded, but the bug eyes...  Didn't bother me too much since I watched Clannad, so it's alright!  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10  I really love the opening, the soundtracks, they're really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10  I liked the mom lol.  But the other character's personalities were boring.  The making dinosaur noises were probably added to make people think it's cute.  Plus, I see a Mary Stu in there.  Out of all the people in this world, this story chooses to be about a \"special\" girl with wings, and her personality is pretty Mary Stu-ish.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10  I was confused, I don't remember anything funny scenes, sad scenes were pretty sad, but I postponed it a few times because it bored me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10  A okay-ish/kinda good anime.  It was unique... I guess...  People who say \"This is the best anime ever!  Saddest anime!\" etc... are gonna hate this review lol xD  But I' just stating my opinion.",

            "content": "I watched this because I pretty much fell in love with Clannad, and when you go from Clannad to a story such as this one, it's really hard to make a review without any bias opinions.\r\nStory - 5. I called the story mediocre because in my opinion, it was two different stories going at once, maybe Air attempted to put a connection between the two stories, but I certainly didn't see it. Plus, the story was really simple, and I think that the author looped the story because he/she lacked the ability to continue it.\r\nArt - 10. Outstanding, I can never find anything wrong withthe fluency or beauty of the animations these people do for any of their shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10. The creators of Air, Kanon, and Clannad, have always made amazing soundtracks which touch me everytime I play or hear them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9. Great depth on characters, but... what's it gotta do with the story?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6. Like I said, it's hard for romances to live up to Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8. The average is pretty good, so I'd recommend it if you're into the romantic nobility type of stuff, but if you're looking at this anime because someone told you the same makers made Clannad, you can sleep well without watching this show.",

I don't want to spoil anything bu the ending of this anime really makes you feel dreadful- terrible and too sad. I wasn't too fond of ANY of the characters, the story was bland and a tad bit confusing. the art was beautiful as all their work is! That's all I have to say about this one really. I would recommend the sub if you really wanted to watch it. I love Vic Micnogna but his voice in this one wasvery unfitting for the main character. I would not suggest this anime for anyone since I did not enjoy it at all really. That is purely my opinion.",

The Fudal Story Arc was, however, interesting and redeemed this anime a little but not enough to sit through the whole thing. If you ask me, skip to that, ignore the artwork (unless you like that style), and be satisfied because that's the best you're going to get out of it.",

It all starts with a traveling puppeteer who is down on his luck. He is search for the \"winged girl\" that his mother searched for. He befriends an odd girl who has no friends. Could she be the fabled girl? The story is composed of three arcs(chapters). The first is the story from the puppeteers view. This was the best of the three arcs. The second was set in the distant past. This one was pretty good.Finally, the last arc is told from the view of a crow. This was my least favorite arc. Overall pretty good.",
