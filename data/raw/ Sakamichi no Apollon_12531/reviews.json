            "content": "Let's do a trivia here! Are you someone who wants to know what it is like back in the 1960's? Ever wanted to build an escapism from the harsh reality of today's world? Want to just sit back and enjoy some old school music after a stressful day? Well, perhaps you've found a series worthy to invest your time into because Kids on the Slope is there and sure to give you something to think about.\r\nKids on the Slope (also known as Sakamichi no Apollon) is a story taking place in the beginning of summer, 1966. It stars the protagonist Kaoru Nishimi, an honor studentwho tends to keep to himself. He has a rather reserved personality and hard to open up. That is until he meets the bad boy and future best friend Sentaro Kawabuchi. While mistakenly getting to a bad start, these two soon develop an unforgettable friendship based on respect, forgiveness, and of course, music. Later comes into picture is Ritsuko Mukae, a friendly girl who plays intriguing roles in the story ranging from music, friendship, and later love. The series follows three friends as they create unforgettable memories of the 1960s in the age of jazz music, friendship, and melody.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you're probably asking yourself \u201cwhy should I watch this series?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWell, first of all this series contains the unification of icons Watanabe Shinichi (Series Director of Cowboy Bebop) and music composer Yoko Kanno. That alone can be seen as a good reason to start watching. While labeled as a coming-of-age drama, this series also contains a bit of the romance theme and of course, drama. So for those interested into the intertwined story arcs mixed in with misunderstandings, jazz critique, and love trials, then this could be a little added bonus. \\n\\n\r\n[ - Story - ]\\n\r\nKids on the Slope details friendship and is one of the most important element of the series and should not be just seen as an aspect of the anime but in real life as well. Kaoru, Sentaro, Ritsuko forge friendship through one common passion: the love of music and the bond that they share.\\n\\n\r\nThis series does not have a strong impression at first. From the first episode, there's not much to say besides the typical high school drama and music setting. Furthermore, for those carving for action and psychological twists or for some who call it \u201cmindfucks\u201d, then this is the wrong series to look into. Thankfully, there's an old saying that goes \u201cnever judge a book by its cover\u201d. Damn right, you shouldn't because this coming-of-age drama is sure to give you a surprising twist.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, there is the common theme. Kaoru falls for the friendly girl, Sentaro falls for the graceful girl, and Ritsuko is already in love with the childhood bad boy. Then comes even more characters that makes the already complicated geometric love shape even more complicated later on. \\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope moves at a relative pace that can be considered neither slow or fast. Ironically, it starts off slow even though it's kids on the SLOPE. Anything that flows down a slope relatively moves fast but in this case retains a relatively average pace. So I'll say this again, this series is not for the fans who carves the fast paced action and psychological twists. If you want that, try Jormungand or something.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Characters ]\\n\r\nWhile the characters are animated plainly and simple, their inner character and style is what drives this series as why it's ranked into the #100 of MAL. Beyond the romance polygon are characters that balances out the series.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Kaoru, the middleman who has the reserved personality. He is smart, he is reserved, and he has the talents to become a real star. Thankfully with some fate, he finds someone who also share a similar love for the age of music. That brings us to Sentaro. Like the opposite of ying and yang, Sentaro is seen as the tough guy with the soft spot, the one that picks fights but also the guy who protects and values his friendship with the other characters from the bottom of his heart. His outer image covers up the fact that he is a deep down guy and cares for the people and things he truly loves; his friends, his family, and the children that respects him so much and of course, music. Finally, there's Ritsuko. She is the cheerful girl, the one that builds bridges of friendship with friends and generally well-liked. Yet behind her outer image lies a somewhat insecure girl and sometimes jealous of others' ability to be so outright themselves. \\n\\n\r\nLater on of course, there are other characters that enter the scene that have stark personalities and also not who they appear to be. I'd love to go on and on about these characters but this isn't an summary is, it? This is a review so I'll leave you to find out. But trust me, you'll love to get to know them once you see the realism behind their outer characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of realism, it is noticeable that the characters' personal lives are conveyed in a way that can be seen and defined as quite real. Whether tragic, sad, or cheerful, we see the histories of the main characters that can be related to most of us. They all have background histories that brings the overall realism into the 1960's and even towards today.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Animation/Art -]\\n\r\nIf there's one thing to forget, it might be the art. I'll say this in the most honest way as possible: \\n\\n\r\nIt is too plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not rich and series airing this Spring Season like Fate/Zero puts it to shame in the art department. The animation however brings out a powerful feeling of nature and refines the 1960s style in its finest form. While plain and simple (Karou's glasses, Sentaro's shirt, etc), we can see that the culture it tries to convey of the 1960s is successful. Culture has indeed changed  from the past to present day as we can clearly see the lesser technology and more general and sophisticated themes. It is simple and not detailed just like how high school should be. It doesn't need to be something special that makes us go \u201cwow!\u201d After all, the precise of an entire series is not always judged by art solely. At one point of watching over 100 series, it's just down right common sense.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Sound/Music - ]\\n\r\nAh yes, this is the main event, if for any reason to watch this series at all, it is this.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and life plays a key role in this series and thus, one could expect the melancholy and drama the music lyrics conveys and delivers. With the ultra talented Yoko Kanno in charge, one can expect a blockbuster hit and smash of the season. And she does not disappoint, neither her skills or the characters' that plays both artistically and beautifully in the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the music in the series plays well, even in rhythm with the main characters. If you take careful notice, the way and style they play their instruments systemically match their art and moments. The way the characters play the music is natural and in the ways they are of themselves, not for a popularity contest. To play music and bring pleasure to the ears is something to respect and take notice of. These kids really do have talent.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Enjoyment - ]\\n\r\nThis story is of the old school coming-of-age style so the pleasure of enjoying this series can vary. At first glance, one might decide to drop or put on-hold at its relative pace as well as its lack of the typical \u201cshounen action\u201d. But with so many of those airing these days (including this season), why not give something new a try? \\n\\n\r\nIt's more than just a high school story of kids falling in painful geometric shapes of love or the \u201cfriendship conquers all\u201d. And of course, despite being hard to make it into the mainstream, it's one of those series that takes an unique and cultural approach of the coming-of-age genre mixing in with jazz music, friendship, and love all in a wonderful little package. The characters are unique and real with their backgrounds, contrasting personalities, and style. The story is easy to follow despite its intertwined arcs. The art (despite plain and simple) brings out the naturalism and culture of the 1960s. It's something not as complicated as the real world we face today because it's so damn right simple. Honestly, I miss it. And who can forget the relaxing music? Without it, this series would be dead. But with it, the series comes to life through realism and gives viewers something to talk about. \\n\\n\r\nAgain for those who are so into the shounen style battles, the fan-service of ecchi shows, or psychological mindfucks, this series can be something new to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all, there's an old saying that goes, \u201clife is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\" And once you open that box, you'll be surprised what you'll find. In this case, it's Kids on the Slope.",

            "content": "I love jazz. Some of my favorite memories of my time living in Florida have to be going downtown to listen to the local jazz festival. Sitting in front of that gazebo and getting into the spirit of the musicians is something you can only experience if you listen to jazz. It\u2019s so different from any other musical genre and I was excited as hell to get to watch an anime centered around this amazing style of music.\r\nThe problem is Sakamichi no Apollon isn\u2019t as much about jazz as it is about lame characters. There\u2019s jazz in the series, and it definitely plays a part,but it doesn\u2019t play as large a part as I wish it would. This seems to be the theme of music-based anime, not paying attention to the music as much as the boring lives of the characters. Jazz is frantic, it changes with the mood. There are a lot of things about jazz that could have been played out in Sakamichi no Apollon that aren\u2019t. That heart and soul of jazz are only seen during the portions where the characters play music. Other than that, the series falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru is a guy. He goes to high school. He\u2019s a bookworm.\\n\\n\r\nSentarou is a guy. He goes to high school. He fights a lot.\\n\\n\r\nRitsuko is a girl. She goes to high school. I can\u2019t discern her character besides \u201clove interest\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nTogether they are the three main characters of our little drama. Kaoru goes to high school as the new kid. He meets Sentarou who is a pretty violent guy who skips classes (the delinquent). Sentarou is a drummer who plays jazz with Ritsuko\u2019s father and a guy named Jun. Kaoru, who can play the piano, joins in on the fun and learns how to evolve from his classical roots into the realm of jazz.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, some bumps on the road. A couple of love triangles (those are the main plague that infest this anime), Sentarou\u2019s problems with his father, and Jun\u2019s becoming a good-for-nothing. The plot is really not that exciting. You\u2019re watching this for the music more than likely, not the duo of love triangles that seem to give way to more of a bromance at the end than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the plot becomes especially painful. The series plot is loose, and by that I mean nothing is consequential or matters. It\u2019s there to hold the series together and give it a reason for being, but it\u2019s mediocre at best. By the end, nothing really matters and the series goes back to square one.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBUT RATCHET! WHAT ABOUT THE MUSIC?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhat music? There\u2019s a little bit of music going around, but for a music based anime there\u2019s not enough. As I said in the beginning of the review, there\u2019s not a lot of music going on. There are a few songs here and there, but not enough to warrant being considered as \u201cmusically focused\u201d. It\u2019s more just a school life anime than anything else and suffers because of the fact it tries to be something it is not.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBUT AT LEAST IS HAS GOOD CHARACTERS!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were generic at best. While Sentarou was a decent character, I grew to hate Kaoru more and more as the series progressed. It reached the pinnacle when he nearly raped Ritsuko. Ritsuko wasn\u2019t a bad character, but she didn\u2019t actually have a lot of character there. She was just there as a love interest and a plot point more so than anything. Jun was okay, but he also had some issues that made him dislikable. His girlfriend, Yurika, was okay.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t really impressed by anything that concerned the plot. I was impressed with some of the music (the little that there was) and the animation was especially good during jam sessions and concerts, unbelievably so.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m unable to say too much about Sakamichi no Apollon because it\u2019s so average. It\u2019s the definition of average. Good music and good animation, mediocre characters and plot, and an overall disappointment. If the series had been longer I feel that perhaps the plot and characters would have been more entertaining. But as it is, Sakamichi no Apollon is merely adequate. The last episode feels especially rushed and I assumed I was meant to feel emotions of some sort, but was left not really caring. And when, by the end, I could care less what happens, then I know that I\u2019m not watching anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is a hesitant pass for me. It\u2019s overhyped, and that hype is probably why you decided to jump on the bandwagon and check this anime out.  There are some qualities that are enjoyable, but taken as a whole, it\u2019s merely adequate in satiating the thirst for jazz, as well as the search for a good music anime.",

            "content": "Okay, the first episode of this wonderful show with tons of potential popped up about an hour ago, and I just had to write a review. (This is my first so cut me some slack, pl0x.)\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that I have been anticipating the airing of this show for a while now, and so far, it has surpassed my expectations. The story begins with our main dude Kaoru who apparently moves around a lot due to his father's job, but I won't get too into that to avoid any accidental spoilers. Instead, let me fill the gaps what you can beexpecting.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the get-go, it goes straight to the opening sequence showing off some of the most vibrant and fluid visuals I have seen to date. The characters are very well drawn, the scenery is just beautiful. and everything just gives off this overall \"jazzy\" atmosphere. When I was around 10 minutes in, I nearly forgot this was part of a show because it was just so polished, I'd expect that sort of quality in a decently budgeted movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe other MAJOR thing this series excels in is the sound. From the voices of the characters to the random chatter, it really immerses you into the environment of that time. If you're looking for some time to kill, hell, even if you have barely any time at all, I suggest you take a peak at this creation, and restore your hope in anime.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is a school drama from 2012. The original manga was written by Kodama Yuki. The anime version was brought to us by MAPPA & Tezuka, neither of which I've seen a lot from. I don't know what to expect from this one at all. So, let's just get right into it. \r\nStory:\r\nOur focus is on Nishimi Kaoru, a bright young student who plays the piano and moves a lot. He's also a complete drama queen, but we'll talk about that later. Nishimi suffers from social anxiety issues and feels the need to get some air on the roof after things take aslightly unanticipated turn. Fortunately for him, he's able to overcome that within about five minutes of meeting Kawabuchi Sentarou. Aren't we all glad that plot point was there? I mean, it contributed so much to the narrative. He and Sentarou wind up becoming friends and playing jazz together while filling the time between sessions with melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nTherein lies the massive underlying problem with the series. Everything has to be overly melodramatic. Dude falls in love after knowing a girl for all of two minutes? Better act like this is super serious and dramatic. Someone gets rejected? Total drama. Sentarou might play... rock music with a band made up of their class mates? This is clearly the most important disaster in history. Don't even pretend that worse things have happened. Although, in all fairness, the series actually acknowledges that that one is childish. To exacerbate things, however, the vast majority of these \u201chyper, ultra dramatic situations\u201d get resolved, at least to a satisfactory degree, in the next episode. Probably would've worked better with fewer sources of drama that were ongoing. \\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, teenagers can be overly dramatic about stupid things but watching teenagers be overly dramatic about stupid things is really annoying. Especially when the narrative treats it like it's super serious. This shite isn't serious, it's dumb teenagers being drama queens. So, when two things that are actually serious happen in the last couple episodes they just don't have much weight. Especially when one, an injury, gets resolved in less than five minutes. The romance is honestly where it's at its worst. We start with a ridiculous situation where one dude likes a girl, she likes another guy, he likes a different girl and she likes this other guy. From there, we get a lot of overblown angst and aggravation because we can't pummel these wankers. \\n\\n\r\nThe only good parts of the series are the jazz jam sessions where the characters are just enjoying themselves for once. Unfortunately, these scenes are vastly outweighed by the scenes where drama is happening over something that really doesn't matter. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are reminiscent of the worst people you knew in secondary school. You know the ones. They treat everything that's remotely upsetting to them as an unmitigated disaster. Then they get mad at you because you openly don't care and won't even remotely validate them. Kaoru is the worst about it, putting distance between himself and his friends on multiple occasions but always for petty reasons. Kodama, you do know that introverts don't have those kinds of rifts just because we're socially awkward and need to limit our time around people, right? Usually we just excuse ourselves from an event or don't go out for a while when we need time alone. And, trust me on this one, your friends will understand if you just tell them \u201cHey, I need some time alone. Can you try calling back tomorrow?\u201d Yes, even in High school. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is one positive the series has going for it. The backgrounds are well detailed and look quite nice. The characters are drawn well. The animation is nice and smooth. So, I'll give them full credit on that one. They may not have produced something with a compelling narrative or tolerable characters but they made what they had look pretty. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is passable enough. Our main cast is made up of Hosoya Yoshimasa (Reiner Braun), Kimura Ryouhei (Sorey) & Nanri Yuuka (Takakura Erika). Their performances here are perfectly fine. The music is pretty good, mostly. I won't pretend that I cared for the theme tune and its whiny sounding singing but the jazz is good.  Kanno Yoko's soundtrack in general works nicely. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little bit. Kaouru goes off on a tangent about how handsome Sentarou is at one point. And Sentarou calls him an angel at another. Bad dialogue writing or unexplored sexual tension, you make the call. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the basics, the artwork, music and acting, Sakamichi no Apollon does just fine for itself. Unfortunately, it doesn't do so well in terms of the main content. The characters are overly melodramatic to the point of being quite obnoxious a lot of the time. The narrative is a lot of annoying, all too easily resolved melodrama with the occasional good jazz session thrown in. All factors considered, it's kind of a bad series. Although you might enjoy it if you like that High school melodrama. For myself, I lost all patience for that while I was still in High school and watching this was, more often than not, an irritation. So, for myself, I give it a 3/10. Next week I'll look at Wizardry.",

            "content": "First of all, I must say it's been a while since I've enjoyed a series as much as I enjoyed Sakamichi no Apollon.\r\nThe story itself has an amazing pace, and in my opinion, has the perfect combination of romance, drama and music. The developments feel very natural and there are no fillers. The only \"complain\" I can have from the story is that the ending might feel a little unsatisfying. Luckily, if you end up feeling unsatisfied like me, you can read the extra volume from the manga and I can assure you that you'll feel a lot better after reading it.\r\nThe art is okay,I guess. It has a very realistic vibe, and fits the story really well. I didn't see any error in the animation either, which is always appreciated. Also, the animation during the musical scenes was particularly good. The soundtrack fits every scene perfectly, so kudos to the studio. It is always nice to have consistently good animation as well as a good soundtrack throughout a whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main characters in the series, and they are best friends even though they make an odd couple. I feel that the two main characters are really well developed. You can see how the two of them grow up as characters as the story moves on. On the other hand, except for one specific character, most secondary characters don't get a proper development. I mention this because there are a couple of secondary characters that I'm sure most viewers would've loved for them to have more screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThe series in general is very enjoyable. If you're into jazz music (or good music in general), you're definitely gonna love watching this series. Also, this is one of the few anime where the English singing is actually pretty good. I had a really good time listening to every single music piece played, as well as with the tons of drama generated from the different love situations that develop.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the series an 8/10. I loved it, but I felt there were some things that could've been told better, especially the ending. I recommend this series a 100%. Actually, I'd say this is a must watch series. Also, don't forget to read the extra volume from the manga once you finish the series. \\n\\n\r\nHave a great time watching Sakamichi no Apollon!",

Got tired of all that shounen crap some time ago.\r\nWell, what can I say, there is a certain beauty about this anime.\r\nThe story: Certainly the cliched motifs of love triangles and rectangles and all the overused dynamics are in there BUT I was shocked to find that I actually enjoyed everything quite well.\r\nFor one, the relationships have much verisimilitude and show a more inexplicable human aspect rather than the KISS THAT SOLVES IT ALL type stuff. The thing with Sentaro, Yurika, and Jun-ni is definitely a BIG PLUS to the RitsukoNishimi main plot. It's not just a side dish romance to make sure everyone's got their love life covered. It's a deep human experience full of inexplicable emotions and time that is needed for love to blossom. \\n\\n\r\n(Ahhh.... I'm sounding like a josei fan now. Ok maybe I am becoming one.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Ehhh Nishimi was one of those new student stereotypes played out in many other animes but he's still good. The true striker with this anime is that the character's backgrounds are revealed in a very subtle way... It's not full of lengthy flashbacks and background story time-wasters... Sakamichi really does well in that it delves into each character's past and background as the anime progresses in a not in your face manner. The inexplicable actions of Ritsuko, the Yurika Jun-ni sub-plot ahhh it's beautiful. Apart from the jazz of Ritsuko's basement, there is a quiet beauty that speaks to the heart in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: This is one anime where music speaks louder than words a lot of times. Jazz is such a freeform expression and I'm not a big fan of it but it is done so well. It's Nishimi's language of love, remorse, each clash on the cymbal is Sentaro's inner pain and struggles released. Jun-ni's trumpet arpeggios are too good. Not to mention Mukae san's upbeat bass.\\n\\n\r\nVoice: It's solid and good work. Ritsuko's voice can get annoying but it has it's charm  But the music overshadows it IMO.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You'll be surprised. I'm a guy and I connected from the first episode. It's strangely good. I don't know exactly how to explain it. But aside from the jazzy improvisations and sounds there is a quiet beauty to this anime. go watch it now.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who hasn't good much background on both Jazz music and Japan during the 1960s, I was wary of watching it at first.\r\nAnd yet it succeeds in its combination of josei, drama and high school slice of life. The show features Kaoru, the socially-anxious new kid in a quiet, rather remote town, who has been blessed with piano-playing skills. Through jazz, he finds the greatest of comrades, a family and even romance. \r\nThe story, as most josei goes, isn't anything too intense. It just shows the life of a jazz-playing boy as he goes through high school with his friends. I love, though, itstake on that part of life. It's so realistic, I managed to relate to it despite the fact that I wasn't even part of band back in high school. The series starts as strongly and ends, if possible, even more.\\n\\n\r\nRomance and melodrama is thrown here and there, and while it wasn't its strongest point, it just felt very REAL. I've been there, through all the confusion and inability to communicate feelings. At times I found myself wondering if it's odd for me to be able to relate so much to Japanese highschoolers in the 1960s when it's 2013 and I live in the Philippines.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the story is rather relaxed, as there really isn't much going on. But that's fine as you obviously wouldn't be looking for action here (it's an anime about high school jazz-players for chrissake). The leisurely pace it has is very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all well-rounded. It makes use of archetypes but never just relies on it. Everyone feels amazingly real. It also helps that there is a very limited cast of characters and they were all given time to develop. They all have layers to them and are much much more than what can be considered their outer personality. Everyone is likable and unlikable in their own ways, just like everyone is. Another thing that I like is that there are quirks as easter eggs placed everywhere that they didn't feel the need to put out in the open, such as the fact that Sen is left-handed (I took note of this when they are studying for his make-up test!).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather... vintage. At times I wasn't particularly fond of it-- it sometimes came off as someone who just recently discovered the gradient and smudge tool on Photoshop-- but it did manage to set the tone for the show. It can come off as plain but it worked. It gave off a nostalgic vibe from which the show benefited greatly. The backgrounds at times, like when it showed the church or Kaoru's house, were exceptional. I wonder if it was rotoscoped because it looked so amazing. How I wish they could have kept it constant all through out though. Wonderful lighting direction was present all throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou would expect music to be the strongest part but I wouldn't say so. It was fine, but not exceptional. The opening and ending themes were rather disappointing for a music anime but it wasn't horrible. Just not what I had in mind, I guess. The choice of music was good for the most part, making use of various jazz artists and the Beatles to make it feel more like the 60s. The jam sessions scenes were amazing, obviously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a simple show with solid character and story development, with good music and pretty art, then this show is for you. It is extremely well-made, a perfect example of a josei anime done properly. The ending didn't leave me disappointed which was what I expected at the first sign of the love polygon. It's worth a shot, at any rate, if you want a break from all the heavy action and overly cheesy harem animes.",

            "content": "Are you ready for a bromance so strong, you\u2019ll feel friendship tingles down the shaft of your peen? For romance elements so complex, they are no longer love triangles--but instead, terrifying, ever-growing love polygons of doom? For jam sessions so boppin\u2019 they could make the late, great, Sun Ra tap his foot in his grave? Then my friend, you are prepared for Kids on the Slope.\r\nAt a glance Kids on the Slope is nothing more than a high school drama, akin to the hundreds which flood contemporary media. While I\u2019ll admit that I do enjoy a show that makes me feel my proverbial ovaries rubbingagainst each other (it\u2019s a guilty pleasure of sorts that I\u2019ve acquired over the years) as well as the occasional bitch-tear from some of the more well put together dramas/slice-of-lifes that catch my eye, I often find the angst ridden filth which is commonly regarded as \u2018adolescence in a nutshell\u2019 to be utterly vexatious. \\n\\n\r\nWhile easily misinterpreted as complaining, I do understand that I\u2019m not a member of the target demographic for at least 90% of the series\u2019 mentioned above and as a result of this I just tend to walk past that hypothetical garden of pubescent depression as opposed to trampling upon it and it\u2019s eternally cherished flowers, despite people\u2019s affection towards them being baffling to a man such as myself. With that being said, I\u2019m also not a part of the target demographic for Kids on the Slope but that does not mean that I was unable to enjoy the fuck out of it. To put it bluntly, this is, at the moment, my favourite slice-of-life anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how could it not be? Set in the quiescent period of 1960s Japan, with a serene art-style and ataractic soundtrack, I often found myself lost in a sense of euphoria. While the pacing at first may seem quite slow, I believe that this is part of the series\u2019 charm and works well to accentuate the insouciant nature of both the series and the era in which it\u2019s set.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying its unmatched poise is the maturity (I\u2019m sorry guys, but this translates to no prolonged gratuitous ass/panty/cleavage shots, unfortunately) in which the story is presented and a great set of characters. Not only could I compare almost every character to someone I\u2019ve met in in the course of my life, I was also able to relate certain elements of each character\u2019s personality to myself. Similarly, no character was your average cardboard cutout. Instead, each and every character had a very human feeling associated with them. Over the course of this journey, we\u2019ll observe each of the main character\u2019s flaws, attributes and eventual evolution into adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise for this slice-of-life drama was also quite refreshing, in the sense that the relationship which receives the most limelight is that of two males as opposed to a primarily romantic relationship. This unlikely bond between Sentarou and Richie will oftentimes amaze me when I think that this is the first bro-drama of it\u2019s kind to cross my path. While for the most part, their friendship does reflect that of a lot of close friends; do expect some moments which gracefully tread the thin line between bromance and romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series really is admirable, and this is most evident during the jam sessions. While concert performances and the like are no new occurrence in anime (especially as of late), in Kids on the Slope every drum hit, every piano note, every pluck of the upright double bass happens in time with the music and looks magnificent. The accurate animation of the instruments really helps bring home the notion that the musically orientated segments of this anime are not a gimmick but rather, help bring the characters together as a group while at the same time aids the characters in growing as individuals--as I daresay music does in everyone\u2019s lives. \\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who feel as if you\u2019re the paragon of masculinity but may want to try a slice-of-life, then look no further (there are multiple physical altercations in this anime, which is why I believe it\u2019s a great starting point for those new to the genre). Similarly, those who merely enjoy jazz but find the genre a bit too intimidating to delve into will find some great artists and songs to add to your essential private shower performance repertoire. All in all, this anime is heartwarming, bitch-tear inducing and a must watch for any and all anime fans.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR? This may be a josei. However, it is a bro-tastic josei which can be enjoyed by anyone. I give this anime a 10/10 and while this is a highly subjective score, this anime objectifies everything I'm seeking when I make the infrequent trip to tear-jerker town. Its stylish aesthetic coupled with its awe-inspiring soundtrack serve to create arguably one of the best slice-of-life experiences I could imagine.",

            "content": "I saw this released awhile ago and never even tried episode one because it looked kinda boring to me. I gave it another shot and I already instantly started liking it.\r\nThe animation is really freakin' good, it is a 12 episode kinda show so I do expect really good animation, and this doesn't hold back. Whenever they play instruments, the animation looks smooth and solid and you can see them hitting the right keys and toms, no made up sounds. It is really hard to animate playing music (a lot of animes take shortcuts and show flashbacks to reduce animation time spent on playing) butwhenever they play, they never take shortcuts and go all out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, I was speculating if I got trapped in another boy-love show, but I was safe because in episode one he already starts falling for a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls in this show aren't that attractive, but whatever, they grow on you and find their charm. (I point this out because anime industry made it so every woman has to be attractive so it is good to clarify if some watchers would be put off from this, which they shouldn't)\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a drama, you will see slapping, punching, crying, etc. which is in my zone, but it isn't OVER dramatic... More like chill dramatic.\\n\\n\r\n Love has a high point in this anime, but friendship totally overrides it in this one. It shows true bro-ship into the end.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters, the glasses-kun is actually a main character and I dig it when he realizes instantly if he does something retarded or stupid. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is top-notch, obviously because this is an anime about playing jazz. Made me respect jazz a lot more than I did before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-wise, I dig it and made me smile couple times, didn't make me cry or anything but it had its moments. It was good enough to marathon with no regrets.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending (whether good or bad, no spoils) was a good one, I get mad at dramas when they don't show an aftermath, and this totally has an aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it 8.5/10 or 8/10",

            "content": "The story consists of a lot of romance tropes, and really tends to play up it's character drama. I didn't enjoy the romance stuff very much, but I feel like the show worked remarkably well in portraying the tension of the relationship between characters through music. When the characters are playing music together, you really can feel their emotions come through, and I thought that was really impressive. The characters, and their interactions with each other were really the best part of the story, despite the otherwise pretty boilerplate storyline.\r\nThe art was very nice as well. Everything had a very detailed, realistic look to itand there was a lot of really impressive animation as well. Things moved really fluidly in most cases, especially when the characters are playing their instruments, and really getting into it. Lighting and colors are used really effectively, too, and it sets a great mood. The only thing I didn't like about the art was the character design. Most of the characters appearances were kind of standard and uninteresting. The designs fit their personalities well, but there just isn't much visual appeal to the way they look. Taken at face value, they just end up looking like very generic anime characters, despite being more than that once you factor in the writing & their actual character depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic, Yoko Kanno does a fantastic job of re-creating these classic jazz tracks, and the whole show just has an incredible tone to it because of this. The music is the heart of this show, for sure, and it's what I feel really makes the show something special, and pushes it from \"above average\" into \"really good\". I watched it in Japanese, and the voice acting is also very well done. The actors have realistic, convincing performances that accurately portray their characters. Nothing sounds cheesy or over-acted, and it adds to the realism of the show. The overall mix of the audio is also professionally done, and the whole show just sounds great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kids on the Slope doesn't have much at it's core. The story or characters don't seem very interesting at first, and both are full of tropes. However, with some very nice presentation, and some quality writing, the characters actually become somewhat more interesting. couple that with some impressive art, and some fantastic, atmospheric jazz music, and what you're left with is a truly enjoyable show that surprisingly ends up being more than the sum of it's parts.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review here and I tried my hardest to leave out any real spoilers. So, here we go:\r\nSakamichi no Apollon started out with a powerful episode and ended with a powerful episode, but seemed to get lost in a tangle of badly handled and clich\u00e9d romance and some unneeded melodrama. The series also suffered from bad pacing, though that only really started to show itself toward the middle-end of the run, this was when the fast pacing became a double edged sword and affected not only the plot, but the characters as well.\r\nSo now, let me look at thecharacters: I liked all of them individually a whole lot with the exception of Kaoru and one other character I will bring up later. He was a bit annoying and frustrating as a main character (he also did quite a few things that I would label as right out jerk-ish), but he was still very realistic and better than the usual generic main lead guy. Nevertheless, I felt that his best sides came out when he was hanging out with the other characters as friends.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is when the fast pacing comes it, it may have made the usual love triangle melodrama less prolonged and annoying, but at the same time it really didn\u2019t allow me to see any of the romantic relationships build up. There was no good transitions from acquaintances to friends to lovers.  It made it very difficult for me to care about the relationships found within this series.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of relationships, the characters themselves suffered from the fast pacing. It made it hard for me to really connect to them, since I saw realistic characters, but I never really saw them evolve. They stayed within their character types and never really moved above and beyond them in any real significant way. Kaoru got some character development, but not as much as some other main characters have gotten this season. And the two other characters that got the most character development were side characters whose subplot gets rushed and they are gone before I could even really fully appreciate them.\\n\\n\r\nTwo other things that bothered me a bit in this anime was that one \u201caccidently walked into the bathroom\u201d scene, which was handled better than most of those types of fanservice scenes are, but felt like something that was unfitting for the type of series Sakamichi no Apollon was; the same goes for the character of Seiji Matsuoka. Generally I am usually fond of characters who are like him, but here he just felt so out of place, not only for the series but for the time period as well.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of these negative aspects of the series, Sakamichi no Apollon does have some extremely well done and beautiful parts too. First and foremost, the music is fantastic and it is utilized perfectly. The animation is also lovely and the art style is very nice to look at in general, especially when the jazz scenes are on screen. Next, when the series focused on aspects other than romance it tended to be very powerful. There was also the added aspect of Christianity, being portrayed accurately (at least in Japan and in comparison to other anime) and the fact that accents were kept in were great, too, since it really helped to make the anime feel like it wasn\u2019t taking place in Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThese other issues that I mentioned above were all really great to see in an anime, but sadly they got pushed aside or brushed over quickly in favor of the romance, the time restraint and pacing didn\u2019t help either. These issues came up and then passed so quickly that I didn\u2019t even have time to properly digest them before they were already done and over. \\n\\n\r\nThis bugged me a bit, that romance got so much attention, when one of the themes of the series itself is that friendship is more powerful and important than that of a love affair, yet love affairs are what take up most of the series. Nevertheless, the ending scenes of this anime are still very powerful. This series didn't have the strongest or most fulfilling ending of the spring season, but it was still very poignant and on level with the first episode when it comes to impact.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, Sakamichi no Apollon is a perfect anime to watch with someone who normally doesn\u2019t watch anime, since many of the usual things that make anime seem \u201cweird\u201d are not present. It is also a very well done and solid teenage romance drama, but it is still just that: a teenage romance drama. I thought it was going to focus more on the jazz and music aspects (and I actually thought I was not going to like it because of that, but in the end that was one of the strongest parts of the series), but then it divulged into the romantic aspect more than I thought it was going to. \\n\\n\r\nThis series was good, but not great, and I am actually a bit disappointed by that.",

            "content": "This was an anime that popped up in my recommendations for a while based off various other's I watched.  I simply didn't believe it would be anything close to what I wanted and became frustrated seeing the same cover page over and over of which I wasn't to fond of.  I refused to watch it time and time again based on my own superficial reasons until I finally said to myself \"it's 20 minutes of my life, I'll watch just one episode.\"  It wasn't just 20 minutes, it ended up being a good portion of the season before I had to finallyget some sleep.\\n\\n\r\nStory-  The story of Sakamichi no Apollon is one of the strongest I've ever seen in only 12 episodes.  It gives a great back story as to why the main character (Kaoru) is where he is now and immerses you in the time frame of the story immediately.  Although it's in the 60's and I was very skeptical of such a time frame, it's essential for the jazz fueled story of friendship that takes place.  The story is truly touching and special as it addresses the great value of a deep bond of friendship as well as coming of age into your own person.  There's certainly romance as well, although the most prevalent romance lies not with the main characters but with two supporting ones who in truth, really have their own amazing chemistry and story unfolding.  This was one of the few plots that kept me invested, thinking and connected to everything happening at all times, it made you feel really heavy and then full of joy the next episode because of how much meaning the plot held.\\n\\n\r\nArt-  The art I was sorely mistaken on.  I went in thinking for some reason it was going to have outdated animation purely because it was based in the 60's.  In reality it was great quality animation, though I can't really pick out any instance where I was amazed by its creativity or colors.  It does what it needs to do in this anime and depicts the time period of the 60's amazingly well, although it wasn't the brightest of times in Japan so I can see why it wasn't trying to be something it wasn't.  The best part is the character designs as they're all crisp and perfectly fit their respective personalities.  All in all the art compliments the story really well, but it's nothing to really to gaze at in itself. \\n\\n\r\nSound-  This is what makes the anime other than the plot.  I'll come right out and say it, I just couldn't handle jazz before, it didn't please my ears you could say.  However, the second I heard Sentarou and Kaoru's first jam session together I was not only moved at how this music brought together the two most unlikely friends, it really gave me a new outlook on the music.  Jazz is the driving force of this anime and this is easily the most important section of the review as there are so many situations that these characters must get through with their music.  They even communicate with each other simply by being in the same room and playing their improv jazz, pouring out all their emotions to each other in instrumental song.   For anyone who hates jazz, this show will at the very least make you tolerate it, they bring meaning to the genre for people who don't care about it in the least.  Not to mention the theme song is the most fitting I've ever heard and the soundtrack is really something so unique and beautiful it needs to be experienced.  I can rant on about how great the sound is for an entire review's length so I'll leave it at this.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  The characters are very well developed especially for a series that only spans 12 episodes.  All of the main characters are very different but they all become bound by one similar interest in Jazz.  While the typical delinquent meeting the quiet exchange student has been done before, both of these characters are far from common beneath the surface.  Sentarou is one of the deepest characters in any show, and you can tell this almost right after meeting him, he had a feel to him that compelled you to be drawn to his story as well as the pure friendship between him and Kaoru.  The seiyuu really bring these characters to life and add a great sense of realism to them to.  Even the supporting characters play vital roles and all help the main characters along in their own way, as well as progressing their own stories in the time they have.  What can be said overall is that there is not one annoying character or overly common one either.  Every single character whether it be main or supporting has their own unique personality and goals that sets them all apart yet binds them together and that's what I find so impressive about the,.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  As you can all tell I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.  It truly impacted me on a few different levels and really makes you think because there are so many real situations and desires you can relate to, despite it taking place in 1966.  It just goes to show you that no matter the time or place, people will always have these issues to go through, and this show goes to show you how valuable having a deeply bonded friendship can be through that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  I highly recommend this to anyone who has even a slight interest in romance/comedy/drama/slice of life or even music.  People who actually go into this liking Jazz beforehand will be on cloud 9 the entire way through.  It drives home a message that I believe resonates with the majority that it will definitely leave you thinking deeply about it after you've finished.  The only reason I did not give it a ten is because (and this is nitpicking now) even with these wonderful aspects I just couldn't put it on the same level as Steins;Gate, Honey and Clover, or Bakemonogatari.  That being said it's extremely close to Honey and Clover, however H+C had amazing art while Sakamichi no Apollon had enough to convey its message.",

            "content": "Once again we are encountering a great anime. Kids on the slope is another combo between Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno. I can't imagine now if someone else did a screen version of Kids on the slope. But lets get to the point.\r\nThe story focuses around Kaoru, who is your normal geek, straight up alone and unexperienced when it comes to real life. He loves studying and playing on instruments. Because of that he apparently can't fight and stand by himself, and this is where another character is introduced to help Kaoru. Sentarou on the other hand is your typical badass character, who doesn't givea shit about studying and can stand by himself. Both of them become friends and this is where things get interesting. For the whole 12 episodes we are watching how these two are growing on their friendship and how they deal with their problems. Kaoru is in love with Ritsuko, but Ritsuko isn't. She loves Sentarou. Yes, it creates a love triangle, but its so well done you won't be dissapointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is just amazing, not only its crispy looking, but the ACTUAL MOVES of the characters when it comes to playing drums and piano is animated. Yes, you can learn from it if you pay enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound doesn't need introduction, cmon guys its Yoko Kanno and the famous piece they play at the end of the anime is called Moanin, a jazz classic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are alive and never feel undeveloped or unoriginal. Every character is likeable and differ one from another, which doesn't make this series boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this a great addition to anyones list and should be seen imediately. I enjoyed it and wanted more, srsly. If it wasn't for shows like this, i wouldn't even watch anime in the first place.",

            "content": "It\u2019s not gay if it\u2019s a three way.  \r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free. \r\nJokes aside, looking at the surface of Kids on the Slope, one might think that it is a just another music SOL anime such as K-On! or Tari Tari.  After all, each of these series is about a number of high school students living out their normal lives, all brought together by music.  Look a bit deeper however, and you will see that Kids on the Slope, directed by the famous Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, is a totally different entity entirely. \r\nStory -7/10\\n\\n\r\nKids on a Slope is set in 1960s Japan, a time when American Jazz was a powerful part of Japan\u2019s musical culture.  During this time, an unlikely group of students gather together, united by this one common interest.  From here their story unfolds, and in some ways the anime changes form entirely; for at its heart, Kids on a Slope is not a SOL.  It is, in fact, a romance through and through.\\n\\n\r\nThe series often forgoes the focus on jazz that it presents in the first episodes of the series to focus on the relationships between the characters.  That\u2019s not to say that the viewer isn\u2019t treated to frequent jam sessions throughout the series, but it becomes obvious that the character\u2019s connections are now the main point of the series.  I\u2019ll go into this a bit more later.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the setting goes, it\u2019s pretty easy to forget that you are in 1960s Japan.  There are indications, of course; mainly music references, but also the cars, record players, etc.  However, the series uses its setting almost entirely for the music, and I feel a bit of potential is lost where it could have brought out a bit more character of the era. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the show is well above average.  Gradients are used to great effect, and shadows on the characters faces and backgrounds show great attention to detail.  Character designs are unique, perhaps even polarizing.  While the character designs are well done, the backgrounds can be a bit plain, and the frequently revisited areas are disappointingly plain.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation itself is beautiful.  Everything is very fluid, especially the scenes in which instruments are played.  The level of detail during these scenes is absolutely fantastic, but it makes me wish they would have used a bit of the animation budget on more detailed sets. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my insistence that this is a romance anime at heart, that doesn\u2019t mean that a huge amount of attention went towards the music.  Famous jazz makes up the majority of the music focused scenes, and this is where Kids on a Slope truly shines.  However, its original soundtrack is average at best, relying on popular music of the time to keep the viewer entertained.  Aside from the jazz, early rock begins to make its way into Japan (and therefore the series) as well, and becomes a source of contention among the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKids on a Slope has a main cast of three characters: Sentarou, Ritsuko, and Kaoru.  Sentarou and Ritsuko are childhood friends, with Kaoru having started attending the same school as them.  Being new and rich, he quickly finds himself a social outcast.  However, when looking for the key to the roof, he finds himself getting along strangely well with the short-tempered Sentarou.  When Kaoru reveals he is a classical pianist, they find themselves playing jazz together often.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kaoru soon develops feelings for the overly kind Ritsuko, who is the embodiment of indecisiveness when it comes to her feelings.  The relationship between them, with the complication of Ritsuko\u2019s maybe-not-so-sure feelings for Sentarou, makes up the vast majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is more of the same.  Yurika, a brief love interest of Sentarou\u2019s, finds herself involved with Junichi, an older friend of Sentarou\u2019s, and her life begins to change as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag, really.  In one respect, the indecisiveness when it comes to romantic feelings in the teenage years is accurately portrayed, and the characters realistic and likable.  On the other hand, this indecisiveness and the classic \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d starts to get old after some time, and I found Yurika and Junichi\u2019s relationship a bit exhausting.  Your enjoyment of the characters in this series will largely depend on how well you can handle the usual tropes that comes with a romantic anime.  A surprising level of backstory is given for relevant characters in a series of this length.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you go into this series expecting a light-hearted comedy with a music focus, you may be disappointed.  What it does present is a slow romance with a musical base drawing the characters together.  A nice collection of jazz music, good animation, and a solid romance between the main cast was all tied up together nicely for a twelve episode series. \\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nSome say there may be some gay undertones between the two male leads.  I didn\u2019t really see this, but it is Josei after all, so men aren\u2019t at their manliest. \\n",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon (or Kids on The Slope) is like a breath of fresh air from recent anime developments and definitely stands out from the rest. I don't think a show could have impressed me this much just by watching the first episode, and it left me with a better feeling than any anime I've ever watched ever has.\r\nThe animation is super unique as well, and far different from the cutsie pop-art style that's used so often to the point where you can't tell one anime from another. To summarize it briefly, it's the summer of 1966, and a really reserved kid named Kaoru Nishimitransfers from Yokosuka to Kyushu to a new school. I can't say too much without giving it away, but rather than the typical slice-of-life type of show, this story is pretty damn quality and unorthodox. I can't say much in this review, because everything basically starts in the first episode and doesn't wait too long to get into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing you should know is that it's really music-centered. Specifically jazz-centered. If that's not your thing, turn back now. The OST is all jazz, the characters play jazz. The aspect of love is also explored as an underlying theme in this anime, and complicates things a bit, but that's all I'm going to say. Needless to say, I'm super excited about this anime and it's getting in the way of this review and I should wait to do it, but what the Hell.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main characters are very ordinary looking. Apart from a few distinctions like glasses or a scar, they look like anybody you'd see on the street. You're not going to get any ridiculous hairstyles or clothes. They're also relatable and well-writen as actual human beings. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to spend much more time on this. But I really suggest you watch it. This anime is just so extremely quality.",

            "content": "Set in 1966, Sakamichi no Apollon is centered on Kaoru Nishimi as he moves to Sasebo to live with relatives due to his father\u2019s job. Naturally, he\u2019s a loner, a great student, and completely isolated from people since he\u2019s always been moving around; he doesn't try to get attached to people in case he must leave them again. But there\u2019s something in the air in Sasebo, and it\u2019s not just love or friendship, it\u2019s a new sound (to Japan at least) known as jazz. Music isn't new to Kaoru as he\u2019s a classically trained pianist, but jazz is certainly new and interesting to him, asit takes him some time to \u2018get it\u2019. All the while he\u2019s studying school and jazz, he\u2019s also developing a social life with the school bad boy Sentarou, and his friend Ritsuko. Not breaking trope norms, Sentarou isn't a brute as his size implies, he\u2019s actually a kind-hearted, caring young man. Ritsuko is in love with Sentarou, which obviously causes problems with Kaoru, as he loves Ritsuko. I know, I know, love stories and slice of life series are not usually my thing. I don\u2019t often go for the dramas and similar ideas, but Sakamichi no Apollon does it so well, in every episode, that it\u2019s hard to step away.\\n\\n\r\nWatanabe\u2019s direction, storytelling, and pacing are just so excellent, and there\u2019s rarely a dull moment in the entire 12 episode run. Everything is well planned out, and leads to a satisfying climax. There are a few moments and questionable plot devices that get thrown in near the end that aren't really for the best, but looking back, they weren't too pivotal and quickly forgotten anyway. Sakamichi no Apollon is a strong long at not only a new sound in Japan, but religion in Japan also. Something rarely discussed or mentioned in many of the series I\u2019ve seen; at least, something besides Buddhism or Shintoism. Sentarou and Ritsuko are both devoted Catholics, and while it\u2019s not impossible for Kaoru to understand this, it is still a little bewildering for him. It\u2019s never the focus of the main story, and there are a handful of moments about it, so it\u2019s never force-fed or heavy-handed, but it\u2019s still a prevalent component to Sentarou and Ritsuko\u2019s characters. The series starts to show some weakness just before the finale, but it quickly pulls itself together by the end to produce an ending that\u2019s not to be ranked \u2018one of the best, or most original, but it\u2019s satisfying and gives nice closure to the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nNow accompanying every scene and poignant moment, Watanabe got the best Japan has to offer in the composition department and tasked Yoko Kanno in the role of handling it. And she absolutely killed it in the end. Sakamichi no Apollon\u2019s soundtrack is gripping, but subtle, aware, but hidden. It\u2019s all there, and even when you do not want it to, it will knock on the door to your feelings and come inside and affect everything found within. There are perhaps a few tracks that may seem out of place due to their sound Rosario is one that stands out for me), but they\u2019re still exceptional tracks and they help make the scenes they\u2019re used in so much more powerful. Yoko Kanno and the team she collaborated with to not only make the tracks for scenes, but for the jazz pieces too; they\u2019re incredible. I usually don\u2019t care for jazz, in fact, I really don\u2019t like it, but this series, and the sounds and implementations of it, made me care (at least while watching the series). Yoko Kanno has always been on point with her soundtracks, and Sakamichi no Apollon ranks up there as another glorified treat for fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnother feast for the senses comes from the animation teams over at MAPPA and Tezuka Productions and their brilliant (and likely expensive) use of rotoscoping to animate several scenes in Sakamichi no Apollon. Rotoscoping is the process of tracing over live-action footage, then animating it for a more fluid, life-like presentation. A lot of Disney films used this over the years, and a few anime studios have done so too, but it\u2019s a time-intensive and expensive process, so very few studios will opt-in to using it. For Sakamichi no Apollon though, it works, because the minute details of keys strikes, drum patterns, and plucking of the bass matters, and with the help of this animation style, they nail it. It\u2019s used sparingly, and in other instances when not overtly necessary, but its uses never distract or hinder the rest of the show. Rotoscoping is truly a treat for the eyes, and I wish more animation were still done this way, because it invokes a natural, almost realistic production that pulls me in more.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is still relatively new to the anime a few years to see if it stands out as one of Watanabe\u2019s best, or sit on the shelves as just another series that exists. If you\u2019ve read this far already, you\u2019ll know what I think: you should be watching Sakamichi no Apollon. It\u2019s likely unlike anything you've seen if you\u2019ve never delved into romance or coming-of-age series, but it is well worth the venture.",

            "content": "When anime fans see the name Shinichiro Watanabe attached to an anime they usually get excited due to his excellent work making Cowboy Bebop. So going into Sakamichi no Apollon there is a certain expectation given to the show. Unlike Watanabe's previous animes, this one does not have any action in it at all. Instead, the focus is on romance and drama.\r\nSakamichi no Apollon captures the setting of 1966 Japan well from the classroom to the clothes the characters wear to the style of music that is played. The backdrop for the story is great and unique as it is very rare to ever seean anime based on 60s Japan and jazz. However, while the setting may be unique, the story itself isn't. The romance is cilched with the usual misunderstandings, melodrama and love triangles. This detracts from the quality of the show as the romance becomes the focus of the plot. Nevertheless, Sakamichi no Apollon portrays the tension and emotion involved with love triangles well.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show is the jazz and music. With Yoko Kanno in charge of the soundtrack, it is expected that it will be high quality and she delivers in every way. Not only is the score great to amplify the emotion and tension in scenes, it also delivers when the characters are playing jazz together. This is what holds the show together. The scenes where the characters are in the basement playing their instruments not only entertains due to the high quality of the music, but gives a great insight to the characters as their emotions are connected to the music they play. It is here where we see the bonds between the characters grow and it is through music that the characters heal their wounds. The opening theme is excellent and sets the tone well while the ending theme seemed a bit out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is also a high point of the show. With a slightly older style of character design, the art style helps immerse the viewer into the 60s. The animation is fluid, especially during the music playing scenes as the anime is very accurate in showing each note played by the characters. There is also no fan service at all which for me is a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nThe downfall for Sakamichi no Apollon is the protagonist, Kaoru. In the early episodes where there was more comedy, it was more enjoyable to watch as Kaoru's internal struggles are countered by the antics of Sentaro. However once the anime changes focus to the romance, there is far less comedy making Kaoru difficult to watch. In most scenes he can be rude, selfish or melodramatic, and with no comedy to counter it, the audience isn't left with much to enjoy when he is on screen. The other characters are much more well rounded and entertaining. Their growth is more visible and their flaws were realistic. Perhaps this may be simply because their inner thoughts are rarely verbalised, unlike Kaoru who is usually repeating the same thoughts of self doubt and pain. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this may seem like a negative review of Sakamichi no Apollon, it shouldn't be taken that way as there is a lot to enjoy. There are no filler episodes, the story is concise and the music is wonderful. The ending is perhaps a bit rushed, but that seems to be a case of there only being 12 episodes. Nevertheless, this anime is easily accessible for anyone, anime fan or not. The series may not be the most memorable, but it is worth a watch, even just to experience the nostalgic feeling of change during high school.",

            "content": "How much you enjoy Sakamichi no Apollon is largely dependent on your level of emotional maturity.\r\nSPOILER-FREE\u2122\r\nSakamichi no Apollon translates to \u201cApollo of the slope,\u201d not \u201cKids on the Slope,\u201d so whatever translation you want to use really doesn\u2019t matter. Kids on a Slope may look on the surface like a typical clich\u00e9d romance anime with lots of misunderstandings, too much drama, love polygons and people sort-of-but-not-really changing who they love. You may be tempted to think that\u2019s all Adolescents on an Incline is, and you should give in to that temptation because that\u2019s exactly what it is.\r\nJuveniles on a Slant, by the way, is totallyNOT GAY. It\u2019s completely normal for male friends to hold hands, embrace each other crying, run out of school together, eat out of each other\u2019s hands and the like. At least I hope so because me and my roommate may have had a small sexual encounter the other day so PLOT POINT: my childhood friend who I secretly love read that and is now crying so I headed over to her house but PLOT POINT: my father who I thought was dead meets me along the way and tells me he wants to be a real family from now on but PLOT POINT: my roommate accidentally bumps into him and knocks him into a cement plant and starts crying because PLOT POINT: my roommate was actually in a relationship with my father but PLOT POINT: there\u2019s a meteor headed toward earth and I have to decide if I want to spend my last moments with my dying father or childhood friend.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 4/10\\n\\n\r\nYou may have gathered from that somewhat cryptic paragraph that Youths on a Declination has no story, what it has is a string of barely connected random events as a cheap attempt to cause an emotional reaction in the audience. The other point I was trying to make is that Striplings on an Oblique Surface has quite possibly got the single most forced plot I have ever seen in anime. The story is hashed together with every situation the creators think could possibly pull on someone\u2019s heart strings, natural story development be damned. The result is some completely artificial Frankensteinian monster. You can almost hear it sob \u201cPlease\u2026kill\u2026me\u201d as it stabs your eyeballs trying to get you to cry any way possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs the plot lurches through its various stages it manages to amass quite the collection of plot holes and inconsistencies. For the most part however, it manages to hold itself together as a pretty stereotypical Josei. It does treat themes like coming of age and friendship acceptably. If you happen to really, really love drama and romance then maybe you\u2019ll find a way to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of late-60\u2019s Japan deserves special attention in this review, because it didn\u2019t get any in the show. Whippersnappers on an Acclivity really missed a chance to be unique and interesting by capturing the flavor of the era. Instead, there is barely anything there to distinguish it from a typical modern anime, I half expected a student to pull out a cell phone at any time. There are a few token times when the show tries to masturbate to its own classiness, old-style desks, records and such, but there are so many anachronisms that it winds up just being annoying.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not very attractive. The characters have faces only a mother could love and objects and backgrounds can look plain and simple. But Minors on a Gradient has one secret weapon up its sleeve: animation. I could use words like fluid, smooth and beautiful. One test I use to determine how lazy a studio is in animation is music scenes. That is, whenever someone is playing an instrument, do their movements match up with the song? Even an amateur can tell if the beat is on (which it often isn\u2019t). Here, the piano parts are matched to the characters fingers. It shows great attention to detail that is present throughout the show, which compounds the great animation to look spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWait, WHAT? 3!? What the fuck is wrong with you John, giving a music anime a 3 for sound? Well, Tykes on a Cant\u2019s soundtrack is lousy. That isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no good music, it\u2019s just all 30-60 second outtakes of jazz classics. I like jazz more than most, but no points for unoriginality, especially if it\u2019s tied together with a second-rate OST. The voice acting is underwhelming but passable. Ultimately, if you came for the music, go listen to music and give this one a pass.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe translation \u201cKids on the Slope\u201d may not be faithful to the Japanese, but it\u2019s very faithful to the characters, because they act like children. The main pair: Kaoru and Sentarou, have an interesting relationship. They are best friends, not because they are alike or get along or anything lame like that. No, the show just declares them best friends when they barely know each other and from then on they stick together for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nSIKE! They spend more than half the show not on speaking terms, and they have at least one fight an episode. I seriously hope nobody views this as a model of a healthy friendship. The way they hate each other makes it even more bizarre and surreal during the few times when they inexplicably love each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow flawed characters are a good thing, but the biggest flaw of Squirts on Uneven Ground\u2019s characters is that they don\u2019t feel like people, not at all. They certainly carry out the orders of the story well, but they have no depth OR consistency. The few times when they acted like human beings was lost on me since I was completely unattached to them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you get emotional easily? Do you cry when you see road kill? Are you a pre-teen girl? If any of these are true, you may enjoy Youngsters on a Rise. But if unrealistic story and characters causes you not to get emotionally invested, I don\u2019t think this is for you. The make or break here is drama. Many people will think the drama is excessive, but if you\u2019re easily affected then maybe this is worth a shot.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nI may not be the biggest fan of the romance genre, but (Baby+15)/(mx+b) was a real let-down. It didn\u2019t so much strike me on a sour note, mostly I was just bored watching it. I definitely enjoyed some of the music scenes, but mostly I just want my six hours back.",

            "content": "[5.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nIt would be natural to compare Kids on the Slope to Your Lie in April. Both series came around the same time, have a relatively similar premise, and are romances with the backdrop of music. I was wholly disappointed in Your Lie in April due to the writing, the hamfisted dialogue, the lack of nuance, the characters, and the inability for the series to let music breath and tell its own story. \r\nSo, with that knowledge, I was cautious going into Kids on the Slope. I was aware that it was a similar, romance-driven series that utilized music to occasionally back-end certain plot elements. Iunderstood where this show was coming from. Unfortunately, I still couldn't help but feel disappointed with the fact that once again, this was an anime that simply refused to promote the elements it clearly excelled at. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Kids on the Slope regressed in its middle half and ended up only peaking its head from the fog of boring writing in the last couple episodes. This series Started off strong by establishing characters who I found quite endearing, such as the rambunctious and rough Kawabuchi. Our protagonist, Nishimi, who was never the highlight, struggles with the move to a new school in a new town. These characters were easy to buy and the friendship that springs up was decently believable. I liked how our protagonist had trouble fitting in due to his wealth, rather than the other way around. It created an interesting dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nThey ended up forming a small jazz-group that jammed out in the basement of a jazz shop. Nishimi was on the piano, Kawabuchi was on the drums, and Pops, the owner of said shop, was on the bass. It was a neat little idea that, for lack of a better word, felt cozy. Occasionally a fourth member would come over from Tokyo, Junichi, who would whip out the trumpet and jam out with them as well. These moments were the show at its best. We had character growth, some light-hearted comedy, and infinite potential for realization. Are they going to form a band? Will music help them in their personal lives? Will they grow closer to one another through their mutual interests? \\n\\n\r\nNope. None of that happens. The series chooses to focus on the romance. More specifically, a quasi-love rectangle that is as frustrating as it sounds. The majority of the series was light on music and heavy on melodrama, and while the melodrama was somewhat more palatable than the tedium that twenty-four episodes of Your Lie in April made me sit through, it wasn't without its utterly baffling and cliche moments. Miscommunication, characters unable to speak to one another, needlessly angry outbursts over nonsense. It was all the teenage romantic bullshit that I've seen too much of. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is all the more frustrating when it back-ends a genuinely good story of friendship between our two protagonists. It is ultimately such an annoying experience because friendship is honestly all someone needs to make a story interesting. The romance here felt so forced and injected simply to have drama suffocate this potentially engaging series. It wasn't bad, in fact, there were a few inspired moments that brought this show past its mediocrity when it wasn't getting bogged down by the romance, but it was far from as good as it could've been. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters, Story, and Music]\\n\\n\r\nThis friendship between Kawabuchi and Nishimi is the chain that grounds the series. It is also the beating heart of some of the most frustrating moments when their friendship is tested because of miscommunication and totally irrational, stubborn moments. Maybe Japanese boys are different but seeing two teenagers discuss girls was such an unsual experience in this series because they were being needlessly vague about their interests.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was a kid and I was discussing my infatuations with my friends, I was blunt and clear because, at the end of the day, we were two guys having a good time and talking about the girls we like was a quintessential teenage \"thing\". Especially when clarity is deathly important to avoid clear conflict. These hair-pulling moments where our protagonist could've avoided two episodes of bitching if he was clear to his friend is the biggest fault of the show. I simply couldn't enjoy the majority of these moments.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bummer because there is a lot to enjoy here. The music, for one, is great. Unlike Your Lie in April and its incessant monologuing over every single musical moment in the series, Kids on the Slope was so smart to actually let its tunes breath. The moments where these characters are jamming out with one another and we see kinetic, frantic editing, hopping seamlessly from one instrument to the next, mixed with properly awesome animation is beyond entertaining. It's everything I wanted! I'm not a huge jazz-head, but seeing these scenes animated was flat-out exceptional. Specifically, the drumming had some ludicrously well-animated cuts. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, these moments are few and far between, especially during the middle-half of the show, where episodes drag on seemingly endlessly as one romantic interest fades and another blooms. One moment, Nishimi is walking down the street and monologues, \"why can't we stop falling in love with each other?\" I don't know! Why can't you? The idea that romance is needed to make anything interesting is such a cliched, old idea that I can't imagine why they have to force these characters in these situations. I was a teenager, I remembered the moments of infatuation, and then I remember waiting a few weeks and those feelings faded and I realized they were simply infatuations. There were no big, emotional, tear-soaked outbursts that defined my life and that's perhaps why I can't relate to these kinds of melodramatic shows. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just boring. Even when the series begins wrapping up and getting into the final three episodes, injecting some much-needed life into this wilting flower. I was already kind of soured to the experience. What I did appreciate was the subversion in the last episode, where instead of going the obvious route they pulled a fast one on the viewers and we got a somewhat melancholy conclusion. Unfortunately, it was reverted, somewhat, however, I was okay with it since it focused more on our protagonist's friendship than it did on convincing us that these fifteen-year-old boys were experiencing true love. \\n\\n\r\nThe main love interest here is Ritsuko and I just think they dropped the ball on her character. Not only was she simply not developed at all, but she lacked any distinguishing personality traits that were so good in characterizing the other two protagonists. But frankly, her flaws were awful. Not in the sense that they made her unlikeable, but rather that they were the same flaws that every character like her has. She's shy and soft-spoken. And this is pushed to an extreme with her voice actress seemingly trying to make her voice as squeaky as humanly possible. That didn't help. I swear I was listening to a dog-whistle in a few scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion and semi-twist that occurs does help her character a little, but at that point, it is just too late. The same can be said about the majority of side-stories here. The only one that had any actual impact on the character's and their development was Junichi's detour which occurred in the latter half of the series. It was decent. The biggest positive here is that it trimmed down this love-rectangle and made it more palatable. Every other side-story was just pointless. Nishimi has father issues that seemingly resolve themselves and are made to seem like a bigger deal than they were. Kawabuchi also has father issues which kind of play themselves out by the end. These stories really go nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nIs it too much to ask for a series that focuses on the music if it wants to be considered a \"music\" show? Not only that, if you don't want to constantly be music-oriented, that's fine, but at least fill these gaps with entertaining material. Don't montage past the actual music-bits in favor of making room for yet another confession near a train. I swear, in this short series we had around four scenes that all had some kind of love-oriented moment in a train, where one character was looking from a moving train while another was looking at them from the station. Not only is that just a flat-out cliche at this point, but to use it that many times? Come on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the story here isn't all too engaging. It is serviceable if only because of the endearing friendships created. Friendships, as the series so bluntly puts it, last forever, and that is more resonant to me than some puppy love melodramatic bullshit that plagues these kinds of series'. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation] \\n\\n\r\nIt's good. The art is consistent in quality and while the character designs aren't stand-out by any means, they are decent enough. The animation is okay until it comes time to flex those muscles in song and it becomes pretty incredible. The first moments we see Kawabuchi pick up a set of drumsticks and begin is so great because I wasn't expecting such a dedication to animating the drumming. \\n\\n\r\nIt felt like they had a separate animator come in for these moments as it was like I was looking at a different show. There was a lot of smears in these moments too, which further emphasized how dissonant the drumming scenes were from the rest of the series and its animation. Which isn't really a bad thing, I'm just happy these scenes were here because they brought some life into the jazz. \\n\\n\r\nApart from those specific moments, the presentation is consistent throughout. I can't say I saw a single episode where I could say was the \"one\" where they were clearly trying to save time by not animating as much as they could just to make room for the next musical moment. But even admitting that I can also say that there weren't enough musical moments to even warrant an episode like that in the first place. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nIt is okay. I'm hard-pressed to say anything more than that. I'm happy that it turned out better than Your Lie in April in just about every way. The presentation was more consistent, the music was actually listenable because they decided to not speak over it, and the characters were significantly less frustrating to deal with. While it was covered, head to toe, in rampant romantic cliches, and they undoubtedly lowered my final score, they weren't enough to fully make this series something I regret watching.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope didn't have enough of the slope. They brought up this hill a few times, however, it just wasn't enough of a theme to tie this show together. I interpreted it more as a metaphor for life rather than a literal slope they had to climb every day to school, but regardless, it could've been a bit sharper. What resonated the most with me, as it often does, is the friendship these characters experience. Dramatically, this series is at its best when it is dissecting friendship and the feelings one feels when they believe their friends are drifting away.\\n\\n\r\nThis element more relatable to me, because I personally can't relate to endlessly crying over high-school crushes when my relationships in high school were always a bit more relaxed and enjoyable than these endlessly melodramatic ones are. If you are looking for a series that is more romance than it is music, with more melodrama about being afraid to admit your feelings for someone than anything else, then Kids on the Slope might be perfect for you. It is wholly better than Your Lie in April simply because it didn't feel as though it was trying to wring tears out of me and failing miserably. It did have moments of inspiration and some genuinely touching scenes towards the end of the series. Unfortunately, Kids on the Slope struggled to climb that hill, as it was chained down by the weights of melodrama and unneeded romantic conflict.",

            "content": "I only watched the first few episodes of this series, though i think i'm able to write a review about it.\r\nFirst of all, i'm not someone who is pleased easily. I don't watch many anime, in fact i don't watch TV or Movies all too often, because they are, well let's say ... crap. When i read and heard about this anime i was eager to watch it, for it promised not to be \"mainstream\" (as i like to call it). Also, Yoko Kanno was on board as well, so that held my hopes high enough. It's really hard to see this promise not fullfilled.\r\nWhy,you ask?\\n\\n\r\nWell, yea it's quite rare to see such \"good\" characters, so early on in a series, but episode 4 already had signs of your typical \"Slice of Life\"- Bullshit. To be honest, even the first episode made me worry. These \"mood swings\". Don't get me wrong, character developement is not a bad thing, but in this case, it is not believable, and more importantly, it is too fast. Kaoru's character developement in particular. It's almost hilarious. First, he is depicted as a loner, who doesn't give a damn about anything in school, or rather life. In this and the following episode he slowly \"befriends\" Sentarou, the tough guy everyone is afraid of. He also developes a crush for Ritsuko, an old childhood-friend of Sentarou. Wow. And with that, one might think the \"Love-Triangle\" is set. Well, we thought too soon. Another girl appears on the stage, Mariko. Sentarou saves her from some guys and, yes you guessed it, he wants to get into her panties. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just the beginning. I could still bear with that, i even was okay with it, but the thing that really struck me was what followed soon after, or rather, what DIDN'T follow. To keep it almost spoiler-free i'll just name it the \"Kaoru-Ritsuko-Resolution\". It's like little girls drinking tea, if you know what i mean. I just can't relate to that. The series is called \"Kids on the slope\", but they aren't THAT little, are they? I mean, i tried to continue watching it, but i just couldn't. This anime left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone just wanting to watch their new season anime, go ahead, have fun with your routine. I can't watch this, seriously.",

            "content": "Let's do a trivia here! Are you someone who wants to know what it is like back in the 1960's? Ever wanted to build an escapism from the harsh reality of today's world? Want to just sit back and enjoy some old school music after a stressful day? Well, perhaps you've found a series worthy to invest your time into because Kids on the Slope is there and sure to give you something to think about.\r\nKids on the Slope (also known as Sakamichi no Apollon) is a story taking place in the beginning of summer, 1966. It stars the protagonist Kaoru Nishimi, an honor studentwho tends to keep to himself. He has a rather reserved personality and hard to open up. That is until he meets the bad boy and future best friend Sentaro Kawabuchi. While mistakenly getting to a bad start, these two soon develop an unforgettable friendship based on respect, forgiveness, and of course, music. Later comes into picture is Ritsuko Mukae, a friendly girl who plays intriguing roles in the story ranging from music, friendship, and later love. The series follows three friends as they create unforgettable memories of the 1960s in the age of jazz music, friendship, and melody.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you're probably asking yourself \u201cwhy should I watch this series?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWell, first of all this series contains the unification of icons Watanabe Shinichi (Series Director of Cowboy Bebop) and music composer Yoko Kanno. That alone can be seen as a good reason to start watching. While labeled as a coming-of-age drama, this series also contains a bit of the romance theme and of course, drama. So for those interested into the intertwined story arcs mixed in with misunderstandings, jazz critique, and love trials, then this could be a little added bonus. \\n\\n\r\n[ - Story - ]\\n\r\nKids on the Slope details friendship and is one of the most important element of the series and should not be just seen as an aspect of the anime but in real life as well. Kaoru, Sentaro, Ritsuko forge friendship through one common passion: the love of music and the bond that they share.\\n\\n\r\nThis series does not have a strong impression at first. From the first episode, there's not much to say besides the typical high school drama and music setting. Furthermore, for those carving for action and psychological twists or for some who call it \u201cmindfucks\u201d, then this is the wrong series to look into. Thankfully, there's an old saying that goes \u201cnever judge a book by its cover\u201d. Damn right, you shouldn't because this coming-of-age drama is sure to give you a surprising twist.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, there is the common theme. Kaoru falls for the friendly girl, Sentaro falls for the graceful girl, and Ritsuko is already in love with the childhood bad boy. Then comes even more characters that makes the already complicated geometric love shape even more complicated later on. \\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope moves at a relative pace that can be considered neither slow or fast. Ironically, it starts off slow even though it's kids on the SLOPE. Anything that flows down a slope relatively moves fast but in this case retains a relatively average pace. So I'll say this again, this series is not for the fans who carves the fast paced action and psychological twists. If you want that, try Jormungand or something.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Characters ]\\n\r\nWhile the characters are animated plainly and simple, their inner character and style is what drives this series as why it's ranked into the #100 of MAL. Beyond the romance polygon are characters that balances out the series.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Kaoru, the middleman who has the reserved personality. He is smart, he is reserved, and he has the talents to become a real star. Thankfully with some fate, he finds someone who also share a similar love for the age of music. That brings us to Sentaro. Like the opposite of ying and yang, Sentaro is seen as the tough guy with the soft spot, the one that picks fights but also the guy who protects and values his friendship with the other characters from the bottom of his heart. His outer image covers up the fact that he is a deep down guy and cares for the people and things he truly loves; his friends, his family, and the children that respects him so much and of course, music. Finally, there's Ritsuko. She is the cheerful girl, the one that builds bridges of friendship with friends and generally well-liked. Yet behind her outer image lies a somewhat insecure girl and sometimes jealous of others' ability to be so outright themselves. \\n\\n\r\nLater on of course, there are other characters that enter the scene that have stark personalities and also not who they appear to be. I'd love to go on and on about these characters but this isn't an summary is, it? This is a review so I'll leave you to find out. But trust me, you'll love to get to know them once you see the realism behind their outer characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of realism, it is noticeable that the characters' personal lives are conveyed in a way that can be seen and defined as quite real. Whether tragic, sad, or cheerful, we see the histories of the main characters that can be related to most of us. They all have background histories that brings the overall realism into the 1960's and even towards today.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Animation/Art -]\\n\r\nIf there's one thing to forget, it might be the art. I'll say this in the most honest way as possible: \\n\\n\r\nIt is too plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not rich and series airing this Spring Season like Fate/Zero puts it to shame in the art department. The animation however brings out a powerful feeling of nature and refines the 1960s style in its finest form. While plain and simple (Karou's glasses, Sentaro's shirt, etc), we can see that the culture it tries to convey of the 1960s is successful. Culture has indeed changed  from the past to present day as we can clearly see the lesser technology and more general and sophisticated themes. It is simple and not detailed just like how high school should be. It doesn't need to be something special that makes us go \u201cwow!\u201d After all, the precise of an entire series is not always judged by art solely. At one point of watching over 100 series, it's just down right common sense.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Sound/Music - ]\\n\r\nAh yes, this is the main event, if for any reason to watch this series at all, it is this.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and life plays a key role in this series and thus, one could expect the melancholy and drama the music lyrics conveys and delivers. With the ultra talented Yoko Kanno in charge, one can expect a blockbuster hit and smash of the season. And she does not disappoint, neither her skills or the characters' that plays both artistically and beautifully in the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the music in the series plays well, even in rhythm with the main characters. If you take careful notice, the way and style they play their instruments systemically match their art and moments. The way the characters play the music is natural and in the ways they are of themselves, not for a popularity contest. To play music and bring pleasure to the ears is something to respect and take notice of. These kids really do have talent.\\n\\n\r\n[ - Enjoyment - ]\\n\r\nThis story is of the old school coming-of-age style so the pleasure of enjoying this series can vary. At first glance, one might decide to drop or put on-hold at its relative pace as well as its lack of the typical \u201cshounen action\u201d. But with so many of those airing these days (including this season), why not give something new a try? \\n\\n\r\nIt's more than just a high school story of kids falling in painful geometric shapes of love or the \u201cfriendship conquers all\u201d. And of course, despite being hard to make it into the mainstream, it's one of those series that takes an unique and cultural approach of the coming-of-age genre mixing in with jazz music, friendship, and love all in a wonderful little package. The characters are unique and real with their backgrounds, contrasting personalities, and style. The story is easy to follow despite its intertwined arcs. The art (despite plain and simple) brings out the naturalism and culture of the 1960s. It's something not as complicated as the real world we face today because it's so damn right simple. Honestly, I miss it. And who can forget the relaxing music? Without it, this series would be dead. But with it, the series comes to life through realism and gives viewers something to talk about. \\n\\n\r\nAgain for those who are so into the shounen style battles, the fan-service of ecchi shows, or psychological mindfucks, this series can be something new to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all, there's an old saying that goes, \u201clife is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\" And once you open that box, you'll be surprised what you'll find. In this case, it's Kids on the Slope.",

            "content": "I love jazz. Some of my favorite memories of my time living in Florida have to be going downtown to listen to the local jazz festival. Sitting in front of that gazebo and getting into the spirit of the musicians is something you can only experience if you listen to jazz. It\u2019s so different from any other musical genre and I was excited as hell to get to watch an anime centered around this amazing style of music.\r\nThe problem is Sakamichi no Apollon isn\u2019t as much about jazz as it is about lame characters. There\u2019s jazz in the series, and it definitely plays a part,but it doesn\u2019t play as large a part as I wish it would. This seems to be the theme of music-based anime, not paying attention to the music as much as the boring lives of the characters. Jazz is frantic, it changes with the mood. There are a lot of things about jazz that could have been played out in Sakamichi no Apollon that aren\u2019t. That heart and soul of jazz are only seen during the portions where the characters play music. Other than that, the series falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru is a guy. He goes to high school. He\u2019s a bookworm.\\n\\n\r\nSentarou is a guy. He goes to high school. He fights a lot.\\n\\n\r\nRitsuko is a girl. She goes to high school. I can\u2019t discern her character besides \u201clove interest\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nTogether they are the three main characters of our little drama. Kaoru goes to high school as the new kid. He meets Sentarou who is a pretty violent guy who skips classes (the delinquent). Sentarou is a drummer who plays jazz with Ritsuko\u2019s father and a guy named Jun. Kaoru, who can play the piano, joins in on the fun and learns how to evolve from his classical roots into the realm of jazz.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, of course, some bumps on the road. A couple of love triangles (those are the main plague that infest this anime), Sentarou\u2019s problems with his father, and Jun\u2019s becoming a good-for-nothing. The plot is really not that exciting. You\u2019re watching this for the music more than likely, not the duo of love triangles that seem to give way to more of a bromance at the end than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the plot becomes especially painful. The series plot is loose, and by that I mean nothing is consequential or matters. It\u2019s there to hold the series together and give it a reason for being, but it\u2019s mediocre at best. By the end, nothing really matters and the series goes back to square one.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBUT RATCHET! WHAT ABOUT THE MUSIC?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhat music? There\u2019s a little bit of music going around, but for a music based anime there\u2019s not enough. As I said in the beginning of the review, there\u2019s not a lot of music going on. There are a few songs here and there, but not enough to warrant being considered as \u201cmusically focused\u201d. It\u2019s more just a school life anime than anything else and suffers because of the fact it tries to be something it is not.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBUT AT LEAST IS HAS GOOD CHARACTERS!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were generic at best. While Sentarou was a decent character, I grew to hate Kaoru more and more as the series progressed. It reached the pinnacle when he nearly raped Ritsuko. Ritsuko wasn\u2019t a bad character, but she didn\u2019t actually have a lot of character there. She was just there as a love interest and a plot point more so than anything. Jun was okay, but he also had some issues that made him dislikable. His girlfriend, Yurika, was okay.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t really impressed by anything that concerned the plot. I was impressed with some of the music (the little that there was) and the animation was especially good during jam sessions and concerts, unbelievably so.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m unable to say too much about Sakamichi no Apollon because it\u2019s so average. It\u2019s the definition of average. Good music and good animation, mediocre characters and plot, and an overall disappointment. If the series had been longer I feel that perhaps the plot and characters would have been more entertaining. But as it is, Sakamichi no Apollon is merely adequate. The last episode feels especially rushed and I assumed I was meant to feel emotions of some sort, but was left not really caring. And when, by the end, I could care less what happens, then I know that I\u2019m not watching anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is a hesitant pass for me. It\u2019s overhyped, and that hype is probably why you decided to jump on the bandwagon and check this anime out.  There are some qualities that are enjoyable, but taken as a whole, it\u2019s merely adequate in satiating the thirst for jazz, as well as the search for a good music anime.",

            "content": "Okay, the first episode of this wonderful show with tons of potential popped up about an hour ago, and I just had to write a review. (This is my first so cut me some slack, pl0x.)\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that I have been anticipating the airing of this show for a while now, and so far, it has surpassed my expectations. The story begins with our main dude Kaoru who apparently moves around a lot due to his father's job, but I won't get too into that to avoid any accidental spoilers. Instead, let me fill the gaps what you can beexpecting.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the get-go, it goes straight to the opening sequence showing off some of the most vibrant and fluid visuals I have seen to date. The characters are very well drawn, the scenery is just beautiful. and everything just gives off this overall \"jazzy\" atmosphere. When I was around 10 minutes in, I nearly forgot this was part of a show because it was just so polished, I'd expect that sort of quality in a decently budgeted movie.\\n\\n\r\nThe other MAJOR thing this series excels in is the sound. From the voices of the characters to the random chatter, it really immerses you into the environment of that time. If you're looking for some time to kill, hell, even if you have barely any time at all, I suggest you take a peak at this creation, and restore your hope in anime.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is a school drama from 2012. The original manga was written by Kodama Yuki. The anime version was brought to us by MAPPA & Tezuka, neither of which I've seen a lot from. I don't know what to expect from this one at all. So, let's just get right into it. \r\nStory:\r\nOur focus is on Nishimi Kaoru, a bright young student who plays the piano and moves a lot. He's also a complete drama queen, but we'll talk about that later. Nishimi suffers from social anxiety issues and feels the need to get some air on the roof after things take aslightly unanticipated turn. Fortunately for him, he's able to overcome that within about five minutes of meeting Kawabuchi Sentarou. Aren't we all glad that plot point was there? I mean, it contributed so much to the narrative. He and Sentarou wind up becoming friends and playing jazz together while filling the time between sessions with melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nTherein lies the massive underlying problem with the series. Everything has to be overly melodramatic. Dude falls in love after knowing a girl for all of two minutes? Better act like this is super serious and dramatic. Someone gets rejected? Total drama. Sentarou might play... rock music with a band made up of their class mates? This is clearly the most important disaster in history. Don't even pretend that worse things have happened. Although, in all fairness, the series actually acknowledges that that one is childish. To exacerbate things, however, the vast majority of these \u201chyper, ultra dramatic situations\u201d get resolved, at least to a satisfactory degree, in the next episode. Probably would've worked better with fewer sources of drama that were ongoing. \\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, teenagers can be overly dramatic about stupid things but watching teenagers be overly dramatic about stupid things is really annoying. Especially when the narrative treats it like it's super serious. This shite isn't serious, it's dumb teenagers being drama queens. So, when two things that are actually serious happen in the last couple episodes they just don't have much weight. Especially when one, an injury, gets resolved in less than five minutes. The romance is honestly where it's at its worst. We start with a ridiculous situation where one dude likes a girl, she likes another guy, he likes a different girl and she likes this other guy. From there, we get a lot of overblown angst and aggravation because we can't pummel these wankers. \\n\\n\r\nThe only good parts of the series are the jazz jam sessions where the characters are just enjoying themselves for once. Unfortunately, these scenes are vastly outweighed by the scenes where drama is happening over something that really doesn't matter. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are reminiscent of the worst people you knew in secondary school. You know the ones. They treat everything that's remotely upsetting to them as an unmitigated disaster. Then they get mad at you because you openly don't care and won't even remotely validate them. Kaoru is the worst about it, putting distance between himself and his friends on multiple occasions but always for petty reasons. Kodama, you do know that introverts don't have those kinds of rifts just because we're socially awkward and need to limit our time around people, right? Usually we just excuse ourselves from an event or don't go out for a while when we need time alone. And, trust me on this one, your friends will understand if you just tell them \u201cHey, I need some time alone. Can you try calling back tomorrow?\u201d Yes, even in High school. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is one positive the series has going for it. The backgrounds are well detailed and look quite nice. The characters are drawn well. The animation is nice and smooth. So, I'll give them full credit on that one. They may not have produced something with a compelling narrative or tolerable characters but they made what they had look pretty. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is passable enough. Our main cast is made up of Hosoya Yoshimasa (Reiner Braun), Kimura Ryouhei (Sorey) & Nanri Yuuka (Takakura Erika). Their performances here are perfectly fine. The music is pretty good, mostly. I won't pretend that I cared for the theme tune and its whiny sounding singing but the jazz is good.  Kanno Yoko's soundtrack in general works nicely. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little bit. Kaouru goes off on a tangent about how handsome Sentarou is at one point. And Sentarou calls him an angel at another. Bad dialogue writing or unexplored sexual tension, you make the call. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the basics, the artwork, music and acting, Sakamichi no Apollon does just fine for itself. Unfortunately, it doesn't do so well in terms of the main content. The characters are overly melodramatic to the point of being quite obnoxious a lot of the time. The narrative is a lot of annoying, all too easily resolved melodrama with the occasional good jazz session thrown in. All factors considered, it's kind of a bad series. Although you might enjoy it if you like that High school melodrama. For myself, I lost all patience for that while I was still in High school and watching this was, more often than not, an irritation. So, for myself, I give it a 3/10. Next week I'll look at Wizardry.",

            "content": "First of all, I must say it's been a while since I've enjoyed a series as much as I enjoyed Sakamichi no Apollon.\r\nThe story itself has an amazing pace, and in my opinion, has the perfect combination of romance, drama and music. The developments feel very natural and there are no fillers. The only \"complain\" I can have from the story is that the ending might feel a little unsatisfying. Luckily, if you end up feeling unsatisfied like me, you can read the extra volume from the manga and I can assure you that you'll feel a lot better after reading it.\r\nThe art is okay,I guess. It has a very realistic vibe, and fits the story really well. I didn't see any error in the animation either, which is always appreciated. Also, the animation during the musical scenes was particularly good. The soundtrack fits every scene perfectly, so kudos to the studio. It is always nice to have consistently good animation as well as a good soundtrack throughout a whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main characters in the series, and they are best friends even though they make an odd couple. I feel that the two main characters are really well developed. You can see how the two of them grow up as characters as the story moves on. On the other hand, except for one specific character, most secondary characters don't get a proper development. I mention this because there are a couple of secondary characters that I'm sure most viewers would've loved for them to have more screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThe series in general is very enjoyable. If you're into jazz music (or good music in general), you're definitely gonna love watching this series. Also, this is one of the few anime where the English singing is actually pretty good. I had a really good time listening to every single music piece played, as well as with the tons of drama generated from the different love situations that develop.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the series an 8/10. I loved it, but I felt there were some things that could've been told better, especially the ending. I recommend this series a 100%. Actually, I'd say this is a must watch series. Also, don't forget to read the extra volume from the manga once you finish the series. \\n\\n\r\nHave a great time watching Sakamichi no Apollon!",

Got tired of all that shounen crap some time ago.\r\nWell, what can I say, there is a certain beauty about this anime.\r\nThe story: Certainly the cliched motifs of love triangles and rectangles and all the overused dynamics are in there BUT I was shocked to find that I actually enjoyed everything quite well.\r\nFor one, the relationships have much verisimilitude and show a more inexplicable human aspect rather than the KISS THAT SOLVES IT ALL type stuff. The thing with Sentaro, Yurika, and Jun-ni is definitely a BIG PLUS to the RitsukoNishimi main plot. It's not just a side dish romance to make sure everyone's got their love life covered. It's a deep human experience full of inexplicable emotions and time that is needed for love to blossom. \\n\\n\r\n(Ahhh.... I'm sounding like a josei fan now. Ok maybe I am becoming one.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: Ehhh Nishimi was one of those new student stereotypes played out in many other animes but he's still good. The true striker with this anime is that the character's backgrounds are revealed in a very subtle way... It's not full of lengthy flashbacks and background story time-wasters... Sakamichi really does well in that it delves into each character's past and background as the anime progresses in a not in your face manner. The inexplicable actions of Ritsuko, the Yurika Jun-ni sub-plot ahhh it's beautiful. Apart from the jazz of Ritsuko's basement, there is a quiet beauty that speaks to the heart in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: This is one anime where music speaks louder than words a lot of times. Jazz is such a freeform expression and I'm not a big fan of it but it is done so well. It's Nishimi's language of love, remorse, each clash on the cymbal is Sentaro's inner pain and struggles released. Jun-ni's trumpet arpeggios are too good. Not to mention Mukae san's upbeat bass.\\n\\n\r\nVoice: It's solid and good work. Ritsuko's voice can get annoying but it has it's charm  But the music overshadows it IMO.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You'll be surprised. I'm a guy and I connected from the first episode. It's strangely good. I don't know exactly how to explain it. But aside from the jazzy improvisations and sounds there is a quiet beauty to this anime. go watch it now.\\n",

            "content": "As someone who hasn't good much background on both Jazz music and Japan during the 1960s, I was wary of watching it at first.\r\nAnd yet it succeeds in its combination of josei, drama and high school slice of life. The show features Kaoru, the socially-anxious new kid in a quiet, rather remote town, who has been blessed with piano-playing skills. Through jazz, he finds the greatest of comrades, a family and even romance. \r\nThe story, as most josei goes, isn't anything too intense. It just shows the life of a jazz-playing boy as he goes through high school with his friends. I love, though, itstake on that part of life. It's so realistic, I managed to relate to it despite the fact that I wasn't even part of band back in high school. The series starts as strongly and ends, if possible, even more.\\n\\n\r\nRomance and melodrama is thrown here and there, and while it wasn't its strongest point, it just felt very REAL. I've been there, through all the confusion and inability to communicate feelings. At times I found myself wondering if it's odd for me to be able to relate so much to Japanese highschoolers in the 1960s when it's 2013 and I live in the Philippines.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the story is rather relaxed, as there really isn't much going on. But that's fine as you obviously wouldn't be looking for action here (it's an anime about high school jazz-players for chrissake). The leisurely pace it has is very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all well-rounded. It makes use of archetypes but never just relies on it. Everyone feels amazingly real. It also helps that there is a very limited cast of characters and they were all given time to develop. They all have layers to them and are much much more than what can be considered their outer personality. Everyone is likable and unlikable in their own ways, just like everyone is. Another thing that I like is that there are quirks as easter eggs placed everywhere that they didn't feel the need to put out in the open, such as the fact that Sen is left-handed (I took note of this when they are studying for his make-up test!).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather... vintage. At times I wasn't particularly fond of it-- it sometimes came off as someone who just recently discovered the gradient and smudge tool on Photoshop-- but it did manage to set the tone for the show. It can come off as plain but it worked. It gave off a nostalgic vibe from which the show benefited greatly. The backgrounds at times, like when it showed the church or Kaoru's house, were exceptional. I wonder if it was rotoscoped because it looked so amazing. How I wish they could have kept it constant all through out though. Wonderful lighting direction was present all throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou would expect music to be the strongest part but I wouldn't say so. It was fine, but not exceptional. The opening and ending themes were rather disappointing for a music anime but it wasn't horrible. Just not what I had in mind, I guess. The choice of music was good for the most part, making use of various jazz artists and the Beatles to make it feel more like the 60s. The jam sessions scenes were amazing, obviously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a simple show with solid character and story development, with good music and pretty art, then this show is for you. It is extremely well-made, a perfect example of a josei anime done properly. The ending didn't leave me disappointed which was what I expected at the first sign of the love polygon. It's worth a shot, at any rate, if you want a break from all the heavy action and overly cheesy harem animes.",

            "content": "Are you ready for a bromance so strong, you\u2019ll feel friendship tingles down the shaft of your peen? For romance elements so complex, they are no longer love triangles--but instead, terrifying, ever-growing love polygons of doom? For jam sessions so boppin\u2019 they could make the late, great, Sun Ra tap his foot in his grave? Then my friend, you are prepared for Kids on the Slope.\r\nAt a glance Kids on the Slope is nothing more than a high school drama, akin to the hundreds which flood contemporary media. While I\u2019ll admit that I do enjoy a show that makes me feel my proverbial ovaries rubbingagainst each other (it\u2019s a guilty pleasure of sorts that I\u2019ve acquired over the years) as well as the occasional bitch-tear from some of the more well put together dramas/slice-of-lifes that catch my eye, I often find the angst ridden filth which is commonly regarded as \u2018adolescence in a nutshell\u2019 to be utterly vexatious. \\n\\n\r\nWhile easily misinterpreted as complaining, I do understand that I\u2019m not a member of the target demographic for at least 90% of the series\u2019 mentioned above and as a result of this I just tend to walk past that hypothetical garden of pubescent depression as opposed to trampling upon it and it\u2019s eternally cherished flowers, despite people\u2019s affection towards them being baffling to a man such as myself. With that being said, I\u2019m also not a part of the target demographic for Kids on the Slope but that does not mean that I was unable to enjoy the fuck out of it. To put it bluntly, this is, at the moment, my favourite slice-of-life anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how could it not be? Set in the quiescent period of 1960s Japan, with a serene art-style and ataractic soundtrack, I often found myself lost in a sense of euphoria. While the pacing at first may seem quite slow, I believe that this is part of the series\u2019 charm and works well to accentuate the insouciant nature of both the series and the era in which it\u2019s set.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying its unmatched poise is the maturity (I\u2019m sorry guys, but this translates to no prolonged gratuitous ass/panty/cleavage shots, unfortunately) in which the story is presented and a great set of characters. Not only could I compare almost every character to someone I\u2019ve met in in the course of my life, I was also able to relate certain elements of each character\u2019s personality to myself. Similarly, no character was your average cardboard cutout. Instead, each and every character had a very human feeling associated with them. Over the course of this journey, we\u2019ll observe each of the main character\u2019s flaws, attributes and eventual evolution into adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise for this slice-of-life drama was also quite refreshing, in the sense that the relationship which receives the most limelight is that of two males as opposed to a primarily romantic relationship. This unlikely bond between Sentarou and Richie will oftentimes amaze me when I think that this is the first bro-drama of it\u2019s kind to cross my path. While for the most part, their friendship does reflect that of a lot of close friends; do expect some moments which gracefully tread the thin line between bromance and romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series really is admirable, and this is most evident during the jam sessions. While concert performances and the like are no new occurrence in anime (especially as of late), in Kids on the Slope every drum hit, every piano note, every pluck of the upright double bass happens in time with the music and looks magnificent. The accurate animation of the instruments really helps bring home the notion that the musically orientated segments of this anime are not a gimmick but rather, help bring the characters together as a group while at the same time aids the characters in growing as individuals--as I daresay music does in everyone\u2019s lives. \\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who feel as if you\u2019re the paragon of masculinity but may want to try a slice-of-life, then look no further (there are multiple physical altercations in this anime, which is why I believe it\u2019s a great starting point for those new to the genre). Similarly, those who merely enjoy jazz but find the genre a bit too intimidating to delve into will find some great artists and songs to add to your essential private shower performance repertoire. All in all, this anime is heartwarming, bitch-tear inducing and a must watch for any and all anime fans.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR? This may be a josei. However, it is a bro-tastic josei which can be enjoyed by anyone. I give this anime a 10/10 and while this is a highly subjective score, this anime objectifies everything I'm seeking when I make the infrequent trip to tear-jerker town. Its stylish aesthetic coupled with its awe-inspiring soundtrack serve to create arguably one of the best slice-of-life experiences I could imagine.",

            "content": "I saw this released awhile ago and never even tried episode one because it looked kinda boring to me. I gave it another shot and I already instantly started liking it.\r\nThe animation is really freakin' good, it is a 12 episode kinda show so I do expect really good animation, and this doesn't hold back. Whenever they play instruments, the animation looks smooth and solid and you can see them hitting the right keys and toms, no made up sounds. It is really hard to animate playing music (a lot of animes take shortcuts and show flashbacks to reduce animation time spent on playing) butwhenever they play, they never take shortcuts and go all out.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, I was speculating if I got trapped in another boy-love show, but I was safe because in episode one he already starts falling for a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls in this show aren't that attractive, but whatever, they grow on you and find their charm. (I point this out because anime industry made it so every woman has to be attractive so it is good to clarify if some watchers would be put off from this, which they shouldn't)\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a drama, you will see slapping, punching, crying, etc. which is in my zone, but it isn't OVER dramatic... More like chill dramatic.\\n\\n\r\n Love has a high point in this anime, but friendship totally overrides it in this one. It shows true bro-ship into the end.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters, the glasses-kun is actually a main character and I dig it when he realizes instantly if he does something retarded or stupid. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is top-notch, obviously because this is an anime about playing jazz. Made me respect jazz a lot more than I did before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-wise, I dig it and made me smile couple times, didn't make me cry or anything but it had its moments. It was good enough to marathon with no regrets.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending (whether good or bad, no spoils) was a good one, I get mad at dramas when they don't show an aftermath, and this totally has an aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it 8.5/10 or 8/10",

            "content": "The story consists of a lot of romance tropes, and really tends to play up it's character drama. I didn't enjoy the romance stuff very much, but I feel like the show worked remarkably well in portraying the tension of the relationship between characters through music. When the characters are playing music together, you really can feel their emotions come through, and I thought that was really impressive. The characters, and their interactions with each other were really the best part of the story, despite the otherwise pretty boilerplate storyline.\r\nThe art was very nice as well. Everything had a very detailed, realistic look to itand there was a lot of really impressive animation as well. Things moved really fluidly in most cases, especially when the characters are playing their instruments, and really getting into it. Lighting and colors are used really effectively, too, and it sets a great mood. The only thing I didn't like about the art was the character design. Most of the characters appearances were kind of standard and uninteresting. The designs fit their personalities well, but there just isn't much visual appeal to the way they look. Taken at face value, they just end up looking like very generic anime characters, despite being more than that once you factor in the writing & their actual character depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic, Yoko Kanno does a fantastic job of re-creating these classic jazz tracks, and the whole show just has an incredible tone to it because of this. The music is the heart of this show, for sure, and it's what I feel really makes the show something special, and pushes it from \"above average\" into \"really good\". I watched it in Japanese, and the voice acting is also very well done. The actors have realistic, convincing performances that accurately portray their characters. Nothing sounds cheesy or over-acted, and it adds to the realism of the show. The overall mix of the audio is also professionally done, and the whole show just sounds great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kids on the Slope doesn't have much at it's core. The story or characters don't seem very interesting at first, and both are full of tropes. However, with some very nice presentation, and some quality writing, the characters actually become somewhat more interesting. couple that with some impressive art, and some fantastic, atmospheric jazz music, and what you're left with is a truly enjoyable show that surprisingly ends up being more than the sum of it's parts.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review here and I tried my hardest to leave out any real spoilers. So, here we go:\r\nSakamichi no Apollon started out with a powerful episode and ended with a powerful episode, but seemed to get lost in a tangle of badly handled and clich\u00e9d romance and some unneeded melodrama. The series also suffered from bad pacing, though that only really started to show itself toward the middle-end of the run, this was when the fast pacing became a double edged sword and affected not only the plot, but the characters as well.\r\nSo now, let me look at thecharacters: I liked all of them individually a whole lot with the exception of Kaoru and one other character I will bring up later. He was a bit annoying and frustrating as a main character (he also did quite a few things that I would label as right out jerk-ish), but he was still very realistic and better than the usual generic main lead guy. Nevertheless, I felt that his best sides came out when he was hanging out with the other characters as friends.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is when the fast pacing comes it, it may have made the usual love triangle melodrama less prolonged and annoying, but at the same time it really didn\u2019t allow me to see any of the romantic relationships build up. There was no good transitions from acquaintances to friends to lovers.  It made it very difficult for me to care about the relationships found within this series.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of relationships, the characters themselves suffered from the fast pacing. It made it hard for me to really connect to them, since I saw realistic characters, but I never really saw them evolve. They stayed within their character types and never really moved above and beyond them in any real significant way. Kaoru got some character development, but not as much as some other main characters have gotten this season. And the two other characters that got the most character development were side characters whose subplot gets rushed and they are gone before I could even really fully appreciate them.\\n\\n\r\nTwo other things that bothered me a bit in this anime was that one \u201caccidently walked into the bathroom\u201d scene, which was handled better than most of those types of fanservice scenes are, but felt like something that was unfitting for the type of series Sakamichi no Apollon was; the same goes for the character of Seiji Matsuoka. Generally I am usually fond of characters who are like him, but here he just felt so out of place, not only for the series but for the time period as well.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of these negative aspects of the series, Sakamichi no Apollon does have some extremely well done and beautiful parts too. First and foremost, the music is fantastic and it is utilized perfectly. The animation is also lovely and the art style is very nice to look at in general, especially when the jazz scenes are on screen. Next, when the series focused on aspects other than romance it tended to be very powerful. There was also the added aspect of Christianity, being portrayed accurately (at least in Japan and in comparison to other anime) and the fact that accents were kept in were great, too, since it really helped to make the anime feel like it wasn\u2019t taking place in Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThese other issues that I mentioned above were all really great to see in an anime, but sadly they got pushed aside or brushed over quickly in favor of the romance, the time restraint and pacing didn\u2019t help either. These issues came up and then passed so quickly that I didn\u2019t even have time to properly digest them before they were already done and over. \\n\\n\r\nThis bugged me a bit, that romance got so much attention, when one of the themes of the series itself is that friendship is more powerful and important than that of a love affair, yet love affairs are what take up most of the series. Nevertheless, the ending scenes of this anime are still very powerful. This series didn't have the strongest or most fulfilling ending of the spring season, but it was still very poignant and on level with the first episode when it comes to impact.\\n\\n\r\nAs it stands, Sakamichi no Apollon is a perfect anime to watch with someone who normally doesn\u2019t watch anime, since many of the usual things that make anime seem \u201cweird\u201d are not present. It is also a very well done and solid teenage romance drama, but it is still just that: a teenage romance drama. I thought it was going to focus more on the jazz and music aspects (and I actually thought I was not going to like it because of that, but in the end that was one of the strongest parts of the series), but then it divulged into the romantic aspect more than I thought it was going to. \\n\\n\r\nThis series was good, but not great, and I am actually a bit disappointed by that.",

            "content": "This was an anime that popped up in my recommendations for a while based off various other's I watched.  I simply didn't believe it would be anything close to what I wanted and became frustrated seeing the same cover page over and over of which I wasn't to fond of.  I refused to watch it time and time again based on my own superficial reasons until I finally said to myself \"it's 20 minutes of my life, I'll watch just one episode.\"  It wasn't just 20 minutes, it ended up being a good portion of the season before I had to finallyget some sleep.\\n\\n\r\nStory-  The story of Sakamichi no Apollon is one of the strongest I've ever seen in only 12 episodes.  It gives a great back story as to why the main character (Kaoru) is where he is now and immerses you in the time frame of the story immediately.  Although it's in the 60's and I was very skeptical of such a time frame, it's essential for the jazz fueled story of friendship that takes place.  The story is truly touching and special as it addresses the great value of a deep bond of friendship as well as coming of age into your own person.  There's certainly romance as well, although the most prevalent romance lies not with the main characters but with two supporting ones who in truth, really have their own amazing chemistry and story unfolding.  This was one of the few plots that kept me invested, thinking and connected to everything happening at all times, it made you feel really heavy and then full of joy the next episode because of how much meaning the plot held.\\n\\n\r\nArt-  The art I was sorely mistaken on.  I went in thinking for some reason it was going to have outdated animation purely because it was based in the 60's.  In reality it was great quality animation, though I can't really pick out any instance where I was amazed by its creativity or colors.  It does what it needs to do in this anime and depicts the time period of the 60's amazingly well, although it wasn't the brightest of times in Japan so I can see why it wasn't trying to be something it wasn't.  The best part is the character designs as they're all crisp and perfectly fit their respective personalities.  All in all the art compliments the story really well, but it's nothing to really to gaze at in itself. \\n\\n\r\nSound-  This is what makes the anime other than the plot.  I'll come right out and say it, I just couldn't handle jazz before, it didn't please my ears you could say.  However, the second I heard Sentarou and Kaoru's first jam session together I was not only moved at how this music brought together the two most unlikely friends, it really gave me a new outlook on the music.  Jazz is the driving force of this anime and this is easily the most important section of the review as there are so many situations that these characters must get through with their music.  They even communicate with each other simply by being in the same room and playing their improv jazz, pouring out all their emotions to each other in instrumental song.   For anyone who hates jazz, this show will at the very least make you tolerate it, they bring meaning to the genre for people who don't care about it in the least.  Not to mention the theme song is the most fitting I've ever heard and the soundtrack is really something so unique and beautiful it needs to be experienced.  I can rant on about how great the sound is for an entire review's length so I'll leave it at this.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  The characters are very well developed especially for a series that only spans 12 episodes.  All of the main characters are very different but they all become bound by one similar interest in Jazz.  While the typical delinquent meeting the quiet exchange student has been done before, both of these characters are far from common beneath the surface.  Sentarou is one of the deepest characters in any show, and you can tell this almost right after meeting him, he had a feel to him that compelled you to be drawn to his story as well as the pure friendship between him and Kaoru.  The seiyuu really bring these characters to life and add a great sense of realism to them to.  Even the supporting characters play vital roles and all help the main characters along in their own way, as well as progressing their own stories in the time they have.  What can be said overall is that there is not one annoying character or overly common one either.  Every single character whether it be main or supporting has their own unique personality and goals that sets them all apart yet binds them together and that's what I find so impressive about the,.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  As you can all tell I thoroughly enjoyed this anime.  It truly impacted me on a few different levels and really makes you think because there are so many real situations and desires you can relate to, despite it taking place in 1966.  It just goes to show you that no matter the time or place, people will always have these issues to go through, and this show goes to show you how valuable having a deeply bonded friendship can be through that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  I highly recommend this to anyone who has even a slight interest in romance/comedy/drama/slice of life or even music.  People who actually go into this liking Jazz beforehand will be on cloud 9 the entire way through.  It drives home a message that I believe resonates with the majority that it will definitely leave you thinking deeply about it after you've finished.  The only reason I did not give it a ten is because (and this is nitpicking now) even with these wonderful aspects I just couldn't put it on the same level as Steins;Gate, Honey and Clover, or Bakemonogatari.  That being said it's extremely close to Honey and Clover, however H+C had amazing art while Sakamichi no Apollon had enough to convey its message.",

            "content": "Once again we are encountering a great anime. Kids on the slope is another combo between Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno. I can't imagine now if someone else did a screen version of Kids on the slope. But lets get to the point.\r\nThe story focuses around Kaoru, who is your normal geek, straight up alone and unexperienced when it comes to real life. He loves studying and playing on instruments. Because of that he apparently can't fight and stand by himself, and this is where another character is introduced to help Kaoru. Sentarou on the other hand is your typical badass character, who doesn't givea shit about studying and can stand by himself. Both of them become friends and this is where things get interesting. For the whole 12 episodes we are watching how these two are growing on their friendship and how they deal with their problems. Kaoru is in love with Ritsuko, but Ritsuko isn't. She loves Sentarou. Yes, it creates a love triangle, but its so well done you won't be dissapointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is just amazing, not only its crispy looking, but the ACTUAL MOVES of the characters when it comes to playing drums and piano is animated. Yes, you can learn from it if you pay enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound doesn't need introduction, cmon guys its Yoko Kanno and the famous piece they play at the end of the anime is called Moanin, a jazz classic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are alive and never feel undeveloped or unoriginal. Every character is likeable and differ one from another, which doesn't make this series boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this a great addition to anyones list and should be seen imediately. I enjoyed it and wanted more, srsly. If it wasn't for shows like this, i wouldn't even watch anime in the first place.",

            "content": "It\u2019s not gay if it\u2019s a three way.  \r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free. \r\nJokes aside, looking at the surface of Kids on the Slope, one might think that it is a just another music SOL anime such as K-On! or Tari Tari.  After all, each of these series is about a number of high school students living out their normal lives, all brought together by music.  Look a bit deeper however, and you will see that Kids on the Slope, directed by the famous Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, is a totally different entity entirely. \r\nStory -7/10\\n\\n\r\nKids on a Slope is set in 1960s Japan, a time when American Jazz was a powerful part of Japan\u2019s musical culture.  During this time, an unlikely group of students gather together, united by this one common interest.  From here their story unfolds, and in some ways the anime changes form entirely; for at its heart, Kids on a Slope is not a SOL.  It is, in fact, a romance through and through.\\n\\n\r\nThe series often forgoes the focus on jazz that it presents in the first episodes of the series to focus on the relationships between the characters.  That\u2019s not to say that the viewer isn\u2019t treated to frequent jam sessions throughout the series, but it becomes obvious that the character\u2019s connections are now the main point of the series.  I\u2019ll go into this a bit more later.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the setting goes, it\u2019s pretty easy to forget that you are in 1960s Japan.  There are indications, of course; mainly music references, but also the cars, record players, etc.  However, the series uses its setting almost entirely for the music, and I feel a bit of potential is lost where it could have brought out a bit more character of the era. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the show is well above average.  Gradients are used to great effect, and shadows on the characters faces and backgrounds show great attention to detail.  Character designs are unique, perhaps even polarizing.  While the character designs are well done, the backgrounds can be a bit plain, and the frequently revisited areas are disappointingly plain.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation itself is beautiful.  Everything is very fluid, especially the scenes in which instruments are played.  The level of detail during these scenes is absolutely fantastic, but it makes me wish they would have used a bit of the animation budget on more detailed sets. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite my insistence that this is a romance anime at heart, that doesn\u2019t mean that a huge amount of attention went towards the music.  Famous jazz makes up the majority of the music focused scenes, and this is where Kids on a Slope truly shines.  However, its original soundtrack is average at best, relying on popular music of the time to keep the viewer entertained.  Aside from the jazz, early rock begins to make its way into Japan (and therefore the series) as well, and becomes a source of contention among the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKids on a Slope has a main cast of three characters: Sentarou, Ritsuko, and Kaoru.  Sentarou and Ritsuko are childhood friends, with Kaoru having started attending the same school as them.  Being new and rich, he quickly finds himself a social outcast.  However, when looking for the key to the roof, he finds himself getting along strangely well with the short-tempered Sentarou.  When Kaoru reveals he is a classical pianist, they find themselves playing jazz together often.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Kaoru soon develops feelings for the overly kind Ritsuko, who is the embodiment of indecisiveness when it comes to her feelings.  The relationship between them, with the complication of Ritsuko\u2019s maybe-not-so-sure feelings for Sentarou, makes up the vast majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is more of the same.  Yurika, a brief love interest of Sentarou\u2019s, finds herself involved with Junichi, an older friend of Sentarou\u2019s, and her life begins to change as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag, really.  In one respect, the indecisiveness when it comes to romantic feelings in the teenage years is accurately portrayed, and the characters realistic and likable.  On the other hand, this indecisiveness and the classic \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d starts to get old after some time, and I found Yurika and Junichi\u2019s relationship a bit exhausting.  Your enjoyment of the characters in this series will largely depend on how well you can handle the usual tropes that comes with a romantic anime.  A surprising level of backstory is given for relevant characters in a series of this length.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you go into this series expecting a light-hearted comedy with a music focus, you may be disappointed.  What it does present is a slow romance with a musical base drawing the characters together.  A nice collection of jazz music, good animation, and a solid romance between the main cast was all tied up together nicely for a twelve episode series. \\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nSome say there may be some gay undertones between the two male leads.  I didn\u2019t really see this, but it is Josei after all, so men aren\u2019t at their manliest. \\n",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon (or Kids on The Slope) is like a breath of fresh air from recent anime developments and definitely stands out from the rest. I don't think a show could have impressed me this much just by watching the first episode, and it left me with a better feeling than any anime I've ever watched ever has.\r\nThe animation is super unique as well, and far different from the cutsie pop-art style that's used so often to the point where you can't tell one anime from another. To summarize it briefly, it's the summer of 1966, and a really reserved kid named Kaoru Nishimitransfers from Yokosuka to Kyushu to a new school. I can't say too much without giving it away, but rather than the typical slice-of-life type of show, this story is pretty damn quality and unorthodox. I can't say much in this review, because everything basically starts in the first episode and doesn't wait too long to get into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing you should know is that it's really music-centered. Specifically jazz-centered. If that's not your thing, turn back now. The OST is all jazz, the characters play jazz. The aspect of love is also explored as an underlying theme in this anime, and complicates things a bit, but that's all I'm going to say. Needless to say, I'm super excited about this anime and it's getting in the way of this review and I should wait to do it, but what the Hell.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main characters are very ordinary looking. Apart from a few distinctions like glasses or a scar, they look like anybody you'd see on the street. You're not going to get any ridiculous hairstyles or clothes. They're also relatable and well-writen as actual human beings. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to spend much more time on this. But I really suggest you watch it. This anime is just so extremely quality.",

            "content": "Set in 1966, Sakamichi no Apollon is centered on Kaoru Nishimi as he moves to Sasebo to live with relatives due to his father\u2019s job. Naturally, he\u2019s a loner, a great student, and completely isolated from people since he\u2019s always been moving around; he doesn't try to get attached to people in case he must leave them again. But there\u2019s something in the air in Sasebo, and it\u2019s not just love or friendship, it\u2019s a new sound (to Japan at least) known as jazz. Music isn't new to Kaoru as he\u2019s a classically trained pianist, but jazz is certainly new and interesting to him, asit takes him some time to \u2018get it\u2019. All the while he\u2019s studying school and jazz, he\u2019s also developing a social life with the school bad boy Sentarou, and his friend Ritsuko. Not breaking trope norms, Sentarou isn't a brute as his size implies, he\u2019s actually a kind-hearted, caring young man. Ritsuko is in love with Sentarou, which obviously causes problems with Kaoru, as he loves Ritsuko. I know, I know, love stories and slice of life series are not usually my thing. I don\u2019t often go for the dramas and similar ideas, but Sakamichi no Apollon does it so well, in every episode, that it\u2019s hard to step away.\\n\\n\r\nWatanabe\u2019s direction, storytelling, and pacing are just so excellent, and there\u2019s rarely a dull moment in the entire 12 episode run. Everything is well planned out, and leads to a satisfying climax. There are a few moments and questionable plot devices that get thrown in near the end that aren't really for the best, but looking back, they weren't too pivotal and quickly forgotten anyway. Sakamichi no Apollon is a strong long at not only a new sound in Japan, but religion in Japan also. Something rarely discussed or mentioned in many of the series I\u2019ve seen; at least, something besides Buddhism or Shintoism. Sentarou and Ritsuko are both devoted Catholics, and while it\u2019s not impossible for Kaoru to understand this, it is still a little bewildering for him. It\u2019s never the focus of the main story, and there are a handful of moments about it, so it\u2019s never force-fed or heavy-handed, but it\u2019s still a prevalent component to Sentarou and Ritsuko\u2019s characters. The series starts to show some weakness just before the finale, but it quickly pulls itself together by the end to produce an ending that\u2019s not to be ranked \u2018one of the best, or most original, but it\u2019s satisfying and gives nice closure to the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nNow accompanying every scene and poignant moment, Watanabe got the best Japan has to offer in the composition department and tasked Yoko Kanno in the role of handling it. And she absolutely killed it in the end. Sakamichi no Apollon\u2019s soundtrack is gripping, but subtle, aware, but hidden. It\u2019s all there, and even when you do not want it to, it will knock on the door to your feelings and come inside and affect everything found within. There are perhaps a few tracks that may seem out of place due to their sound Rosario is one that stands out for me), but they\u2019re still exceptional tracks and they help make the scenes they\u2019re used in so much more powerful. Yoko Kanno and the team she collaborated with to not only make the tracks for scenes, but for the jazz pieces too; they\u2019re incredible. I usually don\u2019t care for jazz, in fact, I really don\u2019t like it, but this series, and the sounds and implementations of it, made me care (at least while watching the series). Yoko Kanno has always been on point with her soundtracks, and Sakamichi no Apollon ranks up there as another glorified treat for fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnother feast for the senses comes from the animation teams over at MAPPA and Tezuka Productions and their brilliant (and likely expensive) use of rotoscoping to animate several scenes in Sakamichi no Apollon. Rotoscoping is the process of tracing over live-action footage, then animating it for a more fluid, life-like presentation. A lot of Disney films used this over the years, and a few anime studios have done so too, but it\u2019s a time-intensive and expensive process, so very few studios will opt-in to using it. For Sakamichi no Apollon though, it works, because the minute details of keys strikes, drum patterns, and plucking of the bass matters, and with the help of this animation style, they nail it. It\u2019s used sparingly, and in other instances when not overtly necessary, but its uses never distract or hinder the rest of the show. Rotoscoping is truly a treat for the eyes, and I wish more animation were still done this way, because it invokes a natural, almost realistic production that pulls me in more.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is still relatively new to the anime a few years to see if it stands out as one of Watanabe\u2019s best, or sit on the shelves as just another series that exists. If you\u2019ve read this far already, you\u2019ll know what I think: you should be watching Sakamichi no Apollon. It\u2019s likely unlike anything you've seen if you\u2019ve never delved into romance or coming-of-age series, but it is well worth the venture.",

            "content": "When anime fans see the name Shinichiro Watanabe attached to an anime they usually get excited due to his excellent work making Cowboy Bebop. So going into Sakamichi no Apollon there is a certain expectation given to the show. Unlike Watanabe's previous animes, this one does not have any action in it at all. Instead, the focus is on romance and drama.\r\nSakamichi no Apollon captures the setting of 1966 Japan well from the classroom to the clothes the characters wear to the style of music that is played. The backdrop for the story is great and unique as it is very rare to ever seean anime based on 60s Japan and jazz. However, while the setting may be unique, the story itself isn't. The romance is cilched with the usual misunderstandings, melodrama and love triangles. This detracts from the quality of the show as the romance becomes the focus of the plot. Nevertheless, Sakamichi no Apollon portrays the tension and emotion involved with love triangles well.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show is the jazz and music. With Yoko Kanno in charge of the soundtrack, it is expected that it will be high quality and she delivers in every way. Not only is the score great to amplify the emotion and tension in scenes, it also delivers when the characters are playing jazz together. This is what holds the show together. The scenes where the characters are in the basement playing their instruments not only entertains due to the high quality of the music, but gives a great insight to the characters as their emotions are connected to the music they play. It is here where we see the bonds between the characters grow and it is through music that the characters heal their wounds. The opening theme is excellent and sets the tone well while the ending theme seemed a bit out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is also a high point of the show. With a slightly older style of character design, the art style helps immerse the viewer into the 60s. The animation is fluid, especially during the music playing scenes as the anime is very accurate in showing each note played by the characters. There is also no fan service at all which for me is a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nThe downfall for Sakamichi no Apollon is the protagonist, Kaoru. In the early episodes where there was more comedy, it was more enjoyable to watch as Kaoru's internal struggles are countered by the antics of Sentaro. However once the anime changes focus to the romance, there is far less comedy making Kaoru difficult to watch. In most scenes he can be rude, selfish or melodramatic, and with no comedy to counter it, the audience isn't left with much to enjoy when he is on screen. The other characters are much more well rounded and entertaining. Their growth is more visible and their flaws were realistic. Perhaps this may be simply because their inner thoughts are rarely verbalised, unlike Kaoru who is usually repeating the same thoughts of self doubt and pain. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this may seem like a negative review of Sakamichi no Apollon, it shouldn't be taken that way as there is a lot to enjoy. There are no filler episodes, the story is concise and the music is wonderful. The ending is perhaps a bit rushed, but that seems to be a case of there only being 12 episodes. Nevertheless, this anime is easily accessible for anyone, anime fan or not. The series may not be the most memorable, but it is worth a watch, even just to experience the nostalgic feeling of change during high school.",

            "content": "How much you enjoy Sakamichi no Apollon is largely dependent on your level of emotional maturity.\r\nSPOILER-FREE\u2122\r\nSakamichi no Apollon translates to \u201cApollo of the slope,\u201d not \u201cKids on the Slope,\u201d so whatever translation you want to use really doesn\u2019t matter. Kids on a Slope may look on the surface like a typical clich\u00e9d romance anime with lots of misunderstandings, too much drama, love polygons and people sort-of-but-not-really changing who they love. You may be tempted to think that\u2019s all Adolescents on an Incline is, and you should give in to that temptation because that\u2019s exactly what it is.\r\nJuveniles on a Slant, by the way, is totallyNOT GAY. It\u2019s completely normal for male friends to hold hands, embrace each other crying, run out of school together, eat out of each other\u2019s hands and the like. At least I hope so because me and my roommate may have had a small sexual encounter the other day so PLOT POINT: my childhood friend who I secretly love read that and is now crying so I headed over to her house but PLOT POINT: my father who I thought was dead meets me along the way and tells me he wants to be a real family from now on but PLOT POINT: my roommate accidentally bumps into him and knocks him into a cement plant and starts crying because PLOT POINT: my roommate was actually in a relationship with my father but PLOT POINT: there\u2019s a meteor headed toward earth and I have to decide if I want to spend my last moments with my dying father or childhood friend.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 4/10\\n\\n\r\nYou may have gathered from that somewhat cryptic paragraph that Youths on a Declination has no story, what it has is a string of barely connected random events as a cheap attempt to cause an emotional reaction in the audience. The other point I was trying to make is that Striplings on an Oblique Surface has quite possibly got the single most forced plot I have ever seen in anime. The story is hashed together with every situation the creators think could possibly pull on someone\u2019s heart strings, natural story development be damned. The result is some completely artificial Frankensteinian monster. You can almost hear it sob \u201cPlease\u2026kill\u2026me\u201d as it stabs your eyeballs trying to get you to cry any way possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs the plot lurches through its various stages it manages to amass quite the collection of plot holes and inconsistencies. For the most part however, it manages to hold itself together as a pretty stereotypical Josei. It does treat themes like coming of age and friendship acceptably. If you happen to really, really love drama and romance then maybe you\u2019ll find a way to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of late-60\u2019s Japan deserves special attention in this review, because it didn\u2019t get any in the show. Whippersnappers on an Acclivity really missed a chance to be unique and interesting by capturing the flavor of the era. Instead, there is barely anything there to distinguish it from a typical modern anime, I half expected a student to pull out a cell phone at any time. There are a few token times when the show tries to masturbate to its own classiness, old-style desks, records and such, but there are so many anachronisms that it winds up just being annoying.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not very attractive. The characters have faces only a mother could love and objects and backgrounds can look plain and simple. But Minors on a Gradient has one secret weapon up its sleeve: animation. I could use words like fluid, smooth and beautiful. One test I use to determine how lazy a studio is in animation is music scenes. That is, whenever someone is playing an instrument, do their movements match up with the song? Even an amateur can tell if the beat is on (which it often isn\u2019t). Here, the piano parts are matched to the characters fingers. It shows great attention to detail that is present throughout the show, which compounds the great animation to look spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 3/10\\n\\n\r\nWait, WHAT? 3!? What the fuck is wrong with you John, giving a music anime a 3 for sound? Well, Tykes on a Cant\u2019s soundtrack is lousy. That isn\u2019t to say there\u2019s no good music, it\u2019s just all 30-60 second outtakes of jazz classics. I like jazz more than most, but no points for unoriginality, especially if it\u2019s tied together with a second-rate OST. The voice acting is underwhelming but passable. Ultimately, if you came for the music, go listen to music and give this one a pass.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe translation \u201cKids on the Slope\u201d may not be faithful to the Japanese, but it\u2019s very faithful to the characters, because they act like children. The main pair: Kaoru and Sentarou, have an interesting relationship. They are best friends, not because they are alike or get along or anything lame like that. No, the show just declares them best friends when they barely know each other and from then on they stick together for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nSIKE! They spend more than half the show not on speaking terms, and they have at least one fight an episode. I seriously hope nobody views this as a model of a healthy friendship. The way they hate each other makes it even more bizarre and surreal during the few times when they inexplicably love each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow flawed characters are a good thing, but the biggest flaw of Squirts on Uneven Ground\u2019s characters is that they don\u2019t feel like people, not at all. They certainly carry out the orders of the story well, but they have no depth OR consistency. The few times when they acted like human beings was lost on me since I was completely unattached to them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 5/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you get emotional easily? Do you cry when you see road kill? Are you a pre-teen girl? If any of these are true, you may enjoy Youngsters on a Rise. But if unrealistic story and characters causes you not to get emotionally invested, I don\u2019t think this is for you. The make or break here is drama. Many people will think the drama is excessive, but if you\u2019re easily affected then maybe this is worth a shot.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nI may not be the biggest fan of the romance genre, but (Baby+15)/(mx+b) was a real let-down. It didn\u2019t so much strike me on a sour note, mostly I was just bored watching it. I definitely enjoyed some of the music scenes, but mostly I just want my six hours back.",

            "content": "[5.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nIt would be natural to compare Kids on the Slope to Your Lie in April. Both series came around the same time, have a relatively similar premise, and are romances with the backdrop of music. I was wholly disappointed in Your Lie in April due to the writing, the hamfisted dialogue, the lack of nuance, the characters, and the inability for the series to let music breath and tell its own story. \r\nSo, with that knowledge, I was cautious going into Kids on the Slope. I was aware that it was a similar, romance-driven series that utilized music to occasionally back-end certain plot elements. Iunderstood where this show was coming from. Unfortunately, I still couldn't help but feel disappointed with the fact that once again, this was an anime that simply refused to promote the elements it clearly excelled at. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Kids on the Slope regressed in its middle half and ended up only peaking its head from the fog of boring writing in the last couple episodes. This series Started off strong by establishing characters who I found quite endearing, such as the rambunctious and rough Kawabuchi. Our protagonist, Nishimi, who was never the highlight, struggles with the move to a new school in a new town. These characters were easy to buy and the friendship that springs up was decently believable. I liked how our protagonist had trouble fitting in due to his wealth, rather than the other way around. It created an interesting dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nThey ended up forming a small jazz-group that jammed out in the basement of a jazz shop. Nishimi was on the piano, Kawabuchi was on the drums, and Pops, the owner of said shop, was on the bass. It was a neat little idea that, for lack of a better word, felt cozy. Occasionally a fourth member would come over from Tokyo, Junichi, who would whip out the trumpet and jam out with them as well. These moments were the show at its best. We had character growth, some light-hearted comedy, and infinite potential for realization. Are they going to form a band? Will music help them in their personal lives? Will they grow closer to one another through their mutual interests? \\n\\n\r\nNope. None of that happens. The series chooses to focus on the romance. More specifically, a quasi-love rectangle that is as frustrating as it sounds. The majority of the series was light on music and heavy on melodrama, and while the melodrama was somewhat more palatable than the tedium that twenty-four episodes of Your Lie in April made me sit through, it wasn't without its utterly baffling and cliche moments. Miscommunication, characters unable to speak to one another, needlessly angry outbursts over nonsense. It was all the teenage romantic bullshit that I've seen too much of. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is all the more frustrating when it back-ends a genuinely good story of friendship between our two protagonists. It is ultimately such an annoying experience because friendship is honestly all someone needs to make a story interesting. The romance here felt so forced and injected simply to have drama suffocate this potentially engaging series. It wasn't bad, in fact, there were a few inspired moments that brought this show past its mediocrity when it wasn't getting bogged down by the romance, but it was far from as good as it could've been. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters, Story, and Music]\\n\\n\r\nThis friendship between Kawabuchi and Nishimi is the chain that grounds the series. It is also the beating heart of some of the most frustrating moments when their friendship is tested because of miscommunication and totally irrational, stubborn moments. Maybe Japanese boys are different but seeing two teenagers discuss girls was such an unsual experience in this series because they were being needlessly vague about their interests.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was a kid and I was discussing my infatuations with my friends, I was blunt and clear because, at the end of the day, we were two guys having a good time and talking about the girls we like was a quintessential teenage \"thing\". Especially when clarity is deathly important to avoid clear conflict. These hair-pulling moments where our protagonist could've avoided two episodes of bitching if he was clear to his friend is the biggest fault of the show. I simply couldn't enjoy the majority of these moments.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bummer because there is a lot to enjoy here. The music, for one, is great. Unlike Your Lie in April and its incessant monologuing over every single musical moment in the series, Kids on the Slope was so smart to actually let its tunes breath. The moments where these characters are jamming out with one another and we see kinetic, frantic editing, hopping seamlessly from one instrument to the next, mixed with properly awesome animation is beyond entertaining. It's everything I wanted! I'm not a huge jazz-head, but seeing these scenes animated was flat-out exceptional. Specifically, the drumming had some ludicrously well-animated cuts. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, these moments are few and far between, especially during the middle-half of the show, where episodes drag on seemingly endlessly as one romantic interest fades and another blooms. One moment, Nishimi is walking down the street and monologues, \"why can't we stop falling in love with each other?\" I don't know! Why can't you? The idea that romance is needed to make anything interesting is such a cliched, old idea that I can't imagine why they have to force these characters in these situations. I was a teenager, I remembered the moments of infatuation, and then I remember waiting a few weeks and those feelings faded and I realized they were simply infatuations. There were no big, emotional, tear-soaked outbursts that defined my life and that's perhaps why I can't relate to these kinds of melodramatic shows. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just boring. Even when the series begins wrapping up and getting into the final three episodes, injecting some much-needed life into this wilting flower. I was already kind of soured to the experience. What I did appreciate was the subversion in the last episode, where instead of going the obvious route they pulled a fast one on the viewers and we got a somewhat melancholy conclusion. Unfortunately, it was reverted, somewhat, however, I was okay with it since it focused more on our protagonist's friendship than it did on convincing us that these fifteen-year-old boys were experiencing true love. \\n\\n\r\nThe main love interest here is Ritsuko and I just think they dropped the ball on her character. Not only was she simply not developed at all, but she lacked any distinguishing personality traits that were so good in characterizing the other two protagonists. But frankly, her flaws were awful. Not in the sense that they made her unlikeable, but rather that they were the same flaws that every character like her has. She's shy and soft-spoken. And this is pushed to an extreme with her voice actress seemingly trying to make her voice as squeaky as humanly possible. That didn't help. I swear I was listening to a dog-whistle in a few scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion and semi-twist that occurs does help her character a little, but at that point, it is just too late. The same can be said about the majority of side-stories here. The only one that had any actual impact on the character's and their development was Junichi's detour which occurred in the latter half of the series. It was decent. The biggest positive here is that it trimmed down this love-rectangle and made it more palatable. Every other side-story was just pointless. Nishimi has father issues that seemingly resolve themselves and are made to seem like a bigger deal than they were. Kawabuchi also has father issues which kind of play themselves out by the end. These stories really go nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nIs it too much to ask for a series that focuses on the music if it wants to be considered a \"music\" show? Not only that, if you don't want to constantly be music-oriented, that's fine, but at least fill these gaps with entertaining material. Don't montage past the actual music-bits in favor of making room for yet another confession near a train. I swear, in this short series we had around four scenes that all had some kind of love-oriented moment in a train, where one character was looking from a moving train while another was looking at them from the station. Not only is that just a flat-out cliche at this point, but to use it that many times? Come on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the story here isn't all too engaging. It is serviceable if only because of the endearing friendships created. Friendships, as the series so bluntly puts it, last forever, and that is more resonant to me than some puppy love melodramatic bullshit that plagues these kinds of series'. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation] \\n\\n\r\nIt's good. The art is consistent in quality and while the character designs aren't stand-out by any means, they are decent enough. The animation is okay until it comes time to flex those muscles in song and it becomes pretty incredible. The first moments we see Kawabuchi pick up a set of drumsticks and begin is so great because I wasn't expecting such a dedication to animating the drumming. \\n\\n\r\nIt felt like they had a separate animator come in for these moments as it was like I was looking at a different show. There was a lot of smears in these moments too, which further emphasized how dissonant the drumming scenes were from the rest of the series and its animation. Which isn't really a bad thing, I'm just happy these scenes were here because they brought some life into the jazz. \\n\\n\r\nApart from those specific moments, the presentation is consistent throughout. I can't say I saw a single episode where I could say was the \"one\" where they were clearly trying to save time by not animating as much as they could just to make room for the next musical moment. But even admitting that I can also say that there weren't enough musical moments to even warrant an episode like that in the first place. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nIt is okay. I'm hard-pressed to say anything more than that. I'm happy that it turned out better than Your Lie in April in just about every way. The presentation was more consistent, the music was actually listenable because they decided to not speak over it, and the characters were significantly less frustrating to deal with. While it was covered, head to toe, in rampant romantic cliches, and they undoubtedly lowered my final score, they weren't enough to fully make this series something I regret watching.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope didn't have enough of the slope. They brought up this hill a few times, however, it just wasn't enough of a theme to tie this show together. I interpreted it more as a metaphor for life rather than a literal slope they had to climb every day to school, but regardless, it could've been a bit sharper. What resonated the most with me, as it often does, is the friendship these characters experience. Dramatically, this series is at its best when it is dissecting friendship and the feelings one feels when they believe their friends are drifting away.\\n\\n\r\nThis element more relatable to me, because I personally can't relate to endlessly crying over high-school crushes when my relationships in high school were always a bit more relaxed and enjoyable than these endlessly melodramatic ones are. If you are looking for a series that is more romance than it is music, with more melodrama about being afraid to admit your feelings for someone than anything else, then Kids on the Slope might be perfect for you. It is wholly better than Your Lie in April simply because it didn't feel as though it was trying to wring tears out of me and failing miserably. It did have moments of inspiration and some genuinely touching scenes towards the end of the series. Unfortunately, Kids on the Slope struggled to climb that hill, as it was chained down by the weights of melodrama and unneeded romantic conflict.",

            "content": "I only watched the first few episodes of this series, though i think i'm able to write a review about it.\r\nFirst of all, i'm not someone who is pleased easily. I don't watch many anime, in fact i don't watch TV or Movies all too often, because they are, well let's say ... crap. When i read and heard about this anime i was eager to watch it, for it promised not to be \"mainstream\" (as i like to call it). Also, Yoko Kanno was on board as well, so that held my hopes high enough. It's really hard to see this promise not fullfilled.\r\nWhy,you ask?\\n\\n\r\nWell, yea it's quite rare to see such \"good\" characters, so early on in a series, but episode 4 already had signs of your typical \"Slice of Life\"- Bullshit. To be honest, even the first episode made me worry. These \"mood swings\". Don't get me wrong, character developement is not a bad thing, but in this case, it is not believable, and more importantly, it is too fast. Kaoru's character developement in particular. It's almost hilarious. First, he is depicted as a loner, who doesn't give a damn about anything in school, or rather life. In this and the following episode he slowly \"befriends\" Sentarou, the tough guy everyone is afraid of. He also developes a crush for Ritsuko, an old childhood-friend of Sentarou. Wow. And with that, one might think the \"Love-Triangle\" is set. Well, we thought too soon. Another girl appears on the stage, Mariko. Sentarou saves her from some guys and, yes you guessed it, he wants to get into her panties. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just the beginning. I could still bear with that, i even was okay with it, but the thing that really struck me was what followed soon after, or rather, what DIDN'T follow. To keep it almost spoiler-free i'll just name it the \"Kaoru-Ritsuko-Resolution\". It's like little girls drinking tea, if you know what i mean. I just can't relate to that. The series is called \"Kids on the slope\", but they aren't THAT little, are they? I mean, i tried to continue watching it, but i just couldn't. This anime left a bad taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone just wanting to watch their new season anime, go ahead, have fun with your routine. I can't watch this, seriously.",

            "content": "I think that there are certain anime that come along in our lives that make us rethink our current ratings. They make us rerate the decent shows and the above average shows. They make 7's turn into 6's, and 8's turn into 9's. Why? Because you really don't know where to put them. Here on MAL we can only choose a single number to represent how we feel about the anime. But sometimes I'm left feeling like, \"Oh, this anime was better than so-and-so, so I have to rate it a 8. But it was worse than so-and-so so I have to rate it a7.\" Sakamichi No Apollon is one of those anime that confused me. Reading this review means that you're opting to know why. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nBasic story. I think that often times in anime, if it doesn't have a show-stopping mindfuck of a premise, people rate the story lowly. I think that the only thing that matters is if the story is one that I can read about and then want to watch it. That doesn't make the story anything amazing, but it means that it has potential. I've never watched an anime based in the 60s before. That was cool. I've never watched an anime about jazz music before. That was cool. What the show lacked in is what it became in the latter half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI've got nothing but praise for the art in this anime. I kid you not, reading the dialogue wasn't my top priority a lot of the time. To me, the art was impressive. Usually in anime (or at least the ones that I have watched) they use very many lines. In this anime, they use blends. There's no line differentiating the skin that is shaded between the skin that is facing the sun; there's a blended transition. The fluidity of this anime was shocking. If anyone knows anything about anime, they'll know how there's usually a lot of corners cut when it comes to the art and animation. There's usually a lot of loops, and certain angles aren't fucked with. In Sakamichi, especially during their music scenes, there was nothing but captivation and awe within me. Like I said before, I've got nothing but praise for the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nAn anime dealing with jazz... that's incredibly cool to me in itself. All this anime got me wanting to do is listen to Moanin' on a endless loop. The beginning theme is one of those themes that I will doubtlessly be listening to over and over. Something about Yuki's voice paired with the lyrics of the song gets me in this audacious mood. Seriously. It makes me want to get off my ass, go outside and live. The ending theme though, I can't say the same for. It wasn't bad by any or all means, but it wasn't captivating. I'd stop listening after the first 5 seconds. Mostly though, the music was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThis is where the anime began to fall on its face. One minute, I love the characters. The next minute they're doing some horribly dramatic, unnecessary thing. The main character, Nishimi, is probably the worst of them all. He makes the same mistake over and over and over again and makes things a lot worse than they have to be. And it's all is over absolutely nothing and it often escalates too quickly. He needed a heavy dosage of plz calm the fuck down. Sen is a character that I liked for the most part. I think that he was too quick to throw a fist, but I liked him nonetheless. He was funny, carefree and a good friend for most of the series. But he wasn't immune to enticing very worthless drama. Besides his few minor offences of that though, he was a good character. Ri'ko... I'm on the fence about. I have this huge thing against lacklustre, personalitiless, docile females in anime. There are SO many and they're all SO boring. She was a nice character and she did have flaws, she was just a... I don't know, boring character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\n12 episode anime that took me some like 3 days to finish. With that, I wouldn't say that it captured my attention that greatly. But it certainly held it. There are some anime that are just impossible to put down and there are some that are impossible to not finish, even if it's eventually. 3 days isn't bad, but considering that I'm out of college and all I've been doing is eating and working out, it's not good either. I think that in the middle of the series my interest dipped, just to peak again in the last episode. I kept watching though, which means that I enjoyed it enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWhat happened when I watched this anime, is that I didn't know whether to rate it a 7 or a 8. It was better than Kaichou wa maid-sama, which I rated a 7, but it was worse than Nana, which I rated an 8. What did I do? Change my rating of Maid-sama to a 6 and Nana to a 9 (plus it's one of my favourite anime, I don't know why it wasn't a 9 anyway). I was so set on rating this anime a 7, but I was really impressed by the ending. If it weren't for that, this anime would have gotten a 7, no question. Judging by the posts on the last episode discussion board people are very up and down about the ending, but in my opinion it was the perfect way to finish of the series on a bittersweet note. It also had me feeling for the characters more than I thought that I would, since I was never 100% invested in them. I was very impressed. \\n\\n\r\nSo is 8 an inflation? Sure is. If I could be more specific with my ratings, this anime would probably get a 7.5. Worth the watch, impressive bits, and slightly over average.",

            "content": "Set in 1966, Sakamichi no Apollon tells the story of three close-knit teenagers growing up in small-town, seaside Japan. The main conflicts and problems in the plot involve the drama inside this group. Put simply, if you are not a fan of drama and romance (and jazz, but we'll talk about that later on), you most-likely won't enjoy this show.\r\nThe art and animation is fluid, smooth and detailed, especially during the performance scenes, where you can truly see it shine. The drumming scenes with Sentaro particularly impressed me, showing off a sheen characteristic of Tezuka Productions. Watching the sticks perform fills and rolls, flourishing onthe drum kit was incredibly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nJazz music in Sakamichi no Apollon is the butter to the drama's bread. All the music in the show compliments and most importantly, intensifies the emotions felt throughout the show. Classic jazz musicians are referenced throughout the show (Bill Evans, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, John Coltrane), and episodes are named after song titles (a practice that Shinichir\u014d Watanabe does frequently, most popularly in Cowboy Bebop). It is somewhat disappointing that besides the opening and closing, there is no original jazz songs created for the show, as that would have been exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and their development throughout the episodes is great. There are many twists and turns in their relationships, a few that you won't see coming, and ''like jazz, unexpected.'' By the end of the show, I truly came to cherish the friendship between the three. A main concept I picked up from the show is ''love is temporary, friendship is forever.''\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this show, and would recommend it to any drama fan, jazz fan, or even better, both. It's a bittersweet and simple slice-of-life that expresses and soothes the pleasures and pains respectively, of growing up, and finding love, and it uses the medium of jazz music and performance to send these messages. The show gave me goosebumps, made me tear up, made me laugh, and reminded me to cherish my friendships and my youth.\\n\\n\r\nWe all walk the slope everyday, but someday, when we stop, we will realise how much we miss it...",

            "content": "Jazz.\r\nI'm not quite a fan of it but, it's an \"okay\" music for me.\r\nJosei?\r\nRarely read any manga of it, especially watch any of it.\r\nThese two factors gave me a very strong reason not to like this series, and yet here i am, writing this very sentence in front of my computer. Why is that? Let me escort you to the very \"Realistically Enjoyable\" series called Sakamichi no Apollon.\r\nThe story was set in the 60's when people would remember one of the biggest musician of all time, The Beatles. Their captivating staging while doing their concert, their youth, their wide musical genre which is known fromPop-rock to Jazz(not many know this, though),  had made them a worldwide superstars,  almost everyone( Including my Dad&Mum) went crazy for them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course where the story takes place, Japan, is no different.\\n\\n\r\nThere was Nishimi Kaoru, a richie-rich boy type, who was immature because of his family and his surroundings.\\n\r\nKawabuchi Sentarou, a tough-looking dude who's known as a feared deliquent in school, but unbeknownst to almost everybody, plays drum.\\n\r\nMukae Ritsuko, Sentarou's childhood friend whose dad owns a Jazz shop with a Session Room for Sentarou to practice his drumming and having Jazz session.\\n\\n\r\nThese main characters were intertwined in those-you-call-cliche story and conflicts like heartbreak, miss communication, even Love Triangle(Sounds very cliche now isn't it?).\\n\r\nBut why would i call it one of the best anime this year?\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty simple.\\n\r\nIt's enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis series that makes 23 minutes seem very very very, short. You were seeing the opening theme (which is very good), watch the episode and in a blink of eye you will say,\" What, ending theme already?\", making you eager and wondering what would the next episode be.\\n\\n\r\nNot that this series perfect. Cliches. Sometimes you get annoyed because of this. Cleverly solved with adding JAZZ into it. Yup, without jazz this series would be the same as the other cliche slice-of-life. I must say, jazz was not my kind of tea in music, but i was smiling all the way every time jazz session was held in this series.\\n\\n\r\nSome person that would say, \"I don't like the art, it's not my taste.\"\\n\r\nAgain, that kind of problem is solved with jazz session.\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that is almost superb as the sound, it was the animation, NOT the artwork.\\n\r\nYou see, in this series, we get to see how cymbals and snare get hit beautifully, how a fretless bass played harmonically, how majestic trumpet is played, and how magnificent piano is played.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what's most important, the title. Sakamichi no Apollon has English Title Kids on the Slope.\\n\r\nThis anime is not only about love, friendship, or music. It's about a journey of growing mature in life. Kids on the slope will always find their \"Slope\" in life, troubled by those \"slope\", get through it, and find another \"slopes\" after the previous \"slope\". This is what every Slice-of-Life anime should be.\\n",

            "content": "OK, so before I say what makes Kids on the Slope good, I'm going tell you the reason why you might want to watch something else.\r\nIt's a highschool-romance-X-music-anime, set in a time period you probably don't care about, featuring a music genre you probably don't care about. The only conflict in the show develops from the characters not being able to fucking say what they are actually fucking thinking to each other.\r\nThere's three kinds of people in this world, Type A; the kind of person that thinks \"yeah, this probably isn't for me\". That's totally cool, there's heaps of good shows out there, go watchsomething else.\\n\\n\r\nThere's type B, who think \"no cheese852, you're wrong, I actually do like [jazz/highschool romance/the 60's/poor communication]\". Congratualations, you're a special unicorn, go watch the anime, you'll probably enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Type C, who read what I've written and think \"if that's what he thinks about the show, why did he give it a 10?\". Well for you Type C kiddies out there, I write this review.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is beautiful because of the way that the characters forgive each other. It sounds sort of dumb, but every time it happens, you get this warm fuzzy feeling through your entire body. These amazingly genuine feel-good moments actually made me care about jazz music. They made me care about the characters, the bully, the nerd and the goody two shoes. I'm writing this review from a bed in Sasebo, Japan, because I liked the show enough to spend seven and a half hours to train to bum-fuck nowhere to see the city that the show was set in.\\n\\n\r\n10/10, would recommend to anyone who is looking for something to watch without action/fighting. It's also the only show that's brought tears to my eyes. If you're looking for those warm magical moments, this is where you'll find them.",

            "content": "Well, where can I begin it...\r\n---- CONTAIN SPOILERS ----\r\nThat anime has three main focus: shows how the music can affect you, show the school romance and how works the adolescent mind, and also, them development. the history revolves around of the friendship of Sentaro and Kaoru (who are like water and oil), and teach us that in the music, we can understand each other. The romance plote is very well done, mainly the love triangle and the life histories of each one personage (what's awesome IMO)\r\nThe anime is very good drawed in some parts (for a anime made 11 years ago, that's impressive), but inothers, it's like the produce money were over, because starts to appear a lot of static images, and that displeased me a bit, because it totally brokes the atmosphere, or at least decreases the same.\\n\\n\r\nDude, if a anime who have as the main genre the music isn't good in it, in what more else would it be?? Sakamichi no Apollon's OST is just awesome!! right on the first ep, Kaoru plays \"Clair de Lune\" who's my favorite classic music. The jazz musics what they chose, the classics one and also the musics who are made just for the anime have fits very well, it's one of the best points in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYurika - I liked so much of that character, who never met THAT person 16 years old, but who had a personality of an adult person?? I think completely justificable the fact of her doesn't have get a romance with Sentaro, but with Junichi, she just chose him because he was an adult, and Sentaro not yet.\\n\\n\r\nJunichi - that character just came to muddle and also help the Sentaro's development, he's an adult who regrets of things of he saids and did(all adult will understand it and will have empathy with him), he's like a older brother of Sentaro, but end up staying with the girl who Sentaro likes, that's kinda curious hahaha.\\n\\n\r\nRitsuko - I loved that character!!! truly, I really liked her, she's like the most 15 years old girls, who doesn't knows what they wants about love, her mind is a chaos. She's loving, prestative, smart, in resume, she's so cute!!!\\n\\n\r\nKaoru - FUCK HIM!!! I hated him, really, dude, he's an asshole, he always, always will do a lot of shits, because he's a brat!! it's really impressive the times he does things without think before, just because he have a low self-esteem and lack of confidence about himself, and ends up hurting people around him, and less than 5 seconds, he regrets about what he did, what a shit personality, dude, he's a typical finicky brat.\\n\\n\r\nSentaro - I'm not gay, I swear!!! BUT, I loved him!!! he's sensational!! is my objective of how to be, fisically or about him attitudes, he've 15 years old, but sometimes acts like if have 25 and in other times he acts like he was a baby who just need of a hug from his mother. The his personality is so strenght, and he always is honest, and when he gets angry, he overflows all in the battery (or fighting huh xD), I don't have words to describe how much I liked that character.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that anime is a musical anime, but he doesn't focus in music in itself, but yes in how the character will turn your emotions in music, or in how he use the music as a refuge to express your feelings, I liked so much of scenes of when Kaoru or Sentaro were sad, angry, or even romant hahaha, and they have can turn it in music!! in each episode you was thinking \"my god, I need to watch the next episode soon\", not because is a anime who makes you in doubt, and leaves the answer always on the next episode, but yes because you sensibilizate and immerses on that world and feel empathy with each one character, that's simply perfect, be it an sad history or even a normal history life, you'll have at least a bit of empathy with that character (even Kaoru, that I hate, but at same time I like). In resume, that anime is one of more underrateds that I've ever seen, I'm so glad to have watched it!!!",

            "content": "\u201cI do my thing and you do yours. I am not in this world to live up to your expectations, and you are not in this world to live up to mine. (Frederick Perls)\r\nSakamichi no Apollon was a series that I, like a lot of people had high expectations for, when I first heard that Shinichir\u014d Watanabe  and Yoko Kanno would be working on this, their first project together since Cowboy Bebop I nearly wet myself, especially when I heard it was going to be set in 60s Japan and be about jazz. It goes without saying that as a huge fan of BebopI couldn\u2019t wait to see this. And for the most part it was a very good series that I enjoyed watching, but I was disappointed overall, it was not the classic I thought it was going to be, it was still good but not what I had been expecting and a good degree of that is because of how high my expectations had been set...\\n\\n\r\n Sakamichi no Apollon is based on a manga by Kodama Yuki and tells the story of a boy named Nishimi Kaoru who has moved from school to school because of his father\u2019s job.  Constantly moving has caused him to become shut off from other people as he doesn\u2019t see the point in making friends.  But things change when he starts to get close to the class president, Mukae Ritsuko, and becomes friends with Kawabuchi Sentaro who is infamous for getting into fights and skipping class. The three of them find they have a common interest in music, namely jazz which helps bring them together. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is interesting enough it was not an original written by Watanabe, this meant  that he was limited in what he could do with the story and so we weren\u2019t going to get another Bebop. Also the story of a kid who\u2019s closed off but joins a new school and makes unlikely friends also falls in love is nothing new, but to the shows credit it takes this standard setting and turns it into something truly interesting to watch. Through its use of detailed and beautiful art, fantastic music and most importantly interesting characters which are the driving force behind it this series its able to shine. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fun to watch but I couldn\u2019t help but be a little disappointed that so much of it is dedicated to the romance and bromance, not that I didn\u2019t enjoy it but its just that we've seen all this before. The problem I had with this series is that at it's core sakamichi no apollo is just another high school drama anime that we've seen a million times. That doesn't make it bad, in fact it's one of the best I've seen in a long time, but this could have been so much more. I mean you had jazz and 60s Japan as a setting, there was so much room for creativity and awesomeness but instead it got bogged down in high school drama. And there is a lot of drama in this series, it seems like every other scene is someone crying or slapping some one. Also the jazz elements of this series took second place to the drama most of the time which was very under-used. Again I must stress I don\u2019t think this was a bad series in fact I really enjoyed it, I just didn\u2019t get why there had to be so much drama and so little \u201c60s Japan jazz\u201d in a series that\u2019s supposed to be about a group of people discovering their love of jazz.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before the characters are defiantly this shows strongest element, and despite the limitations of the story they are very depth-full and surprisingly interesting to watch and grow, especially my favourite Sentaro whose unpredictability and simple minded niceness make him extremely likeable and fun to watch. The slow pace of this series allows much time for the main characters to develop which was perfect as this is very much a character driven story, the many twists and turns that the characters go through as they grow is fun to watch if a little melodramatic at times but still very good. While some characters where given good development some where also virtually ignored such as Kaoru`s family or Ritsuko's father who I would liked to have seen be worked into the story more. But then again this was only a 12 episode adaptation of a 9 volume manga so maybe if there is a sequel they could work that in there.    \\n\\n\\n\r\nVisually this series was very nicely done, and an all round pleasure to watch, nothing looked boring or badly drawn and virtually every scene looked excellent and so full of life and energy. The art was kind of simple but that was supposed to reflect the fact that they where simpler times back then and it really captured the feel of this time period and the characters well, with the series looking every bit as good as one might expect under Watanabe`s direction.\\n\\n\r\nIt impossible to write a review for this series without mentioning the music, the series features many great blues classics such as Moanin by Art Blakey and the jazz messengers and Chet Baker's But Not For Me and it was great to hear actual jazz music in an anime for once. Sentaro and Kaoru`s` jam sessions where also a pleasure to listen too but again there where far to few of them in a series that was supposed to have a central theme of  jazz. I was also disappointed that that the opening and ending themes where not jazz, this surprised me as I was hoping for something similar to \u201cTank\u201d from Cowboy Bebop but they were still good in their own right and did fit the series well . There where a few scenes where you could really feel that Yoko Kanno was composing the music with her influence being felt strongly at these times and this was when the music was at its best, when Yoko was just doing what she does best make awesome music for good shows. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall this was a very good series that when taken at face value is fun to watch with great music and interesting characters, it may have had a done to death story and not have been the classic some people where expecting  but when you put that aside this is still a must watch and one of the best anime of 2012 so far and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an anime with a simple story, interesting characters and some really good music.    \\n",

            "content": "Hi there! Just a quick review.\r\nFirst, let me praise what I liked about the show and say that I expected a lot from it, since it was from Watanabe Shinichiro, who I'm a big fan of.\r\nThe jazz themes and refrences were awesome, the OST's were cool (even had some hip-hop kinda beats for the soundtrack which resembled me Samurai Champloo OST), the old school Japan ambientation was great. Personally I loved Sentarou and his character had a decent development. Loved the interior-ish japanese dialect also, it is very charming.\r\nBut ok, let's get to the downers:\r\nI had a huge problem with Kaoru. Dude, Kaoru just sucks.He indeed had one or two good moments, but most of times he was just there whining about every damn thing. \\n\\n\r\nHis dialogues were mostly lame. \"I can't stop the rhythm of my heart\" kinda thing. I laughed when it was supposed to make me sad. Remember the episode that the crew went searching for clams at the beach? Remember of Kaoru being all jealous because of his \"trauma\" (can't call it a trauma sorry) with a childhood friend? You can't go on that stuff and say that is a good drama plot, it was just the shallowest thing! I can't praise that when a kid at age 10 could write a similar drama plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnd let's get to episode 11 [spoiler ahead], when occured the accident. Kaoru just rushed to the hospital and saw Sentarou's family. Then, he discovered that the one at surgery was Sachiko, and not Sentarou. When Kaoru was told that, he was just like \"Oh, ok nevermind\" and went after Sentarou like fuck Sachiko. Dude, he was just told that she had a severe head trauma and could not wake up anymore. He knew her. Then he went after Sentarou and later comes his thoughts about the school festival. At that point all he knew was that she might not wake up anymore, and he is concerned about the School Festival? Oh man, that sucks. Unreal situation, bad directing or was just Kaoru that sucked? Please don't ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode was good. But again, same lame (imo) dialogues problem \"I can't stop the rhythm of my heart\" DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE what are those dialogues (I'm watching the ep 12 as I write this review). \\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes were good, but when it progressed it was pure bromance anime with an annoying main character. Sad, because I expected it to be so good since people compare SnA with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (and SnA was directed by the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Zankyou no Terror, and on it goes. Had much more potential than Shigatsu). \\n\\n\r\nIt's totally okay and understandable to not have money for a big production like Shigatsu, but in this case you NEED to work on the dialogues, the concept, the plot, the characters, because otherwise...... yeah... And jazz > classical music (personal taste, of course).",

            "content": "I'm a pretty big fan of Jazz, myself. Having played it in high school and still a little currently, I understand the thrill I get when playing and the sense of immense joy sharing it with others. So when my friend told me about this show I was pretty excited. Currently 8 episodes into it, I think I have a pretty good grasp on it and am able to give my opinions on it. It might also be important to note that I'm watching this show literally as I am writing this review.\r\nSo my thoughts on the show? It's...okay, I guess. Don't get me wrongI like watching it, but the enjoyment I get is always coupled with frustration; and I'll get to why later. I'll start with the strong points in this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show isn't too bad. It looks a little off putting at how dated it looks, but I think it fits very much with the overall tone and setting of the story. With the show taking place in post WWII-era Japan I think that the show's kind of faded and basic art style compliments it pretty well. It manages to have an older feeling to it without remaining completely bland, even managing to be downright beautiful at points. That tied with the music of the show captures the story it's trying to tell, in it's essence. And the music, my god the music. ORGASMIC! The opening song is just so beautiful; and that trumpet at the end sends waves a ecstasy through my body. I can't help but smile every time I hear it. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening isn't the only good music in it though. Of course a show about teenagers playing jazz has got to have some decent jazz playing in it, and boy does it. The show manages to create the passion and euphoric feeling of playing music incredibly. I'm pretty sure it uses up most of the budget for whatever episode it's in. The music is clean and energetic when it needs to be and the characters look like they are having a blast playing it, which means I'm having fun watching. So good job Kids on the Slope, you got that right. \\n\\n\r\nBut for all the good things this show has, it's plagued with missteps that are too big to ignore. This show is supposed to be a drama, and it is I guess. I mean if you could call a middle school fake love rectangle, drama. I say fake love rectangle because it's not actually a love rectangle, the characters just think it is. I guess the drama would actually be better if it made sense to me. It doesn't. The problems they have in this could literally be solved with a single conversation and clearing up if one character actually liked another one, instead of everyone just passive aggressively acting on their assumptions. \\n\\n\r\nHmm...I guess the more I think about it that is exactly what middle school drama is. Okay, I'll give you that show. You successfully portrayed kids being stupid and immature, but that doesn't mean I like it. It's actually frustrating to me, watching these kids make one wrong assumption after the other and just making everyone upset because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, they are mostly forgettable. Like so much so, that I don't remember most of their names even while watching the show. I've gotten to the point where I only refer to them by their main characteristic that distinguishes them from the extras (other than the fact that they apparently matter to the story). \\n\\n\r\nSo you got glasses. He's the MC and he plays the piano. Then there's scarface, he's tall and plays drums. Scarface also likes to fight, probably because he has dirty american blood in him tainting his pure nippon heritage. Next is pigtails, she's a romantic interest with no discernible personality other than waifu. Oh and there's Brother Jun. He is the only person who's name I actually remember because he's actually fun to watch and has a singing voice like a god.  Her dad owns a music store, so there's that. You got hat girl. She wears hats sometimes and paints. Cat boy recently showed up. I'm still not sure if he will remain in the plot, I hope not. \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah...that's all the relevant characters. All pretty bland and archetypal as you can tell. They don't really make the annoying plot any better, if anything they just kind of make it more clich\u00e9. Some people will probably in enjoy the story being told here, but I don't. It and the characters only lead to add filler in the show for me, while I wait for the next time they resolve their problems by jamming out on some tunes together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show gets a 6/10 for me. Trash, but \"I'll finish it\" kind of trash.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The american guy in the bar that said the phrase \"Coon music\" is great.",

            "content": "Before you read my review all I have to say is, watch it! Then come back here and read my review, it doesn't contain spoilers but I don't want you to waste time contemplating whether or not to watch this show, just watch it.\r\nHoly sh*t did I not expect that, this masterpiece of a show is very underrated, unlike most series I come across, I have no bad things to say about this anime. Did it piss me off at times? HELL YEAH, but, this show captivated my attention right from the start, I could tell this would be a great series, a gem. Butman o' man was I not expecting such a beautiful story, soothing music, dynamic character development, and I definitely was not expecting the romantic outcome.\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to say that music and romance go hand in hand. The show doesn't revolve around the relationship between a girl and a boy with musical backgrounds like Your Lie In April, but a relationship between 2 friends and some love interests mixed in. Although, the women of interest have no musical background but do enjoy it. Sakamichi no Apollon showed what true friendship is like, and how there's going be fights and arguments over the stupidest of things, but how you'll make sure to reconcile and always each others back. The women in this show however, are almost too accurate to the real thing, indecisiveness and false signals manages to anger both you and the characters in the show. The guys however are pretty straightforward about things, at least to the girls cause they definitely hold back with one another.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it would've been nice to see a little more classical music, the jazz music was really nice, and I'm not a big fan of jazz but I did recognize some of the music choice. Kaoru and Sentarou often used music as a way to express themselves but not how you'd think, when they played together the only emotions that were put in where happiness, they were happy to play with one another and enjoyed their time together. When either one was upset they'd either play their heart out on the instruments or wallow in the sadness and barely play their instruments, clearly showing that they were suffering, and each time they would help one another out.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm happy this show didn't mainly focus on the romantic relationships but on the relationship between friends and family. Truly a beautiful series.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 Although you couldn't follow it at first, you quickly latch onto it and stay for the ride while listening to some nice jazz.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 It was pretty and all but this show was not meant to satisfy your eyes but your ears.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 I watched this show in dub and really like the emotion the voice actors put in, they were well selected for each character and fit in well, although some background characters did seem like they had the same voice actor, but that's not really an issue. Oh, and the music was also really good to the ears, got me thinking about jazz in a new light.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 The character development was well executed and the characters were very likeable, even the one's you might not like at first (just wait, episodes will explain all).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 This has been one of my favorite shows to date, I enjoyed every second of it and I wish it had more episodes but sadly it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 10 sorry but my Enjoyment level goes far above any of the rest, but don't want to put a bias in my critical review.",

            "content": "Before you read. This anime was very personal to me so I am very honest in what I think and felt about this anime. I gave this a perfect, and I would of course understand if you disagree. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy reading my reasons and please feel free to comment or talk about this great anime. Thank you in advance.\r\nI normally don\u2019t give personal stories when I write anime reviews, essays, or articles, but this anime invaded the walls I built against other people and made itself home inside my heart as if it is one of the few special friends I treasurewith my life. Although I was skilled at the acoustic guitar, I wasn\u2019t in a band or any musical clubs when I was in my high school, but I was close friends with a female drummer who knew what she was doing and who was the school band\u2019s drummer. We had only one thing in common; we both improvised our music. Her drumming percussion style was jazz influenced while my guitar was more caf\u00e9, romantic style. She would begin a light tap on the cymbals and I would start with a light bass with my thumbs, as she laid the beat down, my fingers would strike the bottom strings, sliding my left fingers up and down along the frets, occasionally snapping my fingers to provide a sharp note, and you get the picture. She was the one who introduced me to jazz, according to her, Jazz stood for; Jealously, Ardor, Zeal, and times two the Zeal. High school isn\u2019t just a school. It\u2019s a building where you realize first love never prevails, the sharp pain of envy of what you can\u2019t control and have, and a building where it challenges those who have the passion to fight for the fight of their lives. If you\u2019re lucky, you might even lose your virginity. Sakamichi no Apollon is the anime that reflected this statement, only in an incredibly amusing way, ecstatic jazz music, and honest colors.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my rather long introduction, high school is a place where many young boys and girls experience genuine love, inevitable envy, countless misunderstandings, and last but not least, the strength to pave your own path to desire. Sakamichi no Apollon does the perfect, impeccable job conveying this atmosphere and I am not exaggerating in the slightest. A young misunderstood boy transferred into the countryside where he meets another misunderstood boy which they begin a mutual connection of being different from other people. This connection grows deeper in trust and loyalty as the episodes flies by. Meanwhile, these boys learn to love, let go, understand, and most importantly express their true parts not only through music but by words, actions, and honesty. These lessons and events stack and pile up until they create their own pace, tempo, and style in life and music. Despite stating the storyline to blandly, Sakamichi no Apollon amuses watchers in the best way possible, makes us cringe in disappointment from the stupid actions from our favorite characters, and makes us smile so warmly as these brave characters venture their lives in search of their zeal. Dialogue is incredibly well written. Jokes are plentiful, teasing the other gender in the most childish way can be spotted here and there, and nostalgia is abundant as I reminisced my drummer friend as I watched this show. Another aspect that really made me love this anime is the pace. For those who doesn\u2019t exactly what makes Jazz Jazz, there is only one word to describe the charm of Jazz; Eccentricity. Jazz tempo can change in a single instant, and the impact is like a slap across the face. Jazz allows Jazz musicians express everything they feel, from the dark destructive thoughts they harness inside their hearts to the bright smiles and laughs they only allow their children and wife see and hear, always fluctuating the beat like a pendulum ball. This anime pace was fast and slow, emphasizing the charm of Jazz even more. I personally really loved the pacing of it, I just couldn\u2019t stop watching it. The story in Sakamichi no Apollon deserves a 10 due to the fitting pacing of a Jazz anime and a well blend of both dark and bright emotions within high school life and love.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThere was nothing phenomenal about the art. The year it was made was in 2012, a time where animes actually began looking more polished and graphically impressive compared to the past. And yet, Sakamichi no Apollon deserves a 10 in art due to two reasons. One, the choreography was very well directed and drawn. One of the main characters is a drummer and the way, the art how his arms flexed and moved, how his head bobbed along with the complex pattern of snares and cymbals planned within his head, how his eyes were half closed, as if his body was being controlled by someone else, all of that was clearly visible during drumming scenes. And that, was quite impressive and also amusing for a fellow musician like myself to watch another musician enter his zone of his own personal music, be it real or 2D. The movement within the entire series were well developed and laid out. I never saw a scene where something was off place or any obvious mishap within the art both in background and foreground. The second reason is the usage of color in the anime. When I mention color, I might sound like an old man seeing colored anime for the first time, but if you notice carefully, you can see how honestly color was implemented in this anime. I first noticed this in the opening in the anime which was insanely well drawn with lingering shadows and prominent details and charms of every character. In the anime itself, the colors are respectively very well balanced and measured to the exact amount. The lighting which supplemented the color was perfect, and there was not a single shot where it was odd or uncomfortable in the eyes. From the cheeks blushing from embarrassment and love, from the heroine\u2019s cute freckles to her skin color, the white veils in church scenes, every color had their boundaries and the artist had done a splendid job of respecting each color to their roles. For those reasons, I would give Sakamichi no Apollon a perfect for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAllow me to repeat myself. Jazz\u2019s charm is its eccentricity. The taps of the drums can fluctuate however the drummer wants it do, the crashes from the piano, the toots of the trumpet, the low bass cello, every instrument can bring their own beat, tempo, and rhythm. However, here is the tricky part; your style and tempo shouldn\u2019t contradict others\u2019, it should complement along it. You can play however you want. If there is a sudden feeling of improvising your music, you are more than welcome. Just keep in mind that your music should be in synch with your team\u2019s music. If you want to change the atmosphere so you can play your unique solo, you can give them hints to indicate that you want to take the lead and that the members should be the one to follow you. Teamwork is always important in music, but Jazz bands take it up a notch because nothing is planned out. The pianist might have suddenly remembered an old promise he made to his dying mother during a performance and he could signal his team that he would like to take charge to express the emotions he felt from that memory. Thus, trust, loyalty, and connection is absolutely essential in a Jazz band. The music here exactly does that so well, which is why I love this anime. During a performance, the pianist notices how the drummer was not giving his fullest on the performance. As a signal to shake him up, he strikes consecutive tones to alert the other members that he is going to raise the tempo up a notch so that the drummer can focus back on providing the percussions. Another scene was when the pianist began the rhythm and tempo and the drummer joined in, complementing with the beat, making everything natural and planned while it never was. Such symbols that define the true meaning and charm of Jazz was plenty which is why I highly praise the directors for exactly knowing and understanding what they have to do. For the reason the directors understood the true essence of Jazz music, I give the sound a complete 10, for it had just leveled with my expectations when I hear the word \u2018Jazz\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters were perfect. In fact, the entire cast acted as a Jazz band. Conflict against characters are bound to happen, just like misconceived signals from other members. But they reconcile in the end because there is more than just music behind their relationship. There is respect, and as I mentioned before, trust, loyalty, and connection between each characters. Even the minor characters played special roles in which conjured unique emotions or reactions from characters such as the multiple siblings of the drummer or the pianist\u2019s mother. I loved every single character without spite or detest. I found everyone to be essential to the story (with the exception of unnecessary multiple thugs). The relationship links with one character to the other was neatly developed and was hardly confusing. With memorable characters with passionate motivations to move on to prove the world and themselves, I give the characters a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 100\\n\r\nI know I am exaggerating a lot, but I really, really, really enjoyed Sakamichi no Apollon a lot. The moment I saw the drummer skillfully tap the hasty beat with twigs, I instantly knew I was attracted to this mischievous drummer. I loved every second of it, every episode was delightful for my eyes, ecstatic for my ears, and always put a smile of nostalgia and just pure happiness. This honest, amazing anime is definitely worth watching, I highly commend this work and appreciate the creators for constructing a masterpiece of love, Jazz, and life full of uncontrolled yet synchronized beats, melodies, rhythm, and amusement.\\n",

            "content": "This review contains minor spoilers.\r\nIf I had to describe this show in a few words, I would say this is the best friendship in anime history. I didnt got this hooked for an anime in a lot of time.\r\nThe first 2 episodes seem to be the typical rom-com series start, but after that the story turns out to be different and unpredictable, and you finally realize you are not watching a rom-com but an unique story, where the friendship is the main theme.\r\nSo since the very beginning I was amazed for the beautiful art: different character desings, detailed backgrounds drawings and finally I get tosee an anime where they dont remove the part of the glasses that covers the character's eye (which I personally find annoying).\\n\r\nCharacter's movement was smooth, specially when they were playing music and I didnt even spot bad cgi animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the best tool this anime has to make people fall in love with it and it isnt weird if you start to listen to jazz after you finish this show. The way the characters talk to each other through the instruments is so good and captivating. Yoko Kanno is god herself, since not only the original soundtrack was good, but also the songs she adapted. Im pretty sure this anime has one of the best OST ever made, besides FLCL's J-rock, Naruto and Shippuden's rock mixed with japanese folk music and other Yoko Kanno's works. \\n\r\nI enjoyed a lot the scenes where Kaoru and Sen were playing music and the main reason for this was that they werent even talking but just playing music. I love Shigatsu wa kimi na uso, but one of the biggest issues I have with this show is that they dont shut the fuck up when they are playing. Like cmon dude, let me hear that precious music you are playing, you can tell me later how much you admire Kousei.\\n\\n\r\nFinally a show with mature teenagers. However, I wont lie to you, the main cast is cliche. Your typical shy, introverted and sad background story guy who has a crush on the typical good girl of japanese shows. At least their interactions dont make you cringe like other shows' relationships do. \\n\r\nI have to admit that the way Sentarou influenced Kaoru's character was great. In a little amount of time, Kaoru was confident enough to confess his feelings to his crush, and he easily became the main pillar who hold Sentarou.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best part of this common cast is that the non-common characters shine even brighter. Thats when Sentarou comes in. Sentarou seems to be the bad and handsome guy every school show has, but as the anime goes on, you realize he is something special as he turns out to be a shy, religious, responsible and very kind guy. Is that the reason why his character is that good? No, it isnt (at least by itself). Later on, you see his backstory, and then you realize how good this character is. An unwanted kid who is bullied and hated even by his family to the point his dad left home. After that \"childhood\", he had to be the father figure for his siblings while he studied and worked to bring some money home. If that wasnt enough, he is a real character, as you can see in the 2 last arcs. Best written character of the show by far.\\n\\n\r\nIn adittion, supporting cast also get some development and protagonism.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of good things, but it also has bad ones. The end of the story felt a little bit rushed, characters' movement could have been more constant, some of the side characters needed more time to develop etc. Even if you enjoy the arc when Kaoru goes to visit his mother, it loses its charm when they dont explain why his mother left home or why did she act like that when they met.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this is a great show and I highly recommend it if you are bored of childish stories.\\n",

            "content": "After watching the Nodame Cantabile series, I was really looking forward to watching more music-related animes and just so happened to stumble upon Sakamichi no Apollon. \r\nIt is a story about Kaoru aka \"Richie\", a timid young man living in 1960s Japan. He lives with his relatives and has transferred to a seaport town, one of many transfers as he is always transferring schools and therefore never develops lasting relationships with anyone. He actually at times becomes sick as a result of classroom conflicts or interactions. However this all changes when he meets the class rep, Ritsuko, and her childhood friend Sentarou, who is notoriousfor his trouble-making and tough exterior. Although they appear to be polar opposites, Sentarou and Kaoru share a talent for music. Sakamichi no Apollon shows the development of the relationship between these 3 characters as Sentarou introduces Kaoru to jazz music and develops Kaoru's overall love of life and friendship. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nNot overly complex, but short, fascinating and effective. It is definitely unique as it explores an aspect of Japan I never knew existed; Japanese culture and jazz music. The story was very relate-able, as it touched on common issues of loneliness, poverty/being broke and unrequited love. At times the situations did feel a little over-exaggerated but based on the personality types of the characters, it was not completely out of place. The anime is classified under drama and romance but I did find that there was perfect placement of humor and fun as well, especially with Sentarou and Kaoru. \\n\r\nWithout giving anything away, the ending was, in my opinion, near perfection. It did not feel at all rushed but quite natural and really quite satisfying. It is rare for me to not feel a longing for more at the end of an anime but in this case, I truly felt the story needed to end there. This is not to say that I would not have appreciated more story, but it was just so perfectly wrapped up that it would seem unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10- I have no real reason to explain why but I just think it was beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10- The jazz pieces in this anime are beautiful, catchy and exciting to watch. A special mention goes to one performance by a character named Junichi, who without spoiling anything, surprised and drew me in so deeply that I instantly fell for him :P \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10- All the main characters are very well developed and multidimensional. The good and the bad points of each character really made me like and relate to them more. The relationship between Sentarou and Kaoru is something special and was a privilege to watch. Even secondary characters that I started off not liking , like Yurika (a classmate and future love interest of one of the characters), I ended up rooting for at the end. The only character I had a problem with is Ritsuko, just because I did not find much interesting about her personality. But I still found myself liking her and cheering for her anyway!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI think this is a great anime for people who like music but also those who like and appreciate history. I do not know how accurate some of the events are that are portrayed but it does show another side of Japan not usually seen in anime; in the time where the world was struggling with segregation, racism and in many countries, political unrest.  For anyone who has watched Samurai Champloo or Cowboy Bebop, this is a great one to watch also. It was made by the same team that worked on Cowboy Bebop, and I believe although all 3 stories differ greatly in the plot, the quality of the storytelling is comparable. \\n\r\nReally to summarize, the bromance between Sentarou and Kaoru was so enjoyable and touching that I think there is an appeal for anyone (with a heart :P).",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon, or Kids on the Slope, has generated a lot of buzz for all the right reasons. Even before it started airing, many were already heralding the new anime to be something great because of its director and music composer. I'm glad to say that Kids on the Slope lived up to those high expectations.\r\nIn a story set in the days of our parents' youths, a group of friends bond over music, complete with a love triangle sort of set-up, a megane, and a loveable Tough Guy. The main focus of Kids on the Slope is the growth and life-changing experiences of theprotagonists. The characters are all particularly likeable in this series, with quirks and hidden hardships alike. Their relationships feel very real and tangible, which is helped along by some character asides or inner thoughts. They do have traits of their respective character archetypes (Tough Guy, Nerdy Glasses Guy, and the more-or-less Every-woman), but they can diverge from these archetypes into one unique character.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not really one set story, but it is more an accumulation of the events happening in the characters' lives. At one point the plot may just make you purely angry or sad at the characters' actions, but that is totally what it's supposed to do-- evoke emotion. Seeing these relatively complex and developing characters experience normal aspects of adolescence proves quite interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not one who is able to critique art, but as far as I can tell, everything in the series looks great; with extra attention to the main characters. Who of which are incredibly beautiful and detailed. One big exception, however, is the opening sequence with a bunch of off-model characters; where a running Kaoru doesn't have as much more than two boxes for glasses and a line for a mouth. Still, this can be overlooked compared to the rest of the art in the OP and the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don't really know much about art, I MUST talk about the sound-- Oh my goodness. Where can I start? The promise of Yoko Kanno as music composer is what first enticed me to start Kids on the Slope. And when I heard it was music-oriented, I was already in love. I'm a big sucker for great OSTs, and Kids on the Slope has just that. I'm also a sucker for jazz. The sound is exemplary at integrating jazz and swing into the soundtrack without making it sound too foreign or out of place in a Spring 2012 anime.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the OST, but the voice actors were great choices too. Each character's distinct voice suits them perfectly. I'd like to commend the actors' English too-- the CD had pretty good English for the vocal jazz pieces, and most likely a native speaker was hired for one of the more recent episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kids on the Slope is a definite favorite of mine for the Spring 2012 season. I deeply recommend this show for everyone; in particular, music junkies like myself, lovers of school drama/slice-of-life, and those just looking for a good show to watch. I look forward to it every week now, and I hope lots of others do too.",

            "content": "This is quite easily my personal favorite title that I seen for the Spring 2012 season. Taking place in late-1960s Japan, Kids on the Slope believably depicts the major norms and events of the time period mixed with the complicated developments that take place in the bonds between Kaoru, Sentaro and Ritsuko. Spanning the length of three years, Kids on the Slope explores the developing relationships between the three friends as they have their quarrels, develop friendship and even some romantic developments as Kaoru finds himself smitten with Ritsuko. A major part of this bond comes from Sentaro's love of jazz, which is strongly emphasizedthrough the songs that Sentaro and others usually perform with him coming from famous musicians like Bill Evans, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Chet Baker and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. Yoko Kanno offers up her music composure talents in pulling off these Western musical pieces for Kids on the Slope and as usual, they are quite excellent to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe major characters of Kids on the Slope are well fleshed-out as you become familiar with their upbringings, personalities and backgrounds. Characters make foolish decisions that can be risky or risk a rift in the bonds established which occur naturally and could actually happen with anyone in real life. In particular, the actions of one of the major characters in the series relates to the student protests taking place in Japan during the late 1960s connected to the country's relations with America which were still touchy following Japan's loss in World War II to the West, a nice touch in believably depicting the events of the time period.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw I could find with Kids on the Slope came in the form of its final episode where events felt rushed and it left some details on the developments of some characters rather unclear, especially in the case of Sentaro.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the series features beautiful and well-detailed settings of the various Kyushu locales that the characters settle or go through and features fluid animation in many instances from anything like high school students walking to school to close-up shots of characters playing different musical instruments. Character designs are well-designed and detailed as well, though the facial designs of characters looked a bit rough in close-up shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm quite glad that I had a chance of seeing Kids on the Slope as its excellent fleshing out of characters, accurate portrayal of 1960s Japan and Yoko Kanno's musical presence definitely stuck out for me. This is quite easily one of my favorite titles of 2012 thus far.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is in a genre of its own. I've never watched an anime that touched me quite like this one. Not only is the animation breath taking, at least for me, but I really enjoyed the tying in of the music with a day in the life.\r\nI give the story a 9, simply because it's a cute story. I loved the development with interpersonal relationships, the real emotion, and how the story actually progresses in relation to time passing.\r\nI give the art a 10, because the style appeals to me aesthetically. The movements of Sentarou and Kaoru when playing their corresponding instruments matchesup beautifully with how someone actually plays it. The little details within the anime are especially appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nI give the sound a 10 without a doubt. The songs are beautiful, hands down. How they pair all the instruments throughout the anime flow beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters get a 10. They all have their own personalities, and although I felt that the same thing kept happening between the main character and others, I think it shows the consistency with situations and people's behavior.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment also gets a 10. I feel like I was an onlooker to them living their life and I was friends with them and was in the background. It was easy for me to relate to them, partially because I'm currently in high school, but I enjoyed seeing their emotions and having them react to outside influence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it 9. I enjoyed the anime completely until it was the last episode. I felt the ending was a disappointment, and I felt cheated out of a potentially good anime ending, but I don't think it should sway you from watching the anime anyway. Overall, the story was excellent, and I'd absolutely recommend it, but just take the anime with a grain of salt.",

            "content": "It took me 9 months to finish this series because it was very hard for me to stay on this.  So why am I giving this an 8?\r\nStory: It's a simple-yet-not-so-simple coming-of-age story of three friends and a connection with music, which is a big underlying theme.  If you're a music lover (especially jazz), you'll very much enjoy this series as some conflicts are resolved with music rather than words.  While the story isn't groundbreaking and has a conflict (and in some cases, predictable), it became much more enjoyable as the series continued.  So if you're stuck in the first fewepisodes, keep at it.  It certainly feels like a really dry drama at times but becomes more enjoyable and has a decent ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation is unique, though a bit more shoujo style yet slightly retro look.  It definitely tries to keep with the late 60's/70's rural Japan feel.  The opening introduction is animated beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The jazz is very well done, with Yoko Kanno doing the intro theme and some of the piano throughout the series, generally very consistent with the theme.  It doesn't stray away from the music-based show.  Both the English and Japanese dubs are spot on and well done (except Seiji, which I'll explain later).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the only part I felt the series was weak.  You really can't like any of the characters except Sentaro, and even then, he's more of a supporting character.  I'm not sure why some shows insist on having a main character that is not likeable nor someone you can sympathize for.  Ritsuko is a stereotypical shy girl that can't decide on what she wants, Sentaro is almost the stereotypical muscle-bound blockhead, and Kaoru is an anti-social nerd.  They're mostly flat characters with no ambition to develop them in 12 episodes.  As a slice-of-life show, that might be fine but because this show works to evolve the character relationships and school life, it especially makes it hard to really want to get into the show.  Also, I have a small problem with how the English adaptation pretty much made one of characters more ridiculously flamboyantly gay rather than effeminate and a bit more subtle.  Going back and forth from the original material, it felt like the ADR wanted him to stand out more than he needed to for the English dub, which in turn made him more obnoxious (and in some cases, made him comedy relief where it wasn't needed).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Flaws aside, by the time I got to the 6th episode, it got more fun to watch and I really started to enjoy the show.  Again, the music kept the show going and always fun to listen to the performances throughout the shows.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The music drew me into the series.  The animation was wonderful and the way they tie in the story, characters, and music together was well done.  The show finishes on a high note (no pun intended) and keeps consistent throughout the entire series.  I don't consider this a show for everyone in fact, I'd say it's more for classical and jazz lovers and targeted for an older and a bit more mature demographic because of the pacing and themes throughout the show.   Again, if you've only seen a few episodes, keep going and bear with the pacing.  The characters do have their annoying human moments but again they don't get their moments without a reason or personal revolution.",

Let me tell you why.\r\nSTORY : 6\r\nSakamichi no Apollon takes place in Japan of the late 60's.\r\nBasically, it's about a transfered student called Kaoru Nishimi who is alone and who is going to make friends and discover himself a passion for jazz at the same time.\r\nThe plot, beyond being very basic is interesting for two main reasons :\r\n- I know few anime which take place in Japan of the 60's, which is interesting to see how it was like back then, politically, musically... Don't expect too much though(it stays in the background).\\n\r\n- it deals with relationships : friendship, love and it's quite realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why only 6 ?\\n\\n\r\nThe big problem in this adaptation is that it's evolving too quickly (3 years in 12 episodes !!!!).\\n\r\nWatching this, I didn't feel the emotions I'd felt in the manga.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART : 3  \\n\\n\r\nMAPPA.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nDo I really need to develop ?\\n\r\nI don't know : maybe some people actually like their 3D graphisms.

            "content": "It can be a bit trope-y, but Kids On The Slope is a well animated and scored anime drama.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is nice, but at times it feels like it's trying too hard to be a drama. Certain key events don't feel entirely natural. The last couple episodes suffer from this issue in particular, where the cast makes a series of emotionally charged but not completely believable choices to keep the tension up. The ending is still nice, but a part of me is left wondering \"there had to have been better ways for these people to go about this\".\r\nART & SOUND\r\nThe highlight of this showhas to be the music sessions, which display not only the incredible jazz soundtrack but also some stunning character animation. Body animation gets amazingly fluid and realistic, they must have rotoscoped the image over film of actual musicians. Jazz predominates the soundtrack, but classical music and 1960's Rock-And-Roll also make appearances, and this has to be the first time I've ever heard traditional Christian hymns in an anime. On the voice acting front, this show features some of the most impressive English I've ever heard in a Japanese dub- I've heard some MANGLED Engrish in subbed anime before, some of the English here could almost pass for natural.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI know this show was made earlier so it may not be a fair criticism, but I still couldn't help thinking \"I've seen these characters in Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju\". The skinny, socially proper, somewhat effeminate male lead, his big, manly, rowdy, goofball of a best friend, the beautiful older woman with sometimes dubious romantic judgement, they all fit rather neatly into archetypes I've seen before. Still, K.O.T.S. does a decent of making them an interesting cast to follow.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nKids On The Slope is a decent drama, and I'd definitely recommend it for those who love top quality music in their anime, but ultimately it's too formulaic to make the jump from 'good' to 'great'.",

            "content": "Hitherto, I had been reluctant to foray into the world of music-themed anime. I envisioned five-minute long performances interminably seguing into one another, puncturing the narrative into a bullet-holed score sheet through which one could just about discern an actual story. If I wanted to listen to music, I contended, then I would listen to music, and not try to parcel the experience into a twelve-episode series about neurotic high-school students. Music to flavour anime, to nourish it, to help support the scaffolding that sustained the universe one was willingly entering - yes, of course, that I would heartily accept. \r\nBut music in anime asan end, and not a means? \\n\\n\r\nSuch a presumption proved fallacious. After I tackled the first few episodes of Kids on the Slope, I realized that offered here was the musical elements of Cowboy Bepop and Samurai Champloo raised by a few degrees, finally nudged into the narrative; the music had graduated from its former position as a condiment to an ingredient. Shinichir\u014d Watanabe had finally delved head-first into an anime about music.\\n\\n\r\nBut only nominally so.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope is a cocktail, and jazz functions here in a similar manner to gunmanship and swordsmanship in Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. The nucleus of the show is similarly parallel: two males, both of whom excel in the designated surface theme, are bound in an unlikely alliance with one female, and the three of them get into all sorts of hi-jinks and hullabaloos until their joint adventure ultimately culminates in [spoiler alert]. \\n\\n\r\nThe social commentary here is a lot more obvious, though, and the historical setting is utilized to its fullest as the pressing problems of the mid-to-late sixties bare their teeth at us intermittently. The exhibition of Japan\u2019s post-war consciousness, scarred and humbled, is amplified by the location, Kyushu, where a noticeable presence of US military bases force the local population into contact with gaijin. Changing social attitudes are framed in this racially uncomfortable setting besides the transition from jazz to rock \u2018n roll; John Coltrane is dead, and girls are throwing their knickers into the air for four unlikely lads from Liverpool. Kaoru and Sentaro, our two jazz-playing protagonists, are sitting at the end of a musical arch, plugging away at an increasingly unpopular art-form as their celebrity-status-seeking contemporaries don electric guitars and sing love, love me do.\\n\\n\r\nDiverging from the templates of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, Kids on the Slope sprouts love triangles galore. Indeed, the series gives School Rumble a run for its money in terms of the immense pile-up of interdependent, ill-fated romances that form a cat\u2019s cradle at the heart of the narrative. Thankfully, we feel a sufficient amount of pathos to at least somewhat care about the hearts of each of the characters presented to us in this angst-ridden drama - but in twelve episodes, the romantic endeavours of five people can feel a little unconvincing at times, squished as they are between social commentary, historical reflection, and musical appreciation. \\n\\n\r\nBrother Jun, although an admittedly necessary character for the disenfranchised-60s-university-student perspective he supplies, was drawn a little hastily, and his escapades with his semi-forbidden young lover, Furika, felt slapped on. It was Sentaro, subtly and lovingly revealed to us through a series of heart-rending flashbacks, that charged at the frontiers of my tear-ducks; he is crafted in fully-fledged three-dimensional glory, and acts as a representation of a torn-in-two post-war Japan for reasons I shall, out of courtesy to prospective viewers, not disclose.\\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetic is satisfying; pristine, cerulean, and colourful, it nevertheless conservatively tip-toes around anything that could be described as creative. This lack of exploration is encapsulated in the bland opening which, though concerning an anime about jazz, bizarrely contains no jazz, and is instead a beige, happy-clappy, pseudo-J-pop ordeal that does, grudgingly, grow on you. This blip aside, there is a coherence to the show - it is a cohesive product, polished and complete, and I would have finished it in one sitting if the leaden feeling in my eye-lids didn\u2019t dictate that I instead take two.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's not like I don't like Slice of life but I definitely don't go out of my way to watch any of them. And with that being said I don't regret watching this one as it definitely hit all the right pros of being a slice of life and if there's a key word that does cometo mind it's laid back. The story stayed at a great pace for the first few episodes around the end it did speed up quite a bit especially in the last two with the accident and the 8 year time-skip conclusion. I'm not sure if this anime adapted everything that the mangaka has created in her manga adaptation I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't. But nonetheless as an anime only watcher I felt it was done well. As I didn't feel any sort of unsatisfaction by the time it concluded. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10) Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.5/10) Good+ \\n\\n\r\nI can tell just by looking at the cover and a couple of pages of the manga that MAPPA tried to keep the art style of Yuki's manga adaptation authentic to some degree when it came to adapting her work. Her art style isn't the best in my opinion but it's definitely unique. The animation seemed fine not much in a slice of life to show off anything that would require heavy animation for other than the small fight scenes that the character Sentaro got and them running down the slope. So MAPPA did a good job there also nothing to mind blowing but definitely nothing to really complain about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great for Sakamichi No Apollon and seeing that this anime does has music as one of it's key elements, it's a given. It was nice to hear the Jazz and Classic music that the main characters played during the anime. And the voice acting was pretty good also (English Dub) there were some background characters that had voices actors that I felt didn't put any effort into their lines but background characters are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things but it did stand out for those split moments, other than that no real issues sound was great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Sakamichi no Apollon were very good. They did all have good, reasonable and believable personalities for the most part which is what I think you should shrive to create when you make a good slice of life it should be close to realism when it comes to your characters which I felt this series did a very good job on. It there's one issue that did stand out to me when it came to the characters is firstly they are around the ages of 15-16 which it considered Teen or Pre-teen the least not kids which it the name of the anime (nitpicking! SURE WHATEVER IT'S FORGIVEN) point is the new found emotion of \"love\" is introduced to both the main character Sakamichi and Sentaro as apparently they've never had this feeling before. I can only speak for myself but I do feel it was rather unrealistic and took me out of the mood asking questions like \"wait they are 15-16 just getting these types of feelings?\". Like I said I can only speak for myself since you know I've only lived one life so far (the one I'm living now) and I had my first crush or what ever as early as the 2nd grade which should be around the ages of 6-7. So hopefully you can understand how it can be hard for me to find this believable when the age differences between 6-7 and 15-16 when it comes to having such emotions for the first time. Like I said I can only speak for myself but if you are reading this you tell me who was your first crush and how old were you? Because I was around 6-7 and I can only speak for myself if you were around their age when u experience the same and good for you but I couldn't relate. On the other hand the characters did give off other emotions later in the anime that are indeed relate-able which I do give them credit for but the specific one I can't.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good \\n\\n\r\nI was able to finish this in one sitting, which should show that it did keep my interest enough for me not to say \"Ok I'll finish the rest of the episodes later\". One could say \"oh it's because you just finish getting caught up with One Piece (which I have) 12 episodes ain't shit in comparison (which is true)\" BUT I don't remember ever being able to finish a 12 episode anime in one sitting usually not matter how intrigued I am I'll always end up saying \"Alright I'll finish the rest later\". (Or maybe it's because One Piece has increase my tolerance when it comes to saying that WHO KNOWS). All I know is All I know, and what I know is that I fairly enjoyed this anime enough to binge the whole thing end of story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good \\n\\n\r\nFor a slice of life anime this was a very good one, if anyone ever asked what slice of life anime have I watch I can indeed say this anime proudly as the first one with I were to name a list of Slice of life anime that I've seen and enjoyed.",

The MC\u2019s are in middle school. They fall in love innocently but are new to the concept. Viewers will feel sympathetic to their naivety and will be irritated by their lack of confidence. The drama lies in complicated romance triangles, betrayals, jealousy and doubts, but most heavily on friendship. These aspects reveal different sides to the characters' personalities.\r\nKaoru is physically vulnerable but is academically intelligent,a weak hearted and self-centred protagonist; he runs away instead of apologising after hurting others in order to protect himself. Sentarou does the best for those around him. He is tall, scar-faced and is feared by his school mates. He, unselfishly, places others\u2019 well-beings above his own, and does what he wants.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are vital to prevent stagnation to the plot. They are not there to provide comic-relief; they are multi-dimensional persons with their own lives and strong roles in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is refreshing, toned to fit its environment. The animation is crisp but fluid, with movements well matched to the beats and dialogue. VA\u2019s are excellent in expressing a mix of emotions. The soundtracks are pleasing to the ears. Its opening song is happy with hints of angst, which reflects the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take much effort to dive into the series\u2019 setting because it\u2019s very atmospheric. The music, the art style, the characters\u2019 clothes and behaviours make this feel like the 1960s. Do not expect hearing jazz in every scene as this is not a musical; the music is mixed in to incite and compliment the drama, having said that, whenever the characters do play music, they give off plenty of energy and passion. Their distinctive actions match the beats, the camera angles give us different perspectives, and the licensed pieces themselves are dynamic, easily making these moments the highlights of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, Sakamichi no Apollon has some predictable twists and foreshadow, they are very well executed. The tears and laughs don't feel forced. The pace might appear slow at the start and fast towards the end, but it is creditable to the director for setting up the characters and plots sufficiently to allow the viewers to keep up with the follow-throughs that approach the finale.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope will leave you wanting more but satisfied without the need for more. At time of writing, it is available to stream legally on Crunchyroll.",

            "content": "Although I really love both anime and music, music-themed anime has always seemed to let me down. From over-dramatic and sappy Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (which I absolutely loathe) to all-flash-and-no-substance idol series like Uta no Prince-Sama and Love! Live The School Idol Project (as well as shows like Kiniro no Corda which fall somewhere in-between), music anime often fails to convey what music is really all about. Regardless of how many times I've heard all these characters say how much they love music and how it brings them together, I've always had a really hard time believing them. Until now, that is. \r\nSinceSakamichi no Apollon is a music-themed anime which relishes in its simplicity and realism, its story is far easier to believe and its characters are far easier to relate to (compared to all the other shows in this category). Although I grew up loving the magical girl genre (and other crazy supernatural stuff like vampires), I can definitely appreciate anime that is far more grounded in reality when it is done as masterfully as Kids on the Slope. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the unique and understated art and animation to a color palette that is extremely vibrant yet also realistic, everything about this anime is beautifully subtle. Although the emphasis on a more traditional Japanese lifestyle as well as a setting involving a slope and a seaside town in the 1960s initially reminded me of Studio Ghibli's \"From up on Poppy Hill\", Kids on the Slope is far more complex and interesting, hence also far more entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being able to draw this comparison, I still found the setting of the story to be extremely refreshing, for there are only so many slice-of-life shows set in city schools you can take before getting bored. Additionally, this anime did not revolve around idols (like UtaPri and Love! Live) or classical music (like Kiniro no Corda or Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), but instead decided to focus on jazz - a music genre that is often underrated and somewhat neglected in our day and age. While I would personally listen to classical music, JPOP, rock, or any other genre before jazz on any given day, I know not to judge a book by its cover and to always keep an open mind (especially when it comes to anime). \\n\\n\r\nIt is perhaps for this reason that I was pleasantly surprised by the actual jazz music used in this show as well as the fact that I enjoyed an anime focusing on my least favorite music genre way more than I did those that focused on genres I actually like. As such, I think it's safe to say that you don't need to know anything about jazz (or even be a fan of it in the slightest) to be able to enjoy and appreciate this series. Furthermore, this anime is super inclusive when it comes to music and features classical pieces like \"Clair de Lune\" from Debussy as well as songs from The Beatles and even The Sound of Music. Additionally, the use of JPOP is almost inevitable when it comes to anime openings and endings. While I wasn't a fan of the opening initially, it did grow on me over time and seemed rather fitting for the general mood and tone of the series. The ending, on the other hand, made me happy from the first time I heard it, for I immediately recognized Motohiro Hata's voice (which I first heard in Kotonoha no Niwa and have been in love with ever since). \\n\\n\r\nAnother positive aspect involving  the sound of this series is of course the voice acting. Although none of my personal favorites were featured here, I still think that all of the seiyuu did a pretty good job and managed to convey the emotions and personalities of their characters really well. I could also hear some regional accents going on (which are always hard to pull off in any language) and I can only presume that they were done well, for if a foreigner with no knowledge of Japanese can recognize them, then so can the actual Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, this anime is rather subtle and understated in many ways (especially when compared to most of the other shows we've had recently).  However, even if there are no crazy hair colors or fancy special effects, the animation still feels pretty sleek and modern. Despite being initially skeptical about it given how the flying music notes in the opening seemed to resemble those from Your Lie in April and the somewhat flat character designs seemed to echo Studio Ghibli (both of which things I actually hate), I was pleasantly surprised by how great and unique the animation actually was. Although at times it seemed more like a Western style of animation rather than a Japanese one, this would obviously fit with the more \"Western\" music genres (like jazz and rock) that the anime was supposed to portray really well, so it also felt appropriate and refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the only thing more accurate than the pacing of the animation and the \"camera angles\" was the actual pacing of the story. While seemingly simplistic and relaxed, the plot does have plenty of drama here and there (which almost always seems believable and never over-the-top) and often delves into darker topics involving family issues and personal struggles. If you also happen to like love triangles then you're in for a treat, as there is not only one but two of them, with both  eventually transforming into some sort of hexagon. While I don't normally care for such complicated relationships, it was definitely a nice break from the generic harem and reverse-harem setups which are lacking both in purpose and imagination and unfortunately also happen to be pretty much everywhere today. \\n\\n\r\nFrom its clever use of music and animation to its enthralling pacing and storytelling, it's been a while since I've seen an anime that combines  tradition and nostalgia with modernity and innovation quite so well. It's been even longer, however, since I've watched an anime that could actually make me believe its not-so-ridiculous setups and plot devices and therefore also often make me feel \"warm and fuzzy\" inside. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I understand that the themes of music and relative realism may not be for everyone, I still think that everyone should give this anime a try. As someone who had almost completely given up on music anime and then suddenly found this little gem and fell in love with it, I think there's definitely hope left not only for the genre itself, but also for anyone who watches it expecting to fall in love with it (or at least enjoy it) too. \\n",

            "content": "I don't write reviews often. In fact, when it comes to choosing which shows to watch, I never really listen to them, because different people have different opinions. But just hear me out when I say that this anime is something special.\r\nI'm assuming that whoever is reading this hasn't seen the show yet, so I'll do my best to leave out spoilers. \r\nThe story is strange in that it starts out as a very independent, feel good show. Two kids meet and find friendship through music, yadayadayada... However, as it progresses, things start to morph into romance and drama, which may leave you with tears.That being said, it does end well. There are a lot of love connections being made throughout, but none of them are stupidly handled. The pacing was excellently done seeing as it didn't feel rushed, and when there were time skips, they made sure the viewer was aware of them. Personally, I like the way the story unfolded and the twists and turns made me want to keep watching. (It's not some slice of life that will make you bored!!!)\\n\\n\r\nArt is tough to talk about when it comes to this show. At a glance, and without knowing anything about the mood, it may come off as mediocre because of the airbrush shading and uncomplicated animation. However, I love the way they did this. Someone in a forum commented this: \"It's like looking at real life through an anime lense.\" I completely agree. Even the locations are based on a real town in japan. This can be applied to story and characters as well. Everything just feels so real.  On another note, the art is always solid. Never any wonky faces or angles. I believe the art matches the mood and story of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound. yes. Let me just tell you one thing. I was moved to actual tears by one of the jam sessions between Sen and Bon ( You'll know what I mean once you watch ! ) The instrumentals, when they play, actually match the animation?? amazing? It's something really rare to see, surprisingly. When it comes to the opening and ending songs, I really like them. The opening is very lighthearted and makes me happy. I didn't like it at first but it grows on you. And the incorporation of the drums and trumpet into it! It's great. The ending is very solemn which I think fits because often times episodes end on low notes. The music is something really to be experienced rather than read about. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are relatively all built upon, which is pretty crazy since there are so many of them introduced. Though, because there are many the development of them can only be so deep. The characters are so human... \\n\r\nThough because they are human there are times when they make bad decisions. It's frustrating but real. The personalities of the characters are really built and it's easy to tell when that happens when you can predict how they will react in a situation ( it's a good thing! ) Though I find some characters a nuisance, they do all serve a role. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, my enjoyment. Ya'll already know I love this anime. It's actually taken a spot in my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love music, even if you don't and just want some good drama, please watch this anime. It's such a beautiful piece of art. Every episode is worth the time. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens,Brown paper packages tied up with strings, These are a few of my favorite things.\"\r\nOkay people I'm just going to come out with it right now...Kids on the Slope is hands down one of the greatest animes I have seen not of just this year but in a long long long while...and I have seen some pretty great anime recently. Let me tell you from the moment this anime was announced having both Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno working on the project, my heart filled up with glee and yours should've aswell. Even before, I didn't realize how much expectations were going to be surpassed from this anime. Everything about this show is just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope follows the standard Slice of Life formula of having no central plot but rather show excerpts of life as it is displaying dramatic moments, and this show definitely delivers in the drama aspect of things. I mean it every episode of this show delivers, even when an episode starts out slow, it picks up leading to ending that fills you with goosebumps all over. Whether it is a serious or happy moment, you will enjoy this show from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nI think what I like about this show the most and what Shinichiro Watanabe is good at doing is making relationships between unlikely people. If you have seen Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo (and if you haven't shame on you for not being a real anime fan), then you probably understand what I'm talking about. In this we have Kaoru Nishimi, who is a rich boy who likes to only keep to himself more the like the anti-social archetype. Then there's Ritsuko Mukae, who is the cute naive type. Finally, there's Sentaro Kawabuchi, who's the tough bad boy archetype. However, the beauty of all this is that all these characteristics change through the course of the show and suddenly the characters that you thought were not going to get along end up becoming the best friends...two of them even more than that. The beauty gets even better as these characters start becoming likable and change in the second episode of the show exhibiting the excellent pacing this show brings. I myself was afraid that the show was not going to be interesting considering how fast things evolve and it turned out it kept me interested every week plus love it even more than I already did. I think what I love most about this show is that doesn't rely on forced manipulation. In other words, it doesn't try to be too cute (such as Usagi Drop) or be too melodramatic (like AnoHana). It all comes out naturally and realistically, the way real life drama is like. Unscripted and improvised all throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side of things, the animation will throw people off. For me, I love it being that it's animated by the same person who did Paradise Kiss, another favorite of mine. However, a lot of people not used to this art style will be swayed a bit, but then again I think that you'll love it even if you don't like the art style. Plus, if anything this is probably one of the more accurate depictions of Japanese people than most anime in general. I think however another huge strength of this show would be it's music. Once again, the music of Kids On the Slope is done by none other than the great Yoko Kanno. The OP and ED are good but they don't really go with the Jazz feel of the show, but they are great nonetheless. The soundtrack is great with classic Jazz hits such Art Blakley's Moanin and Lullaby of Birdland, and when these tracks are played, you remain silent and are breathless at the cinematography of the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again Shinchiro Watanabe brings us another show that not only is a masterpiece of it's own right, but is also something that can be appreciated by the Xenophobic type. Really, Bebop, Champloo, and now this are among the shows that I believe any person can watch to get into anime. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. GO WATCH IT NOW!",

            "content": "It's very difficult for me to give this anime an accurate score given how much the initial nine episodes differ from the final three. The former were nothing short of masterful, infused with that lovely awareness that everything is transcient that I think Watanabe does so well. The music was beautiful (thanks again, Kano), and the characters were endearing. It felt real, and as a good friend of mine said, it felt like you're being presented with a piece of art. For those first nine I would probably give it a 9.\r\nHowever, the last three were disappointing, the final being the most disappointing with anout of place time-skip (8 years is pushing it for a 12 episode anime) and a visibly rushed conclusion. While it wasn't bad or even poor, I would say that it teetered on \"fine\" and the fact that the previous nine were so masterful made \"fine\" look like a whole lot of nothing. Score for the last three is probably a 5 or a 6. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted so much to say that this anime was as thouroughly outstanding as everyone seems to think it is, but while in part it has some moving, poignant scenes, the overall story is marred by its rushed conclusion. Still, I respect it and would recommend it to people who enjoy slice of life, coming of age, period/historical dramas, or anyone who likes Watanabe's other works. \\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7\\n",

            "content": "\"My favorite things are the footsteps of a certain person heading towards the house, the sound of the piano and drums riffing in the basement, and the laughter of two boys.\"\r\nSakamichi no Appolon feels like a brief, gentle touch of those things most of us dream of: music band, hanging out with friends, being in love with a girl... But the one who really runs the show in this title is the one and only jazz. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story is pretty good at the first half of anime, but at the second one all the characters get screwed over making too many mistakes. Same thingabout drama: in one episode it feels unnatural and artificial while in the other one it really gets the hold of you. \\n\r\nThe other thing I'm still complaining about is the ending. It has no logic, no common sense, nothing. If it would end right after the train scene, it would be pretty sad, but realistic at the very least. C'mon, Watanabe...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best pros of the title. It's really colorful and alive, plus, there's no typical moe elements, emoticons and other annoying stuff. The character's cheeks blushing never felt so real.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nNot much to say about that. Jazz is flowing through this title and I was personally screaming 'Let's jam!' everytime the guys started playing. Music in Sakamichi no Appolon connects people, starts competitions and generally makes everyone shake off the bad feelings much faster, then any magic in the world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters fit in the anime pretty well. \\n\r\nKaouru is a typical depressed individual, always feeling out of place and having noone to care about, at least, at first. Didn't expect him to get along with Sentarou at all. \\n\r\nHis personality is quite contradictory. Today he keeps calm and teaches someone, how to date properly, tomorrow he cries like a psychopath. I personally find his sufferings pretty pathetic and childish at times, but his problems still feel really human.\\n\r\nSentarou. Who would predict, that a typical school bully would be so kind-hearted and easy-going? He really makes contrast with Kaouru, but I still feel, that he is a bit to quick with making decisions.\\n\r\nRitsuko is a pretty normal girl. The love story in  Sakamichi no Appolon is far from being the best one in the world, and I still get a feeling, that it could end in a much better way if both characters acted a bit differently.\\n\r\nI personally liked the story of Yurika and Junichi. It really shows how far can people go, if they care about someone and it left quite a bit of stuff to think about as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe musical part of  Sakamichi no Appolon is a real masterpiece. I enjoyed everything else too, despite the story and the characters personalities being really strange, at least, in my personal opinion.\\n\r\nI would still advice this title to everyone, who wants to dive in the world of jazz music, youth and little moments of human happiness.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon was a fun ride, but the flaws it does possess hold it back from being the top-notch Watanabe/Kanno combo you'd expect. But I'll start with the pros. The story is entirely heartwarming. It's a coming-of-age tale with flair and raw, likable characters. Sentaro, Kaoru, Ritsuko, and Yurika fight and make up just like we as teens would, and watching them do it is easily identifiable. The backdrop that unites them - jazz - weaves its way into the fabric of their dynamic cleanly, to the point where Sen and Kaoru jamming seems nothing short of normal. And enjoyable. It's plain to seehow good friends the two are when they can sit down and play, no questions asked. Plus, every song that gets time during the show is excellent ear candy, even for those like myself who don't have a love for the genre. The music is equally complemented by the art. Though it may be simple character-wise, it proves beautiful in its minimalism; in some ways faintly reminiscent of the works of Miyazaki. Finally, the time period of the 1960's - an unorthodox one to represent -  is executed well, never becoming glaring nor hidden to the viewer. It, like the music and art, integrate so nicely, it's as natural as an after-school session.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the cons. I understand this is an adaptation of a manga, and I haven't read it to compare the two, so I'll go off what I know. The plot, at times, is lacking. It seems drama was injected into it, instead of being a natural part of the many relationships that exist. I had my hands raised in questionable disbelief as Kaoru again instigated another spat between himself and Sen, all because of an innocuous misstep in the pair's relationship. The same applies in reverse, and with other characters. While they may be identifiable, that doesn't mean they're always understandable, and it can be irksome to watch obvious mistakes pop up time and time again. Where do many of these mistakes come from? As a slice-of-life, it's bound to be romance in abundance,  and in abundance it is. However, the relationship triangles that shape as the protagonists mature can't shake a definite feeling of being routine. You've seen it before, in a similar form, and by now it's well-worn.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the most disappointing part of the series was the ending, which skimped on closure and felt plain rushed. In the end, though, I left Sakamichi as a whole satisfied, and maybe that's all I really hoped from it. It's an anime to like, not love. And in my case, I liked it a whole lot.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope, or simply KotS) is a heartfelt, realistic look at a group of high-school kids and the effect that friendship, love and jazz has on their development. It is hard to describe in a short review; people write essays on the impact of music on someone's life, or the importance of friendship. It's much more enjoyable to watch a fully-realized, self-contained story complimented by beautiful art and simply incredible music, though.\r\nStory: At the start of the series, it was tough to guess how the story would progress. The experience of watching the story play out over 12 episodes waswonderful. The story moved at a slow enough pace that you could feel the weight of a character's actions, or the emotional uncertainty that someone was experiencing. These dramatic moments are not rushed, and offer a chance to really connect with the characters. However, the story does not drag; even at a short 12 episodes, the story is fully realized and finished.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story revolves around high-school-aged kids, there is a refreshing lack of melodrama. While Kaoru sometimes overreacts, he will often talk with Sen and Ritsuko and try to work out their problems. It is nice to see teens portrayed in a more realistic light, rather than seeing them get in to trouble because no one wants to share their problems or issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt: A soft, natural color palette for the backgrounds and crisp colors and lines on the characters makes the show very easy on the eyes. The character designs are realistic, and varied enough so that it is easy to remember who is who. The animation was very smooth, and I enjoyed that fact that when the boys are playing their instruments, it seems like they are _really_ playing. The hand movements match the rhythm and pitches on the instruments; it is not a stock animation of someone simply banging on piano keys. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The most outstanding aspect of the show is the music. Jazz is a major theme of the show, and it is used perfectly. The boys' jam sessions, performances and even just listening to the record players is a toe-tapping treat. The musical selections match the development of the characters and their relationships, and are perfect complements to the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs seem oddly out of place, because they are not jazz tunes. Personally, I didn't care for them and skipped them. \\n\\n\r\nI listened to the English dub, and found no faults with it. It was a little strange when the main female character started singing \"My Favorite Things\" in English with a Japanese accent, which seemed like a carry-over from the Japanese dub, but other than that instant the voice acting was great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The other outstanding aspect of KotS is the characters and their developing relationships. The unlikely friendship between Kaoru and Sentarou is a constant during years of crushes, falling-outs and make-ups. Kaoru and Sen's bromance is the one thing that seems to bring everyone back together, but the boys are no strangers to tough situations. As they learn more about each other and their troubled pasts, they grow closer to each other, and also grow as adults. It was very easy to relate to most characters, and the situations they found themselves in. \\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters are all memorable, and have major effects on the story and main characters' developments. The supporting characters really drive the story forward, and keep the story from being stagnant. Without them, we would be stuck in a love-triangle pit that many romance shows find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: KotS is an excellent recommendation if you like jazz, drama and a great story. It is light but still engaging, and not bogged down by unnecessary melodrama that so often accompanies high-school settings.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Kids on the Slope\\n\r\nGOOD JAZZ, emotional, great art, not rushed, GREAT JAZZ\\n",

Nothing wrong with that. The show want us to think that is about jazz, it isn't. But that is not the real problem, in fact the music was good. The jam sessions scenes were the best part in the all thing. The 1-dimensional characters were the majorissue for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is simple. Except when it gets to the love theme, is just plain, flat and shallow in KotS. You can argue, that love in those teen years is confusing and full of misunderstandings, but Kaoru, Sentarou and Ritsuku are very poorly developed, for the show to work. Don't watch this anime if you're imagining jazz and joy, with musicians growing in their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThe melodrama is quite disturbing, the quality is really low and boring and expected and obvious [insert synonyms here].\\n\\n\r\n(minor spoiler ahead)\\n\\n\r\nWhen things go bad there is always a train to give you hope - Same scene 3 times ...\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review.",

            "content": "Hey guys, another round of Robert's Too Late Reviews coming at ya! Glad to have ya. Today we're going to be talking over the dubbed version of Kids on the Slope, and about how this is a very touching anime about musicians and the power of music mixed with love triangles and the angst of high school that often boils over. Quick of it is, because this review is LONG, I enjoyed this series a lot and recommend giving it a go, especially if the whole 'coming of age' angle appeals to you. Lately I've not had reason to break out the ladder and rotateout a pic on the RTLR wall of musical madness, will today's entry be the day? Let's get this joint jumping, cats. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nFirst thing I should say is that this is very much a high school romance story. If you are not interested in the interpersonal conflicts and the whole 'awkward love' phase of life, this is NOT the show for you. Maybe this is the kind of story that adolescent girls daydream about in study hall, but hey, maybe you, dear reader ARE a adolescent girl reading this looking for just this kind of thing. Maybe you're a middle aged man that likes love stories. Maybe you're somewhere between, or even outside this range, who am I to know? If you like fast and furious fights or harems or 'lets do our best!' idol anime, that's great, and there are some great anime out there that will fit your tastes well. This one is just as much about the drama as it is about the music. This is not Love Live! or Idolmaster. \\n\\n\r\nI know, I romanticize romance, I really do. I feel that Kids on the Slope for the most part presents a compelling look at young love and even love in general, with only a few missteps. So if you're down for a 'chick flick' type ride, you've found a good one to run with. \\n\\n\r\nThe synopsis seems to read to me like the show only covers a single summer for the kids, but this isn't the case. We're presented with at least a full calendar year as the annual school festival happens twice. Through this time we get unlikely characters building bonds over music and overcoming trials and pain and tragedy while also celebrating the gift to the world that is music, specifically jazz music. Playing together brings two guys that probably would never think of even talking to each other into a deep friendship, although it is not one without a good dose of jealousy and issues to resolve. We have the loner pianist who has been isolated because he's moved from school to school as a kid, and the tough guy drummer who lives his life for jamming to jazz, looking for his next fist fight, and with a general air of being fairly carefree. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the primary female of the cast, who's father happens to own the record shop that is the other side of the duplex that drummer guy lives in. She's not a musician, but with her being lifelong friends with the drummer, along with her dad's record shop, and his playing bass for the jazz sessions in the shop's basement, she remains central to the musical action. We then have a secondary character that is one cool cat and plays the trumpet, and the final female, a girl rescued by the drummer from a bunch of thugs and becomes friends with the group. Of course all these characters have their own internal drama going on, the loner pianist falling quickly for the record shop girl who is unsure of her own feelings regarding both him and the drummer. The drummer pretty much has a case of love at first sight for the side girl he saves from the thugs, and yet he has competition from trumpet man, who while also liking side girl has a whole ton of problems dealing with some of his fellow college students. So we have a lot going on, with music, either playing or enjoying, being the connecting thread among them all. \\n\\n\r\nNow to address something that might not be as understandable to non-musicians. There are a handful of times that of the main trio of pianist, drummer, and record shop girl there builds a lot of tension and drama. The pianist and drummer often don't see eye to eye, partly over the wavering feelings of record shop girl, partly over other issues. They have falling outs, and yet get in situations where one starts playing music, and the other one hesitantly joins in, and before you know it, their relationship is well on the way to mended just because they played together. This might seem absolutely ridiculous to some of you, but let me tell you, from my experience, it is absolutely true to life. \\n\\n\r\nA bit of background for ya. I play trumpet, and I played tuba in high school band. I know the simple trick of how to convert trumpet music to the tuba, and can play the trumpet part (which is usually the recognizable melody) on the tuba. My best friend also played the tuba, but did not know the trumpet trick. Me and him would be arguing over a girl or something, and not talking to each other, and yet he would sit down, and during warmups he would start playing the bass line to 'Push It' or 'Wild Thing' and before I knew it, I was blasting along the melody with him, and we were jamming out. We'd finish playing, and look at each other and one of us would say something along the lines of 'man, we're fighting over stupid crap, aren't we?' and we'd usually get over the issue right there. Playing together and having fun can really help a friendship through tough times. I'm not saying that a jam session cures all ills, but I am saying that the beginnings of 'I'm sorry, my bad' can be as simple as playing 'Smoke on the Water' together. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to address is the closeness between those two characters, the drummer and the pianist. They are close enough to almost appear as having a gay relationship. First off, so what? Is there anything wrong with that? Secondly, it is clearly bisexual at best as there's an enormous amount of jealousy between the pianist and drummer over record shop girl, who the pianist loves, and between drummer and trumpet man over the side girl. They both clearly fall for females, so even if it was a gay relationship, it wouldn't be an exclusive one. Yeah they hug it out in the face of tragedy, and are much less 'macho' about things than a lot of guys are. I think a fair bit of that, for sure in Western culture, is because of toxic masculinity. We have such a fear of being interpreted as gay that we go out of our way to chest thump and carry on in what we think is a 'manly' way, when really it's not. Yet our culture in a lot of places pushes men to not show their real concern for their guy friends because of this deeply flawed idealization of how a 'man' is supposed to act. You can act caring to your buddies, and still like girls, I promise. \\n\\n\r\nThere's more evidence to support them just having a deep platonic relationship, at least in the dubbed version. There is a side character who makes an appearance in a handful of episodes that is portrayed in an insensitive manner regarding his orientation. This kid talks and acts like he walked straight out of being a hairdresser in a bad '80's movie. We're talking 'oh my gawd girlfriend! Stop it!' kind of limp wristed portrayal, which I'm sure some of you will find, as I said, insensitive at best, and maybe even offensive at worst. Why would they make a character that seems almost mocking of gay men, like to Big Gay Al proportions, only to build a solid and respectful gay relationship between the two leads? Reminds me of El Cazador de la Bruja, and just like in that one, I don't think the creators would do that. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there's the ending. I have to note that I was just loving this show from top to bottom until the last episode. The ending is not bad by any means, and it's perfectly acceptable as a resolution to the storyline, but the sequence of events that culminate in that resolution kind of irritated me. I apologize for being cryptic about it, but I fear revealing what I consider to be a major spoiler if I say much more. You'll likely understand and see what irked me soon as you watch it. Not a deal breaker, but did have me saying 'well, I would have changed that part there to something else'. Otherwise it's a moving and good cap to the plot. Okay okay, I'll move on now. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI'm not too keen on simpler looks in anime, and prefer the more detailed, even if busier looking, approach. Kids is drawn in the former manner, with clean and simpler lines and animation. With this being a drama, we don't get all the usual tropes, and it gives the show a much more realistic look. I would term this style as elegant, even if simpler in detail. The overall aesthetic matches the mood and themes well, and the animation is well done. I honestly had moments where I forgot I was looking at animation, the artwork hit just the right note (pun intended) to seem as if I was watching live actors. This category teeters close to a ten for me, but just doesn't quite make it all the way. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne category that DID make it though was the sound. Excellent music flows through this anime. Of course with jazz music and performing together being such an important plot device, the music had best be done well, and Kids does not disappoint. If you aren't familiar with Art Blakey's 'Moanin', you will be, and likely love it, by the end. The songs are all jammin. The pianist, who starts out as a classical player with no real jazz experience, is appropriately stiff at the beginning before feeling the music in his soul. He then quickly becomes a proficient player. The drummer is banging good from the start, and old Brother Jun on the trumpet tears it up any time he's playing. Of course if jazz is not your thing, then this aint the show for you. If you're a cool cat, this anime's music will having you tapping your foot and bobbing your head along. \\n\\n\r\nThe other music in the show, the opening and closing themes, are a bit interesting. The opening is a groovy little tune, but it's not a jazz piece. I like the vocals in the opener, and the overall sound, but it's not a match to the music in the show. It's forgivable I think, but an odd choice for them to make. I honestly would have considered making 'Moanin' the opener because it is literally the primary theme within the episodes themselves. Now the closer is well chosen. Because this is still a high school romance drama, each episode tends to end on an emotional cliffhanger. The ending then steps in, a soaring ballad that is well executed, to bring the emotional rise to a crescendo, making the audience eager to see the next episode. While it is not jazz either, it's a good match for the 'feels' they use to try to hook us at the end of the shows. I like both songs enough that they make my general music playlist, so they are enjoyable on their own. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors in the dub are pretty well done. I like Chris Patton's work a great deal, and he does not disappoint as the lovelorn pianist. The record shop girl sounds appropriately cute, and the side girl has a nice tone about her as well. There's two things that stand out, voice acting-wise, that being the trumpet man and the drummer. The trumpet man is one cool cat, and speaks in this slow, bluesy-jazzy manner, and sounds like he walked right out of of the roaring '20's, even though this is set in the late '60's. I honestly would have not considered it out of place if the guy wore a zoot suit. He's just awesome sounding. \\n\\n\r\nThe drummer though, at the beginning he comments that his 16th birthday is approaching. The problem? The fool sounds like James Earl Jones. I mean seriously, this guy has a bass voice that does not sound at all like a 15 year old kid. Hell he could pass for 25 by voice alone easily. It doesn't help they draw him as a tall, muscularly built kind of character. He seems to look and sound like he's the same age as the college-attending trumpeter. I'm not saying his voice is bad, I'm just saying while he sounds really cool, he also has an adult man's bass voice. \\n\\n\r\nOf note as well is the gay kid who really does sound like South Park's Big Gay Al. I haven't checked but I wouldn't bat an eye if it was the same voice actor in both roles. I find him not only insensitive in regards to the way he spoke, I find his voice a fair bit grating as well. Otherwise the cast is absolutely well done and the music is absolutely on point. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nLike I have harped on already, gay kid is a bad stereotype and the story would have been just as well served without his over the top antics. At one point the pianist himself has an internal dialogue can calls the gay kid 'so flamboyant'. Its bad when you have other characters recognize that one person is a bad caricature. \\n\\n\r\nI've talked at length already about most of the characters in earlier sections so I'll try to keep this section brief. A quick rundown is that piano boy is has it bad for record shop girl, who in turn isn't sure who she likes and waffles a good bit. Drummer guy wants a girl who he's afraid he'll lose to trumpet man, and that girl kind of goes down a predictable path. Trumpet man has his demons to bear, but learns that it's okay to let others in. There are several times that the characters get a little too dramatic, but never is it to the point where they cross the line into pure stupidity. I mean, as I said, a high school romance drama is what you're signing up for, as should be plainly evident by the end of episode 2 at the latest. Hell, by the end of the first episode it's pretty clear the kind of story they are wanting to tell. The characters all carry their drama pretty well, and makes for enjoyable viewing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI did just say that I found the anime enjoyable, so that cat's out of the bag. I did really like the show, the tensions and drama between these unlikely friends, the longing for each other and the awkwardness that comes standard with most cases of falling in love. Others might poke fun at the dramatic tones of the various crushes and how they are played out, but I'm telling you, you'd find a lot of the same kinds of things happening in a work environment full of 30 and 40 year olds. Falling in love is a dramatic thing, and the wondering if your crush reciprocates your feelings or not. There's danger in revealing how you feel, and a deep need to do so as well. I think many people that knock this kind of thing have probably been in their relationship status for a while, and might have forgotten some of the finer details as to how it went down for them. Sure, some might just be more direct and that kind of person, but the sweaty palms, racing heartbeat, 'doki doki' feelings that comes with approaching that beautiful woman for the first time to put your heart on the line is usually for most of us a breathtaking moment. And sometimes it ends in a way that isn't the greatest, and sometimes too, drama follows as people work through their feelings, or discover if they even have them or not. This is what Kids presents, and if you're down, its a hell of a ride. \\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Record shop girl Ritsuko by default. The side girl is interesting, and they take her through some awesome developments so I really liked her, but record shop girl is the focus of all the attention, and by sheer presence wins out. She's cute, even if she's confused and causes all this drama. She comes across to me as being real to herself, and it seems just as difficult for her to sort through what she's feeling as it is for the guys to wait out her decision. I just wish her resolution in the plot was much closer to the way side girl ends. \\n\\n\r\nI say this thing is worth a serious spin, and I will admit I powered through a few episodes and had to rewatch them because I just couldn't bring myself to stop with just one show at a time. I had to find out what happened next, and found myself looking forward to that time of day that I watch my anime, eager to continue the series. That to me speaks volumes to a show's value, if you find yourself excited to continue the story. I know I sure did. The core trio of pianist, drummer, and record shop girl have made it onto the RTLR jammin wall, one of the few entries not exclusively made of females. This is one slope worth walking up for sure, all thumbs up!",

This time, he will come up against Sentar\u014d, the brawler feared by all the students. These two boys who appear to be of opposite character succeed in understanding each other and find common ground, especially through music.\r\nWe meet Kaoru. immediately, we understand what kind of boy he is. He is solitary, unsociable and even very stressed. He has the perfect profile to be excluded or bullied. moreover, he is of good family and had good grades.So he will be cataloged from the first day. Then we discover Sentar\u014d, he skips courses and never misses an opportunity to fight. Dynamic and jazz's passionate, Sentar\u014d won my sympathy !!\\n\\n\r\nThese two characters have classic personalities. On one side, we have the good student, quiet and lonely. On the other, we have the great big guy, feisty but ultimately harmless. They seem diametrically opposed. Yet both are uncomfortable at school and both are passionate about music. Gradually they will come together, with the help of Ritsuko, the charming delegate of class. I enjoyed this rapprochement between these three characters. The enthusiasm of the girl and the feisty character of Sentar\u014d will undoubtedly evolve Kaoru.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good and gives the series its comic dimension.\\n\\n\r\nOver the episodes, the budding friendship between Kaoru and Sentar\u014d will evolve even if sometimes the romantic feelings they develop in parallel will interfere. A love triangle is created from the first episode between our three protagonists. Then, other characters enter the scene and are interfering in their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nBesides romance, school life takes a significant place although it does serve as backdrops. The relationship with the other students are important because they can see how Kaoru managed to find his place in this school.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also omnipresent. It allowed our two heroes to find each other and it will hold again this role several times in the series, especially in the final scene.\\n\\n\r\nI rarely pay attention to the soundtrack of an anime. Nevertheless, in Kids on the slope, it is hard not to hear. This is obviously a lilting  and causing jazz that accompanies every scene.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope contains all the ingredients to make a series of quality: a compelling story, a successful animation, neat designs and lively music. Enjoy it, because it's free :-)\\n",

            "content": "My first ever review on this site! And my first 10!. \r\nIn all honesty this show forced me to write a review, I enjoyed it that much. What makes the plot so good is it's characters, they are all enjoyable in their own way as well as being extremely relate-able. The characters grow on you very quickly and you feel all the pain and happiness that they feel within the first few episodes. The show also made my laugh out loud many times throughout the 12 episodes even though the specific moments were not necessarily meant to be funny, i was laughing with the characterson many occasions instead of laughing at them like in many comedy shows. I also realized that i was smiling at times without realizing it simply because of the love for the characters, however the anime is not all fun and games as it takes a refreshingly realistic stance in terms of the romance in a similar way to \"5 centimeters per second\". The story pics and chooses it's moments perfectly to tug at your heart strings perfectly with many moments causing me to choke up (Big deal as I don't cry at all) while also being packed with memorable moments that make my hairs stand on end. The story completely drew me in and this tale of friendship was an absolute masterclass. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story was accompanied by beautiful animation and outstanding music thanks to Yoko Kanno and a plethora of well chosen jazz pieces that are played throughout the show. The opening is delightful and the ending equally great, songs are perfectly suited to their moments whether it be happiness or heartbreak. \\n\r\nThe animation is also top quality with excellent shading and crisp lines that are extremely realistic and make the characters so life like and contribute greatly to the realism of the show. In terms of animation when Kaoru, Sentaro and co where jamming out it was outstanding again. The animation quality was fantastic and you really felt like they where playing the instruments with such fluid and life like animations. Big acclaims to MAPPA and Tezuka Productions. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it's easy to see my love of this show and my reason for writing a review. The show is perfect in every way with interesting and lovable characters, excellent and fluid animation as well as truly beautiful music. Really urge you all to watch this show as it was a thoroughly enjoyable roller coaster of emotions as I followed these friends in an excellent coming of age story. What seems like a love story is ultimately overshadowed by true friendship. Masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know too many anime but I would definitely tell you to check out 5 centimeters per second if you liked this show. I'll leave you with my favorite quote from the show. Thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\n\"Treasure him. Unlike love affairs, friendship is for life.\"",

            "content": "Special.\r\nThat's the only word to describe Kids on the Slope.\r\nWatanabe's works are always one of a kind. Better if Yoko Kanno is responsible for the soundtracks.\r\nJazz,or jaz-zi,is the backbone of the anime. So good that this is the first anime I watched while wearing my headphones all of the time. \r\nIt's just pure eargasm.\r\nWatch it with a pair of good cans definitely will cure cancer and ebola.\r\nThe plot is full of twists, and emotional turns, as you can expect from a slice of life genre anime. Due to the pace of the anime ( Watanabe-sensei magic ) , everything just come and go, while leavingan impact in your heart. \\n\r\nDevelopments are there, but you won't feel the drag, which is a major flaw of the genre. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are brilliantly designed. This anime is an adaption from a manga. So main characters and side characters shouldn't have any major flaws.\\n\r\nThe plot is set in sixties, at the time where Beatles were still rolling and taking acids everyday. \\n\r\nSo the characters might get a bit outdated, in the sense of conversations and actions. Which is great because the ACG industry doesn't give a lot of attention of details to the social status and environment when they try to make something that set in motion in other era other than modern times. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise it follows the manga. So no mindbending eye candy instead of something you can imagine from the sixties. Again Watanabe-sensei's magic. YOU CAN EVEN SEE MINOR BLURRING ON THE SCREEN .\\n\r\nThe artstyle fits the story perfectly. That's what I can say.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it with a pair of good headphone. Or good hi-fi. \\n\r\nThe random pop-out, or insertion of jazz is amazing and staggering.\\n\r\nThese are a few of my favorite things~",

            "content": "Kids On The Slope is such a turn from Shinichiro Watanabe's two previous (amazing) animes, Cowboy Bebop & Samurai Champloo. However, it's no less of a masterpiece. \r\nHonestly, when I started Kids On The Slope, I didn't know what I was getting into. I hadn't read anything about it, I didn't know what it was about. I honestly expected it to be another action-filled anime with some badass as the main character. But boy, was I wrong..\r\nAs soon as they started playing music, I immediately thought of Beck Mangolian Chop Squad (I reviewed that too!), which was a great anime. However, both has very, verydifferent styles of music. Seeing as I actually listen to the kind of music (Rock n' roll) that was played in Beck and knew a lot of the artists that they talked about, I wasn't expecting to be as comfortable with the music in Kids On The Slope, which is inspired by a lot of Jazz musicians. But I love the music in Kids On The Slope just as much as I loved the music in Beck (if not more, quite honestly)! The music in it was very easy to love and appreciate. The music alone would've been enough to keep me watching it to the end, but the storyline and the characters were also brilliant. \\n\r\nThe two main characters had amazing personalities that you'd fall in love with. They had this mind-blowing friendship between them that anyone would wish for. I loved that they would always get in fights (which showed realism and that even friendships as strong as the one between Kaoru and Sentaro were not perfect), but in the end, they knew they needed each other to be complete. It was just a very inspiring coming-of-age story that had the perfect ending, although it did leave me wanting more (12 episodes was just not enough!).",

            "content": "\"someday my prince will come\"\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is one of dramatic romance anime i've watched, and now become one of my favourite romance anime.\r\nWell as has been written, this main genre is drama music and romance. So, be prepared to always hear a new song in each episode.\r\nBy the way, its my first review. So i'm sorry if in my review, you catch some spoilers (my apologies too if i have bad grammar)\r\nNow, lets begin with my review:\r\nStory : 10\r\nJust one word that i want to say about a story, its 'Awasome'. Why? because in most episode you'll see dramatic story of romance. A plotof love in each character are absolutely complex, so you'll difficult to guess an ending. Happiness friendship is also nice. How to encourage your best friends when he was depressed and how you have to move over for your friends happiness\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nI know if that art is like some old anime, but i still say that this is very nice. Some character has nice motion and mimic, and some other has less. The motion when they play a music make me cant stop to watch. You can say that art is very simple, besides that each people have their own opinion\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\r\nIn each episode, you'll hear one new song (or more) and most of that songs are jazz music. And because i also like jazz, i enjoy to hear all songs. Some songs even make me cant hold my tears fall.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nFirst of all, let see from main chara. Kaoru : At beginning, he is not the type person who is easy to get along. Even, she felt sick when they're in the middle of the attention of the people. But over the groove, he had become a very loyal friend. Sentarou : Strong and likes fight, but he dislike to see an intimidation. He can cheer up his own feeling just by play a jazz (with a drum) and eat some watermelon (his favourite food). Ritsuko : She is Sentarou's childhood friend and she is cheerful and kindly girl. She always treat Sentarou whenever he has been a fight. But more importantly, she has feelings for him since childhood.\\n\r\nYou'll wonder how can three of them become close friends.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\nIts kinda hard to say. You'll can smile, laugh, sad and cry in some unpredictable scene.This anime will make you feel it all, so you cant stop to watch it untill finish. I feel it when I put off to watch the sequel (hold in episode 5), in the night time i cant sleep well and and tomorrow I instanly download the sequel untill last episode (I cant wait no longer)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\nBe honest, very few 'drama animes' that can make me cry (beside angel beats, anohana and clannad). This anime might not make you cry, but i'll be sure you'll get a nice lesson (or maybe will be you guidance)\\n\\n\r\nAnd with end of review, I highly recomended this anime if you want to drop some tears and ends with a happy smile.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is a series done right, It has everything and put its together to create an incredible series.\r\nCharacters/Story:\r\nNishimi Kaoru is the Main Character, He has recently moved schools, Having moved numerous times he has become a  reclusive type of person, A guy who looks like a typical \"Geek\" back in 1966, and feels this school will be the same as the others, where he struggles to makes friends and just makes up the numbers.\r\nKawabuchi Sentarou a Tall/Strong/Stupid/Thug like behavior, Basically the polar opposite of Nishimi. They somehow make this Friendship work, Music brings them together and gives them this special bond. Nishimiplays Piano and Sentarou plays Drums, Ritsuko's Father owns a record shop and allows them to go the basement to jam together and play their instruments.\\n\\n\r\nMukae Ritsuko is the Female Key Character, She is a Normal good looking girl, Who is childhood friends with Sentarou, She has a soft spot for him, Maybe feels sorry for him in a way. But is helpful type of person and creates a nice three-way friendship.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this the 3 of them go through School, They have their up's and down's like most school/drama's, It will have romance themes connected to both guys, All subtly put and neither genre or theme is pushed too much. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nArt - Is really nice, Not the best I've ever seen, but still amazing and does set the tone for the period this as set it, Characters don't look to Josei or feminine, at times and especially with the eyes, Its not too overpowering it will put of people who cannot stand that Art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Characters sounds like there characters styles are, and the music does make this feel like its set in the 1960's. Also the scenes where its them \"Jamming\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is a superb series, And one i simply cannot recommend highly enough, if you like any Josei's or any School Life and Romantic series, this is right up your ally.\\n\\n\r\nI was not sure to put this as an 8 or a 9 after the ending, many people have issues with how series end, and i have that gripe, And issue you can get from a 12 Ep series is it feeling rushed, This wasn't the case for Sakamichi no Apollon until the LAST Episode, For me they didn't not conclude it the way i liked, they have an \"Element\" in the Story at the end, and Element i cannot stand in TV/Movies, This creates the \"Rushed\" ending for me, didn't give it enough time and felt that they had to \"Quickly Wrap it up\" \\n\\n\r\nI love this series, but the rushed last episode didn't not end as strong as i hoped, As mentioned earlier, i was unsure giving this an 8 or 9, but i went with 9, its simply that good and an Anime series you have to watch if you like a School/Drama/Romance/Music & (Not that K'ON Crap) This series does it how it should be done.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kids on the Slope is not a romance. It's a drama centered on the friendship between two young men with romance used a plot device/as a subplot.\r\nIt does this excellently. The show takes you on a dramatic ride through the twists and turns of their relationship over a period of about 2 years. The main characters, Kaoru, an introverted smart kid and Sentaro, an extroverted kid initially perceived as a bully by his peers, are two dynamic and well fleshed out characters, both with their own strengths and flaws that the other happens to account for perfectly. Sure, they both have basis in common tropes,but that does not discount their strength as characters, not even a bit.\\n\\n\r\nYou read that correctly: this is a high school anime focused not on cringeworthy high school romance, but on the developments of a sibling-like relationship between two dudes. It's a refreshing change.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a 3rd main character, Ritsuko. She is not nearly as fleshed out as the two main characters, but she does a lot to drive the plot forward, as she's Sentaro's lifelong best friend and Kaoru's crush. But her relationship with the two of them is mostly in the vein of a friendly trio, aside from a few episodes where it's primarily used as a plot device to advance the dynamic between Sentaro and Kaoru, and their romantic relationship basically does not progress at all for the entire series. They never even KISS.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, in the final episode, there is a shocking scene between Kaoru and Ritsuko, but the purpose of this scene was not to say anything about their relationship - it was a result of Kaoru trying his damndest not to reveal how much he missed Sentaro. \\n\\n\r\nIt is very much a one way dynamic between Ritsuko and Kaoru, which never develops into anything resembling an actual relationship - and that's OKAY, because the story isn't about their relationship! It's about Kaoru and Sentaro!\\n\\n\r\nMy one critique of Kids on the Slope is that Ritsuko's character is not fleshed out nearly enough for how prominent of a role she plays. We know more about Brother Jin, a side character, than we do about her.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all, this is an excellent drama with some excellent animation and excellent music. You'll laugh, cry, cheer, and contemplate your own teenage years, and what else do you want from a drama? If you can stomach a high school anime, watch it.",

            "content": "I finished Sakamichi no Apollon a few days ago. With other slice of life animes, I usually just watch it, and move forward.\r\nBut, with this one in particular, my mind always drifted back to it. I wasn't going to write a review, but this anime resonated really deep with me. I felt so empty after finishing it, and already I feel nostalgic. It left a deep impression on me, and I'm trying to hunt for something just like this one. Unfortunately, nothing comes close to Sakamichi no Apollon.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIt's really not anything special. The main character is an outsider, befriends the delinquent, and they connectthrough music. It's simple, but beautifully written. Viewers get to see what it's like to live in a small town in Japan in the 1960's, and how the West has influenced their lifestyle due to its presence. The story accurately depicts the common problems seen in youth - love, existence, and simply being.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters each have their own look to them, and no two characters are quite alike. The animation is bested when musical performances happen, however. Every stroke on the piano and every drumbeat is beautifully animated. The backdrops always fit the mood nicely, and attention to detail is stressed. It enhances the simplicity of life.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10.\\n\r\nIt's a music anime - what else can you expect? They have a range of scores they use, from Jazz to music soundtracks. \"Moanin'\" is the central piece to the song, and after watching this anime, this piece in particular is what will drive it home for you. The genre of Jazz is stressed - how to play it, what emotions it conveys - and it all centers around Moanin'. The rest of the OST is amazing as well, fitting well in the moods of the current circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nIt's interesting to see the struggles that they all go through. Each of them are different, each approach life a different way. Even though it may start off a cliche sort of feeling - the newcomer is an outsider, he befriends another outsider, the delinquent, but of course they get along since they're both outsiders - the relationships and the characters themselves develop into so much more than what we are introduced to. I didn't love all of them, of course, but viewers can sympathize with a majority of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, just to make it clear if I wasn't being before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a slice of anime that will leave an impression on you, I would suggest this. The entire thing just touched my soul and I really loved it. If you have any thoughts about watching this anime, any at all, I highly suggest it. Just give it a try. You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nPlease leave any feedback for me, and thank you for reading. :)",

            "content": "*Minor Spoilers*\r\nI watched Sakamichi no Apollon because of the terrific jazz covers that I stumbled upon! The music and art are terrific and they really carried the show because almost everything else fell short for me. \r\nI think the plot had a lot of potential. The whole situation with Jun and Yurika didn't really interest me at all. I expected more emphasis on jazz but instead, most of the anime focused on a love pentagon, where the only character I grew to like was Sentaro. \r\nRitsuko was one dimensional, and Kaoru isn't the most likable protagonist ever (like when he forces himself on Ritsuko orwhen he explodes at Sentaro over small things, etc.). A lot of the drama felt forced.\\n\\n\r\nI did like Kaoru and Sen's relationship though. Though platonic, I think it really could've been something more if the author went in that direction. It certainly would've been more meaningful than Kaoru and Ritsuko ending up together haha, but it did take place in the 60s I guess. Anyway, they help each other heal and open up to each other more than to anyone else. Their friendship felt very real; like what a friendship should be.\\n\\n\r\nI'd still give this anime an 8/10 despite my criticisms because I really enjoyed the art, soundtrack, the friendship, and because I like Sentaro. :')",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is to anime as Vinyl is to American TV dramas: a cheap generic story with extremely boring characters disguised in good music, big names in the industry, and nostalgia.\r\nI was skeptical of this show at first, as the art and setting seemed nothing out of the ordinary. After learning about the creators and the history behind the creation of the show, I felt optimistically inclined to give it a chance.\r\nThe first episode isn't bad! So I thought there was some promise. The style of the art is bland, but we've all seen anime characters with bigger eyes, smaller noses, and bigger tits,so it wasn't pathetic. A good thing about the animation is that the musical scenes are done well. Really well. The players match the music they are playing, and they move as real musicians do. The score is pretty decent, which is obviously thanks to Yoko Kanno. However, this was not one of her standout works in any way. This is representative of Yoko Kanno's capability in her craft, but certainly not in her art. The music is a nice medley of jazz and classical pieces, but nothing extraordinarily new or interesting by any means. The musical scenes were still the best moments of the show, and if Sakamichi no Apollon kept their focus on jazz then I think I might have a better taste in my mouth writing this review.\\n\\n\r\nNow... the reality...\\n\\n\r\nBack to my initial point, Vinyl was a highly anticipated show about the American rock industry in the late 70's, produced by Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger (pretty analogous to Shinichiro Watanabe and Yoko Kanno right?). This show ended up flopping (at least by critics) because the show had the following structure: reel in the audience to reflect on music they are familiar with and love, then make an absurd over-dramatic plot to catch the viewers off guard and keep them reeled in. The 70's music was never a vital part of the story or any message or theme.\\n\\n\r\nMy point is that a burnt piece of horse meat doused in steak sauce is not on-par with a well-cooked steak. It is easy to want to like Sakamichi no Apollon: most people like jazz (or at least want to pretend to try to like jazz), and most anime fans love Watanabe and Kanno. But after watching it is hard to believe that they had much creative input into this production, and the jazz theme does not save this burnt horse meat. There are maybe 2 brief moments where the themes of jazz are tied into the story. As the series progresses, jazz is completely irrelevant and it becomes pretty transparent that we have another soft-hearted uncreative waste of production at hand.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally, within a mere 12 episodes, we have not only 1, and not only 2, but THREE FUCKING SCENES in which a main character is riding a train, leaving behind a crying loved one who wishes they could've stated their true feelings before it was too late... One time is permissible, but certainly an avoidable cheesy cliche. But 3 times within 12 episodes......noooooo....\\n\\n\r\nCome on Watanabe.... What happened?...\\n",

            "content": "Ever finish a show and you're just left speechless? That's how I was after I finished watching \"Kids on the Slope\" (Sakamichi no Apollon); however, as I sat there, staring at my screen, I realized that this show isn't all it appears to be. Plot holes, unanswered questions, and many unresolved problems are evident with the completion of the show. I won't start bashing it right away, so I'll go ahead and start with the perks of Sakamichi no Apollon. \r\nUnlike other reviewers, I'll simply break this short review into two sections: a \"pro\" section and a \"con\" section. I'll start with the former first,as stated earlier.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon is another sparkling example of a slice of life done correctly. Likeable and realistic, it's impossible not to relate and eventually empathize for these characters throughout the struggles they go through in the story. Plot wise, like any slice of life, there is no true overarching story line per se, other than the evident romantic subplot going on between all of our three main character, and a blooming \"bromance\" going on between our two male leads. The story is beautifully told and artistically written. It takes place in the 60s, World War 2 has just ended, and Japan, with the help of the US and its allies, is finally regaining its former economic propserity amidst all that has happened. Sakamichi no Apollon touches on America's presence in the region, and its growing influence on it--particularly in a particular genre called jazz. Sakamichi no Apollon is at its core, a music anime. Although the aforementioned themes are very present, perhaps the most essential and frequently revisited theme in the story is music. This brings us to our next criteria for review: the music and art of this show. Simply put, the art is refreshing to look at. Not really the most detailed work out there, it's unique to this series and I felt it suited it quite well. Music wise, it's everything you expect from a show that revolves around it. A beautifully composed opening and ending themes, with wonderful background music prevalent throughout the scene, the music selection is sure to please anyone, regardless of whether or not they appreciate jazz.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that the show is perfect, however. The story leaves much to the imagination of the viewers. Without spoiling anything, the ending was satisfactory, however, it left many questions unanswered. Some side characters that played pretty important roles in the story seemed to have dropped off the face of the Earth with the timeskip that occurs in the last episode. We know nothing about these characters, hell, we don't even know what happened to our two main characters in the time between the time skip. Although not necessarily that major of a con, I would have liked to know what had happened between those 8 years to both Kaoru, Sentarou, and Ritsuko. Art wise, while I felt that the scenery was drawn beautifully, character designs, I felt, were flat, bland, and sometimes, unbelievable. Props to the drawing of the eyes though.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Sakamichi no Apollon is up there as one of my highest rated slice of life shows, perhaps Honey and Clover being the only one to trumph it. A show about two boys, the show delivers a down-to-earth, yet poignant message that rings true in the hearts of every viewer, regardless of gender. A tale about two men, and their beautifully developed relationship with one another.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is best examined as two distinct parts of a whole. The first two-thirds of the series tells an engaging story that primarily revolves around friendship and romance, highlighted by a few genuinely touching moments and painful adolescent heartbreak. The final one-third of the series, however, is backloaded with a disproportionate amount of melodrama occurring in such rapid succession that viewers are never afforded opportunities to catch their breaths and process what they experience. Viewers inadvertently become fatigued, and the full impact of those crucial points in the story become considerably diminished, substantially weakening the show as a whole.\r\nThe first part of Sakamichino Apollon contains exceptional storytelling. In a mere seven or so episodes, it is able to believably convey a powerful bond between the two male leads, Kaoru Nishimi and Sentarou Kawabuchi, which is all the more impressive considering that they have no history whatsoever between them prior to the first episode; in effect, the show creates their friendship from the ground up. Because their friendship is developed so organically, dialogue always feels real and natural, regardless of what the two are discussing or how melodramatic the story becomes. There is always a subtle but palpable sense of true friendship that is often lacking between characters from similar shows in the genre, and it is that realness that allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the story, smiling with Kaoru and Sentarou during their times of joy and suffering with them in their moments of anguish.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the series continues to strengthen Kaoru and Sentarou's friendship in an effort to build toward the emotional climax of the finale, throwing a slew of obstacles in their respective paths in just a short few episodes. However, because it crams too much melodrama into too little time, the last third of the show suffers immensely, which in turn impairs the ending as well as the show as a whole. The simple, well-paced story of the first part of the show permits viewers and characters alike to stop, breathe, feel, and process what they experience, thereby maximizing the effect of emotional developments in the story. The last few episodes eschew that careful spacing of melodrama and instead overfills the story with a tearful farewell, agonizing unrequited love, a highly anticipated affirmation of love, major family issues, a runaway attempt, a life-threatening accident, another runaway attempt, and another tearful farewell--all in the span of four episodes. Individually, any of those events should be significant enough to warrant at least an episode or two for emotional recovery, but at no point are viewers given a meaningful chance for proper digestion; consequently, it comes as no surprise when viewers find themselves becoming progressively numb with each passing scene. The most unfortunate victim of this quick-fire emotional onslaught is the ending, which should be far more beautiful and poignant than it is in practice, as it is largely wasted on an already exhausted audience. \\n\\n\r\nAt its very best, Sakamichi no Apollon clearly demonstrates that it is capable of compelling storytelling. If not for its insistence on being a nearly complete adaptation of its source material and the narrative sacrifices that come with adapting that much material into just one cour, it very well could have stood among the best in its genre. The show is an example of a work that could have been made much stronger by narrowly focusing its single cour on a limited portion of the story, even if a consequence of that would have been the inclusion of a \"go-read-the-manga\" ending. At least then the brilliance found in the majority of the work would not be massively tarnished by the severe flaws found in a minority of it.",

            "content": "Hey guy's it's 11:17pm as I'm typing this and tbh I'm not tired at all after watching Sakamichi no Apollon and felt I needed to say something about it. Honestly it's almost hard for me to remember the last time a series touched me as much as this one did. It was funny, heartwarming, sad, and an amazing ride all wrapped up in a story steeped in beautiful jazz performances and soundtrack; making for an anime that is almost unlike any others I have seen before.\r\nFirst off the story is absolutely wonderful. Between the strong bonds of friendship based on a love of music, tothe beautiful performances, to the great romances that make up for probably half of the driving plot everything is executed flawlessly. All of the writing is done in such a realistic way that you begin to see these characters not as simply figures on a screen, but real people. You truly feel their emotions, you're happy when they're happy, sad when they're sad. I even have to admit I shed some tears at a point, something that very rarely happens to me with anime. You enter at episode one thinking that this will be another fun SoL music show, but then before you know it your wrapped up in a beautiful drama that is taking you along for this wonderful emotional ride. You never expected that when you started the series you would be feeling so much for these characters, but you do. And by the end you come out of on the other side of the series with a completely changed outlook on what a SoL drama can be. Of course I won't give away any spoilers, but here are my thoughts on the ending\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the music. What can I say that hasn't been said? The music in this show is outstanding, absolutely outstanding. Before watching this series I was a passive jazz fan, if I heard it I enjoyed it, but I never sought it out. But now I'm actively listening to jazz, and loving it. Also, as a musician I think shows like this, and K-On! etc always hit a special place in my heart. I know the joy that comes from performing with others like they show on these series, I get to understand the honest fun the characters are having, and I can relate to the great music that they're playing. Plus with some shows like this it\u2019s fun to see the characters struggle to learn to play, as it\u2019s something all musicians have to go through; that\u2019s not very applicable to this series though since all of the MC\u2019s are pretty accomplished to start. (Thanks, for letting me have that little selfish bit). Anyway, back to the show. I thought the choice to use real songs was brilliant. It adds a lot to the realism, and gives the audience a thing to firstly relate to these characters by. Doing this wouldn\u2019t work for all shows, K-On! for instance is served extremely well by having original songs, and actually I think that adds to the realism of that story. But the real songs work perfectly for this show, and I couldn\u2019t imagine changing a thing.\\n\\n\r\nLastly the art, and animation. Once again, I loved it. The performance scenes were exceptionally well done, I'm aware that they were rotoscoped, but still very impressive. As for the rest of the shows animation it was very, very nice. The entire show has a very smooth and fluid style that leads to all the movements of the characters looking, and feeling very natural. The style of animation also gives a great sense of the time period that most of the show takes place in (Late 60's).Honestly I couldn't rain anymore praise down on this show. It's an outstanding anime that only comes once in a blue moon, and I'm very grateful for being able to enjoy it. I recommend everyone go out and watch it, it's streaming for free over on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I'll leave everyone with this. For those who haven't seen the show this song is probably the most prevalent through the whole series, and one that I think will get you the most interested. From the OST: Moanin'\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for listening to my ramblings. This show has truly been a pleasure to watch. Ahhh! My fingers are killing me *cracks knuckles* well time to hit the hay *Sayonara*",

I personally loved the story because it really opened my eyes in that little time watching it. You don't need much to be happy and enjoy life, just be yourself and love the things you do, do the things you love, and do it with the ones you love. This short story shows so many different characters and different stories for each of them, with all their problems but also their personal enjoyment. You can actually feel how thecharacters are feeling, just by watching the anime and this fascinated me so much.\\n\r\nI wanted to see more of this anime, to enjoy it a little more, but i can't change that this is just a short story, but a really beautiful one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlready mentioned almost everything i wanted in the \"story\" part. I totally loved them, acting normal, sometimes being harsh to each other, sometimes really nice, sometimes disappointed and sometimes proud to be together as friends...that's all part of being human, not only human...but a person. This anime shows that clearly :)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the animation because of two things. First of all the typical stuff like the colors and the surroundings which are really really looking great, i fed my eyes by watching it ^^.\\n\r\nSecond, the movement of the characters while playing their instruments, it was really fascinating. Go watch the anime and you will understand what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLove the OP theme\\n\r\nED theme was nice but a bit of in my opinion\\n\r\nThe in anime music...can't really complain because the anime is partly a music anime series and i totally enjoyed listening to the music played by the characters. This jazz music was so entertaining, full on energy and full of happiness. Every time they were playing, i felt like i'm playing with them and having fun with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnding words:\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I'm someone who can really enjoy an anime easily when I feel like i'm part of it, like i'm there with these characters and go along with them and their problems, their stories and their life, it really makes me feel like I'm somewhere else for a moment, to enjoy myself a little bit somewhere else, somewhere where i want to be.\\n\r\nAnd i had that feeling while watching this Anime and i'm really thankful for that and also glad i was able to watch this.",

            "content": "Kids on the Slope is a simple story, but an effective one.  In this review, I will highlight what I find to be the most important characteristics, not necessarily touching on everything.  \r\nAristotle, being the unofficial first critic of entertainment, is noted for his theory of Drama in his book \"Poetics\".  In it he mentions that when a storyteller evokes emotion in an audience, they have been successful; more specifically, catharsis-purging of emotions.  So, using logic, Sakamichi no Apollon is an effective drama, because it is very good at pulling heart strings.  And primarily it does so by making thecharacters relatable (with the backdrop of 1960's Japan).  \\n\\n\r\nThis show is about relationships and how they are tested.  Both friendship and romance are re-occuring themes played with, without being tired out.  As the main characters are in an unlikely bond, this notion unlocks many narrative avenues that are interesting.  The story in Sakamichi no Apollon is serial-continuing in an episodic fashion.  Typically I prefer serial shows over standalone episodes because they avoid being formulaic.  The decision to have an overarching plot and steady pace is best for Kids on the Slope, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nWorld building is often one of the most difficult aspects to get right in the anime medium, but when it's perfected it makes a world of difference, no pun intended.  Kids on the Slope uses the 1960's as a setting, big band jazz music, and dreamy art/animations to establish a believable and serene place and time.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic is intertwined within the narrative, complementing the story, and reminding us of the setting.  And we should expect no less when Shinichiro Watanabe is directing.  Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Space Dandy) is known for his Western influence, especially with music.  The score in Cowboy Bebop was instrumental to establishing a sense of style.  Likewise, Kids on the Slope uses big band jazz to create a quiet, melancholic appeal.  Jazz is known for its subtlety, and that's what this show projects.\\n\\n\r\nAs good as this series is, it doesn't come across as a Watanabe production.  It has some style, but doesn't ooze it, which is what I consider his biggest strength as a director.  Kids on the Slope is casual, while at the same time engaging, and self-contained.  Further, it doesn't focus too much on a particular plot-point too long before shifting gears.  I recommend this to anyone who understands the bond between friends",

In order to travel to school, the students climb a steep and dreadful slope everyday, which symbolizes their fear and anxiety of the future that is awaiting them. As they become friends, the slope becomes a symbol of relief and happiness, because it's where they create meaningful lasting memories together.\r\nEach episode is a beautifully told slice of life, full of drama and innocent romance, showing common problemsthat teens face as they approach their futures. This series leaves cliches at the door and addresses these problems in a relatable and tangible way, leaving you feeling nostalgic and reminiscent of your own life's experiences.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime addresses many historical and social topics of the time, especially Western influence 21 years after WWII. Influences include jazz and rock and roll, Christianity, and important troubling topics like racial segregation and foreign acceptance.\\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography is incredible.

            "content": "Being someone who played saxophone for 7 years and cherished the band program I attended in high school, I'm someone who has become a sucker for music anime. While some of the shows in the music genre are already highly acclaimed from anime viewers with musical background or none whatsoever, these shows have a near and dear part of my heart and usually I am someone that doesn't get bored and is genuinely excited during scenes of musical performance. With Kids on the Slope, this is absolutely no different. The draw to me for this show at the start was the focus on jazz, asI was in jazz band in high school and took a jazz history class in college as well. But what surprised me, is just how little I ended up caring for the jazz in the show. And not in a bad way either.\\n\\n\r\nKids on the Slope is focused on 3 specific main characters, who each fill their anime tropes they're intended to follow. Our lead Kaoru, is at the top of his class, and is a social outcast at his new school. He meets a young lady Ritsuko, who is the nice but timid class president, and she is also close with the rebellious troublemaker named Sentarou. Both Sentarou and Kaoru bond over their love of going up on the school rooftop, and through interacting with one another bit by bit they discover that both of them are fond of playing music. While Kaoru is a classical pianist, Sentarou is a jazz drummer, and pushes Kaoru enough to interest him into a famous jazz standard \"Moanin' \". Through this, while not necessarily getting along at first, start to play jazz together and form a tight bond, while each of them falling in love with a different female. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's great about this show is that all the getting to know aspects of the characters only occurs in the first episode, and as each episode continues more and more and more time passes through their time in high school. The real story isn't focused on the jazz aspect of the show, the show is primarily focused on these three characters, and two other characters, one being Sentarou's crush Yurika, and the other being a fellow jazz musician and role model of sorts to Sentarou, Junichi. These five individual characters are what makes the show, and how we learn through each point of view stuff that they have gone through, and stuff that they deal with in this current time. \\n\\n\r\nThis show, while sounding like lots of fun following the lives of jazz and friendship in love of multiple high schoolers, is really deep down a drama. Each character deals with baggage in their lives, and each struggle that they go through on a day to day basis is what the root of the show is about. In the end, it's not the jazz that the show focuses on, but just merely that a group of individuals who are close with one another appreciate jazz for their own reasons and deal with growing up. That's what I truly enjoyed about this show, is that while the first two episodes seem more like a comedy, with truly gut hurting moments, it molds itself into this very deep drama following heartbreak, death, family outcastings, and many more. It's what really took me aback, and made this show a very easy marathoning, because these characters are people you become invested in through each episode and root for no matter the hardship. \\n\\n\r\nBeing a musical show, what comes first is the music. The jazz standards that were used throughout the show, a few examples being \"Moanin' \", \"But Not For Me\" and a jazz-arranged \"My Favorite Things\", are all very much known through jazz connoisseurs. That being said, a lot of these songs are also known to jazz casuals, and the focus on standards in the show is what I greatly appreciated throughout the show. While there were not a bunch of jazz-inspired songs within the OST, all the music within the show was extremely well done and put in at key moments correctly providing the right amount of satisfaction for the viewer. What really surprised me though is just how much I grew to love the anime opening and ending of the show. While both start off being your generic anime tune, the opening turns into an extremely gripping and high-energy visual spectacle that provides nice key notes to really satisfy the ears. The ending however, grows into an extremely heartfelt tune, one that is extremely touching while watching the pieces of animation that is shown. The best example I can provide for each is Angel Beat's \"My Soul, Yours Beats!\" and Wolf Children's \"Okaasan no Uta\", both exceptional tunes in their own ways. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really surprised me the most about this anime, is the animation for the show. While the art style seems more generic in a sense, it honestly never falters in quality. The animation for the show is absolutely stunning, the entire show. There's no obvious dips that have stills or make things cartoon-y in shows that have tight animation budgets, which just goes to show how much was put in to the process of creating Kids on the Slope. The animation is gorgeous, especially within the opening credits. The voice actors for the show were all cast perfectly, but I greatly suggest doing a sub-only viewing of the show. While I have only seen clips of the dub, only two characters are viable to make the show watching, while the rest have cringe-worthy performances, with even worse dialogue. The dub tries to use lots of 1950's lingo within the show because of the jazz within the show, but the fatal flaw within the dub, is that no one talks like that whatsoever in today's world. So watching a show that has dialogue stolen from eras ago, in what is supposed to be a serious drama is a superb buzzkill, and is almost a parody of the original source material. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, watching this subbed you will not be filled with complains, and the dub I am pretending does not exist so I am not counting it into my rankings whatsoever. In the end, Kids on the Slope is a powerful drama, filled with fun, laughter, tears, and overall enjoyment. Everything about this show is, in the end, satisfying. That should be the goal for every anime, and this one is almost the perfect model of how to create a satisfying series. While there are a couple characters or moments in storylines that are a bit bothersome, in the end the show succeeds in creating an engaging plot with characters you come to love. With fantastic production and a fresh new take on shows within the music genre, I cannot recommend this show enough. So go onto Crunchyroll and give this thing I shot, you will not be disappointed.",

I rated Sakamichi no Apollon around a 3.5 in my star rating and here's why, without spoiling too much of what happens, though do read at your own discretion, as it does spoil things about the story even if its not exactly what happens.\r\nThe tonality, time setting, and the music is fantastic, and I had a lot of funwith it. Though not outstanding, the little flickers of how the love for jazz amongst characters is represented in the relationships the characters have with each other is heartwarming. I relate to this a lot, mainly because I always love sharing and playing music amongst my friends and loved ones. One of many cherished pastimes, and I believe this to be one of the series strengths, though minimal it was still nice to have.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as an audience, aside from the music and friendships portrayed, we are taken on a bit of a broken-down emotional rollercoaster in one form or another. Once I reached the end of the series the only thought I had was \"Is that it? Was that really all worth it?\"\\n\\n\r\nTo be harshly put, some of the things that happened between characters almost seemed useless because they were either never wrapped up or seemed just slathered in there to have some form of scandal. Take it away theres not really too much of a plot; theres parts but not much to have a series built on. A lot of other plot points that were built up were never really tied up either, adding to the uselessness of some of it. It wasn't too satisfying, and though to my own tastes and interpretation, a lot of the drama I found cringe-worthy and oddly clich\u00e9. \\n\\n\r\nI genuinely love the main characters, and I cherish the relationship they have with one another, but the character development is rocky. Characters will make progress, but then do something and take a few steps back again, doing this more than one or twice. Tied in with odd story choices that don't really influence the end too much adds to my unsatisfied viewing experience. The ending is bittersweet, but confusing.\\n\\n\r\nBut, all technicalities aside; I do believe in this series and the potential it has, and I love the charm of it. Though a part from the music and some of the moments the friends have together when performing, there's nothing really too memorable about it, and I'm not sure if I'd ever watch it again or recommend it a lot. It is, in the end, up to any of those reading this if its worth watching it or not. I definitely would say it is to an extent if you love music and performing with your friends, and you think about the good old days more than once. It definitely took me back there.\\n",

It was written by Ayako Katoh in coalition with Y\u016bko Kakihara (the manga creator).  The anime was directed by the god among gods Shinichir\u014d Watanabe known for Cowboy Bebop, among many others.\r\nStory:\r\nKids on the Slope is not what many of us have come to think of when we watch an anime.  There are no epic battle scenes, or large dangling \"tracksof land\"; there is only the pleasant serenity of life in post war Japan.  Life for these three teenagers is much like the slope they walk up and down each day, while attending school.  They all experience rough patches, and seemingly endless hills; but they manage to make it back down every day through the friendships they create.  We can all relate to this story in one way or another; be it the death of a family member, or the rejection of a loved one.  Yet life continues on, and our pain is soon forgotten in place of joy.  I only found two complaints to make about the story. The first being the lack of detail sometimes found during the time skips.  Often there are many months, if not years that go by with only a small monologue in between to catch the viewer up.  In addition there were not enough jazz jam sessions/concerts, but I believe this was due to the 12 episode time constraint.     \\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art the style chosen is a perfect pick for this type of anime.  The extreme detail given to the characters faces makes every little change in emotion noticeable.  This is especially prevalent during the musical sessions.  Seeing the characters eyes move up or down as they increase pitch or speed really brings the show to life.  All of the characters have been drawn in a proportionate manner, almost mimicking an actual human face.  As a tenor saxophone player myself it was great to see this inclusion.  However, this is where our experience starts to get a little rough.  The water color backgrounds can be utterly astounding at times, but the animation quality drops at random intervals.  The still frames will be left close to blank, and the running animations can look very off.  I'm not sure what this shows budget was, but seeing as that Watanabe headed it I'd be surprised if it was under the normal rate for a single cour program.  Also what's up with a the opening sequence, it looks terrible?  None of these problems are very serious I would just like to know why they happened in the first place.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm just going to say one thing, Yoko Kanno.  If you don't know what I mean by that the door is to your right.  All jokes aside if a sound track is good enough for me to listen to without the animation behind it, it deserves a 10/10.  From \"husky\" woman solos to the ever amazing Moanin' by Art Blakey, this soundtrack is just about as perfect as perfect gets.\\n\r\nFor the voice dubbing I choose to go with the English version, as I normally do, produced by Sentai Filmworks.  I'd say the best word to describe the voice acting for this show would be \"passionate\".  I could tell right off the bat that the voice actors had been matched to their respective characters perfectly; hats off to Sentai for their excellent screening process.  Not only are the actors voices filled with emotion, they adjust their level and type of emotion from scene to scene in a manner that rivals traditional acting.  It's a damn good piece of work.            \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKOTS has three main protagonists, with a variety of supporting characters.  Kaoru Nishimi is the well off \"prodigal son\" who at a young age was chosen to, by his aunt, become a wealthy doctor in order to carry on the family name.  He plays the piano.  Sentar\u014d Kawabuchi is seen as a bully with a negative outlook on self worth.  He plays the drums.  Our final protagonist is a girl named Ritsuko Mukae.  She has always been a sister figure to Sentar\u014d, and his only true friend.  These characters are as close to perfect as they come.  They all develop in a natural way as the show progresses; weaving their personal stories into the overarching narrative.  While not always positively, the three react to each other meaningful ways.  They understand the problems of each other, and share a deep connection that can only be found in love and friendship.  The only complaint I can muster, is the supporting character \"Pops\" didn't receive enough development.  While showing potential, he is no more than a walking string bass.\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nAfter having just finished watching \"Durarara!!\" (review coming...someday) it was relaxing to just sit back, and take in this life-like story.  Other than the occasional fault this anime is a joy to watch from start to finish, and receives a \"Must Watch\" on my scale of recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nMasterpiece-Best\\n\r\nMust Watch\\n\r\nWatch\\n\r\nTry The First Couple Episodes\\n\r\nSkip It\\n\r\nRun For Your Life-Worst\\n\\n\r\nAs usual I recommend you buy a copy, and help support our local dubbing companies and the anime industry as a whole.  However, just taking the time to watch it is of greater importance.\\n\r\nAs a final statement I recommend that you take my numerical scores with a grain of salt; as numerical scores are easily skewed and each person has their own understanding of the 1-10 scale.       \\n",

            "content": "Sakamichi No Apollon is, to put it simply, a taste of life.\r\nI watched it on a whim when I was looking for a show to watch and ate through all the episodes in one night.\r\nThe story is realistic, I feel. It touches upon some really human emotions, the simple ones. The ones we deal with in our everyday lives: the happiness we acquire from those around us, confusion, misunderstanding, love (not necessarily romantic love). The plot sucks you in and by the second episode you are attached to the characters completely. The ups and downs they have, you feel too.\r\nThe art is simply stunning. Simple,yet effective. The characters have distinct features that are unique and interesting. While there are the occasional sausage hands and some odd blobs, usually even down to the fingernails are done in a very tactile way. The animation is smooth and clean.\\n\\n\r\nSound, well it has to be good for a show with a music theme! And it was. I enjoyed listening to both the jazz the characters played as well as the jazz that was in the bg music. It moved from classical to jazz appropriately based on the mood. Even though the singing was mediocre, I actually quite enjoyed the cover of \"My Favorite Things\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is the only place where this show lost a pinch of its greatness. And its only because of the relationship between Nishimi and Ritsu. I felt that them never having a real good romantic moment was a bit of a letdown. It was always one or the other in a  bad mood or misunderstanding. I feel like all the other characters got their \"happy ending\" except these two. Even Sen is happy despite vanishing after he crashed his bike. But the ending made up for most of it. I was left feeling like \"everything is ok and is going to be ok in the future\" which is how i like to feel at the end of a show. So only 1 point lost here!\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this show! It felt real - relate-able. Visually and sound-wise, yummy. Good characters. Cliff hangers at ends of episodes were perfect and made me want more. Its a melancholy show that fluctuates between heartache and simple but wholesome happiness. You go up and down, but you are sure to feel good at the end! A must watch!",

Until then, Kaoru was an honor roll student who tended to keep to himself, but meeting notorious bad boy Sentaro Kawabuchi starts to change him. Through his devil-may-care classmate, Kaoru learns the attractions of jazz and finds the first person he can call a \"friend\". He also discovers how much fun it is to play music with a pal. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Sentaro's kind childhood friend, Ritsuko, who is the daughter of a record shop owner; the mysterious upperclassman, Yurika; and Brother Jun, the much-admired leader among their peers. Set against the backdrop of a seaside town with a scent of American culture, this series is a drama about young people coming into their own, crossing each other's paths, and finding friendship, love, and music! \\n\\n\r\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not large but makes up for it with some great music, although I didn't really like their representation of sixties rock, although I'm yet to research how rock spread in Japan.  Considering these factors the music and sound of Sakamichi no Apollon gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound-9/10 (great)\\n\r\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\\n\\n\r\nThe story provides a good look into early jazz and a small glance at rock while all the while utilizing some whoop-ass main characters, while the cast is small the important characters make up for it with their development and backstories.  Sakamichi no Apollon also has a balanced amount of romance and drama developing characters further.  It also has an ending disliked by most but to me it wrapped up the whole 12 episode anime nicely, reminding me of the ending of The Shawshank Redemption, a great movie btw, although the manga--which i'm yet to read, went a few chapters further.  These factors give the story and characters a 9.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters-9/10 (great)\\n\r\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Sakamichi no Apollon is a little strange for at least some people's faces, although most are fine and the environments are beautiful.  The Animation as well, is just above average, not outstanding.  These factors give the art and animation a 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation-8/10 (very good)\\n\r\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the overall score for Sakamichi no Apollon or Kids on the Slope, adding all previously scored categories together, dividing them by the number of categories for our average is a well deserved 9!\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10 (great)\\n\r\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||",

I am no otaku, but here is my honest take on \"Kids on the Slope.\"\r\nOverall Enjoyment\r\n-\r\nThis is a beautiful, beautiful anime. The most tender years of one's life are often those in middle and/or high school. Friendships and relationships are so important and so difficult. The future looms ahead. Between school, hobbies, and social activities, it is easy to get caught up in a whirlwind of emotions. This anime takes a snapshot of all of these feelings and perfectly conveys them through music and a delicately told story that is simple yetemotionally complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that I really dislike the lack of developed female characters. Apparently, females cannot be top of their class, play jazz, have interesting life stories, become doctors, or have as meaningful and deep relationships as males. While I may sound like \"just another feminist,\" it really is disheartening to see yet another anime fail to show the complexity and beauty of humanity in its entirety. This warped view of the world distracted me so much that moments that were supposed to be deep or heartfelt fell very flat. I found myself incredulous that the main characters were really a trio of best friends when the girl in that trio had no backstory and no discernible personality.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, this was a beautiful anime, and I can hardly blame this single anime for the systemic exclusion of women's perspectives. After all, there are animes with mostly men, and there are animes with mostly women. What I want people to know about this anime is that it captures the essence of adolescence perfectly. Watching, one experiences nostalgia, joy, and heartbreak just as everyone once did in their childhood. Overall it is an outstanding work of art.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope) is a story about friends, music, youth and romance that starts as Bon (Nishimi) transfers to his new school. \r\nThe story itself is brilliant, however simple. Those of you who know japanese rest assured that the dialogues are greatly crafted and truly credible (unlike many popular series), arguably due to its being josei genre. To put it like this: the story isn't predictable (I thought I knew how it would end about 3 times and all of them I was wrong (though that may say more about my dumbness xD)) but even if it's not predictable, it's notridiculous either. The writer was clearly very thoughtful about it (the story is ring structured) and the adaptation is very well made.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is perhaps the most lacking part of the series, in particular the character design for Ricchan (Ritsuko) was rather displeasing, but most of the rest is very good. The hand animations for the instrument playing are really good (better than Nodame Cantabile, on par with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, though maybe not as fancily adorned) and the fighting scenes were very good too (have in mind that they're not very relevant for much of the series, however, I'd dare to say they're better than Naruto's and many battle anime's).\\n\\n\r\nSound is great, though as a jazz lover I may be biased about that, but anyway, the seiyuus do a great job bringing out the characters. Bon for example has very dislakeable aand very likeable phases, and the seiyuu transitions flawlessly between them.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this almost like one of my favorite animes and I wouldn't doubt recommending it to anyone up to a josei romance drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score: 9.4 (Story 10, Art 8, Sound 9, Character 10, Enjoyment 10)",

            "content": "I spent an amazing six years playing jazz charts in my junior high and high school jazz bands. It's no wonder, then, that this anime holds a special place in my heart. \r\nStory: (9) \r\nOn first glance, Sakamichi no Apollon appears to be a coming-of-age story that is centered around two high school boys who end up becoming the most unlikely of friends through a shared love of jazz music. While this is true, on second glance, the story of this anime becomes much more than that. The way Sakamichi no Apollon includes romance, relations with other characters, and reactions to adversity in life andin the world around is entirely realistic and believable given the age of these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe small inclusions here and there of the important historical context of the era, such as the Japanese social activist movements and American military presence in Japan, provides the viewer with snapshots of what it meant to live in Japan during the 1960s. The setting of this anime is a true breath of fresh air among other fantasy, sci-fi, and other similar shows that seem to top and the fill the anime charts each season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8) \\n\r\nThe simplistic style in which the characters' faces and bodies are drawn are fitting given that the story centers around portraying the mundane and realistic lives of the characters. Forgive me for I am not an artist, but I have noticed that the \"atmosphere\" of each scene seems a bit \"feminine\" (soft lines and color palette)- a successful touch that matches the Josei genre well. While the animation is not flashy or mouth-dropping by any means, the movements are fluid and the overall character designs and backgrounds are pleasing to the eye. '\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8) \\n\r\nNow this is where the jazz-loving, nostalgic me wanted to give this anime a 10. Unfortunately, Sakamichi under-delivers for an anime that is often praised for being jazz-centered. The jazz charts that are present are incredibly catchy and display good balance in sound amongst all instruments (a feat which is often hard to accomplishment in my opinion). Unfortunately, the musical pieces are too few and far between and a bit too \"mono-genre jazz\" for my taste. The soundtrack still does a good job setting the tone when it is actually present.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, if you came here looking for a variety of jazz genres like bebop, bossa nova, blues, dixieland, and all in between, you will be disappointed...but if you can get past the fact that this show is not \"music-centered\" but \"centered around the love of music,\" then you're in for a touching and emotional story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10) \\n\r\nThis is where Sakamichi no Apollon truly shines. Both Kaoru and Sentarou, two seemingly friendless outcasts at school who come from completely different familial backgrounds, begin to experience incredible development of their maturity and perspective of the world through their budding friendship. Ritsuko is well-characterized as a friend, love-interest, and overall normal teenage girl as well. The rest of the supporting characters are all given enough screen-time to develop their personalities and role in the story that is centered around main characters Kaoru and Sentarou. \\n\\n\r\nI also appreciate that much of the characterization does not stem from boring \"show-and-tell\" dialogue only. The actions and unspoken words of characters truly highlights and develops the personality of each one. \\n\\n\r\nThe screen-time given for each character does a remarkable job of neither overshadowing the main characters nor appearing like useless filler- creating an overall fulfilling and connected story which highlights each character in a meaningful way. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9) \\n\r\nSakamichi no Apollon reminds me of just how much music can bring all sorts of people together. There were many members within my own jazz band that, on the outside, would seem like the most unlikely of personalities to mesh well together...however, our love for music allowed us all to relate and connect to each other in some way. As a musician, I felt incredibly nostalgic throughout the whole watch.\\n\\n\r\nMusician or not though, the stories of these characters is entirely relatable and enjoyable for almost anyone who has gone through inevitable period of growing up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9)\\n\r\nThe characters of Sakamichi no Apollon take us on an emotional journey through all the ups-and-downs of friendship, romance, and adolescence in 1960s Japan. Even though we, as viewers, may be separated by a generation gap, the feelings and actions of those living in the 1960s is not much different from our emotions and lives in present-day. \\n\\n\r\nThe lives of these characters really touched my heart and I'm sure it will touch yours as well...and none of this story could be possible without the shared love of music and jazz. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter watching Your Lie in April and Fuuka I have been desperately searching for a good musical anime and then I stumbled upon Kids on the Slope where I finally got what I wanted.\r\nThe story begins with Kaoru Nishimi who has started his first year at high school in Kyushu, after moving from place to place for the past few years he prepares for another lonely year until he meets Sentarou Kawabuchi, Sentarou's love for Jazz interests Kaoru and then his lonely shell begins to break.\r\nNow what the story does really well is the development of Kaoru's and Sentarou's relationship as we seethese two guys go from looking like completely out of place people to incredibly good friends all because of Jazz and it's funny how many things in this show were settled between these two just by playing Jazz music.\\n\r\nIt was very entertaining seeing how these characters really did change over the series as a whole because they went through a lot of hardships ranging from heartbreaks, a lot of arguments and even near death experiences that ended up changing how these characters felt for each other too.\\n\r\nIt was really interesting how this anime was set in the 1960's so we got to see when Jazz was a very popular music piece and how it would have to go up against newer music types that were getting popular during this time like Rock music and how this would affect the characters viewpoint on the different genres of music and their tastes in general and we even got to see events that weren't about music and more about how life was changing in Japan as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were really good and certainly go through a lot of hardships in only 12 episodes.\\n\r\nKaoru Nishimi is the first male MC of the show and his character really changes a lot over the course of the show as he starts out as very socially awkward and introvert which causes him to feel nauseous when stressed which is due to the many times he has moved around in his life making it difficult for him to make friends, but when he becomes friends with Sentarou and Ritsuko he starts to become a more cheerful and open person plus he is a smart person so he catches onto things a lot quicker than Sentarou does, but this can make him overthink things too, he also likes classical music along with Jazz and is an avid user of the piano, I really liked Kaoru as his character felt very relatable to myself.\\n\r\nSentarou is the other male MC of the show and despite his tall, strong figure he is actually a very fun and open guy however he does tend to get into a few fights mainly because he likes doing it, but his love for Jazz is even stronger and he loves to play the drums, he does have a dark past though and because of this it gives Kaoru a reason to relate to Sentarou which brings the both of them closer together as friends.\\n\r\nRitsuko is Sentarou's childhood friend and she is actually a very kind and helpful person often keeping Kaoru and Sentarou out of trouble and allowing them access to her fathers basement so they can have their Jazz sessions, she also has had a crush on Sentarou for a long time, but when Kaoru tells her he loves her, her feelings start to become very random as she doesn't know who to love until she makes up her mind towards the end of the show.\\n\r\nJunichi is an old friend of Sentarou and Ritsuko and is the reason why Sentarou fell in love with Jazz, he is a pretty smooth and cool guy however he goes down a dark path later on and begins to give up on life until someone helps him see through the darkness and be brought back into the light, he also plays the trumpet and sings a few songs during his Jazz sessions with the boys.\\n\r\nYurika is the second female character of the show and is in the art class at the high school, at first she becomes Sentarou's crush after he rescues her from some guys who were irritating her until she encounters Junichi and then she starts falling in love with him and manages to help him break out of his dark corner.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the artstyle, it seemed simplistic since the characters looked very normal while also having a sixties style like the female characters hairstyles which aren't overexaggerated, I really liked the sixties setting as well since a lot of anime's are set in the present of future it was interesting seeing one set in the past as we get to see some of the cultural differences and changes that were happening during this time.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Music was absolutely amazing I loved the Jazz tracks that they used and every musical piece was just great to listen to, I would've liked to have seen more scenes with boys having a Jazz scene like there was at the bar, but since everyone has different things to do in their lives I'll overlook it. I really liked the intro too it fits perfectly for this kind of show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Romance is actually pretty mixed for me, in some areas it was good while others it just didn't fit, but it was random and unpredictable as each of the characters feelings would change a lot so you wouldn't know what they'll do or how they'll react to certain things, but I liked the outcome as it wasn't bad for everyone and I was surprised with some of the people that got together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is definitely the best musical anime I have seen though there wasn't really much competition before this, but if you like music along with some Romance then you'll definitely enjoy this.",

One of the cornerstone's of this anime is the development given to the main character, Nishimi Kaoru. Nishimi starts out as a very shy and frail kid who struggles with outside life since he gets nauseous whenever something surprising happens around him. Nishimi meets Mukae Ritsuko and Kawabuchi Sentarou and big changes to Nishimi's daily life begin to unfold. This anime is filled with some heartfelt amazing moments which is why Ibelieve this anime is definitely worth a watch if you're looking for a good wholesome slice of life show. Although this anime may use cliche romance love triangles a bit too much to further the show's plot I managed to look past these unoriginal moments and appreciate the show for it's characters and their beautiful friendships.",

I unironically love jazz too, though the bee movie might convince you otherwise. The way they used so many different  jazz pieces was phenomenal! The time period was neat too since it was before cellphones and all of that you could see the characters connect so much better! \r\nFrom the art to the soundtrack, Sakamichi noApollon is an anime necessity!",

Sakamichi no Apollon blends in mature themes with a very light coming of age story, and it's a damn masterpiece.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story of Sakamichi no Apollon does an amazing job fitting in a broad cast of side characters without losing any development of the main bunch. It's a witty and believable story that expresses many themes of maturity and friendship. One would think with such a large cast of characters, some would feel underdeveloped and with loose ends, but Sakamichi no Apollon hammers out these common mistakes.\r\nArt:10\r\nThe visuals are outstanding. Easily one ofthe best looking shows of the past decade. It still holds up by standards set this year.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a music anime with the bonus of Jazz!

            "content": "This anime is like a grungy soap opera. It's not as terrible as your average soap opera, but nonetheless. So, this is an anime that I'm gonna have a hard time reviewing because it wasn't astounding, but I also don't have much to say about it that's negative. I'm gonna try giving some critiques, so here we go.\r\nI'd say the number one critique I have about this anime is that certain parts of the story seem to come out of nowhere. For example, there are characters that are focused on that aren't necessary to the overall storyline or dramatic things happen to fill the timewhen they don't mean anything in the long run. That being said, this anime was still about to make those things interesting. If I'm being picky here, the art style isn't my favorite either, though it isn't the worst I've ever seen. It's still really lovely to look at the landscapes and environments in this anime. The sound was another thing that wasn't a strong as it could've been, but it was still very fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the story. This anime tells such a beautiful story with such a beautiful message. The anime definitely doesn't fall short during its emotional bits as I found myself pretty invested with each and every development that came to light. The pace of the anime being what it was helped a lot, in my opinion. It's not often that I watch dramas like this that take the story slow and takes care to progress the story properly. In other words, the story didn't feel rushed, and I really liked that. You get to sit in with these characters and watch their relationships with each other break and form again. It paints a very nice picture of friendship and how fulfilling and long-lasting it can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves were written well, for the most part. As I said, there were a few that I didn't feel were needed for the story, but the main characters were spot on. There were moments that their inner conflicts weren't elaborated on in ways that made a lot of sense at first, but they came across as full and complex rather than shallow. \\n\\n\r\nAll technical stuff aside, this anime really just makes you feel good. It'll definitely make you feel sad as well, but I think by the end of it, it'll give you a sense of peace. That's probably a weird thing to say about an anime, but nonetheless, I'm glad I watched this. It wasn't perfect or what I was expecting, but I think what I learned from it was worth all the time I spent on it.",

The start was kinda boring but when you give the 2nd episode a go you cant just stop going on going cause of the curiosity of what would happen next cause you'll get drag in their world and be swayed by the emotions of some events in it. It offers some great values and the good and bad experiences during your youth and they nailed it it was a good anime the story was awesome. This is amust watch anime please watch it :)",

            "content": "Music is such an all-encompassing part of everyday life. Everywhere we go, everything we do, almost always there will be music involved somewhere in it. Music is able express feelings through our ears and straight to our heart, and the way each piece is played and written tells us little things about the author. Where am I going with this? Well, if you read the title, then you know the anime I\u2019m talking about today is Sakamichi no Apollon (or Kids on the Slope) from studio MAPPA. Sakamichi no Apollon notably focuses on two jazz playing friends in the \u201860s, as we watch their struggleswith the unexpectedness of life and see it portrayed both in their words and actions as well as through the music they play.\\n\\n\r\nThe show begins by introducing us to the pensive teenager Kaoru Nishimi, who by an unexpected turn of events ends up befriending the school-wide feared delinquent Sentarou Kawabuchi. Kaoru soon comes to see that Sentarou is a far softer guy than others would think, and discovers that Sen is also an avid jazz drum player. As Kaoru warily joins in their little band - meeting Junichi, Ritsuko, and Tsutomu in the process - and they begin playing music together, many of the twists and turns that come with growing up interrupt his previously apathetic life.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does the show fare? Is Sakamichi no Apollon a brilliant character study, or does it fall flat in its ambitious journey? While the show certainly does succeed in many areas, particularly the audial and visual portions, there\u2019s a good chunk of issues that lie in the story. Sakamichi no Apollon follows the somewhat common Josei-drama style wherein said drama seems to take precedence over all in a fairly unrealistic manner. The way the story progresses feels contrived. Rather than the characters and their life situations driving the story in a way that comes off as logical, most major plot points are clearly designed and break the immersion. Characters seem to just walk into each other whenever it\u2019s convenient for the plot. On occasion characters within the show will act completely irrationally and out of character simply to create conflict and keep the story moving, though half the time this conflict doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. I would have much preferred keeping the focus on these characters when they\u2019re together rather than when they\u2019re being forced apart as the cast does have a nice dynamic. Despite the irritating contrivance of it all, I still found myself invested simply due to caring for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nBy far, however, my greatest issue lies in the shows ending, or the lack thereof. After a rather unexpected turn of events, there is a time skip that is covered within a single episode. No epilogue or anything of the sort, it just sort of ends. It barely explains anything and comes of as very unsatisfying. All it really needed was one more episode, even an OVA, and I think the ending would have come off a lot better. Given that it didn\u2019t though, I\u2019d recommend simply reading the last chapter of the manga, as it does fix a lot of problems I had with the show\u2019s ending.\\n\r\nSo sure, the story isn\u2019t perfect, but the music and animation come pretty close. While I\u2019ve seen complaints towards the lack of importance that the time period plays in the series, I appreciate it as it gives a nice visual change of pace. We\u2019ve seen the same settings time and again. The \u201860s is a much less common setting for anime in particular, and the art definitely makes it feel real.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, the animation is downright fantastic. The way characters move is accurate, consistent, and incredibly smooth. Most impressively for me, this show really seems to nail that feeling of weight that is so hard to do properly. As if this weren\u2019t enough, the musical sequences step this up to the jaw dropping level. It\u2019s not all in technicality though, the perspective from which everything is portrayed really does make you feel at home in this world and with these characters. These places become familiar and comfortable, from the slope to the record shop.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, I\u2019ve made special note to leave the best for last. That is, the music. The soundtrack makes for a big part of why the show is as effective as it is. If Samamichi no Apollon were about something else I wonder if it\u2019d even be able to be considered \u201cgood\u201d. The show\u2019s musical focus is on that of jazz, and I personally have great respect and perhaps a fair bit of bias towards it as it essentially got me into the genre. You really don\u2019t need to be a jazz fan to enjoy this show, in fact I\u2019m inclined to recommend it especially to people who don\u2019t know about jazz and would like to see what the genre can offer. For the more experienced jazz fans, however, there are little tidbits here and there that are nice to see, such as Sen\u2019s pet pigeon being named Sarah Vaughan.\\n\\n\r\nAside from its genre, just as music it\u2019s fantastic. The portions of the OST that are for background all serve their purpose effectively. Each piece has a sense of individual flair and memorability, accentuating the scenes they accompany. The compositions for the in-show music performances, much like the animation, take it up a notch. It\u2019s hard to discern whether or not this was intentional, but it legitimately feels like the musicians playing had a deep understanding of the characters they portray. The way the music is played and developed feels unbelievably authentic to the events going on in the story with the characters and their changes. In particular, there is a musical sequence in episode seven where our two main characters perform a medley consisting of three songs previously highlighted. The style of the piece and transitions between songs shows just how much these characters have developed. This scene serves as a highlight to the series and despite not being inherently sad is emotionally provocative. Listening to the piece alone does the job well enough, as it is a brilliant interpretation, but listening to the piece and knowing these characters and their struggles makes it far more powerful.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Sakamichi no Apollon is not a particularly strong show. It bears plenty of faults in it\u2019s story and characters, to the point that one could justifiably argue that it is \u201coverrated\u201d. However, there is a reason Sakamichi no Apollon is loved by a fair few. It uses music in a brilliant manner. Many other shows, even those that claim to be focused around music use it merely as a driving point for the story. The music isn\u2019t what makes the show, in fact it could easily be replaced with any other story element that can bring our characters together towards one goal. However, with Sakamichi no Apollon the use of music feels far more sincere. Music seems to course through everything within the show as a truly integral part. That\u2019s what makes this show special. It isn\u2019t perfect, no it\u2019s far from it, but it has those moments of brilliance. It has those scenes that make think \u201cwow\u201d, that touch you to your core. And personally, I think shows that can do that are worth noting, regardless of their flaws.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com\\n",

Kids on the slope is one of those semi-quality anime shows that pulls you in and then makes you go: \"Where in the name of Batman's balls did my jazz show disappear?\" Time and time again. \r\nLook, I know that it's a show about relationships as well but if you are going to hook the audience with something as intriguing as \"nerdy classical pianist meets wild child meathead jazz drummer and you know that they are going to be jam buddies and you will want to know how\" then it better pay off. But justlike my master's degree in philosophy, it doesn't. Oh sure, there's plenty of highschool romance stuff in there everyone. And we all know how rare that stuff is. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this is still much better than you're average anime. So much in fact that it made, even me, the hater of probably 95% out there, watch it neatly to the end. The show lacks many of the usual anime vices, like the out-of-place-boob-grab and the stripper-outfit-as-everyday-life-clothing. The dialogue has no glaring \"I will explain what just happened although you just saw it\" either. I wont be running around naked in the snow for Kids on the slope (like that one weekend with Monster - my gawd) but it's a nice watch, if you can stomach the highschool/romance stuff. 8/10.",

They essentially have opposite backgrounds, family lives, personalities, school standings, body types, etc. The show is a lot about how one has an effect on the other. There is of course also Ritsuko, Sentarou's childhood friend, and the daughter of the owner of the record shop the group will practice in. \r\nThere arealso two side characters, Brother Jun and Yurika. They will be involved heavily in some romance sub-plots (and also be a cause of a great deal of confusion around the middle of the show). A lot of this show is about the romance, bromance, and mistaken romances of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, especially Kaoru go through some pretty nice development, however, there are issues. Kaoru especially is the type of character who will make choices that will infuriate you, many of them because of the pure childishness they exhibit. Even Sentarou, who I'd consider to be the best character in the show, makes an extremely rash and out of character decision. The progression of the show is good, but some of the drama used to get there is not.\\n\\n\r\nA show that a lot of people will compare this to is Nodame Cantabile. However, Nodame Cantabile does something that Kids on the Slope does not... have comedy. While I understand KotS is not a comedy (and Nodame is) there is almost ZERO comedy in all of KotS. So it's basically all built of tension episode after episode and the end results is that it seems a bit tiring.\\n\\n\r\nObviously one of the main draws to the show is going to be the music. Well, there is some music. The thing is it's not the focus of the show. If you think they form a jazz band or something, they don't. It's just used for them to play and basically let out their emotions. This leads to another issue, if you don't like the over the top, notes everywhere type jazz then the music will be a real detractor for you. \\n\\n\r\nSo, for all the negative sounding things I've said about the show it's actually fairly decent. It has well thought out (albeit often infuriating) characters and a real good sense of character driven drama (although they go overboard). Yes, the show will make you feel things, but what they do is totally based on you.",

How I love you and how I hate you; why did you have to be so good but with such obvious, glaring, painful flaws? \r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story (synopsis available above) is pretty simply. It's simple without the need to get convoluted and is very enjoyable with it's innocent fun but... here comes my biggest issue with the show; it's not handled very well. \r\nTo avoid spoilers I won't go into details: there are concepts introduced which don't show up for long periods of time, seeming like they were forgotten or copped out because of time restrains. Transitions between time 'skips' (forlack of a better term) is awkwardly handled, leaving the audience to piece together how much time has passed with very little indication for no reason and, my biggest issue, the extremely sporadic pacing. The pacing is all over the place in this show; some parts are calm and collected while others go from one thing to another so fast that there's little time to take anything in. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are very 'normal' (for the most part) without the need for flashy in-your-face characters or deformed bodies. The art is overall quite nice and the close-up shots on the instruments are pleasing to the eye. Very fitting with the rest of the show leaving no complaints. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably bias speaking, especially since jazz is one of my favourite genres--and the 'main' song \"Moanin'\" by Art Blakey being one of my favourites--but the sound of this show was damn near perfect. The voice acting was good and there were no overblown reactions for comedic purpose (that I remember), sound effects were fitting, and the music selection left little to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nI could go off on numerous tangents about each of the [important] characters but to save time and space: \\n\\n\r\nthey were all well written with their own motivations, reasoning, likable and irritable traits, they had fitting reactions and were, in my honest opinion, more relatable/human/'natural' than in most other anime. Although some development is lacking, the execution more than makes up for it if I say so myself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I loved this anime there were numerous issues with the story which I found to be greatly detrimental to the overall show but not enough to make me dislike it. It's a show I'd definitely recommend and think stands on a solid 8/10.",

            "content": "It's an anime with a ton of Jazz music. Not much to say here except that whether or not one is a fan of jazz music, you are in for what is arguably one of the most well orchestrated and arranged soundtracks in recent anime productions. Combined with the fluidity of the show's animation, Kids on the Slope is a model of visual and musical entertainment, culminating in impressive musical numbers at several key points within the series. \r\nIt's also an anime about life in small town Japan during the 1960's. Aside from putting on a great show, there is significan meaning behind the music,for it is a representation of the time and setting of this anime. The anime references a number of famous real life jazz artists and their music, thus illustrating the inherent influence of American culture during the decade. Indeed, the show's music and they way it transforms from one stylistic genre to another draws parallels to the changes in one's life with the passage of time. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all, the narrative tells the story of an unlikely duo consisting of an introverted study-bug in Kaoru Nishimi and his counterpart, the brash school delinquent Sentaro Kawabuchi. Having only a knack for music in common, yet they are brother's in every sense except for blood; The bond these two main characters share only grows as the series progresses. This level of  platonic character development is not only rare in slice of life dramas but also frequently drowned out in favor of more cliched romances, and contrived tragedies. \\n\\n\r\nLouis Armstrong once said  \"The memory of things gone is important to a jazz musician.\" In keeping with that, Kaoru and Sentaro's bond with their friends (and each other) is epitomized, and later on immortalized in remembrance by their numerous jazz numbers together. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, there's a lot to like about this series and I hope you enjoy this series as much as I did. \"Kids on the Slope\" is an excellent slice of life story that draws a lot of empathy for its characters, while at the same time director Shinchiro Watanabe evokes his signature jazz themed narrative in collaboration, for the second time, with the talented Yoko Kanno (Their first collaboration over 15 years ago yielded the now anime classic \"Cowboy Bebop\"). \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhil I hope you found this review helpful, I am always trying to make my reviews better, so constructive feedback would be much appreciated ( just leave a post on my wall ). Or, if you wanna just talk about this series ( or anime in general ) you can do that too! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My opinion is kind of separated in two opposed thoughts.\r\nThe first one is that Kids on the slope is a really beautiful anime about music, and especially jazz. The ost is awesome, the different sessions between the characters are amazing, and the different renditions of some of the legendary jazz songs are all excellent.\r\nEach time Kaoru and Sentarou was about to play, I knew I was going to enjoy the thing. Not only the music was amazing, but the way it was used is fascinating. The characters were using music to express their feelings, providing various and colorful renditions of a same song whitin the12 episodes. Sometimes, they wouldn't speak to each other, but would simply use instruments to discuss and solve their problems. Trully a very thoughtful and poetic way to speak about music in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is about the romance aspect. I think this anime is really killed by the romance, which take a huge (even enormous)  place. I had read that this anime was into that kind of thing, but I was hoping something not that boring. Each time there was romance, all the characters were kind of dumb, acting weird and making no sense. Kaoru acted like an autist, Sentarou like someone with no willpower and Ri-chan like a vane, all of them enable to speak with each other.\\n\r\nI mean, I'm ok with a bit of romance (I'm not really into it but if it's just a bit I won't complain), but when it takes 3/4 of the anime in a boring way, I can't pass through it.\\n\r\nIt's even more a pity, considering the other aspects treated in the anime (family issues, passage from child to adult is kinda good, even if I didn't understand that episode with Kaoru's mother (since it didn't impact at all the rest of the anime).\\n\\n\r\nSo, it's quite balanced. I liked it for the music, but I was completely bored by the romance. I was about to rate this anime 6/10, but well, it's worth watch it, despite the dumb romance. 7 should be fine for one of the most beautiful anime about music and jazz.",

            "content": "How do I even start ... if you're looking for a 12 episode Masterpiece, THIS IS IT!!! The first thing that got me into it is the genre, historical drama. The settings is drawn magnificently, we're in the late '60, Japan, the olympics are a fond recollection, the war is a distant memory, and Neil Armstrong hasn't landed on the moon yet. A rich, slightly cowardly teenager makes friends with the school bully through their love of music, and by music I mean jazz. The atmosphere is bohemian, there's also a girl, there's always a girl, but I would be spoiling you if I'd dwelveany deeper. This anime in all seriousness has changed who I am, how I see life, how preconceptions can become opportunities, how love and friendship might or might not end. The art is simply gorgeous, no bad CG here, no any type of CG LOL. About the music. First, this isn't a musical anime, like Hibike or La corda d'oro. This is drama, with characters that rejoice in music. That said, the legendary Yoko Kanno signes the score, and right from the opening you know this isn't your randon 1 cours anime. In terms of character progression there's a lot to talk about, but I would be spoiling you so I'll refrain myself to saying that things aren't what you'd expect in this anime, neither the characters nor the story. Needless to say, I give it a 10 out of 10. Hope you enjoy it, even if drama might not be your mainstay, you know we've talked about preconceptions, but once you do see it, you'll get hooked. Good bye for now.",

The friendship between the 2 mc is truly the highlight of the anime. And I enjoyed the music even thought I'm not into jazz.\r\nThe downside is the animation (really hated Ritsuko's character design) but theplot makes up for it, also the ending is so satisfying (if you don't feel satisfied enough, go read the manga for a few extra chapters). Overall it's definitely worth a watch and I recommend you to watch this anime.",

            "content": "Having a friend must be one of the greatest feelings ever, even better if he or she becomes a close one. You want to do everything together, from watching movies to playing card games, it's a whole lot of fun. Now, after a day well spent with that best friend of yours, you go back home and start reflecting: How did you two first meet? How will this friendship end?\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I am honoured to say that Sakamichi no Apollon, or Kids on the Slope, is one of my favourite music animes to date. A lot of people wonder whether this show is aboutthe friendship of the main two males of the story, Kaoru and Sentarou, or the romance of the main couple, Kaoru and Ritsuko. To be honest, I don't know and I don't care either. Both themes play a huge role in making this anime as beautiful as it is.\\n\\n\r\nLet's break it down, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't say the story was flawless, it did have its weak points here and there. But overall, they did a pretty good job on the plot for this anime. As a music anime, I agree that this show didn't have much of a focus on Jazz, but it still played an important role in bringing the characters together. What happened from there drifted more to romance, friendship and slice of life. In my opinion, I accepted that shift in genres but it could be just my lack of interest in jazz music.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk a bit about the romance in this story. It is very typical and cliche, with the main character falling in love with a girl who didn't know about her own feelings then. It felt flat, but I was anxious to see how it would develop from there. And I was not let down at all. With the sudden appearance of Yurika, whom Sentarou falls in love with, the plot immediately improved. Love triangles formed here and there and the characters begin questioning their love for one another. More characters showed up, creating a more complicated and interesting story overall. The show clearly nailed it.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the series, the show started to slowly drift back to the music genre. Friendships fall, gets rebuilt again and mass chaos happens here and there in terms of their emotions for each other. Those conflicts kept the story interesting and worthwhile to watch. The pre-ending was not rushed at all, the pace was smooth and understandable. And the ending was just heartwarming and delightful. Overall, I enjoyed the story and the only problem I saw here was the lack of focus on music. That's all, no biggie.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. The way the characters moved, the landscape and their facial expressions, they nailed it. The amount of effort put into the anime to make it feel realistic is really underappreciated. I just felt uncomfortable at the fact that Ritsuko resembled a guy, in a certain way. If that's fixed, the art is flawless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nEvery anime needs a good opening that can reel in the viewer's interest, and part of it comes from the song. Kids on the Slope had a beautiful opening song, \"Sakamichi no Melody\" or \"Melody of the Slope\". It had no connection whatsoever to Jazz, which I'm sure disappointed many, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It had a heartwarming and delightful feel to it, and the climax of the song illustrated how fast time flies when you're with someone you enjoy being with. I'm sure that was what they were going for. Altair, the ending, was slow and had a melancholic feel to it, which was perfect for the ending of the whole series. Once again, not much connection to Jazz, but I still enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters seemed very boring and typical at first glance. Kaoru, a nerd. Sentarou, a bully. Ritsuko, the cutie. It just felt flat, but as the series progressed, I witnessed the development of the characters as well. No character was stuck with one personality for the rest of the series. Kaoru had a rough side that makes him easily pissed, Sentarou had a soft side that makes him caring at times, Ritsuko has a sensitive side hidden under that delightful smile. Characters that seemed good at first glance suddenly turn against each other and you start to see their true colours. Sakamichi no Apollon nailed the character development, and I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAs you have probably realised, I love this anime. All its up and downs, all its flaws and all its beauty, it burns deeply in my heart. From the start, I was hooked and I enjoyed watching them be together. The ending warmed my heart and broke it at the same time, realising that another outstanding show has ended. No one can truly understand what I feel about this anime without watching it, hence Wittgenstein's Beetle-In-A-Box analogy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nAnother great show ends, so you sit down and start thinking. The anime has impacted your life and you start noticing things about the friendship between you and your close friend, and you slowly begin to tie them together. How did both of you first meet? Was it as dramatic as Kaoru sliding off a white sheet, meeting Sentarou asleep on a couch beside the rooftop of the school? How did you want your friendship to end? Do you want it dramatic and happy, just like how this show ended? Now you realise what you want in this friendship, now it's up to you to create a bond with a friend that could last forever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hence, I rest my case.",

            "content": "Some light spoilers~\r\n    The melody is, tu-tu-tuuuuuu tu-tu-tuuuuuuu, a lot like love.\r\nThat there is a single line from the opening song of \u2018Kids on the Slope\u2019 (\u2018Sakamichi no Apollon\u2019 in Japanese) titled \u2018Sakamichi no Melody\u2019 performed by YUKI. The moment the female singer passionately chirped out, \u201cMelody wa~\u201d which was followed by a mighty trumpet, I knew that Sakamichi could very well be a memorable ride. I had goosebumps. A welcome sign, yes.\r\nI first came across Sakamichi while bingeing DemolitionD\u2019s \u2018Should You Watch\u2019 review series on YouTube. His review of Sakamichi was pretty damn hilarious. The 4 minutes video had 2 minutesdedicated to Demo\u2019s classic antics. That was more than a year ago. So, when I watched Sakamichi recently and then hit Demo\u2019s review again, I was surprised how much I did not remember. Thus, you can exhale a breath of relief that this review is not biased.\\n\\n\r\nThe point about bias is quite important, actually. Sakamichi is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe who was also behind such influential works as \u2018Cowboy Bebop\u2019 and \u2018Samurai Champloo\u2019. Except for the befuddling mess that was \u2018Terror in Resonance\u2019, many people simply guffaw over Watanabe\u2019s works upon hearing his name. Personally, I found Cowboy Bebop to be just average while I consider Samurai Champloo to be one of my favorite anime. Space Dandy was pretty damn fun as well. As for Sakamichi\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll kick off the review by saying that Sakamichi has to be Watanabe\u2019s second best work. It\u2019s not at the level of Samurai Champloo, which is in a class of its own, but it will still manage to leave a strong impression on most viewers \u2013 regardless of whether they like Jazz or not.\\n\\n\r\nI myself am not heavily into Jazz (nor any particular genre for that matter) but I do still appreciate good music. Sakamichi\u2019s use of, what I assume is, classic Jazz cements the base firmly for the plot to easily get into the SWING of things. And, that, it does.\\n\\n\r\nSakamichi\u2019s plot is actually quite simple. Cliches and tropes are a-plenty. That doesn\u2019t devalue nor demean the show\u2019s story. Cliches and tropes exist for a reason and that reason is that they work. They are things you just can\u2019t simply throw out of the window just like our main boy character did with the other male lead when he came into his room at night for some sweet boy-loving. Going for a stupid and plot-hole inducing twist in order to seem \u2018fresh\u2019 instead of executing tried ideas to perfection is just outright silly, in my opinion. An example would be Angel Beat\u2019s final reveal. It just came completely out of nowhere and brought up a whole series of questions that it did not even attempt to answer even by foreshadowing or whatever. No, \u2018Randy Orton: the Anime\u2019, you can fuck off and so can my tears.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story starts off with classical pianist and socially anxious Kaoru transferring to a highschool in Kyushu where he somehow befriends the local thug-with-a-heart Sentarou using the power of Jazz. As the narrative pushes forward, you find the usual teenage melodrama accompanying the adventures the teens experience over the course of 2 years in the 1960s. There\u2019s lots of drama \u2013 most of which is caused by the usual buffoonery of our Kaoru almost always blowing things as much out of proportion as a horndog with his very first blow-up sex doll. This is all supported with excellent musical performances by the cast. The music doesn\u2019t take center stage nor is it made to stand out on the curb in a \u2018Top Cat\u2019 costume.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is predictable, of course. It\u2019s a teenage romantic drama. There\u2019s only so much you can do with that certain mix of genres. Thankfully, Sakamichi wonderfully makes use of its setting to expand on it as a whole. The anime feels like a misunderstood kouhai wanting to be noticed by their senpai and managing to succeed at that goal.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that Sakamichi achieves this task flawlessly. The pacing may sometimes drag and sometimes it will jump around much too quickly. This is especially evident with the scenes that concern Jun, Sentarou\u2019s neighbor, and Yukari, Sentarou\u2019s crush. While the scenes deal with a much more serious romantic endeavor, what with Yukari still being in highschool and Jun being a college dropout disowned by his family, they progress faster than the very first episode of \u2018Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun\u2019 (there\u2019s a confession and kiss in there). Maybe an extra episode could have helped. Or they could have removed some of Kaoru\u2019s idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nAnother not-so-perfect point in regards to Sakamichi\u2019s plot is the ending. It\u2019s just meh. I was all smiles while I was watching it. Then, when I spent the next couple of minutes pondering it over I realized that it wasn\u2019t as special as I initially had thought. Certainly, the very last moment was an absolute oomph when the opening song played to conclude the Jazzy ride but the few scenes before THAT didn\u2019t have weight behind them. Goosebumps be damned! Sakamichi could have been better but it copped out with what I assume the director and writer(s) must have thought to be a true-to-life, and so, bittersweet ending.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of bittersweet, I am hungry and, thus, I must end this review. So, onto the technical stuff!\\n\\n\r\nMAPPA and Tezuka Productions have done an excellent job overall. The animation is standard. The CGI doesn\u2019t suck arse. It\u2019s actually quite fluid. The decision to use such a coloring technique that it nearly matches the gradients of colors of the CGI was a smart move. The character designs are quite expressive as well. When matched with on-point voice actors, the big picture comes together quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already gone into the Jazz specifics. Enthusiasts may recognize the names and works of Billy Evans and Chet Baker. The background music is alright. Suits the show. The opening and ending songs are fantastic. They build on the character of the anime. As I usually say, \u201cInto the music folder they go,\u201d and that they shall.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Sakamichi scores an 8.5/10 from me (rounded off to 9 for MAL). With some refinement, it could have easily being a 10/10 show but it just kind of lost steam towards the end. It also momentarily touched on some rather mature topics such as racism and economical divide but it didn\u2019t use them as junctions where it could find footholds with which to climb higher. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend Kids on the Slope. You might either really like it or just find it dull if limited melodrama doesn\u2019t amuse you.",

            "content": "For starters, if you were never introduced to the Jazz style of music, this anime will pump your veins full of hard hitting, fast paced, funky jazz, and the best part is.. you may just get hooked.  Not only is the music smooth and funky, but the main characters are extraordinarily lively.\r\nThe story is centered around a young lad in high school who is supposedly at the top of his class.  It is said that he studies hard and all of the other classmates envy him and in turn, hate him.  He isn't very social with anyone and life goes on, untillater into the first day of school.  The main character becomes nauseated and runs to the rooftop of the building where he can relax, except that he runs into bullies before reaching the top.  Here is where the first supporting character comes in. I won't spoil the rest.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and final supporting character keeps the peace between the two, but later down the line causes twists in the plot line.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about true companionship and leaves a warm, if not fired up, feeling in your heart, even through the hardships happening around the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, we'll begin with the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 10 - This is the first time that I have marked a slice of life genre with a ten.  I was consistently enthralled to continue the story just find out what else is happening in this ordinary life. I mean, does anybody actually say that?  \\n\r\nGraphics - 8 - Very well done.  Nothing to blow the mind like \"Ahh, that was sooo amazing!\" or \"Woah, I forgot to breathe\", but I can say that they were well crafted.\\n\r\nSound - 10 - I never truly understand Jazz until I watched this anime.  Now, I can say that a piece of me is addicted to this new sound.\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 - The reasons for the actions of each the main character and two supporting characters are explained through the anime. These three characters are so LIVELY in terms of emotions and motives.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - Very, very cool slice of life anime.  I even took the extra time to lookup songs from the genre and download to my phone.\\n\r\nRecommended: It's quite possible that others will not see this anime as a ten, but this is definitely not an anime that will leave anyone disappointed. The crowd score at this moment in time is around 8.50.  I highly recommend.\\n\\n\r\nIceMasterCho out!",

            "content": "Another unexpected Josei anime that I didn't notice. So.. music and drama.. Yeah,  Shigatsu wa kimi no Uso has some similarities to this series but don't worry, no deaths here... or was there one? Huehuehuehue... Yeah just find out for yourself but don't push so much and hate on me for that. \r\nAnyways, I guess the plot was unique and very well blended into the story. The Drama based slice of life resembles other series with the same genres. This series was a bit older than Shigatsu so I don't think anyone copied either. Since the setting was in the late 1960's, it wasthe era which Jazz music was popular and classic Rock was about to be born. The place it centered around was a countryside with simple lifestyles showcased by the characters. Though the series was musically centered, it was well balanced by the other genres it was tagged for.The art is decent for a series with its age and most backgrounds are well detailed. The characters may have unique traits but atleast they show real feelings unlike fiction only emotions during different situations. The character development is on point and maybe a bit unexpected sometimes. I didn't enjoy this series very much because I cringe at awkward romance situations and I can't stand to watch those events. I appreciate that the series used real songs and brands for the props of the story. Though I am someone who is into rock and metal, I appreciated Jazz music from this series and it piqued my interest in this genre of music. So this anime being centered around that wasn't really that bad. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime an excellent rating because it has shown the things that I want to see and what the author and producers wanted the audience to see from this series that they have created. It does not need a sequel because it was given enough closure in the end. I recommend this to viewers who want to explore the unique beat of Jazz Music.",

            "content": "I usually go nuts for this sort of thing. 1950s/60s Japanese setting (flashbacks of Kurosawa) with a focus on character and setting with coming-of-age drama and the connections formed by music predominating, all mixed together with beautiful Studio Ghibli-esque animation and directed by the guy who did Cowboy Bebop. But something about it just never clicked for me. Maybe it's the jazz focus (I've never really been a jazz fan) but I think it's more the lack of any structure or satisfying resolution. Not that the ending is bad. Actually, the concluding section is near perfect. It's just that nothing builds up to anything andin the end all the characters seem to be drifting aimlessly. Maybe that's the point? I don't know. All I know is that it had lost my attention by about episode eight and the last few episodes were a real struggle to get through.\\n\\n\r\nIt also bothered me that the character motivations seem so incomprehensible. That's a typical Japanese thing, particularly in the mid-20th century and earlier, but just because a piece is set in a time doesn't mean it has to be obtuse. I'm reminded of my least favorite Kurasawa film, The Quiet Duel, in which a doctor contracts syphillis when operating on a wounded soldier and spends the rest of the film heroically not saying anything about it to his fiance (who he can now never marry) or anyone else since he cannot bear to live with the apparently impossible shame. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me either. And the characters here act like that. Shame prevents them from doing absolutely anything (although it doesn't extend to performing publically, oddly, the one area where that makes total sense to me) and even when all sides know something nobody is ever willing to talk about it. And really, I didn't understand the reasons behind half of what the lead does.",

It made me laugh, cry, yell, rejoice then repeat all of that again and I'm not one to easily feel that for a show but this was so good, sometimes I wanted to reach into the screen and help/talk/jam with them. This is a really good anime with a simple and beautiful storythat will make you care about almost every charecter that is on screen. the only problem I have with this anime is that I want more, I feel like its so much left unsaid and the ending will make you want to be a fly on the wall in the room when the 3 main characters meet up, I find myself a little envious that I don't know these characters and that ill probably never get to hear from them again but what they gave me was incredible and memorable and I hope they are living their best life. Oh and it goes without saying the art work and music in this anime is phenomenal with the characters love of jazz music and how it effects them and the story. 9/10 would Highly recommend and watch again.",

            "content": "An anime that i feel appreciate jazz in many ways atleast thats how i feel as i relax and watch it but with its bumps its not all rosy as i watch this. \r\nThe story is well created its not typical and since it focus on an earlier time and place when everything was different i would say that brings out something unique in that regards. This is best examplified with how some people behave or act since remember this anime is set in an older time there people had less choices in their life. I have two minds about this story as i havewatched this anime. On one hand i have the feelings of loving the flow but , on the other hand i only like the flow to a certain point in the anime. After the introduction episodes were done there we found out about most characters i felt they tried to pack too much drama into it and it became staggering how much you felt the story stopped and flowed as one watched it. It was kinda like a crack in a record that just kept staggering. And this is kinda why for me the anime at a point took what i felt was a melodramatic turn until it slowed and went into a nice pace again of a sort. \\n\\n\r\nAs with many musical anime its no wonder that in this case the music takes the highest marks because this anime gives from what i feel a great representation of jazz. Although there can always be more its a nice that there is an anime that manage to capture and make people like the genre just from having watched an anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo in this anime there is 3 main character which i can try to summarise my thoughts about. \\n\r\nKawabuchi, Sentarou who is the typical delinquent who gets into fights with random people and is mostly feard by many due to his strenght. Hes a nice enough and likeable character in itself but he also is the typical dense character who doesnt realise how he feels many times and has to be told by his friend who has to try to steer him the right way. That dense character can sometimes get too much as with any character with that trait. \\n\\n\r\nNishimi, Kaoru is an introverted boy who has had to move alot around when he was young. Due to this he is made into at first being the typical boy who gets pushed into taking the mantle from his family and do what they/his aunt tell him to. Feels like a pushover but has a really outgoing personality and is fun to follow as you watch the anime and gets to know his thoughts and feelings. Although i would say in his case his drama can sometimes gets too much and it starts to get irritating. \\n\\n\r\nMukae, Ritsuko is a female who feels very much like the shy yet lovable character who one almost feel is a supportive one but as you move through the story one sees her as a true main and learn to feel with her or get irritated over her depending on your feelings. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime alot although there were things i wished could have been done better i really enjoyed how most of it went. I would recommend this anime to most people although some might say that the beginning is slow or that a character seems a little too boring and doesnt show enough i can almost promise that it will get better. Its great for those who want to enjoy music with a good story combined with some interesting characters that you will enjoy in your own ways. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough i might praise it alot more i still feel that this anime for me is an 8. Why because i feel that it was being too dramatic for my taste. There was a certain point in it there i felt there was a good balance between the two but as the anime went further it went more and more on the melodrama and it annoyed me that i rarely got a moment to just enjoy the anime and music it had.",

(Beforehand, I'd like to apologize for all mistakes that I could overlook m(_ _)m)\r\nOk, here we go...\r\nStory: 9/10\r\n\"Reminds me of \"Beck\"- that was my first thought after the first episode. \"Nope, it's closer to \"Honey and clover\"- was my thought after the second episode.Right now, I don't actually care about this anymore.\r\nBasic things: 'school','friendship','love','joint interest'. It should seem to be nothing new. Then what's so great about it? Why do I continue to watch it? Sincere realistic story. I think that's the main point. It should seem, ordinary, even stereotypical thing, yet..it looks real. Rightnow, though I've watched only 10 episodes and I don't know where this story will go. I've got a feeling that it actually could have happened. It's hard to say what exactly makes me think like this..Who knows. But the fact that I do believe in it, makes this anime brilliant in my eyes.    \\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSoft colours deepen the 'retro' atmosphere. Characters look not too realistic nor too embellish. Hm.. reminds me of 'Paradise Kiss', 'Baccano' and 'Beck'.\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nJazz..should I add something? If you're not a fan of it, this anime will make you like it :)\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nWhat I really like about them, that they seems to be real. Just normal girls and boys.\\n\r\n(Accent makes them even more adorable)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nLike listening to a retro record...It brings some thoughts about past and present. Was it better back than? Maybe nothing has changed..or maybe... \\n\r\nSad thoughts, pleasant thoughts. Like a jazz music, this anime will relax you and make your calm mind just drift on the waves.",

            "content": "Kids On the Slope is a solid piece of work, but it pales in comparison with other works of the same or similar genres. What's wrong with it in my opinion? It feels unnatural. \r\nIn other words, the progression of events and the interaction of characters make me feel like they are what they are for the sake of the storyline and overall atmosphere. It's like, you first create an unchangeable backdrop and lot of things to be done and then make some characters fit in some roles to do those things. I didn't feel any deeper traits that actually defined each character, so consequently,whether or not the characters are what they are doesnt really matter to the story anymore, since the story would nevertheless progress the way it was written. This type of progression might work fine for horror or mystery, but definitely not for drama or slice of life. I believe that the importance of each characters foremost must surpass the importance of the storyline in order for a drama to be successful. Otherwise, there is no point in watching it since it would be too trivial. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about this series is that the story lacks anything that pops. You can say that's the way Josie series are. However, for me this can only mean the Josie genre needs a breakthrough. Anyways, for me, no matter you use which genre to define this show, it doesn't live up to the potential in any of the genres. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is a solid piece of work. From the music to the animation, there is nothing one can really complain about. The big picture is perfect, but too perfect for the characters to shine through. That's why I couldn't bring myself to like it as much as I wanted to.",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon, in my opinion, was a great anime. The animation is what dragged me in. Usually I don't like reading the synopsis because I like \"surprises\". I watched both the subbed and the dubbed and the voice acting was amazing. \r\nKaoru and Sentaro had amazing backgrounds which made them seem like total opposites. Kaoru is a rich and smart kid with no place in his home and has a liking to classical music at first. Sen on the other hand is a poor kid and bad student with a really sad background which makes him have no place in society so he takesout his frustration through fighting and jazz music. Both of them are outsiders which make them become closer. Its a slice of life which means expect it to pull on your heart strings. \\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nSPOILERS:\\n\\n\r\nMy least favorite character was Ritsuko since she rejected Kaoru's feelings  after he kissed her since she liked Sen and then a year later she starts liking Kaoru. Although their relationship goes nowhere which is a real bummer cause I was looking forward to more development in that. Brother Jun and Yurika had an amazing relationship together which made up for it. \\n\\n\r\nI especially liked how it didn't end with a \"What happened to Sen?\" Ending. It's rare to find anime series which go +8 years Into the future to show how each of the characters have developed in their lives.\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sakamichi no Appollon had an outstanding animation, amazing dub and sub, good characters, and great music which added to the anime. I'd recommend to watch it.",

That late 1960's vibe, combined with the animation and music of the show, and lively characters..all of it was simple, yet effective and satisfying. Sentaro was my go-to watch character in the series, just because his story and appearance, and his attitude, and he was christian. Richie and him went great together in the whole series, it felt..right and necessary having them around each other, because the anime felt interesting wheneverthey would meet up. Just those two making music, filled KOTS duties on music. Of course let's not forget the other musicians. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters weren't too important aside from Ritsu. Junichi's scenes and involvement were good, but really...man all I wanted to see is if when am I going to see more jazz being made! Richie and Sentaro, without them getting screen time together the show would be probably bad! Those two characters go hand-in-hand, because they created lots of entertainment for me. The last episode..oh man it was fantastic, a great ending indeed (you won't be disappointed!)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the story, some parts feel extremely rushed..and those specific parts I felt would've been essential to make the story more interesting and to get to know the characters way more. The story isn't special at all aside from the heart-warming and tear-jerking ending. I never understood Richie, he was so surprising and so interesting in the beginning of the series, however later on, he gets confusing. I never got to know much about him aside from his few interests. Again, this story is laughable and probably mediocre, simple but nothing much to talk about, although the ending justified it for me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music..I went ahead and downloaded the ost. You will most likely be to do so as well if your into Yoko Kanno's stuff. I watched the OP every episode. Special effects were close to none at all including atmospheric effects, car noises, birds chirping, wind blowing, none of that organic stuff. Voice acting was good, I liked it alot! Background music fitted in so well with so many of the scenes as I could remember, some of them were really feel-good and just nice to have an ear on!\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'll end this review here. I want to recommend you to watch this anime, even though there's a tiny chance you won't like it..but it's only 12 episodes of music, drama, and romance. ALso, I just wanna say this anime made me cry like buckets. Just do yourself a favor and watch Sakamichi No Apollon, it won't hurt. If you like enlightening and heart-warming stuff, watch this anime!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nMay grace and peace be with you, and God bless you. :)",

The first day of school was really tough for him but he asks where the roof of the school is on his way up he sees this sheet put over a bench this is where he first meets Sentarou and his high school life changes. He goes on to becoming friends with this boy after he giveshim keys to the roof and follows him around. Sentarou is someone who gets into a lot of trouble due to his enjoyment of fighting so Kaoru is very unsure about him. He finds out Ritsuko the class rep is childhood friends with him. They end up all becoming friends with the power of music Sentarou plays the drums and loves jazz music so Kaoru being a piano player wants to impress him by learning jazz. Throughout this series there are a lot of huge things that lead up to Ritsuko and Kaoru winding up together. This series was honestly so heart warming I love this anime because of all the fantastic music in this anime and the heart warming love story of two friends and there hardships of getting each other to fall in love. I honestly find this series so appealing with its simplistic art style, great story, and great character back story.",

            "content": "Ok this is my first time writing a review, so it's probably going to be quite short, but this anime gave me too many feels I just have to review it.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nWhy 10? To me, it's not the actual plot itself, but the way it is presented that's perfect. I'm not sure how to phrase it properly, but the way the story flows is very natural. It doesn't take any big dramatic event to make it develop, it's just that episode by episode you get dragged into it naturally. \r\nArt: 9/10\r\nI've read reviews before I finally decided to watch this anime, but the art iswhat mainly attracted me.\\n\r\nSimple art style but beautiful lighting, and not to forget, the way the animation was done. Unlike some animes, motion and movements in this anime are done incredibly well, especially movements like drumming and playing the piano. It made me actually feel like it was real, that the characters were drumming and playing piano, instead of real people who did the job for these sounds.\\n\r\nOne thing that bugged me a little though, was the fact that girls had a jawline like a guy's, it decreased the femininity. This is the reason why I gave the art a 9 and not a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nFor a person like me who has never really listened to Jazz before, I actually quite enjoyed the music. The songs were catchy and actually 'Moanin' is still stuck in my head.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe best freaking part. The characters are the most outstanding thing of this anime, emphasizing Kaoru and Sentarou. If I were forced to choose one of these two, I can't, because to me they're both equally awesome. They both have a soft and strong side. What's very interesting is that the physically strongest one (Sentarou) isn't always the protector. He has his weak moments and Kaoru is always the one taking initiative and clearing Sen's thoughts at the right time. I'm kind of bad at describing such things but if you watch the anime you will understand.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI finished this anime in two days but I would have finished it in one day if I wasn't occupied with school. I enjoyed this anime a hell lot and I honestly wish I'd have watched it earlier. The only thing that didn't please me was the ending. I don't like the way it was ended and the fact that some things weren't explained and elaborated. But that's just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDespite the somewhat 'meh' ending, I'd say overall this anime is a masterpiece. To me it definitely is. I would recommend this anime to anyone, even people who aren't into Jazz. Feel free to give it a shot. Trust me, you won't regret it.\\n\\n",

At first I would've never thought I'd watch this anime, but I am so glad I did!

Then there's  the romance and friendship bonds that grow as the episodes go on will make you feel like you cancompare your story to this, and I think that if an anime can make you do that, then it's damn well worth watching.\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nI'm a big critic on artwork and I will overlook an anime if I cant bear the artwork, but the artwork in this anime is great. I don't really like artwork like this in an anime, but I am so glad I made myself get used to it, because I would've missed out on a fantastic master piece!\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nDo I need any explaining?

            "content": "\"Sometimes life is like jazz and moves in an unexpected direction.\"\r\nThis one line from this anime sums up this series well, especially in terms of its story and characters. One thing the synopsis doesn't tell you is that this anime is about learning to be open to new experiences, because life doesn't always go up or down or in a circle.\r\nThe character that best embodies this lesson is Kaoru Nishimi, who is one of the main characters and the main focus of this anime. Before he meets Sentarou (a tough, imposing male) and Ritsuko (Sentarou's female childhood friend), Kaoru is an intelligent stiff with socialanxiety issues so bad that he feels ill when he feels stressed about interacting with others. Kaoru encloses himself in a metaphorical circle and walks through life with a metaphorical \"down\" perspective that he gradually comes out of as the series progresses and he learns to play jazz.\\n\\n\r\nSentarou and Ritsuko embody unexpected directions because of the impact they have on Kaoru and because they aren't what you expect, especially from reading the anime's synopsis. If you have any doubts about this, I recommend watching the first four episodes before you decide to drop this. \\n\\n\r\nThe most touching thing about the complexity of Sentarou and Ritsuko is that with Kaoru, they form a deep bond that is like a family. Even when those three are in a love triangle, the familial bond is still there. Despite their romantic feelings, Sentarou is like a elder brother, Ritsuko is like a sister in the middle, and Kaoru is like the youngest brother. This familal bond that causes them to try not to hurt each other and feel remorseful when they do end up doing so.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters, the soundtrack is incredible. Composed by Yoko Kanno, the jazz music provides an atmosphere similar to that in Cowboy Bebop, except this jazz isn't bebop. It's relaxing stuff in the vein of John Coltrane (whose work is featured a bit in this anime btw), except during action scenes (which are scored just as well as the stuff from Cowboy Bebop). I downloaded half the soundtrack after watching just the 1st episode, b/c I knew Yoko Kanno would make it great.\\n\\n\r\nThe next-to-last notable thing in this anime is the setting. Since it is set in the sixties, a bit of historical and cultural stuff is sprinkled throughout the anime, such as racism, the popularity of rock n' roll (esp. The Beatles), and political student protests. This added depth to the characters' world and made things more interesting for them at times.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the last notable thing in this anime are little details (probably provided by Cowboy Bebop director Shinichiro Wantabe) such as the episode titles being named after jazz songs, the early love confessions (thank you for not occurring at the very end) and the way music ties the three main characters just as much as their drama.\\n\\n\r\nI've only seen two other music-centered josei anime (NANA and two seasons of Nodame Cantabile), but this one has become my favorite one (sorry NANA). If NANA is the best josei anime with post college grads, then Kids on The Slope is the best josei anime with high school students.\\n",

            "content": "Oh my God!!!!This anime had the power to make me burn inside wishing to write a review.It's just as good as that.\r\nI have been thinking for a long time that anime these days cannot realy be at the same level as old creations, but this one proved me the opposite.Now let's analyse its good points.\r\nStory:as it is said in the synopsis, the events are happening around  '60.There is also a little presentation of the historical movements that took place around that time when Japan was healing from the war's scars and was filled with Americajin.All these exist so that you can go back intime and imagine (kind of) how thins were going then.\\n\r\nBut the most important thing about this story is the friendship between the characters.I would say that the whole series is created to display a good example of friendshis.It's a mixture of honest feelings,pain,growth,resentiments,development,past-future,emotional-connections,making your dream reality,etc.\\n\r\nAnother thing that a want to point out is the way it ends.Generally you feel kind of dissapointed if it's smth cheesy.or easy to anticipate but it won't happen with this one.\\n\\n\r\nArt:well,i'm not an expert and i don't know many things about this subject but i still can say little.First af all,the art of this anime is made so that it can make you believe you are seeing the real thing.No shiny faces,no extremely handsome boys,no unreal proportions.It's more like a movie,trying to express reality.\\n\\n\r\nSound:it teaches you a lot.An important episode fron the history of music is displayed:the Jazz period.And not only this.Also the Rock-and-roll influences.\\n\r\nIt's very interesting to see what's their hobby:playing Jazz in the basement.\\n\r\nThe OST of this series is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:these characters are complex human beings and are portrayed as real humans.The fight,reconcile,hit each other,reconcile again,are saying stupidities,regretting,crying,smiling,are enjoying each other's presence or not.We are not perfect.Humans are not perfect.All that matters is the way we live our life.Enjoy it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:THE BEST!",

            "content": "To start off, finding an anime series like this hardly happens.  There is a very small majority of anime that has jazz music, slice of life, and school genres included.  Sakamichi no Apollon is one of those gems that hardly comes along in anime.  Since it is directed by Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, you know it's gonna be be good.  So, I'll begin with the story.  In a nutshell, our protagonist Kaoru Nishimi has been transferred to a school.  He finds our major secondary character  Sentar\u014d Kawabuchi and spark a really bromantic relationship.  They then start jazzsessions at Ritsuko Mukae's, who is also a major character, session room.  To let you know, if you can tolerate episodic episodes here and there and pacing shifts then you should be good.  If you can't, well try anyway.  The story is original which also makes the story twist and turn.  Also, there is... about 2 love triangles and some awkward social moments too that will make you cringe.  All in all, story deserves a 9.  The art is amazing.  If you have watched Honey and Clover, which I strongly recommend you do, you'll find there are similarities.  Though it is uncommon, there are times when it fails. So, I give the art a 10.  The sound is not for everyone.  I love jazz, but it is really uncommon to find other people who do.  If you don't, don't watch it, because it is very heavily influenced by jazz.  If you have watched Baccano! or Cowboy Bebop you shouldn't have a problem.   After all, it is composed by Yoko Kanno. I give the sound a 9.  I'm not gonna get deep into the characters, because there is a lot.  Each one is unique and are probably one of the most realistic anime characters I have experienced.  Like I said previously, there are 2 love triangles.  If you can't deal with unrequited love and awkward social moments, your cringe meter is gonna go off the charts.  I give the characters a 9.  I would give it an overall rating of 10, but that's my personal enjoyment, so I give it a 9.",

I was having high doubts about starting this ,but the only thing I doubt now is not starting this any sooner. The character development is amazing. There wasn't a single character without a purpose. When their happy ,I'm happy. When their sad ,I can't help but feel sad too. It brought up all the emotions in me and I am so sad that it ended. Sakamichi no Apollon has become one of my recentfavourite anime. I honestly can't see how anyone would not like that  even though it's a Josei (aimed for older female audience). This anime is amazing and I can not recommend it enough. It deserves respect and it's one of those animes where you have to watch till the end to go back and appreciate the beginning. \\n\\n\r\n10 out of 10 for all.",

            "content": "I wondered why the anime seemed oldy-worldy, didn't realize it was set in the 60's...\r\nHello guys, and welcome again to a Waldy565 review. I absoloutley LOVE music so decided to watch this series instead of my usual one-episode reviews, and at only 12 episodes there was really no point reviewing it from only one show!\r\nStory - the story is, hmm, hard to judge. I may repeat myself a little when talking about the characters because they are linked (story and character that is). You can read the description yourself, but yeah, my score explains my thoughts!\r\nArt - the art is really nice! It's not themost beautiful I've seen (then again, my favourite anime art is the CGI K-On/Love Live stuff, with hints of hand drawn stuff like You're Under Arrest and Cowboy Bebop) but I can't bash it either. It really complements the sound I think. Oh, speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nSound - WOW! This won't please everyone, but anyone who has a slight whiff of a music connoisseur about them will appreciate the musical score of the anime. I said the art complemented the sound, and what I mean by this is Jazz had it's high and low moments. However, personally, the jazz in this is all-high, no-low. Perfect, not has a soundtrack enticed me since K-On! (and Cowboy BeBop, Code Geass and Love Live before it)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I really, really like the characters. Many of them portray the \"under-dog\" figure, and you root for them whenever they struggle. I myself \"jam\" with my mates, we're not a band as such, so I can relate to the aspect of the four people being part of a band. I think what it is is they are relatable and show real, HUMAN emotion(s), and it makes them all the more enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - If you enjoy music, Jazz-especially, and want to enjoy an anime that has a not-so-rememrable story but interesting characters, I'd definetley give this a look into! However, don't like music-based anime? This ain't gonna change your mind...",

It wasn't a Hall of Fame soundtrack in any way, but the music really just fits the characters and the anime as a whole. Good job\r\nThe characters are pretty good, different personalities, unpredictable, and great job on this. Their personalities clash well with each other forming the decent story italked about in the first paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. Simple.

The creator of Kids on Slope is the same man behind Space Dandy, Samurai Champloo, and Cowboy Bebop. So if you enjoyed any of those shows I recommend Kids on the Slope.The story does have some cliches but I feel the pacing is fast enough and the relationships between the characters are believable enough that the cliches are not much of an issue. Kids on the Slope can be an endearing story of friendship and actually has a pretty well writtenromantic subplot.\\n\r\nOf Course the real appeal of Kids on the Slope is the awesome jazz soundtrack and the gorgeous animation. The same person who did the music for Cowboy Bebop, which had one of the most amazing soundtracks in all of anime, also did the soundtrack for Kids on the Slope. It is any jazz lover's dream come true. The animation for all of the music scenes is incredible. The motion of the characters playing their instruments is so realistic, detailed, and smooth that it looks like it could have been live action footage that the animators just drew over. And I played the drums for a couple years.\\n\r\nKids on the Slope is a must watch for any anime fans that like jazz, and I strongly recommend to fans of musical anime.",

As a jazz musician myself, I see this show as being incredibly accurate to the art and how it's portrayed to the community. From the jump, the story is built upon with background information to supply the viewer with a stable understanding of the protagonist and his ventures. The interaction between characters is nothing short of intimate which helps the overall pull of the shows content, although the characters can be a bit over dramatic at times. Besides that the music, scenery, artstyle, acting, and plot are amongst the best in my opinion. For any music lover out there who wants a good story to go with it, this is an absolute must.",

            "content": "I'll say I don't particularly like giving out good scores. If I find an issue with a series characters, story, progression, animation, themes, etc. I try my hardest to think critically and explore why such issues exist--and ways an anime could've done better.\r\nSTORY- (9/10) GREAT\r\nI know, my opening sentence may contradict that first review score, but the thing is the story is handled exceptionally well. If there was one issue I could note is that at the beginning of the story the main character has some sort of condition that seemed to have been caused by some childhood psychological issues, and its quickly resolved bytime he meets one of the other main cast members (which there are three) and not mentioned or brought up again throughout the rest of the story. I dislike that. If you're going to introduce an aspect about a character during the first episode, that defines who they are--don't simply disregard that because it would drive focus away from introducing other characters and plot elements. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, that was the only noticeable aspect. This is included in the story portion because had the main character been affected by his \"condition\" for longer than five minutes, the story's progression and direction would look drastically different than what was done instead. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime does include jazz as a backdrop to the other leads, but unlike Your Lie in April, it is not the main focus. It is simply a means for the characters to come together. A catalyst for building their relationships if you will. The progression and pacing is adequate enough to get the viewer invested in the different arcs, and they all make logical sense. That's actually the part I like the most. These characters behave like teenagers. They encounter problems that in retrospect seem petty and easily solved, are impressionable about the opposite sex, and attempt to grow in personality. the arcs play out well and are realistic to the point where I could see this being based off similar events. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART (7/10) GOOD\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe designs for the characters are tasteful and not overdone. None of the characters have outrageous hair designs, facial structures, or body compositions. The animation hits its high notes during the moments the characters are playing instruments, or there is a dramatic scene. Otherwise it is pretty standard across the board. This is an element I dislike. If they had animated the entire series the way they do when the characters are playing instruments, then the animation would've been more cohesive and consistent. To have exemplary animation in one scene, and return to standard animation in the next distances the viewer from the experience as a whole. It makes certain moments seem extra special while everything else is ordinary. Overall, since the standard animation was actually decent, the designs were consistent, backgrounds were interesting and fairly believable I would have to say the art is good but nothing special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10) VERY GOOD\\n\\n\r\nI'll say this: I do not listen to jazz in my everyday experience. So I do not know what \"Great jazz\" sounds like. I've never been into  the genre because I simply can't follow the instruments that weave in and out of melodies, the tones, and the direction of the music, but I digress. When these characters play instruments, it is well done. The score they have chosen for instances outside of musical performances is tasteful and doesn't detract from the scene. Things are silent when they need to be, background score volume is increased or played subtlety according to the direction of the scene, and most importantly, the music choice is very simple. The thing about the jazz pieces in this anime was that they weren't complicated to where it would take years of practice to play efficiently, but intermediate pieces that someone whose hobby was playing instruments would be able to learn and get better at. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect I found interesting is how the music actually played a part in developing the characters and story progression. For instance, the main character writes a song to play for the girl he has a crush on, later on in the story that same girl is startled when someone finds her humming that very song and uses that to initiate conversation. Very subtle techniques that make the score play apart of the story instead of being an afterthought.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (9/10) GREAT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main character has his shortcomings, as he is meant to represent the average smart teenager who moves into an unfamiliar place, but this is where the other two lead characters shine. The characters play well off one another and have actual conversations with one another that develop the story. The other characters play their part, and stay in it. They were driving forces for their particular arc, and after its conclusion they move on. The same characters don't tag along for the rest of the story, and so this helps the pacing. The characters all also have their own distinct personality that isn't simply based off of some weird trope. They do not change from one personality type to the other, but simply adapt in minor ways according to the plot progression. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10) OUTSTANDING\\n\\n\\n\r\nI watched this series in the span of three days, and so I may not have noticed some weird cutting off points between episodes but each episode served its purpose. There weren't any episodes devoted to filler, or an inconsequential event that had nothing to do with the over-arching story. Each event had its beginning, climax, and conclusion. The character progression was satisfying to watch unfold, and their behavior, reactions, and thoughts seemed very realistic. Some mistakes were made out of rash behavior, there were misunderstandings, but as the characters begin to learn more about each other and develop close relationships, these issues are resolved and the story doesn't backtrack. The pacing was done rather well, and the ending wasn't a \"and they all lived happily ever after!\" and not all of their problems are solved. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10) GREAT\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very good romance show. It is one of the instances where the high school isn't the most important location for the story, but more of a natural place. The story progressed very well, and the sound played a factor in its pacing. The characters were likable and not over the top and so I ended up invested in the events of the series. Definitely worth a rewatch in my case, and in the case of a new viewer: definitely something worth checking out.\\n\\n",

For these kinds of stories, there isn't a \"plot\" because the characters are the plot, like in Catcher in the Rye. Kaoru's transformation is just awesome because it reflects my own hesitations, and it is depicted just too realistically, it made me laugh... like a half-laugh. However, one character development that hasn't been explored yet is Sentaro's. He's all expressive and stuff, but will he change? Will he learn to restrain himself, as Kaoru does? If this show is going to be the best that it canbe, Sentaro needs to change as well. But what doesn't need to change is the sound. Magnificent jazz! Background music? It's Yokko Kanno! On the other hand, the art and images are not afraid to make an atmosphere, which they do successfully... and it's unique. Awesome stuff. Watch it!",

            "content": "Bill Evans starring as Richie Rich.\r\nAnd here I thought that Jazz was dead. Huh, figures. \r\nSakamichi no Apollon or Kids on the Slope, whichever you prefer, has music from Yoko Kanno (the same composer of the widely acclaimed Cowboy Bebop, I might add) and I think that gives a sufficient foothold to realize how good this anime is going to be.\r\nStory:\r\n7/10\r\nLet's start with the show's weakest point (although not a mediocre one) the story. The story starts like this: Bill Evans, is your usual hard working, rich, academician and pianist protege, that has recently moved to the islands where he plans to attend a newschool. Bill Evans, a freshman in highschool meets Sentarou, which introduces him to the world of Jaaaaaaazzzzz, in which Bill Evans get's accustomed to. Apollon has a very linear way of storytelling. Nothing complex or compelling, but it's definitely  heartwarming and travels at an enticing pace to leave you wanting more. Keep in mind, I watched the series in one seating, so that's pretty good evidence on how good the pacing was. Unfortunately, the story was a bit cliche' and dried out due to the heavy romance that got nowhere in the end. The setting is also very unique. Not a lot of animes take place in the 40's.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nI haven't seen a lot of music animes, but goddamn. Apollon's animation during the musical scenes are stupendously accurate! Seriously, I have no idea who was in charge with the main animation of Apollon, but damn is it good. The rest of the anime has standard animation, but the show's art really shines during the music scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nART BLAKEY!? BILL EVANS!? YOKO KANNO REMAKING THESE SONGS?\\n\r\nSeriously dude, what can I say about the music? It's free jazz, the best genre of music you'll find. Music is top notch, I just wished more of the show focused on the music, you know, considering it IS a music anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nApollon's strongest suit (besides the music) was the characters. The 3 main characters: Ritsuko, Sentarou, and Bill Evans, are amazing. Like I said, Bill is your standard smart dude, that meets a guy which then introduces him to the world of Jazz. By far, my favorite character was Sentarou. Sentarou is like that intimidating guy you meet on the first day of high school, but then you get to know him and he ends up being a cool dude. Over the series, Bill and Sen develop a very friendly and likable relationship, they also have their ordeals... Ritsuko, the love interest, was a very sweet girl, she was very caring and supportive for the two. The best part of this series is the way it makes the main character grow into such a different person by the end, but I'll let you see that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I was expecting a show heavy on music, whilst sacrificing plot and characters and instead got the best of three worlds. You can tell I enjoyed the series (considering I watched in one inning) so if you liked some of Yoko Kanno's previous works, then I can guarantee that you'll enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nYoko Kanno, man. Watch the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sakamichi no Apollon is one of the animes where you want to ask the producer \"Why? why did you have to destroy an almost perfect anime?\". For the reason why...read the review :)\r\nSakamichi no Apollon centers about a group of high school students who love jazz music. And where is music there i also love. Plenty of love :).\r\nThe main character, Nishimi Kaoru, is bright student with good grades but not so good in makings any friends. He's changed many school so he's got used to be alone.\r\nOn the other hand Sentarou Kawabuchi is an energeting young men who prefers fighting and skipping school, atotal opposite of Nishimi.\\n\r\nRitsuko Mukae is kind and gentle girl, probably the only friend of Sentaro, who will play a significant part in uniting them together.\\n\\n\r\nIt all starts when Nishima comes to a new school. Soon he hear rumors of a delinquent student who is in his class. Since he's the perfect target to be bulliied, he tries to stay away from him. (Un)forturnately he meets him on his very first day. In a little awkward situation Sentaro  helps him and soon they become friends. They learn that both of them play musical instruments and they start practising in a basement of Ritsuko's father music shop. Nishima soon meets two other band memebers Junichi Katsuragi and Ritsuko's father. From time to time they practice together and they made a small concert in a local bar. But... their problem comes, as usually, with love. It's not unusual to see love triangles in animes, but here we got a love pectagon, three boys (and to more dramatic all three of them are in the band) and two girls. If with a love triangle things can get complicated, imagine with a love pentagon. So from the midle of the anime there starts the frequents fights and reconcialitions between various main characters.After a while things get kind of sorted out and the anime begin to get concentrated on the music again. But almost at the end, when most are expecting a happy ending (with an 'epic' battle between jazz an rock bands in the school festival), the producer changes his mind and decides to make a dramatic event that will change everything. At the end we get a weird, neither happy nor sad ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of the strongest (if not the strongest points) of this anime. Although I'm  not a big fan of jazz music, thanks to this anime I started to get interested. There is a 'epic' moment in the anime, when Nishima and Sentaro performed at the school festival, which reminded me of a legendary scene from Beck (I've got a feeling performance at the festival).\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I  was hoping that the anime would be more concentrated on the music rather than the love events between the main characters. Unfortunately, it wasn't that way and the unnesecary dramatic event at the end ruined almost a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong the anime is great, good characters and even greater music perfomances. But... But it could be even better. It started great but it ended bad :(.\\n\\n\r\nThe final score is 9 and only because I really loved the music. A deserved score would be 8.",

They both have very lovable personality and you just can't stop from falling in love.\r\nStory is realistic and thought through. If you prefer stereotypical characters of shojo and action mangas this plot isn't for you. \r\nArt and sound.\r\nSound is perfect, both voice acting and music. There is a lot of really well done music pieces and no cheezy \"disney-like\" moments. Enjoy prettyawesoem jazz and a bit of rock'n'roll. \\n\r\nArt is done quite well. This anime is in semi-relaistic style, people aren't deformed and you can easily tell one character from another. I really loved design of characters and environment.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nThough there are many very sad moments in \"Kids on slope\", overally this anime leaves you warm and fuzzy inside. I felt like crybaby in the end. \\n\\n\r\nDespite main action happening in school, I'd suggest target audience for this story is older than 20, probably 25+. One needs to have a bit of life experience to fully enjoy the plot. This anime is a must watch for all who like realism and need a little boost to their souls.",

            "content": "I'll start by saying Sakamichi no Apollon wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed every episode to the extent that I couldn't stop - I had to watch the whole thing in one sitting. I feel nothing needs to be changed, and for that I give it a 10. \r\n* * * S T O R Y / C H A R A C T E R S* * *\r\nWell, there isn't much of a plot, per se. They play jazz, but they don't try to form a successful band like in Beck. What you're left with is a story that revolves around the characters and theiremotions. In the end, the main point I got was that they consider friendship truer and more important than love. While I don't agree with that, I think it was fine in this anime. When it comes to love, the characters are confused, moody, and they have no idea what they want. Well, I suppose that's how most teenage love is. Indeed, having true friends is far more valuable than some temporary, whimsical relationship. \\n\r\nThey're pretty moody about their friendships, too, but only because they foolishly seek empty romance and act childish whenever something comes up. You might say it'd be better if they didn't act that way, but hey, they're still young and immature, and that stuff gave this series entertaining twists. As viewers, we tend to insist that \"Boy\" MUST be matched up with \"Girl\", but if the basis of their relationship is weak, should we really care about that? I was fine with how things turned out, though there was sorta one loose end. \\n\r\nThe characters changed throughout the series. I've seen quite a few series that didn't really have any character development; it's good that this series didn't forget about that aspect. Maybe some of their changes weren't for the best, but they were changes, nonetheless. Teens oughtta be going through changes, anyway! It was also good that they changed in that it progressed the story; we could've been sitting here for 24 episodes or more with no conclusion if it was your average indecisive love triangle.\\n\\n\r\n* * * A R T * * *\\n\r\nThe shading is a little blurred, giving it a more realistic look than the usual shading in anime. I thought it looked pretty nice, and it's also nice to see something different once in a while. The opening theme has beautiful artwork. The rest of the series might not be quite that nice, but it's still well done. Overall, the series gave me a different \"feel\" than your average anime. I mean, I'm used to seeing a hill to get to school, a city/town setting, a school setting, a random park that inevitably has some confession scene. Still, Sakamichi no Apollon somehow felt very different. I think it's probably because of how realistic they made everything look with the art, shading, and choice of colours. The characters also had normal looking faces, which is another plus. The animation was also rather smooth in many parts.\\n\\n\r\n* * * S O U N D * * *\\n\r\nIf you like jazz, you'll probably like the music in this. It has some nice pieces in it, some of which I recognized from hearing elsewhere. I think it made it much more enjoyable to see the characters happily jamming their worries away. The lively jazz gave those scenes the impact they aimed to have. \\n\\n\r\nThis series manages to make rock music seem like a shallow and lifeless piece of shit. I'm not sure why they felt the need to take a stab at rock, but also not sure I really care. \\n\\n\r\n* * * E N J O Y M E N T * * *\\n\r\nYou might think of it as yet another high school love triangle mess, but there are some key points that I think made Sakamichi no Apollon much better than the usual. This anime is set in a time before girls wore nothing but miniskirts, a time before girls had pink hair, a time before maid cafes were a necessity in a school festival, a time before 10 girls would be fawning over 1 guy, a time before high-pitched voices. Not only that, but this anime is safe from the greatest plague of all anime - \"anime humour\". You won't see \"anime faces\" like XD and ^o^. You won't see lame attempts at humour that fall flat. \\n\r\nHonestly, I think all anime would be much better if they'd give up on that stuff. We don't need our entertainment watered down by fanservice and the same jokes we've already heard dozens of times. It's hard to find something like this. Even Hellsing, known for its intense violence and gore, is ruined by its occasional weak humour and typical anime content. The Berserk manga's value is also decreased by its \"typical anime humour character\", Puck - it's a miracle the Berserk anime took a serious route and excluded that character. I could go on forever listing anime that's been ruined by comedy/ecchi, such as Chobits. Humour doesn't belong in all anime. I'm glad Sakamichi no Apollon realized this.\\n\\n\r\n* * * O V E R A L L * * *\\n\r\nWell, this is my idea of what anime should be like. Serious anime is more enjoyable than anime that inappropriately tries to inject comedy into the mix. If you're sick of moe, lolicons, harems, ecchi, large-breasted characters, filler arcs to defeat some no name enemy, overkilled jokes, common \"anime faces\" substituting emotions/real expressions... then I think you'll like this.",

I do, this anime is great, it shows how people's lives were back in a golden age where there were a lot of troubles, be it political, emotional or even physical. The story for that matter is great, the way it follows there lives and how honest to truth it is is incredible. The art is amusing in a way that could draw you in, and the sound... well, it is an anime based around music so the sound is incredible. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and highly suggest it!\r\nNow, getting passed my positivethoughts, there are a number of things that really get on my nerves in this anime. *THIS SECTION WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS OF SOME SORT BUT I WILL KEEP IT TO A MINIMUM!* The women in this anime truly grind my gears, the way they are and the way they do things. I do not know if this was the way it was supposed to be because of the time period or whatever, but the two main female characters in which the two main male characters have a crush on really get on my nerves. Firstly, Ritsuko was nice at first, I thought this is a character i could really grow to enjoy, but then a few episodes in it hit me how much of a fragile pathetic character she really was! Misunderstandings, neglecting her own feelings, neglecting others for their feelings just because she can't handle her own. In short... A bitch! \\n\r\nThen there is Yurika, at first, once again, a nice character. A damsel in distress who is saved by the prince, first showing affection, that then moves on to using of sorts. Then, they destroyed her initial image and made her come across as a bitch of the highest magnitude. Understanding someone's feelings for her and yet going after someone else, all while stringing along the initial man. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, this anime is still very enjoyable and I advise it to anyone who is in the mood for a musical anime that will truly dig into your heart, especially if you lived through the time period it was set.",

            "content": "I love jazz, so it's no surprise that I loved Kids on the Slope. I loved it enough to marathon it in one night.\r\nPlaying music makes a fantastic coming of age metaphor. Jazz is particularly apt for this, it's a style that says \"jump in, make something up, it's okay to make mistakes.\" The soundtrack and the fantastic characterization of the two leads (Kaoru and Sentaro) saved this show from being another nerd-meets-rebel cliche.\r\nYet, as much as I enjoyed the show, there are some problems. The first few episodes are difficult to get through because they throw us immediately into the characters' inner struggles beforewe even know or care about these people. This is solved around episode five when there are more external conflicts for them to deal with. To be fair, this is probably a symptom of condensing a longer manga into 12 episodes. The story doesn't have a lot of room to breathe.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama can get overwrought at times. This is particularly bad because in several cases, issues felt resolved to the viewer but never really were on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe romances are convoluted and problematic (at least three scenes verge on sexual assault though, of course, this is never even recognized much less mentioned or addressed). Only one couple seems believable. To the shows credit, this is the only couple we see work out.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest problem with the show is how it treats its girls. Only three girls have names--Sachiko, Sentaro's elementary aged sister; Ritsuko, Sentaro's childhood friend and Kaoru's love interest; and Yurika, Sentaro's (and another character who will not be named because spoilers) love interest.\\n\\n\r\nJust by reading that, it becomes apparent that these girls are only defined by their relationships with the boys around them. While Kaoru and Sentaro and the supporting cast around them--hip jazz trumpeter Jun, the dorky Marou, superstar wanna be Seiji, hell, even \"Pops\", Ritsuko's father, is more interesting than she is--are all rich, human, amazing characters. Ritsuko and Yurika are supposed to become really close friends (and kudos to the show for that because it would have been easy to cast them as catty rivals) but they NEVER once discuss anything but their romantic entanglements. We see the male characters argue about mundane things, get into fights, discuss musicians and records and their love of making music. Ritsuko and Yurika are allowed no such life. They function as plot devices to add more angst, to swoon and to be swooned over, and change this from a \"Beck\" style battle of the bands seinen show to a josei one. Even little Sachiko gets plot deviced.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, let's get to the good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's expressions were so perfectly animated that they could have been on human actors. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the sub was pitch perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting and time period were interesting and beautiful. The story is set in a rural Kyushu, and the contrast between the people there and the new kid, city boy Koaru is perfect. I'm assuming (based on fashion, the fact that the Beatles were just getting popular and the Communist movement was taking off) that it was also set in the early 1960's, which really added a classic, nostalgic feel to the show. Perfect for casting it as memories of youth gone by.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing the show does really well is romanticize youth without calling it the best time of life. We see the characters grow up and they are happy and healthy in their adult lives.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, of course, Yoko Kanno means the soundtrack is amazing. If you have any knowledge of jazz, get why the episode names are all so perfect (hint: it's not just because their all song names), know the lyrics to the melodies played in a few places, or understand why \"Moanin'\" is such a perfect song to be the true theme of the show, then you're in for a real treat.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen criticism of Kids on the Slope for it's convoluted love...shapes. I think it's fair to say the show focuses too much on romance but in the end, the most important part of the show, the most endearing love, isn't a romance. It's the love between Kaoru and Sentaro expressed through music. As deftly expressed in the show, they have a special kind of \"goofy\" friendship that lasts longer than romantic love. It's the realization that the ending theme \"Altair\" is sung by Kaoru to Sentaro. It's what pulls our two boys and Ritsuko back together again at the very end after they've grown so much and so far apart.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, while moving and heart warming, bromances have been the center of stories since ancient Greece. The boys' deep love isn't anything new or subversive.\\n\\n\r\nGive Kids on the Slope a spin if you like things that are cool. Just beware that Ritsuko and Yuriko are unfairly more props than characters.",

I'll try to make this review as quick possible.\r\nStory\" 8/10 \r\nThe anime is about Kawabuchi, Sentarou and Nishimi, Kaoru and their devolopment threwout the episodes of building there friendship and love of jazz music. There is a romance between the two with Mukae, Ritsuko and it's well built mostly between them.\r\nCharacters\" 10/10\r\nI just loved all of them and could not get enough of them especially Kawabuchi, Sentarou. But, Nishimi, Kaoru, really was a true jerk threw out the anime. His character made me upset countlesstimes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\" 10/10\\n\r\nBeautifully animated with a unique style. I loved every episode and each episode was full of life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\" 10/10\\n\r\nNot since Beck have a heard music done so well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\" 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the romance, Jazz and the cry's and fights between these characters. They made me believe life is not easy and there is always struggles throughout.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score\" 10/10\\n\r\nMy review is short but I felt I needed to write a quickie for this anime. I once thought music anime was boring and dull. But not since Beck and now Sakamichi no Apollon have I said I will never underestimate the generation again. If you have a love for music in general you owe it to yourself to watch Sakamichi no Apollon.\\n\\n",
