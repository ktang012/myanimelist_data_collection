            "content": "OK. First off, let me just say that this series was a mess.\r\nI had huge expectations for this sequel since I'm a fan of E7, however, this didn't even come close. What I enjoyed about E7 was the story and character development. I actually felt connected to many of the characters. The story flowed very nicely. I even liked the Nirvash as its own character.\r\nE7AO started off ok while introducing the characters, then it quickly went downhill. The focus was more on the story and fight scenes. I dont think the story was good, but that's where the focus was.\r\nI liked Elena and Fleur andi thought they had great potential. I thought that Fleur would develop feelings for Ao but that never happened. They actually threw in some signs that she had a thing for Gazzele. Elena made a lot of references to other anime. I picked up easily on the Evangelion ones. Both these characters failed to go further and were just part of the cast for a majority of the series until they decided to wrap it up and give them their scene. I felt like it just came out of nowhere. Ao just made me upset. He was a wet blanket. He was boring and indecisive until the end. Truth. Wow. Just wow. I think its always great to have a crazy character somewhere and let them have their 1 second insane facial expression, but Truth had his on more than half the time. It got old and annoying fast. Anemone is 100% a better character. I didn't even understand Naru. Noah was better than her.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mecha designs were well done I think. I wish they gave a little more air time to appreciate them. What was bad was that there were too many special ones thrown in. There were several Nirvashs and it became confusing because of them coming from a different time and all that. I understand that there are two, but it seemed like there were many more. I wonder what the back story was for Truth's Mech. It just appeared.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the story. The basic plot was good, but all the little details they threw in made it a wreck. I didn't even know what was going on half the time. There would be a serious fight going on, then it just switches over to a calm island scene. I didn't like this at all. It sucked the severity and seriousness of the events. They just jumped on the time travel hype, but time travel is really hard to put together. Its an interesting concept, but difficult to make it enjoyable. They would have been more successful if they had kept it more low key with a single goal. The protagonist didn't even know what his own goal was until the last episode. Also, that ending! Seriously, what the fuck? If you've seen it you probably have the same thoughts I have. The main questions, how and why. The series would be better off without it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was good about the series were the animations and music. They were consistent with the first series. The openings and endings were also pretty good. The animations for Ao were a bit lacking about halfway though. It kept changing. It might have been just me.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, E7AO failed to meet my expectations. It may seem my intent was to bash the series but that is wrong. I'm just expressing what made me upset. It had a lot of potential so it makes me sad when it turn out like this. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to keep all of E7 in a good light.",

            "content": "Building on an existing storyline isn't an easy thing to do - especially when the ending of the original tale has a degree of finality to it. That doesn't stop people making the attempt though, and nowhere is this more prominent than in the world of fanfiction. This rather odd realm of amateur (and not-so-amateur), writers is filled with continuations, alternate retellings, character side-stories, non-canon additions, and a host of other works that reflect the fan's passion for the source material. Although they often lack the quality and direction (and sometimes the logic and common sense), of professional pieces, they're generally imaginative yarns that cansometimes lead the reader to new insights about the original work.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are occasions where the story has been created not out of love, but simply because the author feels that they can do better.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO (which stands for Astral Ocean, but is also the name of the lead character), is the sequel to 2005's extremely popular Eureka Seven - and with director Kyoda Tomoki at the helm again and Bones producing both shows, it's easy to see why fans of the original would be excited. Written by Kato Yuichi, the new story focuses on Fukai Ao - a 13 year-old boy living with his grandfather on the island of Iwato Jima in the independent nation of Okinawa. Considered an outcast by the residents who blame the disaster that occurred ten years before on his mother Eureka - who has been missing since that time - his life changes when an accident delivers a strangely familiar bracelet into his hands, which in turn brings him into contact with a mysterious robot called Nirvash.\\n\\n\r\nThe tale begins in relatively familiar territory and progresses at a decent pace for the first few episodes, but as the series continues more things are added to the plot until it grows into a ponderous, shambling behemoth of ideas and concepts that simply don't go anywhere. In addition to this the storyline degenerates into a mediocre monster-of-the-week narrative for a good portion of the show, and elements of the original series have either been left out, crowbarred in, or completely altered - sometimes for no logical reason at all - creating some major continuity issues. The problems are further compounded by the addition of time travel and alternate realities, all of which lead to a rather lukewarm, confusing, and decidedly unsatisfying ending that lacks the catharsis of the original series.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO takes many of its visual cues directly from its parent, and Bones have worked hard to maintain the style while updating the design. That said, there are some odd decisions about clothing (Ao's school uniform resembles a costume used by male strippers),  but some good animation and effects work balances the strange outfits. Much of the aerial combat is fluid, and although there are some minor issues the character movements are handled in a reasonable manner. In addition to this the mechs - which are clearly influenced by the original series - have a definite \"man-made\" feel that highlights the creator's desire for Eureka Seven AO to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe show features two opening sequences that serve as bland-yet-functional introductions to the story thanks to the use of the check-box approach (protagonist running, birds flying, people looking pensive/cheerful/heroic/constipated, [insert cool action sequence], [insert suggestive minor spoiler that may have no connection to the plot at all], rinse, repeat, end with cool and/or spicy action still featuring the protagonist (and his love interest - male or female, species is optional), adverts, etc). The first closing sequence is equally unimaginative (and ticks all the boxes), but the second is something of a departure as it adopts a \"pop-art\" style and relies on still images to suggest that Ao's playtime is over.\\n\\n\r\n\"Escape\" by Hemenway (the first opening track), is the type of bland rock song that seems to grace every major shounen title at least once, but FLOW's \"Bravelue\" manages to capture  at least some of the magic of \"Days\" - the opening theme from Eureka Seven. \"Stand By Me\" by the oddly named Steropony is a rather dull, brooding affair that doesn't really fit with the formulaic closing sequence, while Joy's \"Lolite\" is a poppy little number that works surprisingly well with the associated imagery.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to overall audio quality, and the uninspiring opening and closing themes are reflective of the music throughout the show. The predominantly well-chosen background tracks often work within the context of a given scene, but there are far too many attempts at enhancing a humourous moment using a comedic tune, and many of these attempts fall short of the mark. In addition to this the diverse array of effects can be let down by a lack of care with choreography or poor production quality, and the issues are further compounded by a script that is sorely lacking in emotional intensity. With little to work with the Japanese cast are unable to showcase their talents effectively - resulting in performances that vary wildly as the voice actors struggle to breathe some semblance of life into their roles. Unfortunately things don't get any better with the English dub as, true to form, the approach is literal and the scope is limited.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be pointed out is the continuous inability of the Western license holders to find people with accents to play particular roles, and it's painful to hear Sainty Reid as 16 year-old French pilot Fleur Blanc - especially when she macerates her way through terms like \"maman\" - the colloquial form of \"m\u00e8re\" (mother). It's unfortunate that her first serious role is one that really needed a specific vocal style, and the truly sad part is that in an era where talented people can be found under every rock, viewers are still being subjected to the idea that everyone in the world speaks English (with an American accent), as their native language.\\n\\n\r\nThe wastelands of anime are littered with the shades of forgettable characters, and the numerous problems with the storyline and script deal what could only be called a killing blow to Eureka Seven AO. The foundation of good characters lies in the logical development of the plot together with an organic approach to dialogue - both of which require time, patience, an understanding of relationships, and a healthy dose of criticism. The original series featured some good character dynamics that added personality to each role, making Renton, Eureka, and several others believable to a degree - but more importantly they became interesting and likeable. Unfortunately logic appears to have gone out of the window with this \"sequel\" - resulting in a set of bland \"people\" with few saving graces.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to treat Ao in a manner similar to Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion has backfired, and although some attempts have been made to save him from the pit of obscurity, he stands at the head of a queue of unlikable, uninteresting, and excruciatingly dull characters - all of whom shove him steadily towards the precipice. Truth initially serves as a decent antagonist, but his development is sorely lacking as he is quickly relegated from that role - becoming little more than a force of nature whose actions serve no purpose whatsoever. As for Naru, her status as Ao's love interest quickly loses all meaning once the plot shifts into monster-of-the-week mode, and like Truth her purpose in the story is ultimately rendered irrelevant. That said, there are some intriguing interactions between the supporting characters, but the approach to relationships is surprisingly lacking in emotional depth - becoming little more than background noises that are eventually swallowed by the confusing plot.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is a strange, lumbering beast that struggles to maintain its balance before the weight of its collective flaws sends it careening into the realms of logical fallacy, but the odd thing is that nobody appears to have noticed any of the obvious problems during the planning, production, or ADR stages of the show - which raises quite a few questions. Kato Yuichi's confusing, poorly written storyline has a mechanical feel that lacks emotion or passion for the original series, and in truth has more in common with amateur fanfiction written by someone whose ideas, imagination, and belief that they can do better are greater than their talent. The shoddy dialogue makes it difficult to like or believe in the characters, and fans of the original series may find this addition to the franchise painful to watch. That said, the show does feature some rather nice action sequences that can distract the audience from the mundanity, and there are some interesting aspects of the story that really should have been more prominent. If all the viewer wants is something to pass the time then Eureka Seven AO isn't the worst show available, and if it isn't examined too closely then the show may attract its own fan base.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to make a \"sequel\" to a successful show is understandable (anime is a business after all), but Eureka Seven AO highlights some issues that lie at the heart of the industry - in particular the lack of understanding about what the wider audience wants and a serious need for quality control at all levels. The simple fact is that the series has broken under the weight of too many unnecessary straws, and aside from the visuals the show lacks the finesse and polish that one would expect from a mainstream title.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven was one of my most favorite mecha-animes of all time, but I was very disappointed in Astral Ocean. Here are the reasons why,\r\nEureka Seven AO focuses too much on the action. In the previous series, there was drama and love. I know most of you will think to yourself \"mecha animes aren't suppose to have any drama or love, just action\" but the drama in Eureka Seven was what made the series. It made you love the two main characters, Renton and Eureka. But in Astral Ocean, you don't have the same connection with Ao.\r\nThe story of the show is still strong, it'svery mysterious. There are new entities called Secrets attacking the unnatural beings known as Scub Corals. There is a man named \"Truth\" who is trying to reveal the truth to the world (sorry if that sounded repetitive) and he is the shows main antagonist. There is Naru who was Ao's best friend who decided to go total whack on Ao one day and follow the main bad guy. And there is the mystery behind of \"what happened to Eureka and Renton?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is still beautiful like the original show, I love the action scenes and the mecha drawings, it's pure epic. The sound is crystal clear, the openings and endings are amazing, (OP 2- Very Nostalgic to Eureka Sevens original opening), and overall I give the animation and sound effects a ten. \\n\\n\r\nHere is where I get a bit pissy. The characters seem very bland compared to the characters in the original series. Renton from the original series was a crybaby, he was a crybaby but we got to know his character so well that we felt like we actually knew him. He was very true to himself, and he loved Eureka dearly. He cared for others and put his life on the line at certain times. The rest of the crew- members in the Gekkostate (Gekkostate is their flying ship) all had their own unique looks and traits that made us love them. Holland (the captain) was a bit of a jerk but nonetheless I loved him as a character of the show. \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters in Astral Ocean is a different story. Eureka Seven had humor and the characters were fun to watch and listen to. But in Astral Ocean, many of the characters seem way too serious and it feels like you can grab several characters and just meld them into one person- that's how boring they are. A lot of characters feel the same to me and I just don't connect with them.\\n\r\nEven Holland (from the Original series) was such an ass to Renton that I actually hated Holland. To actually hate someone that doesn't even exist, means that they're a good and true character. \\n\\n\r\nHere's how bad the characters are in Astral Ocean- I won't be sad if Ao dies. I'm serious. He's the main character but he's so boring like the rest, that I don't feel like I'll be very sad if he died. However, if Renton died, I would be extremely sad and I'll hate the show for killing him, (thank God he didn't die) but if Ao dies, I'll just say \"meh the show could still possibly go on without him\" (and a lot other characters besides).\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm still putting up with this show is because I can't wait to see Renton and Eureka reunite. But Ao? Whatever. He can do whatever he wants to, because he's as boring as the shows pet. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show would be around a 6 when my overall enjoyment from the predecessor would be a 9. \\n\r\nOverall the show gets a 7 because the art and action saves it from dropping below a 5. \\n\\n\r\nWatch Eureka Seven then watch Astral Ocean. You'll see a depressing drop and you'll wonder, what in the hell happened?\\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven AO serves as a sequel to the fantastic Eureka Seven of a few years ago. however to call it a sequel is akin to calling a doughnut a loaf bread, it shares many of the same base elements, is similar on a surface and level but make for totally different products in the end. one of which has a giant hole in the middle.\r\nThe hole in this context is the story, or rather the lack of it. The series mulls around being a monster of the week show for the majority of it's run all the while attempting to raise mysteries and intriguearound a few side plots that aren't really addressed till later. the problem however lies in when it actually does address those plots, it's painfully rushed, borderline incomprehensible at times and leaves the impression that writers didn't have an ending in mind and just sort of winged it for the last stretch of episodes, culminating in a bizarre mess of a plot which feels like it was over too fast and drawn out at the same time. \\n\r\nthe entire ordeal feels like a directionless mess. which spends so much time trying to make it seem like it's doing SOMETHING that it eventually becomes clear it's not really doing ANYTHING. introducing just a many plot points as it seemingly drops, it has a schizophrenic whiplash of a pace which never seems to settle in on what it wants to do enough to do any of it effectively. \\n\r\nas far as the plot goes, it's a disappointment to prior fans of the franchise due to it's handling of what few legacy elements it embraces but at the same time relies fairly heavily on you knowing/liking the previous series to fully understand it, which leaves new fans in the cold too.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may be a broken mess, the animation and art design are actually very good. the show has some really impressive visuals at times and upholds to bones usual high standard of quality. backgrounds are often colourful and detailed and it features some of the nicest looking explosions I've seen in a long time. \\n\r\nThe primary character designs were handled by Kenichi Yoshida, who was the character designer for the first series, which lends a nice bit of visual familiarity to the series and helps tie it to the original series.\\n\r\nmecha design is sadly a low point, the original series had shoji kawamori, a veritable god among mecha designers, and this series... doesn't. the mechs don't look bad on their own, but they lack the distinct visual punch the original had, only made worse by it's comparing the two styles.\\n\r\nand finally you have the G-monsters or secrets, the primary antagonists of the series. which are essentially monsters made of polygonal shapes. their appeal seems to be a matter of taste, they are simplistic enough to resonate with some, but bland enough to be forgettable to others. personally i found them to be an interesting concept that turned out to be unmemorable due to their execution, another failing of the story and it's lack of direction.\\n\r\nIt's visuals are certainly one of it's strongest point and it rarely looks cheap, but some of the mecha/antagonist designs can feel sub-par which really takes away from some fairly well done action.\\n\\n\r\nthe music is the only point i have absolutely no problems with. the score is handled by Koji Nakamura (of supercar, lama and ILL) and is a audible treat, i often found myself rewatching parts of episodes just to hear the songs going on in the background. it ranges nicely from slice of life calmness to intense mecha action perfectly and compliments those scenes fantastically as it goes. the few insert songs are also great, though musical taste may be a factor in your enjoyment of them. \\n\r\nthe music never failed to get me into the series moods and managed to accomplish the rare feat of both fitting the scenes subtly and without overstating itself but also being good enough for me to end up humming it long after watching episodes. of all it's traits, the soundtrack is the thing i've most taken away from AO and i personally am more likely to just listen to the soundtrack than rewatch the show.\\n\\n\r\noverall the series is a real mixed bag, on the surface level it's great. it's pretty and sounds great with a seeming return to a fantastic world. but as is often the case things are not quite what they seem. it's ties to the original series are tenuous and confusing, it's own plot is underdeveloped and meandering and the whole experience ends up feeling a bit hollow. it's fantastic presentation does a lot to carry it, but in the end the the story is weak and it's art isn't good enough to watch just for it.\\n\r\nIt's a case where the show is primarily bad, the most important thing (the story) is lacking and often confusing, but there is just enough good to balance it out. it ends up being a completely middle of the road show despite all it's qualities being at extremes. they just happen to cancel each other out into this weird show.\\n\r\nPersonally it left me with an odd impression.  I don't regret watching it, but i feel like i probably should and can't. which is really strange. much like this show.",

            "content": "Ah, Eureka Seven AO, how I was so excited to watch you before you aired. Now here I am facepalming all over the place at how bad this show is, and how I was foolish to be excited for this.\r\nLet me start out by saying, the original Eureka Seven is one of my all-time favorite anime series, and it's just sad for me to see what BONES did. They are merely marketing a show purely based off of nostalgia, and putting zero effort into it, less so than those incomplete adaptions used to sell more of the source material.\r\nSo first off, what is this showall about? Well originally it was about Ao, Eureka's son as you probably could have guessed from the promo image, joining a group called Pied Piper-actually, just a subsection of Generation Blue-(The E7 AO equivalent of the Gekkostate, not.), and trying to find his mom (Who he calls \"Anma!\"-Where did this shit come from?). From there, it's total nonsense, especially in the second half. Seriously, I doubt even BONES knows what they're writing in this show. Hell, it's even hard to review this show because it's so messy. So where did it all go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nPart of the problem is how Eureka Seven had a completely closed ending, with no loose ends. So, what the heck were they supposed to do for a story, a sequel story? Set it up in our world, instead of the world of the original E7? Introduce an overpowered villain with no motives, and then come up with something along the way? Put in terminology the viewer is completely unfamiliar with, and explain it midway when all the characters knew everything from the start, and assumed the viewers were the same? Put random things in, and forget about them completely in only a few episodes, making it completely redundant? How about just put in random crap to fill up 24 episodes? Really, these are warning signs the show is going to be a total mess.\\n\\n\r\nThere are tons of plot holes everywhere (Especially in the final two episodes which are just one large Deus Ex Machina), and lots of things will not make sense as such. In one instance, it's stated everywhere the Secrets are not the enemy as they merely take an element called Quartz away from the Scub Corals. But then later, Generation Bleu tries to eliminate all the Secrets. Oh and let's not forget how you can travel around the world in only an hour, it doesn't matter where. Seems the earth is way smaller than it really is...\\n\\n\r\nHow about the characters? Did the characters turn out good? Hardly, the show makes some of the same mistakes Shakugan no Shana III (Final) made. It introduces a bunch of characters, and then doesn't bother to develop them, or show any backstory, so they're just...there. Many characters will develop in some way, but it'll either make no sense, or it'll be a total character rewrite. We'll also get some good backstory, but the show then tosses it aside and forgets about it. The backstory rarely ends up being relevant to the story.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, can we forget how they introduced certain elements you never in a million years wanted in E7? An otaku girl? Moe girls everywhere, resulting in a harem practically? Fanservice? And what purpose does this serve? Really, what does it serve for a good story? In this show, it can't co-exist with the story, and character development like does in various shows.\\n\\n\r\nNow the production values, believe it or not, despite being newer, E7 AO visually looks worse than its predecessor, and the animation can be rather messy. The soundtrack, same thing. Not all that much to it.\\n\\n\r\nReally, they should have either made this not a sequel, or took a page from Gonzo from when they made Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam, the sequel to Last Exile which also had a completely closed ending. That show managed to do a much better job at things, from the story, to the characters. It did not rely on purely nostalgia to tell a story, and the result wasn't all that bad.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO in the end is a prime example of doing everything wrong in a show, and what happens when a studio uses only nostalgia to tell a story. Take the E7 fanboy glasses off, and you'll immediately notice the many, many problems. One can only hope less of these kinds of shows get made in the future. Nostalgia can be great, but not when you use it to tell a story for a show.",

            "content": "It may be early days yet, but the refreshed and reinvigorated Eureka Seven franchise holds great promise.  Earmarked as it's spiritual sequel, Eureka 7 AO appears to not only match its predecessor in beauty and story, but does create firm groundwork to better it.\r\nStory\r\nBy the end of the first episode, I was hooked.  The whole progression is well-built, where E7-AO dips its toes pretty evenly between character dialogue and fast-paced action scenes.  Just when you think the action has outstripped its relevance, the plot yanks you back, to cover any gaps you may have missed.  This to and fro between actionand deep & moving storytelling creates means each is that much more compelling, as it is contrasted with one another.  Episode four typifies this, where one half is pure mind-melting action, and the other half delving into the deeper mysteries of Ao and his mother. \\n\\n\r\nMore interestingly, the story feels darker than the original E7.  This comes out in the open depictions of violence by the \"G-Monsters\" to the open yet diverse political opinion voiced between the main characters.  Yes, politics and divided issues do form a subtle undertone here.  Themes such as racism, nationalism, political identity and independence, and even government corruption are bandied about from character to character.  Pippo's snide reply to Giselle's remark that the Nirvash being part French, US and theirs springs to mind (\"it\u2019s fat, wants to surrender and has bad teeth\").  \\n\\n\r\nIt reminds me A LOT of X'amd in a way, which also grappled with these issues, and as such, really makes the story feel real and visceral.  More importantly, it feels like the story has aged with the viewer.  Whereas E7 placed the viewer squarely in the sheltered and naive hands of Renton; here in AO, Bones does away with the protection and says: \"Here's the real world - its not a fluffy fantasy - it's real, gritty and desperate.\"  Nothing evokes better emotional responses than that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nPlease.  It's Bones we're talking about here.  There should be no question over this stuff.  The artwork is BEAUTIFUL (as usual) and the voice-acting is top notch.  More interestingly, the music really sounds like an improvement on E7, which did feel a tad repetitive.  Here the music, especially the track concluding episode one, is swelling and moving.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Ao as the protagonist is distinctly different from his previous counterpart (Renton).  Renton in E7, was grossly naive for much of the early episodes, and his mood fluctuated wildly, often transpiring into tears or bouts of frustration/anger.  Pretty understandable for his age BUT it did get on my nerves a little (probably doesn't bode well for when I have kids).  Ao on the other hand, appears to be far more assured and assertive.  He rarely contemplates/broods over issues, and rather jumps quickly to proactive action (Renton, to be fair, did this at times).  For this reason, I prefer Ao, owing to his more assertive nature.  Sure, there are times he is shocked or saddened, but several times, he shows this tough resilient attitude, such as the end of episode one.  At other times, he acts entrenched and guarded of his secrets, such as his first interactions with Flair Blanc.  Finally, Ao just seems to be less naive to Renton.\\n\\n\r\nThis is really the same for all the main characters in general.  Naru, the vulnerable romantic interest, Elena and Fleur combining to make tenacious yet comical Generation Bleu team to the rough and rebellious Giselle and his crew (much like Holland and his).  By the end of the four episode, each of these characters (and more) are memorable and provide their own watermark on the story.  This most of all shows fantastic storytelling and writing, that it has only taken FOUR EPISODES, to flesh out stories, that take some animes triple the time to get to.  \\n\\n\r\nOH - and how could I forget NOAH.  Easily the best pet-sloth-thingy ever. It's like Bones stole the \"cuteness\" potion from the Powderpuff Dolls and smeared it all over the one animal.  Awesomesauce.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOne analogy springs to mind when summing up E7:AO so far.  One of my best mates produces electronic music, which is a time-consuming and hair-tearing process.  By the end of writing and recording the track, the track must undergo \"mastering.\"  What mastering does, is basically it crams as much synth, bass, treble, percussion and general loudness into the smallest capacity.  This process is often rife with error, and as such, the perfect final sound is hard to come by, yet sought endlessly by my friend.  \\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is really beginning to feel like that perfect mastering.  To bring back to the topic at hand, it just feels like the writers have managed to craft episode after episode crammed with great storytelling - such that by the time the 22min (or so) disappears, you feel like you've watched an hour of story in 5 minutes.  Every second is utilised.  No unnecessary fat here.\\n\\n\r\nE7:AO has set high expectations from its great opening episodes.  As such, many commentators preach that like most anime, there will come the inevitable dip, when the studio needs to pad out the script.  However, judging from the past episodes, I feel quietly confident that AO is quite safe in the mastered hands of Bones.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Episode 12 and on.\\n\\n\r\nWOW.  Just wow.  M Night Shamalamalamalyan (maybe incorrect spelling :P) would be envious of this well performed twist.  Without divulging spoilers, episode 12 represents a significant shift in the plot surrounding E7:AO, and direct links between E7 and E7:AO are beginning to show clarity, like peering through a clearing fog.\\n\\n\r\nUp to this point, the plot feels like it has taken 3 sharp \"chapters\".  Episodes 1-4 really introduce us to Ao and the main characters, as well as the greater world of E7:AO.  Episodes 5-10 then slow down the pace, and allow in-depth character development to proceed, of supporting characters.  Then from episode 11, the series begins to pick up pace again, whereby many questions and answers are raised, as the worlds of E7 and E7:AO begin to collide.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the three parts, probably 5-10 is the weakest.  I still enjoyed them, but the view between E7 fans, voyeurs and the general mishmash of commentators appeared to hold a mixed, if not, negative reaction.  In a way, I do share their criticisms.  These episodes were very formulaic, whereby each episode could be summarised as the following:\\n\\n\r\nSupporting character problem\\n\r\nProtagonist tags along\\n\r\nMonster of the week appears\\n\r\nMonster of the week is destroyed + supporting character overcomes issue\\n\r\nPudding is had by all\\n\\n\r\nIn hindsight (eg. after seeing episode 12+), I can see why BONES had to approach the supporting characters with such detail, as the characters of Ao, Naru, Truth, Elena, Fleur and Ivica become incredibly central (I predict) to the quickly changing plot.  But, I also think that despite the product being good, BONES could of thought of perhaps a more complex path to get there.  To be fair, I am nitpicking, so as to not come across as completely biased :P\\n\\n\r\nTo cut to the chase: if you are an E7 fan but are unsure whether to proceed through the series, perhaps due to getting restless during eps 5-10 or due to the somewhat negative fans, my recommendation is to persist at least till episode 12.  I can at least predict that if you watch it no further, you will still get a kick out of a certain blue-haired individual making their fashionably-late entrance ;)\\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven: OW...er, AO\r\nOuch! That's is all.\r\n...okay, that wouldn't make for much of a review, but really, the best way I can put this series was it was painful to watch. I remember seeing the original series in both English and Japanese and loved both. One of the few English dubs that I didn't despise that much. I really hope this doesn't get localized so it can slap the faces of any other Eureka Seven fans that don't watch subbed anime.\r\nOkay, enough venting and more reviewing. The problem with this series was the story and character development...and boy, was it bad. Bones had a prettystrong reputation before this series but I get the impression it's going to take a major hit. The writers tried to create an innovative plot that took Eureka Seven character archetypes, put them in a time travel/dimensional travel plot, and see what happens. It's almost as if Bones took a look at Steins;Gate and said \"see how successful this was?! We need to do that!\" Problem is, Steins;Gate created a full cast of likable characters and didn't make the plot any deeper than it had to be. This? It was confusing from start to finish. It's one thing to slowly pace out plot development out of suspense, it's a complete other thing to slowly pace out plot development and then not have a proper payoff.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made the original series so great was the character development. There was a cast that was well hashed out, well developed, and most importantly, the characters were actually likable and memorable. Astral Ocean failed in that department. It had some unique characters that could've filled that role. I felt as though Elena and Fleur were probably the best characters outside of Ao in this series when it comes to likability. However, even they were not hashed out as well as they should've been and in moments where the dramatic tension should've been high, it wasn't. Simply put, I react well to animes that can convince me that there's dramatic tension between the characters and how they respond to each other. I wasn't sold on any of their dramatic tension. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the WORST part of Eureka Seven: Ao though was the ending. Since I'm not allowed to \"spoil\" it, I'll just come out and say...it was pointless...and I mean that literally. The ending deemed the entire Eureka Seven: Ao storyline essentially pointless. On top of that, it COMPLETELY hung Ao, the series lead character, out to dry. I found it to be an absolute TERRIBLE approach. It's one thing to have a tragic ending that has an affect on the main cast of characters. This anime didn't have that. It had a tragic ending that effectively left zero impact on the main cast of characters. Buzz kill is really the best way to describe the ending.\\n\\n\r\nI know I said a lot of bad things about E7: Astral Ocean so far, but are there any good things? Yeah, there are. The artwork was pretty consistent with the original series and I'd even say slightly better. Although, I do think they went a little overboard with Truth's facial expressions. The music on the whole was pretty good. I also found myself REALLY enjoying the 2nd OP BlazBlue by FLOW. The OP set up the feel that the anime would have an epic 2nd half...so good advertising on Bones part...just poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the bad outweighs the good. I can say that for the most part, I did enjoy the series but like many series before it, poor writing and an absolute \"worst possible ending\" just ruined the series for me. The writers tried to do way too much with the plot and not enough with the character development. In an attempt to be innovative, the writers instead created a confusing, heaping mess that even by the time everything was cleared up and explained, it left me unsatisfied. For a sequel to a great series like Eureka Seven, Astral Ocean failed to meet expectations...and then some.",

The artwork is new and definitely fresh and at moments has some almost 3D aspects but it still has the Eureka 7 feel to it. The manga and the anime have a few different ambiguities that are slight. I have yet to identify the sound tracks that will be used or were used in the first episode, but hopefully they are correlated just as well as Sato Naoki's from the first series where you could literally hear the emotion in his music. Character development is good for thefirst episode... I mean many things have been left for later to be summed up such as Eureka being Ao's mom and where Renton was when all of Ao's childhood and such. Surely to be covered as the anime progresses. Story is a little undefined as to what G-monsters are as well as FP's and other acronyms that aren't drawn out...yet.\\n\\n\r\nSurely this will be a great anime.

This review will tell you what to expect from E7: AO so you can be spared the headaches if you don't want to watch it. I won't be doing the generic reviews of the usual elements since many others have covered them.\r\nFirst, don't expect that the original series is paralleled here in AO. It's a completely different story with elements from the previous series, the only links being Renton, Eureka, Nirvash, and the Gekko.\r\nSecond, if you don't like to think hard on an anime, then don't watchthis. Spare yourself from a lot of hair pulling.\\n\\n\r\nThird, this is a BONES anime. This means that the plot doesn't usually make sense until the end or near the end.\\n\\n\r\nFourth, if you're looking for action and lasers with good old mecha fighting, then don't watch this. Go and watch Gurren Lagann instead.\\n\\n\r\nFifth, if you're expecting romance like the original series, don't expect anything from this unless you're only watching for the Renton and Eureka one (which you'll have to wait for for a long, loooooong time).\\n\\n\r\nSixth, be prepared for a reversal of roles. Not everything you think is correct, IS RIGHT. It's like thinking for the longest time that 1+1 = 2, when the real truth is actually 1+1= 345934578934759.\\n\\n\r\nSeventh, don't expect the typical plot build up. If you know about Romeo and Juliet and have read the book/watched the play, then you know what I mean. This is like Romeo and Juliet, without the romance.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, if you care about background characters then don't watch this. Let me tell you right now, this is a story filled with resets and restarts. Stories like that don't usually bid well for people who want closure on everything.\\n\\n\r\nPeople go hard on this anime because they didn't get what they expect. Let me tell you now, if you want to watch this, wipe all your biases and expectations. I learned it by Episode 13, and I say that's not too late a time.\\n\\n\r\nE7 AO is a sequel made to close everything. It closes the scene on E7 POP and AO together. It's the curtain call for both series. If you like it, good for you, you understood it. If you don't like it, then too bad, go watch an anime with a proven formula for a plotline.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, thanks for reading.",

            "content": "This proved quite disappointing considering how much I enjoyed the original Eureka Seven series, though I'm not completely condemning it to hellfire and brimstone as many folks presently are as there have been worst messes I've seen in anime. Eureka 7 AO gave us the promise of Eureka's son, Ao, trying to discover his mother's whereabouts by trudging through some complicated conflicts between military factions and Generation Bleu. While this idea showed its potential for much of the first half of the series, while also digging into the complicated issues surrounding affairs between the mentioned factions and monster threats, later episodes get increasingly messy withthe title's writing and its exploration of characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet us first talk about the choices of writing for AO. The original series had a clear direction for what it wished to accomplish with Gecko State's motives, revealing Eureka's origins, some pretty shocking secrets surrounding the origins of the world and Dewey Novak's manipulations to bring forth his own twisted plans. For AO though, the series starts getting messy towards the middle of the show when we come to learn of Eureka's whereabouts as it introduces a convoluted plot device, that I won't spoil here, that makes things rather hard to follow with what exactly is happening to her and how this element to the plot affects things for later events in the series. The series also gets in the rather obnoxious habit of creating twists in the direction of the plot that you would assume would be relevant for later events of the show or unveiling details on characters yet in many cases, these twists aren't quite as relevant and were mostly there to swerve the audience. The final two episodes that were hyped up to just recently were noticeably more fast paced than earlier episodes of AO as a major character from the first season of the series finally made his appearance and the resolution to the series will have one questioning what the entire point of it even was with how mean-spirited and contradicting AO was from how it presented itself in the earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was another issue effecting AO. Relevant characters in the original series got a good amount of fleshing out with their personalities and backgrounds so the audience would learn to care for the issues faced by them throughout the series and see how they eventually grow throughout the series. Even among the supporting characters, the first series still gave them enough personality where they were entertaining to see in serious and light-hearted moments. In AO though, many characters who were relevant in the major events of the series get limited development and don't have much in the way of personality, limiting any kind of connection one could get from them. Those characters who do get reasonable fleshing out are still limited in their development and growth thanks to the mentioned messy writing. Any chemistry between characters that would have one think there is a significant bond between them, like friendship, family or love, or there is development of one is snuffed aside for the most part thanks to larger focus being on the advancement of AO's plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that AO seemed to genuinely land right were the visuals. Eureka 7 AO retains the same animation style used from the first season of the series while having a more vivid color palette and smoother details. The fluid and intense mecha fights are also retained here as well and make for some of the best animated moments I've seen from a TV anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eureka 7 AO made for one of the year's biggest disappointments for me in terms of expectations. While I was expecting a title that would retain the spirit of the original Eureka 7 in exploring Ao's search for his mother from its earlier episodes, AO became quite a mess in terms of writing and characterization in later episodes as it had trouble deciding on a proper direction to follow with its elements compared to the original series. Diehard Eureka 7 fans may want to avoid AO lest they want to fume fan-rage over what they will inevitably see.",

            "content": "Oh god Bones. How can you do this to me? \r\nHonestly, it wouldn't have been an awful anime standing on it's own. But you had to attach it to Eureka 7, to which I have so many fond memories and emotions attached!\r\nMy first complaint with this anime is.. The waste of time. The key points of this episode could have been done in 12 episodes. There were no real filler episodes either!\r\nWhy 12? Well, at least half the content was just boring: Go here, kill these guys. Minor character development. Nothing really happens.\r\nMy next complaint is.. the characters. The super powers, they didn't make sensein this universe. To some extent, Naru fit in great. However, Truth was just the personification of every awful villain of any anime. Even when you get his full story. He just sort of.. is horrible. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing about the characters.. Is the lack of development. Even on the main characters. We saw more development from Moon Doggy in E7 than we did from Ao in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThird complaint. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't make sense. I hate time travel. Hate it! With a passion, and this took confusing time travel and made it more confusing. They never answer a few questions which arise like \"Were the scubs actually time traveling, or were they going to another universe in which an earlier time period of earth was occuring?\" We don't have the insightful mind of a character like Dr. Bear to elaborate to the viewers what the staff knows. \\n\\n\r\nTo that end on the story. It kind of ruins the original series. I don't think I've been this dismayed at  a series end since Mass Effect 3. \\n\\n\r\nWhile creating a clone of the original is  fruitless endeavor, making the sequel more similar than distant to the original story should have taken a  precedent. When it didn't apparently. There were so many avenues to be followed upon with the original anime but instead they offer this short series which honestly should have been way shorter. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really missed were those scenes where you felt in touch with the character. I remember literally crying during Anemone's lamenting, and the tears of joy that followed when Eureka and Renton helped her see past the life she was locked in to. \\n\\n\r\nGranted the end of Eureka 7 PoP was a little bit trippy for me, it was still amazing compared to what we got from Astral Ocean. \\n\\n\r\nGoddamn how Bones has fallen.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, first of all let me just say that when I first saw the original Eureka 7 I actually had a hard time getting into it. so much so to the point where I put it on hiatus for a while. Now usually when I do that I rarely go back to finish watching it but E7 was different. I found myself checking it out once more and loving it! I'll tell you why I was so compelled to watch that anime again despite initially not liking it very much....the characters and character development was great! Even for characters I did not like such asDewy and Holland. I still was able to understand where they were coming from. Talho was a flawed character as well but she had a personality and was likable. Renton, I thought he was the typical mech anime boy until he opened up and revealed his true and honest feelings toward eureka, his family life, and his future. I was glad that none of the characters were up in Renton's buttcrack like most of anime characters tend to be toward the main character, they just liked him. Eureka, once again I thought she was the typical expressionless anime girl but she surprised me and revealed to be a girl who suffered a lot and truly wish to set everything right. Her, Renton, the kids, and the members of the Gekko State were unique and enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBut don't expect that from E7:AO\\n\\n\r\nNow when I finished watching E7 and heard there was a second part I was so happy I immediately began watching it. We're introduced to Ao who is Renton and Eureka's son and I'm thinking great start! But soon you learn that Eureka and Renton are nowhere in sight and he is in fact in another world on another timeline. Apparently Eureka and Renton get separated and Eureka came to their world and had her kid and went back blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, don't expect to find decent character development here. The characters are ALL typical mech anime characters. First we have typical mech anime boy Ao who gets recruited to join \"Generation Blue\" a military like organization that uses children to fly IFOs because for some odd reason only children can fly IFOs *eye roll*\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are one dimensional including Ao. He's the typical mech anime boy that all the characters instantly love even when they say they don't. He comes complete with a \"funny\" pet, and a love interest whom he feels he must fight to protect.  Of course there is a chief of the child pilots who love them all like they were his own children. And the story does take a five minute break every five episodes so we can see the characters be \"quirky\". But is this character development? No! These characters are so bland they could really all be just one person and you would never notice. These characters lack everything that made the members of the Gekko State fun and interesting to watch. The members of the Gekko state had lives, the members of Generation Blue needed to get a life. There is really nothing to them but never ending mech battles. Gone are the priceless moments such as the Gekko team tricking Renton into thinking a bowl of Ramen was a deadly mission. Instead with AO you get some banter about whether or not Ao can swim. Gone are deep characters like Charles and Ray and instead you get....nothing! None of these characters are remember-able! \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of AO simply sucks! the creators try to be deep with the whole mysteriousness of it but it's really just a ploy to keep people watching cause they really have NO PLOT!\\n\\n\r\nThey try to do this whole time travel deal but it's a mess.\\n\\n\r\nNow I don't mind time travel stories being a little messy but this was just a hot mess and it seems as though the creators are just pulling plots out their rear to compensate for the lack of character. For example; When Eureka arrives again in that world on board a ruined Gekko State she is pregnant and just before Ao helps her go back she says she's having a girl not a boy which leads Ao to question the whereabouts of a mysterious older sister. There is never much of a explanation as to how Eureka is constantly traveling to that particular world while pregnant and she never even seems to remember anything. The anime also tries to remain interesting by not explaining anything and coming up with stupid names that are supposed to make you question what is going on. Such as \"The Secrets\" \"The truth\" *eye roll*\\n\\n\r\nYes the main villain's name is Truth and apparently he's Ao's girlfriend's (Haru) Nirvash although he's not in mech form. Anyway he's called a \"Secret\" which at first are the main bad guys of the show. Sigh. So this regular girl gets her own Nirvash simply because she was accidentally exposed to scub corals? Then she spends her time riding on the real Nirvash  for some reason. Blah blah. And of course Ao wants to save her blah blah. The creators for some reason thought it made sense to take away everything that made Eureka and Renton and subsequently Ao, so special and just pass them to the other bland characters like hot cakes. Anyway, the story sucks, the characters suck, and the music sucks. I tried to watch as much as I could just to see Renton and Eureka and so far all I saw was Eureka and the show picked up somewhat but she left and it was back downhill again.",

            "content": "I don't exactly have much time to write a full review as the previous people did. But I wanted to get this down since I just recently finished watching Eureka Seven AO. Probably won't bother doing much editing either. So here goes my review of Eureka Seven: Astral Ocean.\r\nI will start this off by saying up-front I am a huge fan of the first Eureka Seven. It is by-far my number one favorite anime next to Steins;gate, NHK, and a few others. Tbh, I did have some pretty high expectations for the sequel. Based on how well Bones did with the first series. I reallywanted / hoped the next one to be just as good if not better. And i figured with the way things ended with the last one they were free to do whatever they pleased and it should be fine. Right?\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, in the beginning of AO I liked how everything was going. Bones has a way of leaving you with questions and building curiosity and suspense. After about maybe not even mid way through the season I got bored of it. Like, okay I liked where it was going but from the early-mid to end the plot practically stays the same. It's just flat out boring. Cool actions scenes, if you're into that kind of stuff. But not much worth watching if you're looking for a good story and some character development.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of development, AO had absolutely NONE (if any) character development. In Eureka Seven you got to see Renton grow from this clumsy silly little kid to this sort of heroic figure. And throughout the show you really get to connect with the cast. They were so likeable. Not only that you got to see what kind of challenges Renton faced as a young boy growing up. Not to mention the added love story which pretty much completed it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really want to delve into the soundtrack a whole lot but MY GOD they are seriously lacking in the OST department for AO. How do you go from an awesomely ridiculous soundtrack to like, half-assing the new OST?\\n\\n\r\nIt's as though Bones just said, \"okay let's see how bad we can screw up and see if any of the fans will notice.\" I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that there was a lot that should've been fixed with the new series. I won't spoil anything but some characters that were added were unnecessary. Because they hardly served any purpose other than to be there just for show.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything they introduced new elements to E7:AO that didn't need to be there so they ended up spending more time explaining all the new elements and spent less time on the story and characters. As a matter of fact there were a lot of things in AO that they simply wasted time trying to explain. I felt like I was watching a whole new show. Hardly anything reminded me of the original E7. So for the most part I would watch it believing this was some stinky new anime that just aired.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I watched AO with an open mind and holding it to no standards too high but even as an anime for simply watching and enjoying, or killing time, I couldn't have been more disappointed. I might as well have watched paint dry if sheer disappointment didn't kill me first. If I had to say whether or not I would watch it again. I may. But I'd skip through most of it because some scenes are a nuisance and a waste of time to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the reviews before watching, you probably shouldn't have. Just some fair advice. You should probably go watch it yourself before checking the reviews to get your own opinion on AO. Because I get a feeling that not very many people are going to be too thrilled about this one.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr? E7 was the best. Nothing can compare. =)",

            "content": "After watching Eureka 7 and loving it I decided that I would give this anime a try.  I tried to go into it with an open mind knowing the eureka series, however this is not what I expected.  The best way I can describe this anime is a mecha mystery mess.\r\nStory- In my opinion I do not feel that this story is solid.  There are many holes and mysteries that even after watching up to episode 20 still don't make sense or haven't been explained.  This story has endless plot holes that will most likely never be explained or never makeany sense.  You can't really write much about this anime without  giving anything away the only things they do explain.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art isn't bad. There is a lot of color and the characters are well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound-well this category has never made sense to me because any anime I watch has good sound..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters of Eureka ao are not that great. Your left with wondering why some of them are even in the anime at all, and what their purpose is.  Especially his friend Naru.  I can't seem to stand her.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I can say that after each eps. that I watch I get more irritated and seem to dislike this anime even more.  I can't enjoy something that irritates me.  To be honest I continue to watch it in some hopes that something that will happen. Some glimmer of hope that they will explain some of the mystery with the secrets, with Ao's sister....why the hell Naru is all high and mighty now...\\n\\n\r\nOverall-I gave it a 4 for some level of hope that it will redeem itself with some awesome ending.  If you are looking for an anime like Eureka this isn't it.   This anime doesn't have half the amazing components that Eureka 7 had!",

            "content": "Before we get started I am planning on making a 2 part review of Eureka 7 AO this being the first one. Since i have reached the half way mark of AO i felt like it would be a good idea to give a opinion on it now, then an opinion after the show. Also i will not be ranting in any case of this review. I feel like people aren't here to hear a rant they want to know about what the anime features good and bad. \r\nEureka 7 AO or its full name Eureka 7 Astral Ocean is the sequel to the verypopular Romantic/Mech anime Eureka 7. If you have not seen Eureka 7 yet then it's recommended to watch it before AO as it does mention very important things that people who watched Eureka 7 would know. Another thing to note is that AO takes place in a different universe than the original show which is explained in the original Eureka 7 and in some of AO.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place on Okinawa's isolated island of Iwado where a young boy of the age 12 named Ao (yes the main characters name is the same as the anime title) Fukai lives. Ever since he was born nobody liked him and was known by many as a foreigner. Why? AO knows very little of why everyone hates him but what he does know is his mom at a very young age. She had Beautiful aquamarine hair and Mallow eyes with a red fringe. But soon after AO was born his mom left him alone with the old doctor of the island  Toshio Fukai. AO tried living a normal life on thel island just like anybody else on the island, accompanied by her childhood friend Naru. a young girl of the age 13. Soon after AO's mom's appearance scub bursts begin to appear all over the world. for those who do not know Scubs are Intelligent lifeforms that has been on earth for 1,000's of years before the series. As soon as the scub bursts appear secrets( uninditified objects) appear creating havoc at wherever their destination is which is really close to scub bursts.  But back to the story of Ao, Scub bursts start occurring more and more on his island and then he soon gets caught in the situation of the scubs and secrets and meets a mysterious robot named the Nirvash. A bit after his situation he soon joins Generation Bleu a organization dedicated to stopping the Secrets and extracting certain objects from the scubs. AO is teamed up with a group who name themselves the pied piper. From then on AO is dedicated to helping the world by defeating the secrets with the help of Nirvash.\\n\\n\r\nI do not want to spoil everything I just wanted to Talk about the intro and a little summery of how AO got to the position he's in now. Story wise it keeps you very intrested in whats going on, but. It can at times be very slow in the first few episodes. It may also be very repetitve at times but they keep it from not getting to boring. But, give it time and it will become very awarding after the few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLike Original, Like Sequel, AO was able to provided outstanding visual performance that's even better than its Original. The animations had amazing detail and the fights with the secrets looked top notch and detailed. the way the trapar waves in this anime looked was outstanding even better than Eureka 7. The art was phenomenal all the colors that they added and all the detail in the background really gave it a addicting feel to it. The way the hair moved and the way the models interacted was outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nBones seemed to pull it off again creating an amazing soundtrack for this anime. The music being played in certain scene gave it more emotion to that certain scene and created a sense of enjoyment. The sound effects in the anime sounded splendid to such as the way the Nirvash moved on the trapar waves or the battles with the secrets. As for voice actors, They sound fantastic the way the put in their emotions in certain scenes just added to the Anime's quality. As the music did sound great their were a few scenes where the sound shouldn't have fit in or just sounded weird. But never the less it is a great soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters definitively provided a sense of enjoyment to the anime. AO the main protagonist was really great and had a great personalty. Naru was really great character to be with AO its as if they could be lovers but i digress.  Noah AO's pet sloth was really funny to watch too. As for other characters, Gazelle played a very important part in AO's story he has a great sense of how people feel and is a very smart person. Truth supposedly the main antagonistic of the story so far is really played out well. His ability's were really unique and kept you wanted to know who he was. Team pied piper are alright too but it seems as though they don't provide lots of back story about them SO FAR! Fleur and Elena are very interesting but it would be great to know more about them. As for Ivica the leader of the pied piper he has an interesting back story that's really enjoyable to watch. Other characters in AO kept the story interesting and made the anime oh so more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 AO provides a great deal of detail so far that keeps you wanting for more. Story wise it is really interesting but can get a bit repetitive and boring at times mostly just in the first few episodes. The art and animations are especially phenomenal and top notch for a show of its caliber it will keep you entertained with stunning visuals and effects. The music and sound effects play out very nicely in certain scenes of this anime and voice actors are espically top notch.(do know that I am talking about sub right now as dub has not came out yet.) The characters are very unique in there own ways and are very fun to watch. As for action and Mechas Eureka 7 AO is not so technical when it comes to Mecha battles they are mostly quick battles that are very entertaining to watch and are unique in their own way from other Mecha's. If you are a hardcore mecha fan then you will see that this show isnt really based on mechas but more of the characters themselves. Overall this anime is well worth the watch for anyone who has seen Eureka 7 the orginal show. for new people who are watching this first it can become very confusing and will leave your brain in knots and twists. \\n\\n\r\nDO NOTE THAT I AM MAKING 2 PARTS THIS IS PART 1 OF WHAT I THINK AND PART 2 WILL BE AFTER EPISODE 26. SO PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I MAY CHANGE MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE SHOW AFTER THE ENDING FOR THE GOOD OR BAD.\\n\\n\r\nTHANK YOU :D.\\n",

            "content": "As quick overview to this review:  I liked Eureka AO but, I can't get into what I liked without discussing its shortcomings as a series and sequel first. There are a considerable amount of shortcomings to this series but, I am going to try to condense them down into three primary faults from which other problems with this series stem. \r\nProbably the biggest problem I initially had with this sequel is that it denies fans the happy ending that a lot of us had pictured as following the end of Eureka Seven. Ao's parents are missing, Ao's island home in is remarkably different fromthe setting of Eureka Seven and most returning themes are subverted in one way or another sporting a considerably different vernacular as well. This is an especially hard pill to swallow for fans who already watched Pocket Full of Rainbows as AO immediately gives off the feeling of another blatant redacting of the Eureka Seven universe. In retrospect this seems like a creative choice to play with fans' expectations coming into the sequel although this might have been a little over done as I dropped this series the first time I watched it because of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe next issue seems to be the result of over ambitious writing. The combination of everything that is going on in AO and the relatively large central cast results in a number of difficulties in telling each character's story while conveying a sense of overarching plot that viewers can comfortably follow. For some people this makes the character development seem rushed, unclear in execution or tacked on. Where as other reviewers were left wanting more character driven story and were disappointed with the overarching plot which was truly hard to follow with all the back stories popping up along the way. I found myself in the middle wanting a clearer plot and more time with each character (except Truth.) Aside from this, transitions between episodes often felt jarring and confusing since the series rarely fell into a familiar swing while trying to find a place for everything.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of reviewers have said this and I feel it deserves restating: This series is not Eureka Seven. This is fairly obvious to those who've watched or are considering watching this series, but this phrase holds a considerable amount of weight to it. Lets consider some of the things that Eureka Seven has/had to its advantage over AO.  Eureka Seven had the benefit of open expectations, a new word to discover and fifty episodes. This makes Eureka Seven a reasonably hard series to follow up in twenty-four episodes without disappointing a lot of people. It is arguable that issues with the story and presentation of the series could stem from trying to fit more into this series than could be done in twenty-four episodes, but I feel that is more a matter of opinion than fact so I've kept this as a separate shortcoming in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion of this series is that there is a lot to love and hate. For me personally there was more to love in this sequel. For a lot of reviewers there was more to hate and I find that completely understandable since there is a lot to look past to start seeing what this series did well. With that said I don't think everyone that enjoyed Eureka Seven will enjoy this sequel, but I think fans who approach this series with an open expectations and are willing to look for what they like in this series will find a lot of pleasant surprises. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the whole set up for this anime. In a cohesive, although not very well presented, plot the creators of this show managed to bring the audience into a setting that is both similar and different than the setting of Eureka Seven. This allows the audience to become reacquainted with the familiar while discovering what is new and different about the setting of AO through Ao's adventure in a way that was, for me, very nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a large and diverse cast of characters in this series and most of them are pretty likable. Although the majority of the character development felt forced and out of place in this series I still really liked the characters and I have to credit this to the fact that every primary character has some form of back story or side story. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of AO is much more politically diverse than Eureka Seven. I felt this really made AO stand out as a sequel and, although it added to the side story clutter and general messiness of AO's presentation, I still enjoyed the political aspects of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEven by the end of Eureka Seven there where many questions left unanswered and aspects of mythos left unexplored. AO continues this tradition by answering some questions viewers might have never known to ask about the Eureka Seven universe while revisiting some old questions and introducing new ones along the way. Though fairly simple, I feel this is one of AO's more notable successes as a sequel. For me this is what most of my opinion of this series as sequel hinged on. More than the characters or the story, the world of Eureka Seven is what originally drew me into this franchise and I am glad to see that aspect of Eureka Seven done justice.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Note:\\n\r\nI read the guidelines and it was suggested to avoid something like this (but not expressly prohibited.) So, I held it off until the end to respectful of everyone's time. This is my first review and although I read the guidelines and kept them in consideration while writing this review I am sure people will notice things that I overlooked. If you have any advice on how I could make this review more helpful, clear or more compliant with the guidelines, please let me know.",

            "content": "This series cannot be reviewed as a sequel. It's best to look at it as an optional side story. That being said, it has both positive and negative aspects.\r\nFor those that love the original and have yet to give this a look, I do advise perhaps taking a pass on this one. It has very little continuity with the original, and it doesn't expand on the overall story. One word to sum it up is this is clearly DIFFERENT (than the original).\r\nEureka 7: AO has a lot of mystery throughout. The biggest problem is the overall delivery of the story. The flow of the storyis very choppy, almost like it was butchered in post production. Some scenes simply don't transition properly from one moment to the next. It is flawed in it's emotional delivery, and lacks heavily in character development. It's difficult to feel any emotional attachment to most of the characters as the story goes on. It does have great artwork and good music, but this isn't enough at most times. This is one series that could easily be redone with an hour and a half long movie that would probably work better overall. \\n\\n\r\nI do warn that my next comments are a bit of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: this story works well with the time travel/alternate universe theme, and I do not feel it lacks in it's explanations of the universe. There are a lot of new things like their G-Monsters (or secrets) that have the cool factor.",

            "content": "Straight 7s all across the board ... minus a 3 in Character. So how do I feel about E7:AO? \r\nI've been a fan of Eureka Seven since I first watched it subbed by Nanashi. It's also been a really long long time since Bones made that. Forgetting E7, let's look at AO for what it actually is.\r\nEureka Seven: AO is less like a drama and barely a romance anime at all. Its entire point lies in family ties and coming of age - which it does... Well. Not great. Well. I did enjoy it's constant change of perspective though, although that's really not a plus- just me being absolutely insane.\\n\\n\r\nThe story encompasses a boy growing up without knowing much of his parents, like the original. Also is picked up by a militant like group designed to fight Coralians, reasonably similar to the original as well. In fact, the first 13 episodes, while lacking on any forms of true development and romance or coherency, are in fact fairly enjoyable. This however becomes a roller-coaster, as a cycle of enjoyment, boredom, followed by bitterness, rinse repeat.\\n\\n\r\nSee, Ao didn't have the same kind of run its predecessor had to tell its story. In fact, it had less than half the episodes. Bones made the decision to come up with a thousand events for this series that could've been awesome but just weren't. In fact, the show pitches around from one thing, to another thing unrelated, then pitches back, then decides it wants to play soccer.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/n74d7keexalbvpj/ao.png\\n\\n\r\nI'm not kidding.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem really is that Ao could've had a fine story until it gutted any character development, decided to forget plot-lines, decided it wanted to implement a completely confusing time-travel plot, and decided to drop more than 2 -second gag humor. If one took each episode of Ao, added some fun and maybe some actual character development to the story, and really tried fricking hard to reason out the time-traveling thing (I've done it and frankly, the amount of deus ex machina made it basically a moot point), the show would've been that much better. \\n\\n\r\nhttp://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011063920/eurekaseven/images/7/7c/Quartz-gun.jpg\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just phallic, it changes bloody history! Also it will erase you. *click*\\n\\n\r\nThe story get's a 7 though, despite every actual flaw in it's telling, it's not terrible, (lose Naru though, she went from somewhat interesting to the most annoying and pointless prophet the world will ever know) and the first and last two episodes actually do a good job of sending nostalgia waves through the viewer. It also attempts to explain every thread it abandoned on the way, which is nice, but frankly, it suffers the whole \"24 mins only\" run-time problem, and we all have to just scratch our heads, pause the video, open Descarte, and then proceed to say, \"Ohhhhhh...\" as realization comes flooding in about what was actually just said. Or be me and rewatch the entire series just to remember what they were referencing.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://ghostlightning.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/eureka-seven-ao-noah-reading-pied-piper.jpg\\n\\n\r\nWe like to believe he gets it. Probably does, a lot better than we did in one viewing at least.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, the eyes don't lie, the art was spectacular, the animations fluid, the mechs were beautiful... I scored it a 7 though because frankly, we don't misspell white house as 'white hous' and spell it correctly in the same exact frame of the same episode simultaneously. (episode 18... What the hell man?) Seriously, this is the same studio that did Darker Than Black (which had EXTENSIVE screens and screens of English piled onto a computer monitor, with no misspellings, a sequel with tons of Russian, which I believe is okay, and a ton of Chinese. I think we can hold them to a higher standard.)\\n\\n\r\nSound.... Was good. Nothing truly new, but the sound library did feel decent, atmosphere matched well, music pieces weren't god-awful, and come on, we love it when the Nirvash does it's whole launch sequence, doesn't matter how  bad the show was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the worst of everything. I can honestly say I hated Naru for being a philosophical female dog, despised how the back stories of Elena and Fleur were glanced at and then never brought up again for the rest of the show (okay, like once or twice - but it was so pointless I really didn't care), Ivica was borderline frightening, and Gazelle was... Gazelle? Okay, point is - I don't even know if this show had legitimate villains. Everything just kept going a this breakneck speed that I had no idea who was who and fighting who and oh god this is a mess. Look, Ao has the personality of bread. Whiny, blue bread. With purple dots. I did not give a single damn about Ao (the character) after episode 10, and this continued until the very last episode where he finally develops a personality that isn't the equivalent to: Butthurt Mom Left Me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, that personality change in the last 10 mins of the last episode ALMOST makes me forgive him. But only almost. Seriously, did Naru, Fleur, Elena or any one else even have a point after the Quartz Gun became a thing? Cos frankly, we already went over that that thing takes retroactive continuity and beats you over the head with it and makes you say it's your daddy.\\n\\n\r\nOh and don't get me started on Truth, that guy wasn't a villain at all. HE ACTUALLY HAD MORE BACKSTORY THAN MOST OF THE GODDAMN CAST!!!! By the end of it (prior to episode 23), I was basically hoping he'd kill everyone - and then...\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gt1pl2f0islecg1/hi.png\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm okay with this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment... I have to say - I would've hated this anime - it would've gotten a 4 or 5 if it wasn't for episode 24. It's certainly watchable, and isn't actually that unforgivable, but because it's so dependent on its predecessor without even being good at emulating it, and because it has so few merits of its own it can barely hold onto, the majority of the series left an anguished taste in my mouth... Like eating babies... On fire. I feel like if it had been easier on the terminology, and took more time to explain itself, and CUT ALL THE CRAP THAT ENDED UP NOT MATTERING TO EMBELLISH ON ITS MERITS, it could have been amazing, but it's not. It's passable. And even then, it's predecessor makes it look like a joke.\\n\\n\r\nWatching for what it is - you should watch it if you're a fan of the original, but don't expect much, and really don't buy it. It makes a sub-par show, and while it's better than a ton of garbage people will swear their mother's graves upon, it's just not living up to its name.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 - watch on TV.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://myanimelist.net/profile/eureka822/reviews for the record - this guy actually shares many of my opinions but still scored this show higher than I feel it deserves. Still a valid read.",

            "content": "OK. First off, let me just say that this series was a mess.\r\nI had huge expectations for this sequel since I'm a fan of E7, however, this didn't even come close. What I enjoyed about E7 was the story and character development. I actually felt connected to many of the characters. The story flowed very nicely. I even liked the Nirvash as its own character.\r\nE7AO started off ok while introducing the characters, then it quickly went downhill. The focus was more on the story and fight scenes. I dont think the story was good, but that's where the focus was.\r\nI liked Elena and Fleur andi thought they had great potential. I thought that Fleur would develop feelings for Ao but that never happened. They actually threw in some signs that she had a thing for Gazzele. Elena made a lot of references to other anime. I picked up easily on the Evangelion ones. Both these characters failed to go further and were just part of the cast for a majority of the series until they decided to wrap it up and give them their scene. I felt like it just came out of nowhere. Ao just made me upset. He was a wet blanket. He was boring and indecisive until the end. Truth. Wow. Just wow. I think its always great to have a crazy character somewhere and let them have their 1 second insane facial expression, but Truth had his on more than half the time. It got old and annoying fast. Anemone is 100% a better character. I didn't even understand Naru. Noah was better than her.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mecha designs were well done I think. I wish they gave a little more air time to appreciate them. What was bad was that there were too many special ones thrown in. There were several Nirvashs and it became confusing because of them coming from a different time and all that. I understand that there are two, but it seemed like there were many more. I wonder what the back story was for Truth's Mech. It just appeared.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the story. The basic plot was good, but all the little details they threw in made it a wreck. I didn't even know what was going on half the time. There would be a serious fight going on, then it just switches over to a calm island scene. I didn't like this at all. It sucked the severity and seriousness of the events. They just jumped on the time travel hype, but time travel is really hard to put together. Its an interesting concept, but difficult to make it enjoyable. They would have been more successful if they had kept it more low key with a single goal. The protagonist didn't even know what his own goal was until the last episode. Also, that ending! Seriously, what the fuck? If you've seen it you probably have the same thoughts I have. The main questions, how and why. The series would be better off without it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was good about the series were the animations and music. They were consistent with the first series. The openings and endings were also pretty good. The animations for Ao were a bit lacking about halfway though. It kept changing. It might have been just me.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, E7AO failed to meet my expectations. It may seem my intent was to bash the series but that is wrong. I'm just expressing what made me upset. It had a lot of potential so it makes me sad when it turn out like this. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to keep all of E7 in a good light.",

            "content": "Building on an existing storyline isn't an easy thing to do - especially when the ending of the original tale has a degree of finality to it. That doesn't stop people making the attempt though, and nowhere is this more prominent than in the world of fanfiction. This rather odd realm of amateur (and not-so-amateur), writers is filled with continuations, alternate retellings, character side-stories, non-canon additions, and a host of other works that reflect the fan's passion for the source material. Although they often lack the quality and direction (and sometimes the logic and common sense), of professional pieces, they're generally imaginative yarns that cansometimes lead the reader to new insights about the original work.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are occasions where the story has been created not out of love, but simply because the author feels that they can do better.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO (which stands for Astral Ocean, but is also the name of the lead character), is the sequel to 2005's extremely popular Eureka Seven - and with director Kyoda Tomoki at the helm again and Bones producing both shows, it's easy to see why fans of the original would be excited. Written by Kato Yuichi, the new story focuses on Fukai Ao - a 13 year-old boy living with his grandfather on the island of Iwato Jima in the independent nation of Okinawa. Considered an outcast by the residents who blame the disaster that occurred ten years before on his mother Eureka - who has been missing since that time - his life changes when an accident delivers a strangely familiar bracelet into his hands, which in turn brings him into contact with a mysterious robot called Nirvash.\\n\\n\r\nThe tale begins in relatively familiar territory and progresses at a decent pace for the first few episodes, but as the series continues more things are added to the plot until it grows into a ponderous, shambling behemoth of ideas and concepts that simply don't go anywhere. In addition to this the storyline degenerates into a mediocre monster-of-the-week narrative for a good portion of the show, and elements of the original series have either been left out, crowbarred in, or completely altered - sometimes for no logical reason at all - creating some major continuity issues. The problems are further compounded by the addition of time travel and alternate realities, all of which lead to a rather lukewarm, confusing, and decidedly unsatisfying ending that lacks the catharsis of the original series.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO takes many of its visual cues directly from its parent, and Bones have worked hard to maintain the style while updating the design. That said, there are some odd decisions about clothing (Ao's school uniform resembles a costume used by male strippers),  but some good animation and effects work balances the strange outfits. Much of the aerial combat is fluid, and although there are some minor issues the character movements are handled in a reasonable manner. In addition to this the mechs - which are clearly influenced by the original series - have a definite \"man-made\" feel that highlights the creator's desire for Eureka Seven AO to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe show features two opening sequences that serve as bland-yet-functional introductions to the story thanks to the use of the check-box approach (protagonist running, birds flying, people looking pensive/cheerful/heroic/constipated, [insert cool action sequence], [insert suggestive minor spoiler that may have no connection to the plot at all], rinse, repeat, end with cool and/or spicy action still featuring the protagonist (and his love interest - male or female, species is optional), adverts, etc). The first closing sequence is equally unimaginative (and ticks all the boxes), but the second is something of a departure as it adopts a \"pop-art\" style and relies on still images to suggest that Ao's playtime is over.\\n\\n\r\n\"Escape\" by Hemenway (the first opening track), is the type of bland rock song that seems to grace every major shounen title at least once, but FLOW's \"Bravelue\" manages to capture  at least some of the magic of \"Days\" - the opening theme from Eureka Seven. \"Stand By Me\" by the oddly named Steropony is a rather dull, brooding affair that doesn't really fit with the formulaic closing sequence, while Joy's \"Lolite\" is a poppy little number that works surprisingly well with the associated imagery.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to overall audio quality, and the uninspiring opening and closing themes are reflective of the music throughout the show. The predominantly well-chosen background tracks often work within the context of a given scene, but there are far too many attempts at enhancing a humourous moment using a comedic tune, and many of these attempts fall short of the mark. In addition to this the diverse array of effects can be let down by a lack of care with choreography or poor production quality, and the issues are further compounded by a script that is sorely lacking in emotional intensity. With little to work with the Japanese cast are unable to showcase their talents effectively - resulting in performances that vary wildly as the voice actors struggle to breathe some semblance of life into their roles. Unfortunately things don't get any better with the English dub as, true to form, the approach is literal and the scope is limited.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that should be pointed out is the continuous inability of the Western license holders to find people with accents to play particular roles, and it's painful to hear Sainty Reid as 16 year-old French pilot Fleur Blanc - especially when she macerates her way through terms like \"maman\" - the colloquial form of \"m\u00e8re\" (mother). It's unfortunate that her first serious role is one that really needed a specific vocal style, and the truly sad part is that in an era where talented people can be found under every rock, viewers are still being subjected to the idea that everyone in the world speaks English (with an American accent), as their native language.\\n\\n\r\nThe wastelands of anime are littered with the shades of forgettable characters, and the numerous problems with the storyline and script deal what could only be called a killing blow to Eureka Seven AO. The foundation of good characters lies in the logical development of the plot together with an organic approach to dialogue - both of which require time, patience, an understanding of relationships, and a healthy dose of criticism. The original series featured some good character dynamics that added personality to each role, making Renton, Eureka, and several others believable to a degree - but more importantly they became interesting and likeable. Unfortunately logic appears to have gone out of the window with this \"sequel\" - resulting in a set of bland \"people\" with few saving graces.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to treat Ao in a manner similar to Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion has backfired, and although some attempts have been made to save him from the pit of obscurity, he stands at the head of a queue of unlikable, uninteresting, and excruciatingly dull characters - all of whom shove him steadily towards the precipice. Truth initially serves as a decent antagonist, but his development is sorely lacking as he is quickly relegated from that role - becoming little more than a force of nature whose actions serve no purpose whatsoever. As for Naru, her status as Ao's love interest quickly loses all meaning once the plot shifts into monster-of-the-week mode, and like Truth her purpose in the story is ultimately rendered irrelevant. That said, there are some intriguing interactions between the supporting characters, but the approach to relationships is surprisingly lacking in emotional depth - becoming little more than background noises that are eventually swallowed by the confusing plot.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is a strange, lumbering beast that struggles to maintain its balance before the weight of its collective flaws sends it careening into the realms of logical fallacy, but the odd thing is that nobody appears to have noticed any of the obvious problems during the planning, production, or ADR stages of the show - which raises quite a few questions. Kato Yuichi's confusing, poorly written storyline has a mechanical feel that lacks emotion or passion for the original series, and in truth has more in common with amateur fanfiction written by someone whose ideas, imagination, and belief that they can do better are greater than their talent. The shoddy dialogue makes it difficult to like or believe in the characters, and fans of the original series may find this addition to the franchise painful to watch. That said, the show does feature some rather nice action sequences that can distract the audience from the mundanity, and there are some interesting aspects of the story that really should have been more prominent. If all the viewer wants is something to pass the time then Eureka Seven AO isn't the worst show available, and if it isn't examined too closely then the show may attract its own fan base.\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to make a \"sequel\" to a successful show is understandable (anime is a business after all), but Eureka Seven AO highlights some issues that lie at the heart of the industry - in particular the lack of understanding about what the wider audience wants and a serious need for quality control at all levels. The simple fact is that the series has broken under the weight of too many unnecessary straws, and aside from the visuals the show lacks the finesse and polish that one would expect from a mainstream title.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven was one of my most favorite mecha-animes of all time, but I was very disappointed in Astral Ocean. Here are the reasons why,\r\nEureka Seven AO focuses too much on the action. In the previous series, there was drama and love. I know most of you will think to yourself \"mecha animes aren't suppose to have any drama or love, just action\" but the drama in Eureka Seven was what made the series. It made you love the two main characters, Renton and Eureka. But in Astral Ocean, you don't have the same connection with Ao.\r\nThe story of the show is still strong, it'svery mysterious. There are new entities called Secrets attacking the unnatural beings known as Scub Corals. There is a man named \"Truth\" who is trying to reveal the truth to the world (sorry if that sounded repetitive) and he is the shows main antagonist. There is Naru who was Ao's best friend who decided to go total whack on Ao one day and follow the main bad guy. And there is the mystery behind of \"what happened to Eureka and Renton?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is still beautiful like the original show, I love the action scenes and the mecha drawings, it's pure epic. The sound is crystal clear, the openings and endings are amazing, (OP 2- Very Nostalgic to Eureka Sevens original opening), and overall I give the animation and sound effects a ten. \\n\\n\r\nHere is where I get a bit pissy. The characters seem very bland compared to the characters in the original series. Renton from the original series was a crybaby, he was a crybaby but we got to know his character so well that we felt like we actually knew him. He was very true to himself, and he loved Eureka dearly. He cared for others and put his life on the line at certain times. The rest of the crew- members in the Gekkostate (Gekkostate is their flying ship) all had their own unique looks and traits that made us love them. Holland (the captain) was a bit of a jerk but nonetheless I loved him as a character of the show. \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters in Astral Ocean is a different story. Eureka Seven had humor and the characters were fun to watch and listen to. But in Astral Ocean, many of the characters seem way too serious and it feels like you can grab several characters and just meld them into one person- that's how boring they are. A lot of characters feel the same to me and I just don't connect with them.\\n\r\nEven Holland (from the Original series) was such an ass to Renton that I actually hated Holland. To actually hate someone that doesn't even exist, means that they're a good and true character. \\n\\n\r\nHere's how bad the characters are in Astral Ocean- I won't be sad if Ao dies. I'm serious. He's the main character but he's so boring like the rest, that I don't feel like I'll be very sad if he died. However, if Renton died, I would be extremely sad and I'll hate the show for killing him, (thank God he didn't die) but if Ao dies, I'll just say \"meh the show could still possibly go on without him\" (and a lot other characters besides).\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I'm still putting up with this show is because I can't wait to see Renton and Eureka reunite. But Ao? Whatever. He can do whatever he wants to, because he's as boring as the shows pet. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of the show would be around a 6 when my overall enjoyment from the predecessor would be a 9. \\n\r\nOverall the show gets a 7 because the art and action saves it from dropping below a 5. \\n\\n\r\nWatch Eureka Seven then watch Astral Ocean. You'll see a depressing drop and you'll wonder, what in the hell happened?\\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven AO serves as a sequel to the fantastic Eureka Seven of a few years ago. however to call it a sequel is akin to calling a doughnut a loaf bread, it shares many of the same base elements, is similar on a surface and level but make for totally different products in the end. one of which has a giant hole in the middle.\r\nThe hole in this context is the story, or rather the lack of it. The series mulls around being a monster of the week show for the majority of it's run all the while attempting to raise mysteries and intriguearound a few side plots that aren't really addressed till later. the problem however lies in when it actually does address those plots, it's painfully rushed, borderline incomprehensible at times and leaves the impression that writers didn't have an ending in mind and just sort of winged it for the last stretch of episodes, culminating in a bizarre mess of a plot which feels like it was over too fast and drawn out at the same time. \\n\r\nthe entire ordeal feels like a directionless mess. which spends so much time trying to make it seem like it's doing SOMETHING that it eventually becomes clear it's not really doing ANYTHING. introducing just a many plot points as it seemingly drops, it has a schizophrenic whiplash of a pace which never seems to settle in on what it wants to do enough to do any of it effectively. \\n\r\nas far as the plot goes, it's a disappointment to prior fans of the franchise due to it's handling of what few legacy elements it embraces but at the same time relies fairly heavily on you knowing/liking the previous series to fully understand it, which leaves new fans in the cold too.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story may be a broken mess, the animation and art design are actually very good. the show has some really impressive visuals at times and upholds to bones usual high standard of quality. backgrounds are often colourful and detailed and it features some of the nicest looking explosions I've seen in a long time. \\n\r\nThe primary character designs were handled by Kenichi Yoshida, who was the character designer for the first series, which lends a nice bit of visual familiarity to the series and helps tie it to the original series.\\n\r\nmecha design is sadly a low point, the original series had shoji kawamori, a veritable god among mecha designers, and this series... doesn't. the mechs don't look bad on their own, but they lack the distinct visual punch the original had, only made worse by it's comparing the two styles.\\n\r\nand finally you have the G-monsters or secrets, the primary antagonists of the series. which are essentially monsters made of polygonal shapes. their appeal seems to be a matter of taste, they are simplistic enough to resonate with some, but bland enough to be forgettable to others. personally i found them to be an interesting concept that turned out to be unmemorable due to their execution, another failing of the story and it's lack of direction.\\n\r\nIt's visuals are certainly one of it's strongest point and it rarely looks cheap, but some of the mecha/antagonist designs can feel sub-par which really takes away from some fairly well done action.\\n\\n\r\nthe music is the only point i have absolutely no problems with. the score is handled by Koji Nakamura (of supercar, lama and ILL) and is a audible treat, i often found myself rewatching parts of episodes just to hear the songs going on in the background. it ranges nicely from slice of life calmness to intense mecha action perfectly and compliments those scenes fantastically as it goes. the few insert songs are also great, though musical taste may be a factor in your enjoyment of them. \\n\r\nthe music never failed to get me into the series moods and managed to accomplish the rare feat of both fitting the scenes subtly and without overstating itself but also being good enough for me to end up humming it long after watching episodes. of all it's traits, the soundtrack is the thing i've most taken away from AO and i personally am more likely to just listen to the soundtrack than rewatch the show.\\n\\n\r\noverall the series is a real mixed bag, on the surface level it's great. it's pretty and sounds great with a seeming return to a fantastic world. but as is often the case things are not quite what they seem. it's ties to the original series are tenuous and confusing, it's own plot is underdeveloped and meandering and the whole experience ends up feeling a bit hollow. it's fantastic presentation does a lot to carry it, but in the end the the story is weak and it's art isn't good enough to watch just for it.\\n\r\nIt's a case where the show is primarily bad, the most important thing (the story) is lacking and often confusing, but there is just enough good to balance it out. it ends up being a completely middle of the road show despite all it's qualities being at extremes. they just happen to cancel each other out into this weird show.\\n\r\nPersonally it left me with an odd impression.  I don't regret watching it, but i feel like i probably should and can't. which is really strange. much like this show.",

            "content": "Ah, Eureka Seven AO, how I was so excited to watch you before you aired. Now here I am facepalming all over the place at how bad this show is, and how I was foolish to be excited for this.\r\nLet me start out by saying, the original Eureka Seven is one of my all-time favorite anime series, and it's just sad for me to see what BONES did. They are merely marketing a show purely based off of nostalgia, and putting zero effort into it, less so than those incomplete adaptions used to sell more of the source material.\r\nSo first off, what is this showall about? Well originally it was about Ao, Eureka's son as you probably could have guessed from the promo image, joining a group called Pied Piper-actually, just a subsection of Generation Blue-(The E7 AO equivalent of the Gekkostate, not.), and trying to find his mom (Who he calls \"Anma!\"-Where did this shit come from?). From there, it's total nonsense, especially in the second half. Seriously, I doubt even BONES knows what they're writing in this show. Hell, it's even hard to review this show because it's so messy. So where did it all go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nPart of the problem is how Eureka Seven had a completely closed ending, with no loose ends. So, what the heck were they supposed to do for a story, a sequel story? Set it up in our world, instead of the world of the original E7? Introduce an overpowered villain with no motives, and then come up with something along the way? Put in terminology the viewer is completely unfamiliar with, and explain it midway when all the characters knew everything from the start, and assumed the viewers were the same? Put random things in, and forget about them completely in only a few episodes, making it completely redundant? How about just put in random crap to fill up 24 episodes? Really, these are warning signs the show is going to be a total mess.\\n\\n\r\nThere are tons of plot holes everywhere (Especially in the final two episodes which are just one large Deus Ex Machina), and lots of things will not make sense as such. In one instance, it's stated everywhere the Secrets are not the enemy as they merely take an element called Quartz away from the Scub Corals. But then later, Generation Bleu tries to eliminate all the Secrets. Oh and let's not forget how you can travel around the world in only an hour, it doesn't matter where. Seems the earth is way smaller than it really is...\\n\\n\r\nHow about the characters? Did the characters turn out good? Hardly, the show makes some of the same mistakes Shakugan no Shana III (Final) made. It introduces a bunch of characters, and then doesn't bother to develop them, or show any backstory, so they're just...there. Many characters will develop in some way, but it'll either make no sense, or it'll be a total character rewrite. We'll also get some good backstory, but the show then tosses it aside and forgets about it. The backstory rarely ends up being relevant to the story.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, can we forget how they introduced certain elements you never in a million years wanted in E7? An otaku girl? Moe girls everywhere, resulting in a harem practically? Fanservice? And what purpose does this serve? Really, what does it serve for a good story? In this show, it can't co-exist with the story, and character development like does in various shows.\\n\\n\r\nNow the production values, believe it or not, despite being newer, E7 AO visually looks worse than its predecessor, and the animation can be rather messy. The soundtrack, same thing. Not all that much to it.\\n\\n\r\nReally, they should have either made this not a sequel, or took a page from Gonzo from when they made Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam, the sequel to Last Exile which also had a completely closed ending. That show managed to do a much better job at things, from the story, to the characters. It did not rely on purely nostalgia to tell a story, and the result wasn't all that bad.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO in the end is a prime example of doing everything wrong in a show, and what happens when a studio uses only nostalgia to tell a story. Take the E7 fanboy glasses off, and you'll immediately notice the many, many problems. One can only hope less of these kinds of shows get made in the future. Nostalgia can be great, but not when you use it to tell a story for a show.",

            "content": "It may be early days yet, but the refreshed and reinvigorated Eureka Seven franchise holds great promise.  Earmarked as it's spiritual sequel, Eureka 7 AO appears to not only match its predecessor in beauty and story, but does create firm groundwork to better it.\r\nStory\r\nBy the end of the first episode, I was hooked.  The whole progression is well-built, where E7-AO dips its toes pretty evenly between character dialogue and fast-paced action scenes.  Just when you think the action has outstripped its relevance, the plot yanks you back, to cover any gaps you may have missed.  This to and fro between actionand deep & moving storytelling creates means each is that much more compelling, as it is contrasted with one another.  Episode four typifies this, where one half is pure mind-melting action, and the other half delving into the deeper mysteries of Ao and his mother. \\n\\n\r\nMore interestingly, the story feels darker than the original E7.  This comes out in the open depictions of violence by the \"G-Monsters\" to the open yet diverse political opinion voiced between the main characters.  Yes, politics and divided issues do form a subtle undertone here.  Themes such as racism, nationalism, political identity and independence, and even government corruption are bandied about from character to character.  Pippo's snide reply to Giselle's remark that the Nirvash being part French, US and theirs springs to mind (\"it\u2019s fat, wants to surrender and has bad teeth\").  \\n\\n\r\nIt reminds me A LOT of X'amd in a way, which also grappled with these issues, and as such, really makes the story feel real and visceral.  More importantly, it feels like the story has aged with the viewer.  Whereas E7 placed the viewer squarely in the sheltered and naive hands of Renton; here in AO, Bones does away with the protection and says: \"Here's the real world - its not a fluffy fantasy - it's real, gritty and desperate.\"  Nothing evokes better emotional responses than that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nPlease.  It's Bones we're talking about here.  There should be no question over this stuff.  The artwork is BEAUTIFUL (as usual) and the voice-acting is top notch.  More interestingly, the music really sounds like an improvement on E7, which did feel a tad repetitive.  Here the music, especially the track concluding episode one, is swelling and moving.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Ao as the protagonist is distinctly different from his previous counterpart (Renton).  Renton in E7, was grossly naive for much of the early episodes, and his mood fluctuated wildly, often transpiring into tears or bouts of frustration/anger.  Pretty understandable for his age BUT it did get on my nerves a little (probably doesn't bode well for when I have kids).  Ao on the other hand, appears to be far more assured and assertive.  He rarely contemplates/broods over issues, and rather jumps quickly to proactive action (Renton, to be fair, did this at times).  For this reason, I prefer Ao, owing to his more assertive nature.  Sure, there are times he is shocked or saddened, but several times, he shows this tough resilient attitude, such as the end of episode one.  At other times, he acts entrenched and guarded of his secrets, such as his first interactions with Flair Blanc.  Finally, Ao just seems to be less naive to Renton.\\n\\n\r\nThis is really the same for all the main characters in general.  Naru, the vulnerable romantic interest, Elena and Fleur combining to make tenacious yet comical Generation Bleu team to the rough and rebellious Giselle and his crew (much like Holland and his).  By the end of the four episode, each of these characters (and more) are memorable and provide their own watermark on the story.  This most of all shows fantastic storytelling and writing, that it has only taken FOUR EPISODES, to flesh out stories, that take some animes triple the time to get to.  \\n\\n\r\nOH - and how could I forget NOAH.  Easily the best pet-sloth-thingy ever. It's like Bones stole the \"cuteness\" potion from the Powderpuff Dolls and smeared it all over the one animal.  Awesomesauce.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOne analogy springs to mind when summing up E7:AO so far.  One of my best mates produces electronic music, which is a time-consuming and hair-tearing process.  By the end of writing and recording the track, the track must undergo \"mastering.\"  What mastering does, is basically it crams as much synth, bass, treble, percussion and general loudness into the smallest capacity.  This process is often rife with error, and as such, the perfect final sound is hard to come by, yet sought endlessly by my friend.  \\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is really beginning to feel like that perfect mastering.  To bring back to the topic at hand, it just feels like the writers have managed to craft episode after episode crammed with great storytelling - such that by the time the 22min (or so) disappears, you feel like you've watched an hour of story in 5 minutes.  Every second is utilised.  No unnecessary fat here.\\n\\n\r\nE7:AO has set high expectations from its great opening episodes.  As such, many commentators preach that like most anime, there will come the inevitable dip, when the studio needs to pad out the script.  However, judging from the past episodes, I feel quietly confident that AO is quite safe in the mastered hands of Bones.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: Episode 12 and on.\\n\\n\r\nWOW.  Just wow.  M Night Shamalamalamalyan (maybe incorrect spelling :P) would be envious of this well performed twist.  Without divulging spoilers, episode 12 represents a significant shift in the plot surrounding E7:AO, and direct links between E7 and E7:AO are beginning to show clarity, like peering through a clearing fog.\\n\\n\r\nUp to this point, the plot feels like it has taken 3 sharp \"chapters\".  Episodes 1-4 really introduce us to Ao and the main characters, as well as the greater world of E7:AO.  Episodes 5-10 then slow down the pace, and allow in-depth character development to proceed, of supporting characters.  Then from episode 11, the series begins to pick up pace again, whereby many questions and answers are raised, as the worlds of E7 and E7:AO begin to collide.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the three parts, probably 5-10 is the weakest.  I still enjoyed them, but the view between E7 fans, voyeurs and the general mishmash of commentators appeared to hold a mixed, if not, negative reaction.  In a way, I do share their criticisms.  These episodes were very formulaic, whereby each episode could be summarised as the following:\\n\\n\r\nSupporting character problem\\n\r\nProtagonist tags along\\n\r\nMonster of the week appears\\n\r\nMonster of the week is destroyed + supporting character overcomes issue\\n\r\nPudding is had by all\\n\\n\r\nIn hindsight (eg. after seeing episode 12+), I can see why BONES had to approach the supporting characters with such detail, as the characters of Ao, Naru, Truth, Elena, Fleur and Ivica become incredibly central (I predict) to the quickly changing plot.  But, I also think that despite the product being good, BONES could of thought of perhaps a more complex path to get there.  To be fair, I am nitpicking, so as to not come across as completely biased :P\\n\\n\r\nTo cut to the chase: if you are an E7 fan but are unsure whether to proceed through the series, perhaps due to getting restless during eps 5-10 or due to the somewhat negative fans, my recommendation is to persist at least till episode 12.  I can at least predict that if you watch it no further, you will still get a kick out of a certain blue-haired individual making their fashionably-late entrance ;)\\n",

            "content": "Eureka Seven: OW...er, AO\r\nOuch! That's is all.\r\n...okay, that wouldn't make for much of a review, but really, the best way I can put this series was it was painful to watch. I remember seeing the original series in both English and Japanese and loved both. One of the few English dubs that I didn't despise that much. I really hope this doesn't get localized so it can slap the faces of any other Eureka Seven fans that don't watch subbed anime.\r\nOkay, enough venting and more reviewing. The problem with this series was the story and character development...and boy, was it bad. Bones had a prettystrong reputation before this series but I get the impression it's going to take a major hit. The writers tried to create an innovative plot that took Eureka Seven character archetypes, put them in a time travel/dimensional travel plot, and see what happens. It's almost as if Bones took a look at Steins;Gate and said \"see how successful this was?! We need to do that!\" Problem is, Steins;Gate created a full cast of likable characters and didn't make the plot any deeper than it had to be. This? It was confusing from start to finish. It's one thing to slowly pace out plot development out of suspense, it's a complete other thing to slowly pace out plot development and then not have a proper payoff.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made the original series so great was the character development. There was a cast that was well hashed out, well developed, and most importantly, the characters were actually likable and memorable. Astral Ocean failed in that department. It had some unique characters that could've filled that role. I felt as though Elena and Fleur were probably the best characters outside of Ao in this series when it comes to likability. However, even they were not hashed out as well as they should've been and in moments where the dramatic tension should've been high, it wasn't. Simply put, I react well to animes that can convince me that there's dramatic tension between the characters and how they respond to each other. I wasn't sold on any of their dramatic tension. \\n\\n\r\nBy far the WORST part of Eureka Seven: Ao though was the ending. Since I'm not allowed to \"spoil\" it, I'll just come out and say...it was pointless...and I mean that literally. The ending deemed the entire Eureka Seven: Ao storyline essentially pointless. On top of that, it COMPLETELY hung Ao, the series lead character, out to dry. I found it to be an absolute TERRIBLE approach. It's one thing to have a tragic ending that has an affect on the main cast of characters. This anime didn't have that. It had a tragic ending that effectively left zero impact on the main cast of characters. Buzz kill is really the best way to describe the ending.\\n\\n\r\nI know I said a lot of bad things about E7: Astral Ocean so far, but are there any good things? Yeah, there are. The artwork was pretty consistent with the original series and I'd even say slightly better. Although, I do think they went a little overboard with Truth's facial expressions. The music on the whole was pretty good. I also found myself REALLY enjoying the 2nd OP BlazBlue by FLOW. The OP set up the feel that the anime would have an epic 2nd half...so good advertising on Bones part...just poor execution.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the bad outweighs the good. I can say that for the most part, I did enjoy the series but like many series before it, poor writing and an absolute \"worst possible ending\" just ruined the series for me. The writers tried to do way too much with the plot and not enough with the character development. In an attempt to be innovative, the writers instead created a confusing, heaping mess that even by the time everything was cleared up and explained, it left me unsatisfied. For a sequel to a great series like Eureka Seven, Astral Ocean failed to meet expectations...and then some.",

The artwork is new and definitely fresh and at moments has some almost 3D aspects but it still has the Eureka 7 feel to it. The manga and the anime have a few different ambiguities that are slight. I have yet to identify the sound tracks that will be used or were used in the first episode, but hopefully they are correlated just as well as Sato Naoki's from the first series where you could literally hear the emotion in his music. Character development is good for thefirst episode... I mean many things have been left for later to be summed up such as Eureka being Ao's mom and where Renton was when all of Ao's childhood and such. Surely to be covered as the anime progresses. Story is a little undefined as to what G-monsters are as well as FP's and other acronyms that aren't drawn out...yet.\\n\\n\r\nSurely this will be a great anime. The only thing to do is to wait and see if it lives up to its predecessor.",

This review will tell you what to expect from E7: AO so you can be spared the headaches if you don't want to watch it. I won't be doing the generic reviews of the usual elements since many others have covered them.\r\nFirst, don't expect that the original series is paralleled here in AO. It's a completely different story with elements from the previous series, the only links being Renton, Eureka, Nirvash, and the Gekko.\r\nSecond, if you don't like to think hard on an anime, then don't watchthis. Spare yourself from a lot of hair pulling.\\n\\n\r\nThird, this is a BONES anime. This means that the plot doesn't usually make sense until the end or near the end.\\n\\n\r\nFourth, if you're looking for action and lasers with good old mecha fighting, then don't watch this. Go and watch Gurren Lagann instead.\\n\\n\r\nFifth, if you're expecting romance like the original series, don't expect anything from this unless you're only watching for the Renton and Eureka one (which you'll have to wait for for a long, loooooong time).\\n\\n\r\nSixth, be prepared for a reversal of roles. Not everything you think is correct, IS RIGHT. It's like thinking for the longest time that 1+1 = 2, when the real truth is actually 1+1= 345934578934759.\\n\\n\r\nSeventh, don't expect the typical plot build up. If you know about Romeo and Juliet and have read the book/watched the play, then you know what I mean. This is like Romeo and Juliet, without the romance.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, if you care about background characters then don't watch this. Let me tell you right now, this is a story filled with resets and restarts. Stories like that don't usually bid well for people who want closure on everything.\\n\\n\r\nPeople go hard on this anime because they didn't get what they expect. Let me tell you now, if you want to watch this, wipe all your biases and expectations. I learned it by Episode 13, and I say that's not too late a time.\\n\\n\r\nE7 AO is a sequel made to close everything. It closes the scene on E7 POP and AO together. It's the curtain call for both series. If you like it, good for you, you understood it. If you don't like it, then too bad, go watch an anime with a proven formula for a plotline.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, thanks for reading.",

            "content": "This proved quite disappointing considering how much I enjoyed the original Eureka Seven series, though I'm not completely condemning it to hellfire and brimstone as many folks presently are as there have been worst messes I've seen in anime. Eureka 7 AO gave us the promise of Eureka's son, Ao, trying to discover his mother's whereabouts by trudging through some complicated conflicts between military factions and Generation Bleu. While this idea showed its potential for much of the first half of the series, while also digging into the complicated issues surrounding affairs between the mentioned factions and monster threats, later episodes get increasingly messy withthe title's writing and its exploration of characters.\\n\\n\r\nLet us first talk about the choices of writing for AO. The original series had a clear direction for what it wished to accomplish with Gecko State's motives, revealing Eureka's origins, some pretty shocking secrets surrounding the origins of the world and Dewey Novak's manipulations to bring forth his own twisted plans. For AO though, the series starts getting messy towards the middle of the show when we come to learn of Eureka's whereabouts as it introduces a convoluted plot device, that I won't spoil here, that makes things rather hard to follow with what exactly is happening to her and how this element to the plot affects things for later events in the series. The series also gets in the rather obnoxious habit of creating twists in the direction of the plot that you would assume would be relevant for later events of the show or unveiling details on characters yet in many cases, these twists aren't quite as relevant and were mostly there to swerve the audience. The final two episodes that were hyped up to just recently were noticeably more fast paced than earlier episodes of AO as a major character from the first season of the series finally made his appearance and the resolution to the series will have one questioning what the entire point of it even was with how mean-spirited and contradicting AO was from how it presented itself in the earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization was another issue effecting AO. Relevant characters in the original series got a good amount of fleshing out with their personalities and backgrounds so the audience would learn to care for the issues faced by them throughout the series and see how they eventually grow throughout the series. Even among the supporting characters, the first series still gave them enough personality where they were entertaining to see in serious and light-hearted moments. In AO though, many characters who were relevant in the major events of the series get limited development and don't have much in the way of personality, limiting any kind of connection one could get from them. Those characters who do get reasonable fleshing out are still limited in their development and growth thanks to the mentioned messy writing. Any chemistry between characters that would have one think there is a significant bond between them, like friendship, family or love, or there is development of one is snuffed aside for the most part thanks to larger focus being on the advancement of AO's plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that AO seemed to genuinely land right were the visuals. Eureka 7 AO retains the same animation style used from the first season of the series while having a more vivid color palette and smoother details. The fluid and intense mecha fights are also retained here as well and make for some of the best animated moments I've seen from a TV anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Eureka 7 AO made for one of the year's biggest disappointments for me in terms of expectations. While I was expecting a title that would retain the spirit of the original Eureka 7 in exploring Ao's search for his mother from its earlier episodes, AO became quite a mess in terms of writing and characterization in later episodes as it had trouble deciding on a proper direction to follow with its elements compared to the original series. Diehard Eureka 7 fans may want to avoid AO lest they want to fume fan-rage over what they will inevitably see.",

            "content": "Oh god Bones. How can you do this to me? \r\nHonestly, it wouldn't have been an awful anime standing on it's own. But you had to attach it to Eureka 7, to which I have so many fond memories and emotions attached!\r\nMy first complaint with this anime is.. The waste of time. The key points of this episode could have been done in 12 episodes. There were no real filler episodes either!\r\nWhy 12? Well, at least half the content was just boring: Go here, kill these guys. Minor character development. Nothing really happens.\r\nMy next complaint is.. the characters. The super powers, they didn't make sensein this universe. To some extent, Naru fit in great. However, Truth was just the personification of every awful villain of any anime. Even when you get his full story. He just sort of.. is horrible. \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing about the characters.. Is the lack of development. Even on the main characters. We saw more development from Moon Doggy in E7 than we did from Ao in the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThird complaint. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't make sense. I hate time travel. Hate it! With a passion, and this took confusing time travel and made it more confusing. They never answer a few questions which arise like \"Were the scubs actually time traveling, or were they going to another universe in which an earlier time period of earth was occuring?\" We don't have the insightful mind of a character like Dr. Bear to elaborate to the viewers what the staff knows. \\n\\n\r\nTo that end on the story. It kind of ruins the original series. I don't think I've been this dismayed at  a series end since Mass Effect 3. \\n\\n\r\nWhile creating a clone of the original is  fruitless endeavor, making the sequel more similar than distant to the original story should have taken a  precedent. When it didn't apparently. There were so many avenues to be followed upon with the original anime but instead they offer this short series which honestly should have been way shorter. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really missed were those scenes where you felt in touch with the character. I remember literally crying during Anemone's lamenting, and the tears of joy that followed when Eureka and Renton helped her see past the life she was locked in to. \\n\\n\r\nGranted the end of Eureka 7 PoP was a little bit trippy for me, it was still amazing compared to what we got from Astral Ocean. \\n\\n\r\nGoddamn how Bones has fallen.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, first of all let me just say that when I first saw the original Eureka 7 I actually had a hard time getting into it. so much so to the point where I put it on hiatus for a while. Now usually when I do that I rarely go back to finish watching it but E7 was different. I found myself checking it out once more and loving it! I'll tell you why I was so compelled to watch that anime again despite initially not liking it very much....the characters and character development was great! Even for characters I did not like such asDewy and Holland. I still was able to understand where they were coming from. Talho was a flawed character as well but she had a personality and was likable. Renton, I thought he was the typical mech anime boy until he opened up and revealed his true and honest feelings toward eureka, his family life, and his future. I was glad that none of the characters were up in Renton's buttcrack like most of anime characters tend to be toward the main character, they just liked him. Eureka, once again I thought she was the typical expressionless anime girl but she surprised me and revealed to be a girl who suffered a lot and truly wish to set everything right. Her, Renton, the kids, and the members of the Gekko State were unique and enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nBut don't expect that from E7:AO\\n\\n\r\nNow when I finished watching E7 and heard there was a second part I was so happy I immediately began watching it. We're introduced to Ao who is Renton and Eureka's son and I'm thinking great start! But soon you learn that Eureka and Renton are nowhere in sight and he is in fact in another world on another timeline. Apparently Eureka and Renton get separated and Eureka came to their world and had her kid and went back blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, don't expect to find decent character development here. The characters are ALL typical mech anime characters. First we have typical mech anime boy Ao who gets recruited to join \"Generation Blue\" a military like organization that uses children to fly IFOs because for some odd reason only children can fly IFOs *eye roll*\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are one dimensional including Ao. He's the typical mech anime boy that all the characters instantly love even when they say they don't. He comes complete with a \"funny\" pet, and a love interest whom he feels he must fight to protect.  Of course there is a chief of the child pilots who love them all like they were his own children. And the story does take a five minute break every five episodes so we can see the characters be \"quirky\". But is this character development? No! These characters are so bland they could really all be just one person and you would never notice. These characters lack everything that made the members of the Gekko State fun and interesting to watch. The members of the Gekko state had lives, the members of Generation Blue needed to get a life. There is really nothing to them but never ending mech battles. Gone are the priceless moments such as the Gekko team tricking Renton into thinking a bowl of Ramen was a deadly mission. Instead with AO you get some banter about whether or not Ao can swim. Gone are deep characters like Charles and Ray and instead you get....nothing! None of these characters are remember-able! \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of AO simply sucks! the creators try to be deep with the whole mysteriousness of it but it's really just a ploy to keep people watching cause they really have NO PLOT!\\n\\n\r\nThey try to do this whole time travel deal but it's a mess.\\n\\n\r\nNow I don't mind time travel stories being a little messy but this was just a hot mess and it seems as though the creators are just pulling plots out their rear to compensate for the lack of character. For example; When Eureka arrives again in that world on board a ruined Gekko State she is pregnant and just before Ao helps her go back she says she's having a girl not a boy which leads Ao to question the whereabouts of a mysterious older sister. There is never much of a explanation as to how Eureka is constantly traveling to that particular world while pregnant and she never even seems to remember anything. The anime also tries to remain interesting by not explaining anything and coming up with stupid names that are supposed to make you question what is going on. Such as \"The Secrets\" \"The truth\" *eye roll*\\n\\n\r\nYes the main villain's name is Truth and apparently he's Ao's girlfriend's (Haru) Nirvash although he's not in mech form. Anyway he's called a \"Secret\" which at first are the main bad guys of the show. Sigh. So this regular girl gets her own Nirvash simply because she was accidentally exposed to scub corals? Then she spends her time riding on the real Nirvash  for some reason. Blah blah. And of course Ao wants to save her blah blah. The creators for some reason thought it made sense to take away everything that made Eureka and Renton and subsequently Ao, so special and just pass them to the other bland characters like hot cakes. Anyway, the story sucks, the characters suck, and the music sucks. I tried to watch as much as I could just to see Renton and Eureka and so far all I saw was Eureka and the show picked up somewhat but she left and it was back downhill again.",

            "content": "I don't exactly have much time to write a full review as the previous people did. But I wanted to get this down since I just recently finished watching Eureka Seven AO. Probably won't bother doing much editing either. So here goes my review of Eureka Seven: Astral Ocean.\r\nI will start this off by saying up-front I am a huge fan of the first Eureka Seven. It is by-far my number one favorite anime next to Steins;gate, NHK, and a few others. Tbh, I did have some pretty high expectations for the sequel. Based on how well Bones did with the first series. I reallywanted / hoped the next one to be just as good if not better. And i figured with the way things ended with the last one they were free to do whatever they pleased and it should be fine. Right?\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, in the beginning of AO I liked how everything was going. Bones has a way of leaving you with questions and building curiosity and suspense. After about maybe not even mid way through the season I got bored of it. Like, okay I liked where it was going but from the early-mid to end the plot practically stays the same. It's just flat out boring. Cool actions scenes, if you're into that kind of stuff. But not much worth watching if you're looking for a good story and some character development.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of development, AO had absolutely NONE (if any) character development. In Eureka Seven you got to see Renton grow from this clumsy silly little kid to this sort of heroic figure. And throughout the show you really get to connect with the cast. They were so likeable. Not only that you got to see what kind of challenges Renton faced as a young boy growing up. Not to mention the added love story which pretty much completed it.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really want to delve into the soundtrack a whole lot but MY GOD they are seriously lacking in the OST department for AO. How do you go from an awesomely ridiculous soundtrack to like, half-assing the new OST?\\n\\n\r\nIt's as though Bones just said, \"okay let's see how bad we can screw up and see if any of the fans will notice.\" I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed that there was a lot that should've been fixed with the new series. I won't spoil anything but some characters that were added were unnecessary. Because they hardly served any purpose other than to be there just for show.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything they introduced new elements to E7:AO that didn't need to be there so they ended up spending more time explaining all the new elements and spent less time on the story and characters. As a matter of fact there were a lot of things in AO that they simply wasted time trying to explain. I felt like I was watching a whole new show. Hardly anything reminded me of the original E7. So for the most part I would watch it believing this was some stinky new anime that just aired.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I watched AO with an open mind and holding it to no standards too high but even as an anime for simply watching and enjoying, or killing time, I couldn't have been more disappointed. I might as well have watched paint dry if sheer disappointment didn't kill me first. If I had to say whether or not I would watch it again. I may. But I'd skip through most of it because some scenes are a nuisance and a waste of time to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the reviews before watching, you probably shouldn't have. Just some fair advice. You should probably go watch it yourself before checking the reviews to get your own opinion on AO. Because I get a feeling that not very many people are going to be too thrilled about this one.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr? E7 was the best. Nothing can compare. =)",

            "content": "After watching Eureka 7 and loving it I decided that I would give this anime a try.  I tried to go into it with an open mind knowing the eureka series, however this is not what I expected.  The best way I can describe this anime is a mecha mystery mess.\r\nStory- In my opinion I do not feel that this story is solid.  There are many holes and mysteries that even after watching up to episode 20 still don't make sense or haven't been explained.  This story has endless plot holes that will most likely never be explained or never makeany sense.  You can't really write much about this anime without  giving anything away the only things they do explain.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art isn't bad. There is a lot of color and the characters are well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound-well this category has never made sense to me because any anime I watch has good sound..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters of Eureka ao are not that great. Your left with wondering why some of them are even in the anime at all, and what their purpose is.  Especially his friend Naru.  I can't seem to stand her.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I can say that after each eps. that I watch I get more irritated and seem to dislike this anime even more.  I can't enjoy something that irritates me.  To be honest I continue to watch it in some hopes that something that will happen. Some glimmer of hope that they will explain some of the mystery with the secrets, with Ao's sister....why the hell Naru is all high and mighty now...\\n\\n\r\nOverall-I gave it a 4 for some level of hope that it will redeem itself with some awesome ending.  If you are looking for an anime like Eureka this isn't it.   This anime doesn't have half the amazing components that Eureka 7 had!",

            "content": "Before we get started I am planning on making a 2 part review of Eureka 7 AO this being the first one. Since i have reached the half way mark of AO i felt like it would be a good idea to give a opinion on it now, then an opinion after the show. Also i will not be ranting in any case of this review. I feel like people aren't here to hear a rant they want to know about what the anime features good and bad. \r\nEureka 7 AO or its full name Eureka 7 Astral Ocean is the sequel to the verypopular Romantic/Mech anime Eureka 7. If you have not seen Eureka 7 yet then it's recommended to watch it before AO as it does mention very important things that people who watched Eureka 7 would know. Another thing to note is that AO takes place in a different universe than the original show which is explained in the original Eureka 7 and in some of AO.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place on Okinawa's isolated island of Iwado where a young boy of the age 12 named Ao (yes the main characters name is the same as the anime title) Fukai lives. Ever since he was born nobody liked him and was known by many as a foreigner. Why? AO knows very little of why everyone hates him but what he does know is his mom at a very young age. She had Beautiful aquamarine hair and Mallow eyes with a red fringe. But soon after AO was born his mom left him alone with the old doctor of the island  Toshio Fukai. AO tried living a normal life on thel island just like anybody else on the island, accompanied by her childhood friend Naru. a young girl of the age 13. Soon after AO's mom's appearance scub bursts begin to appear all over the world. for those who do not know Scubs are Intelligent lifeforms that has been on earth for 1,000's of years before the series. As soon as the scub bursts appear secrets( uninditified objects) appear creating havoc at wherever their destination is which is really close to scub bursts.  But back to the story of Ao, Scub bursts start occurring more and more on his island and then he soon gets caught in the situation of the scubs and secrets and meets a mysterious robot named the Nirvash. A bit after his situation he soon joins Generation Bleu a organization dedicated to stopping the Secrets and extracting certain objects from the scubs. AO is teamed up with a group who name themselves the pied piper. From then on AO is dedicated to helping the world by defeating the secrets with the help of Nirvash.\\n\\n\r\nI do not want to spoil everything I just wanted to Talk about the intro and a little summery of how AO got to the position he's in now. Story wise it keeps you very intrested in whats going on, but. It can at times be very slow in the first few episodes. It may also be very repetitve at times but they keep it from not getting to boring. But, give it time and it will become very awarding after the few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nLike Original, Like Sequel, AO was able to provided outstanding visual performance that's even better than its Original. The animations had amazing detail and the fights with the secrets looked top notch and detailed. the way the trapar waves in this anime looked was outstanding even better than Eureka 7. The art was phenomenal all the colors that they added and all the detail in the background really gave it a addicting feel to it. The way the hair moved and the way the models interacted was outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nBones seemed to pull it off again creating an amazing soundtrack for this anime. The music being played in certain scene gave it more emotion to that certain scene and created a sense of enjoyment. The sound effects in the anime sounded splendid to such as the way the Nirvash moved on the trapar waves or the battles with the secrets. As for voice actors, They sound fantastic the way the put in their emotions in certain scenes just added to the Anime's quality. As the music did sound great their were a few scenes where the sound shouldn't have fit in or just sounded weird. But never the less it is a great soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters definitively provided a sense of enjoyment to the anime. AO the main protagonist was really great and had a great personalty. Naru was really great character to be with AO its as if they could be lovers but i digress.  Noah AO's pet sloth was really funny to watch too. As for other characters, Gazelle played a very important part in AO's story he has a great sense of how people feel and is a very smart person. Truth supposedly the main antagonistic of the story so far is really played out well. His ability's were really unique and kept you wanted to know who he was. Team pied piper are alright too but it seems as though they don't provide lots of back story about them SO FAR! Fleur and Elena are very interesting but it would be great to know more about them. As for Ivica the leader of the pied piper he has an interesting back story that's really enjoyable to watch. Other characters in AO kept the story interesting and made the anime oh so more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 AO provides a great deal of detail so far that keeps you wanting for more. Story wise it is really interesting but can get a bit repetitive and boring at times mostly just in the first few episodes. The art and animations are especially phenomenal and top notch for a show of its caliber it will keep you entertained with stunning visuals and effects. The music and sound effects play out very nicely in certain scenes of this anime and voice actors are espically top notch.(do know that I am talking about sub right now as dub has not came out yet.) The characters are very unique in there own ways and are very fun to watch. As for action and Mechas Eureka 7 AO is not so technical when it comes to Mecha battles they are mostly quick battles that are very entertaining to watch and are unique in their own way from other Mecha's. If you are a hardcore mecha fan then you will see that this show isnt really based on mechas but more of the characters themselves. Overall this anime is well worth the watch for anyone who has seen Eureka 7 the orginal show. for new people who are watching this first it can become very confusing and will leave your brain in knots and twists. \\n\\n\r\nDO NOTE THAT I AM MAKING 2 PARTS THIS IS PART 1 OF WHAT I THINK AND PART 2 WILL BE AFTER EPISODE 26. SO PLEASE REMEMBER THAT I MAY CHANGE MY OVERALL OPINION OF THE SHOW AFTER THE ENDING FOR THE GOOD OR BAD.\\n\\n\r\nTHANK YOU :D.\\n",

            "content": "As quick overview to this review:  I liked Eureka AO but, I can't get into what I liked without discussing its shortcomings as a series and sequel first. There are a considerable amount of shortcomings to this series but, I am going to try to condense them down into three primary faults from which other problems with this series stem. \r\nProbably the biggest problem I initially had with this sequel is that it denies fans the happy ending that a lot of us had pictured as following the end of Eureka Seven. Ao's parents are missing, Ao's island home in is remarkably different fromthe setting of Eureka Seven and most returning themes are subverted in one way or another sporting a considerably different vernacular as well. This is an especially hard pill to swallow for fans who already watched Pocket Full of Rainbows as AO immediately gives off the feeling of another blatant redacting of the Eureka Seven universe. In retrospect this seems like a creative choice to play with fans' expectations coming into the sequel although this might have been a little over done as I dropped this series the first time I watched it because of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe next issue seems to be the result of over ambitious writing. The combination of everything that is going on in AO and the relatively large central cast results in a number of difficulties in telling each character's story while conveying a sense of overarching plot that viewers can comfortably follow. For some people this makes the character development seem rushed, unclear in execution or tacked on. Where as other reviewers were left wanting more character driven story and were disappointed with the overarching plot which was truly hard to follow with all the back stories popping up along the way. I found myself in the middle wanting a clearer plot and more time with each character (except Truth.) Aside from this, transitions between episodes often felt jarring and confusing since the series rarely fell into a familiar swing while trying to find a place for everything.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of reviewers have said this and I feel it deserves restating: This series is not Eureka Seven. This is fairly obvious to those who've watched or are considering watching this series, but this phrase holds a considerable amount of weight to it. Lets consider some of the things that Eureka Seven has/had to its advantage over AO.  Eureka Seven had the benefit of open expectations, a new word to discover and fifty episodes. This makes Eureka Seven a reasonably hard series to follow up in twenty-four episodes without disappointing a lot of people. It is arguable that issues with the story and presentation of the series could stem from trying to fit more into this series than could be done in twenty-four episodes, but I feel that is more a matter of opinion than fact so I've kept this as a separate shortcoming in the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion of this series is that there is a lot to love and hate. For me personally there was more to love in this sequel. For a lot of reviewers there was more to hate and I find that completely understandable since there is a lot to look past to start seeing what this series did well. With that said I don't think everyone that enjoyed Eureka Seven will enjoy this sequel, but I think fans who approach this series with an open expectations and are willing to look for what they like in this series will find a lot of pleasant surprises. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the whole set up for this anime. In a cohesive, although not very well presented, plot the creators of this show managed to bring the audience into a setting that is both similar and different than the setting of Eureka Seven. This allows the audience to become reacquainted with the familiar while discovering what is new and different about the setting of AO through Ao's adventure in a way that was, for me, very nostalgic.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a large and diverse cast of characters in this series and most of them are pretty likable. Although the majority of the character development felt forced and out of place in this series I still really liked the characters and I have to credit this to the fact that every primary character has some form of back story or side story. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting of AO is much more politically diverse than Eureka Seven. I felt this really made AO stand out as a sequel and, although it added to the side story clutter and general messiness of AO's presentation, I still enjoyed the political aspects of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEven by the end of Eureka Seven there where many questions left unanswered and aspects of mythos left unexplored. AO continues this tradition by answering some questions viewers might have never known to ask about the Eureka Seven universe while revisiting some old questions and introducing new ones along the way. Though fairly simple, I feel this is one of AO's more notable successes as a sequel. For me this is what most of my opinion of this series as sequel hinged on. More than the characters or the story, the world of Eureka Seven is what originally drew me into this franchise and I am glad to see that aspect of Eureka Seven done justice.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Note:\\n\r\nI read the guidelines and it was suggested to avoid something like this (but not expressly prohibited.) So, I held it off until the end to respectful of everyone's time. This is my first review and although I read the guidelines and kept them in consideration while writing this review I am sure people will notice things that I overlooked. If you have any advice on how I could make this review more helpful, clear or more compliant with the guidelines, please let me know.",

            "content": "This series cannot be reviewed as a sequel. It's best to look at it as an optional side story. That being said, it has both positive and negative aspects.\r\nFor those that love the original and have yet to give this a look, I do advise perhaps taking a pass on this one. It has very little continuity with the original, and it doesn't expand on the overall story. One word to sum it up is this is clearly DIFFERENT (than the original).\r\nEureka 7: AO has a lot of mystery throughout. The biggest problem is the overall delivery of the story. The flow of the storyis very choppy, almost like it was butchered in post production. Some scenes simply don't transition properly from one moment to the next. It is flawed in it's emotional delivery, and lacks heavily in character development. It's difficult to feel any emotional attachment to most of the characters as the story goes on. It does have great artwork and good music, but this isn't enough at most times. This is one series that could easily be redone with an hour and a half long movie that would probably work better overall. \\n\\n\r\nI do warn that my next comments are a bit of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER: this story works well with the time travel/alternate universe theme, and I do not feel it lacks in it's explanations of the universe. There are a lot of new things like their G-Monsters (or secrets) that have the cool factor.",

            "content": "Straight 7s all across the board ... minus a 3 in Character. So how do I feel about E7:AO? \r\nI've been a fan of Eureka Seven since I first watched it subbed by Nanashi. It's also been a really long long time since Bones made that. Forgetting E7, let's look at AO for what it actually is.\r\nEureka Seven: AO is less like a drama and barely a romance anime at all. Its entire point lies in family ties and coming of age - which it does... Well. Not great. Well. I did enjoy it's constant change of perspective though, although that's really not a plus- just me being absolutely insane.\\n\\n\r\nThe story encompasses a boy growing up without knowing much of his parents, like the original. Also is picked up by a militant like group designed to fight Coralians, reasonably similar to the original as well. In fact, the first 13 episodes, while lacking on any forms of true development and romance or coherency, are in fact fairly enjoyable. This however becomes a roller-coaster, as a cycle of enjoyment, boredom, followed by bitterness, rinse repeat.\\n\\n\r\nSee, Ao didn't have the same kind of run its predecessor had to tell its story. In fact, it had less than half the episodes. Bones made the decision to come up with a thousand events for this series that could've been awesome but just weren't. In fact, the show pitches around from one thing, to another thing unrelated, then pitches back, then decides it wants to play soccer.\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/n74d7keexalbvpj/ao.png\\n\\n\r\nI'm not kidding.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem really is that Ao could've had a fine story until it gutted any character development, decided to forget plot-lines, decided it wanted to implement a completely confusing time-travel plot, and decided to drop more than 2 -second gag humor. If one took each episode of Ao, added some fun and maybe some actual character development to the story, and really tried fricking hard to reason out the time-traveling thing (I've done it and frankly, the amount of deus ex machina made it basically a moot point), the show would've been that much better. \\n\\n\r\nhttp://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121011063920/eurekaseven/images/7/7c/Quartz-gun.jpg\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just phallic, it changes bloody history! Also it will erase you. *click*\\n\\n\r\nThe story get's a 7 though, despite every actual flaw in it's telling, it's not terrible, (lose Naru though, she went from somewhat interesting to the most annoying and pointless prophet the world will ever know) and the first and last two episodes actually do a good job of sending nostalgia waves through the viewer. It also attempts to explain every thread it abandoned on the way, which is nice, but frankly, it suffers the whole \"24 mins only\" run-time problem, and we all have to just scratch our heads, pause the video, open Descarte, and then proceed to say, \"Ohhhhhh...\" as realization comes flooding in about what was actually just said. Or be me and rewatch the entire series just to remember what they were referencing.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://ghostlightning.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/eureka-seven-ao-noah-reading-pied-piper.jpg\\n\\n\r\nWe like to believe he gets it. Probably does, a lot better than we did in one viewing at least.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, the eyes don't lie, the art was spectacular, the animations fluid, the mechs were beautiful... I scored it a 7 though because frankly, we don't misspell white house as 'white hous' and spell it correctly in the same exact frame of the same episode simultaneously. (episode 18... What the hell man?) Seriously, this is the same studio that did Darker Than Black (which had EXTENSIVE screens and screens of English piled onto a computer monitor, with no misspellings, a sequel with tons of Russian, which I believe is okay, and a ton of Chinese. I think we can hold them to a higher standard.)\\n\\n\r\nSound.... Was good. Nothing truly new, but the sound library did feel decent, atmosphere matched well, music pieces weren't god-awful, and come on, we love it when the Nirvash does it's whole launch sequence, doesn't matter how  bad the show was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the worst of everything. I can honestly say I hated Naru for being a philosophical female dog, despised how the back stories of Elena and Fleur were glanced at and then never brought up again for the rest of the show (okay, like once or twice - but it was so pointless I really didn't care), Ivica was borderline frightening, and Gazelle was... Gazelle? Okay, point is - I don't even know if this show had legitimate villains. Everything just kept going a this breakneck speed that I had no idea who was who and fighting who and oh god this is a mess. Look, Ao has the personality of bread. Whiny, blue bread. With purple dots. I did not give a single damn about Ao (the character) after episode 10, and this continued until the very last episode where he finally develops a personality that isn't the equivalent to: Butthurt Mom Left Me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, that personality change in the last 10 mins of the last episode ALMOST makes me forgive him. But only almost. Seriously, did Naru, Fleur, Elena or any one else even have a point after the Quartz Gun became a thing? Cos frankly, we already went over that that thing takes retroactive continuity and beats you over the head with it and makes you say it's your daddy.\\n\\n\r\nOh and don't get me started on Truth, that guy wasn't a villain at all. HE ACTUALLY HAD MORE BACKSTORY THAN MOST OF THE GODDAMN CAST!!!! By the end of it (prior to episode 23), I was basically hoping he'd kill everyone - and then...\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gt1pl2f0islecg1/hi.png\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm okay with this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment... I have to say - I would've hated this anime - it would've gotten a 4 or 5 if it wasn't for episode 24. It's certainly watchable, and isn't actually that unforgivable, but because it's so dependent on its predecessor without even being good at emulating it, and because it has so few merits of its own it can barely hold onto, the majority of the series left an anguished taste in my mouth... Like eating babies... On fire. I feel like if it had been easier on the terminology, and took more time to explain itself, and CUT ALL THE CRAP THAT ENDED UP NOT MATTERING TO EMBELLISH ON ITS MERITS, it could have been amazing, but it's not. It's passable. And even then, it's predecessor makes it look like a joke.\\n\\n\r\nWatching for what it is - you should watch it if you're a fan of the original, but don't expect much, and really don't buy it. It makes a sub-par show, and while it's better than a ton of garbage people will swear their mother's graves upon, it's just not living up to its name.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 - watch on TV.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://myanimelist.net/profile/eureka822/reviews for the record - this guy actually shares many of my opinions but still scored this show higher than I feel it deserves. Still a valid read.",

            "content": "*Astral Ocean has not yet concluded its run as I write this review and thus I cannot say whether the last five episodes are along the same lines as the rest that will be reviewed.*\r\nEureka Seven Astral Ocean is an interesting series for various reasons. While the parent series, Psalms of Planets, focused on character interaction and psychology (among many other topics) with plot taking the backseat for more than half of it's run, Astral Ocean, which is less than half the amount of the original, has a stronger focus on politics. This makes for fundamentally different plot and character development, and while much ofit is often seen in a  negative light, some of it makes for very good viewing. Before I get into the pros and cons, here is a quick summary.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a boy, Fukai Ao, on his personal journey to find his missing mother. In order to find out more about her, he joins a for-hire organization, Generation Bleu, which fights mysterious creatures called \"Secrets\", which are destroying the world's precious Scub Coral, a valuable resource for an energy termed \"trapar\" (the same from the original series, but in much lower concentrations). The plot deals with various conflicts that surround Ao's life, namely; his (not quite) mysterious parentage and origins, the danger that the Secrets and Scub Coral pose to the world, generational politics in which adults are untrustworthy, and an even more mysterious and dangerous entity named  Truth.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n-Ultimately, the greatest flaw that AO suffers from is time constraints. Unlike the original Eureka Seven, Astral Ocean has a 24 episode run, which means that plot and character development take a dive compared to the scope of the first series.\\n\\n\r\n-As a result of the time constraints, characters in Astral Ocean do not shine as brightly as memorable characters in PoPE7 such as Eureka, Anemone, or Holland. The majority of the characters seem to have little screen time or true importance (such as Gazelle and the smugglers) or are downright boring or generic (some of Team Goldilocks and Truth). However, there are still brilliant moments of characterization interspersed within these examples. Ao and his fellow pilot Elena are good indicators of this, as both are actually very complex characters with interesting reactions.\\n\\n\r\n-Astral Ocean was not meant to be seen weekly. A lot of subtle and important contexts get lost in the week to week wait for the next episode. The episodes thus feel slightly disjointed compared to how they feel in succession. \\n\\n\r\n-The plot devices are not as creative as they could have been; the first half of the series is run in a monster of the week fashion, which then gives way to a plot which borrows heavily from classical sci-fi devices.\\n\\n\r\n-Truth is a very annoying, and know-it-all, villain that embraces all the stereotypes for generic anime villains I can think off, including being flamboyant. Not as interesting or complex as Dewey.\\n\\n\r\n-Occasionally there are visible dips in animation quality, in which, for example, Ao's usually feminine features suddenly change to resemble a burly Elric from FMA Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nNow, clearly AO is a flawed series, but there are far more pros involved that make Astral Ocean a very interesting series to follow.\\n\\n\r\n-The major problems that people have with the series always begins with the sentence, \"It's not as good as the original\". I agree with this statement, to an extent. Yes, Astral Ocean is not a fifty episode epic chronicling the amazing romance of a boy learning to grow up and a girl learning to change herself, it's not particularly good at making you love its characters, and it's not full of the atmosphere that makes one so nostalgic for PoP.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER.\\n\\n\r\nAstral Ocean is very good at what it does aim to do, and what it aims to do is so different to that of the original that while it's easy to compare them, we shouldn't. We don't have a romance of the ages, we don't have a true makeshift family, and we don't have the themes of acceptance and change that made the original so poignant. Instead, Astral Ocean speaks to generational conflict and the ties between families. While the original did actually incorporate both themes, AO puts them on stage and presents them through an absolutely brilliant main character. The politics are very complex and have real world analogies, and they alienate the younger characters from the scheming and untrustworthy adult world. The family dynamics are interesting to watch and shape many of the characters in ways that are very natural and also very thought-provoking in retrospect. The pilot Fleur Blanc and her relationship to her father, as well as Ao's own family, are such examples.\\n\\n\r\n-The production values are wonderful. The color palette is beautiful, the music, by composer Nakamura Koji of Supercar fame, is perfect for the atmosphere. The art is usually top-notch, and the battles, though short, are a treat to watch.\\n\\n\r\n-Ao is one of the most spectacular main characters in recent anime history. To some, he comes off as whiny because of his attachment to his mother, and to others he comes off as boring because he's a no-nonsense type and does what he must when he's asked to. Ao is neither. He is a complex and amazingly developed character. His attachment to his mother, which is a very interesting parallel between himself and Renton Thurston's obsession with his older sister in the original, stems from her unexplained disappearance as well as the fact that she is the only blood relative he has ever known. He also identifies with her as an outcast, as both he and his mother were shunned from the island in which he was born. The resulting feelings and resolve are very realistic, and poor Ao has some of the most pitiable circumstances regarding his family outside of being downright abandoned. When Ao is not dealing with his mother complex, he is a very serious character, which might be the reason why he doesn't quite resonate with viewers. However, after a many truly whiny and annoying or useless main character in mecha, Ao is a breath of fresh air. He fights when he is told to, he does what must be done even if it means defying orders, he does not break down and run away from his problems. He might doubt himself or his orders, but sooner or later he tells himself he can and will do what is asked of him. The boy has what most mecha characters lack; a backbone and a no-nonsense resolve. This trait brings Ao into some truly interesting moral divides, and tests both his sense of what's right as well as that resolve.\\n\\n\r\n-There are a great many superb references, both to the original series as well as to other franchises, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Elena, the resident otaku character, is usually the one to bring these up, although Ao himself is a great reference to some of the most memorable E7 scenes and characters.\\n\\n\r\n-While Truth isn't the greatest villain in the world, there is no denying that the plot is interesting to follow. There is no clear good side or evil side; even though I state that Truth is a villain, he is more of the antagonist instead, rather how Anemone and Dominic worked against Eureka and Renton but were not actually bad themselves. In fact, AO runs a bit like a free-for-all battle in which various sides have various agendas and everyone believes themselves justified. As a real world allegory, this is particularly intriguing.\\n\\n\r\n-While the big picture feel of AO may not seem that great, it's important to understand the series as a whole rather than as separate episodes as well as to appreciate small moments of characterization, symbolism, conversation, and interaction in order to get the true scope of and appreciate what is happening and why.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nAstral Ocean is a great series to follow, and while it is hindered by time constraints as well as the fact that it's related to an epic makes it feel underwhelmed, the fact remains that one should not judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree. On its own, AO is at the very least decent and at its best superb for what it's trying to do. It is still fun, engaging, and well worth watching, and while you won't get as attached to its characters as you did with the parent series, at the very least Ao himself is someone worth rooting for.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven is the first Bones original work I've seen, and quite simply it was one of the best 50-episode anime I've seen to date (Last Exile comes close). From its brilliant planning and execution, to excellent visuals and soundtrack, to solid plot and characters, it was a quintessential \"boy meets girl\" sci-fi/giant robot show.\r\nSo naturally I was excited when AO was announced, and I started watching. The first few episodes weren't too bad, but as the show progressed the characters didn't seem to mesh with the story. Without spoiling the story, here's an example: Ao sees something about Naru that shocked him at theend of one episode, and the next episode he's off fighting Secrets as though that shocking revelation never happened-- there wasn't a single moment of hesitation or doubt, and up to that point Ao was depicted as every bit the impulsive teenager Renton was. You'd think he'd defy orders to go find Naru instead of dutifully blowing up Secrets! Whether a result of poor planning or poor writing, such a disconnect is simply unacceptable in a series that depends on a cohesive narrative, much less a drama with complex political intrigue. I remarked at that point, \"If the production crew wants to kill off Naru, this is a really good way of going about it.\"\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, it seemed as though the staff felt that hiding the connections to the first series behind hints until the last possible moment would be a great way to either entice viewers to keep watching, or pleasantly surprise them. But as it turns out, the plot is heavily dependent on Eureka Seven, and the latter half of the show is comprised partly of a mad dash to reveal all of the connections. Putting the direct connections to the first series at the beginning would've been predictable and only half as dramatic, but at least the rest of the series wouldn't be a confusing mess I would need to re-watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue lies in the setting. Time travel is a tempting plot device for many a sci-fi writer, and as the Star Trek franchise demonstrated many times, it is not a device to be taken lightly, because it is so easy for the story to get out of control. Sadly, AO falls into the same snare, and evidently the writer's solution to a story inconsistency or plot hole is to blast it out of knowledge with a big ray gun. I've seen my share of deus ex machina, but this was in-your-face enough for me to stop watching the series. Would things have been different had Dai Sato been in charge of the series' story? Possibly, but unfortunately that's not how it worked out.\\n\\n\r\nYet another problem is with characterization. I never got a chance to really get into Ao's head the way I was able to with Renton-- those internal monologues were there for a very good reason, after all. Likewise, I was never given much of a chance to really grasp the motivations of pretty much the entire cast of characters-- or, whatever attempt to do so was lost on me and other viewers. Whether because AO's staff decided to focus more on visual action or to subordinate character development to the plot, the end result is a marionette show, superficially entertaining but lacking in substance. As a result, whatever conflicts that are portrayed are largely pointless or lost.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all bad, of course. The action scenes are some of Bones' finest visual work, the performance of the cast was engaging and dynamic despite the writing, and the soundtrack didn't get in the way of the experience. But if the goal was to tell another story in the Eureka Seven universe worthy of the predecessor, this series was a disappointment to me.",

            "content": "Story\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nWhat It Should Have Been\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA lot of viewers will tell you that a sequel to Eureka seveN was near impossible. However, I completely disagree with this notion. Eureka seveN AO could have gone in two very plausible directions.\r\nI. A sequel based on the artwork from DVD Vol. 12:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Eureka-Seven-Vol-Episodes-47-50/dp/B00114UUKY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439064718&sr=8-1&keywords=eureka+seven+dvd+12\r\nIn this picture, there are essentially two worlds: the above-ground and below-ground, as I've taken to calling them. The plethora of questions posed by this image (since the image is canon to the end of Eureka seveN) could easily make for a new series:\r\n1. Is there political turmoil between above-grounders and below-grounders?\r\n2. If this takes place far inthe future, are Coralian-Human hybrid descendants common and do they face discrimination like the Vodarac?\\n\r\n3. How different are the cultures of lifters (above-grounders) and surfers (below-grounders), since below ground there is no trapar?\\n\\n\r\nThe Eureka seveN universe is so detailed, there should have been no problem creating a chronological sequel to it.\\n\\n\r\nII. A *prequel* based on the events detailed in episode 47 of Eureka seveN. 10,000 years before Eureka seveN, humans were attacking the Scub Coral. We used jets to try bombing it, and I wouldn't doubt it if we used nukes.\\n\\n\r\nIn this context, the Scub Coral as the true enemy would have made perfect sense, especially when fighting these creepy things: http://eurekaseven.wikia.com/wiki/Antibody_Coralians Get rid of the Secrets and Quartz, and we would have had an amazingly anime that built on the canon. There are more than enough questions to sustain a prequel, such as:\\n\\n\r\n1. What, in graphic detail, happened to humans as they fought the Scub?\\n\r\n2. How did the humans build the ships that took them off the planet, and how did they survive out in space for 10,000 years?\\n\r\n3. How many humans were left behind to be killed/absorbed by the Scub?\\n\\n\r\nSadly, I've reached my Limit of Questions for this section, but as you can see, there was obviously a lot of missed potential with this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat It Actually Was\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe plot was incredible sporadic. Never is there any consistency in the characters who make random choices that are not explained, or that really even matter. I can't really elaborate without *many* spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt was nothing impressive. It just took from the same Eureka seveN art style, tried to change things up in a special way, and failed.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nIf you look up Eureka seveN AO OST on Amazon, you get the OST for Eureka Seven, 'nuff said:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=eureka+seven+ao+ost\\n\\n\r\nThe music was so terrible in this anime; not in that the music was bad, but because it didn't evoke the raw emotions that music in Eureka seveN did.

When does a character actually change in the inside, as opposed to the outside? Sure, some characters get different outfits, but the same underlying characters don't change. And then you have a character that has a different outfit, and did not used to be the same character, but it is very poorly explained. You have explained but unexplained romances in the series. There are times when it pretends to be a harem... and then ignores any relationships between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nDid I enjoy one of my favorite animes of all time being butchered a SECOND time after it was previously butchered by a terrible movie?

            "content": "Ok so, I watched Eureka Seven several days before watching this sequel and as many people may already have guessed, i'm pretty disappointed. I expected the same faimly friendly, coziness, empowering feel that I got from Eureka Seven but that wasn't the case at all.\r\nStory: 5\r\nNow in the beginning it was simliar to Eureka Seven where a regular boy now has to pilot/co-pilot an IFO (Mechas they frequently use in the series) and it felt pretty nice to see that. The next few episodes were used to introduce the main and supporting characters. They were pretty boring and generic at first and the only onewho stood out was that one tan girl (but that's besides the point) The way they describe how politics are working will turn some people off from this series. I had to go on the wikia to understand who and what each political party wanted and what was their reason for even existing (kinda spoiled the big plot twist in the series for myself in doing so :/) Anyways basically the series has a problem with how they explain big points in the series, especially when in the beginning and end of the series. It's very confusing what they're saying half the time and you often have to rewatch that scene twice or three times to understand. The pacing was pretty ok, its was a little slow in the beginning, picked up a lot in the middle of the series with a bunch of action and things that actually progress the plot and the end of series was ok as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was probably one of the only consistent things about this anime. It was simple and done properly throughout the series. So it wasn't spectacular but it wasn't bad either. Animation was pretty smooth as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI took note of the background music because of how well it meshed together with the scene at hand. I think the OST was pretty well done. The music always just made the scenes fill with more emotions, whether they be positive or negative.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\n his was easily one of the weak points of this show. Most characters were there just to fill a spot in the ohw. They had no real purpose and tried to have real melodramatic moments but it just didn't work. The main character I felt went through a lot of struggle but to learn nothing really. We see no change in his personality and no one else really. Whenever there was change though, it seemed hella forced. Another thing this show does is give characters so way of magically knowing information and not telling the viewer how they know this. just so the story can progress and doesn't explain how they figure it out.  It was nice to see some characters from Eureka Seven though (the feels were real)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\n Even though it seems I've been bashing this anime so far, I did enjoy some moments. Very few but did enjoy some. The animation during most of the fights were pretty nice. The last few episodes were very enjoyable just because of reasons I can't spoil. Other places of enjoyment were the little comedic moments from time to time. Didn't happen often but I did crack a few laughs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.5-6\\n\r\n In comparison to the prequel, AO is nothing in comparison really, the main goal of the series is all over the place, main characters doesn't really grow and the supporting characters doesn't help because all they do is fill roles and spout nonsense. The music and animation were solid though. And the feels at the end of the series were just... something I can't explain.",

The series starts off slow in the first episode but quickly picks up to a fast paced and well choreographed action scenes that have thus far managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. There always seems to be a \"oh, and just one more thing!\" moment in all of the fights that I didn't see coming.\r\nBones does well and doesn't let up evenfor a second, even with green streams flying across the screen. All episodes so far have kept up appearances with a lot of help from the music which is simply to say... astounding. The sound atmosphere that's created by the combination of guitars, drums and orchestral instruments creates an amazingly cheerful and eerie atmosphere throughout. For once we get to see larger parts of the E7 universe while still managing to keep focus on the characters oh so well. Bones have pulled it off again, even giving an amazing personality to an AI with very little screen time.\\n\\n\r\nI have no doubt that the combination of an astounding main cast, amazing atmosphere created by the brilliant animation and amazing sound, characters that are deep at face value and the ever-expanding E7 universe will keep me screaming for more every week.\\n\\n",

Its DAYS by flow in a different key. There is no nostalgia they literally took the core progressions of the first song and put them in the new one. Im notsure if there is an awesome FLOW rap in this second one like there was in DAYS but  play both opening themes back to back and they will end up sounding the exact same.

            "content": "Eureka 7 AO has a rather low average rating and ranking here on MAL. I think this is pretty sad, because AO really is a quite good series.\r\nThis review is an ontake to explaining why I think it is, despite understandably falling flat for so many prequel fans as it does.\r\nTHIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. \r\nSpecific spoilers start from in the second half of the characters section onwards. I generally mostly focused on some punctual highlightings of aspects/scenes. \r\nIn a nutshell I'd say, whether this show is enjoyable or not depends, to a very vast degree on just how much of what you liked the originalEureka 7 prequel and the expectations come out based on that.\\n\r\nThis is where this show's major misfortune lies in: This season is a direct sequel. And it is made as such. Even though half the show doesn't look outright like it, it is and any entry about the anime will mark it as such. It also expects you to have watched the prequel, because it doesn't waste time on reiterating what happened there. But AO's tone, themes and purpose are only about as similiar as Eureka 7 and Bone's other show Rahxephon are.\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 is the story of Renton, a 14 year naive childish idealist, a somewhat rebellious brat in puberty admiring the cool and seeking adventures. Somebody who knows nothing of the world, but would like to be taken for a grown up man, would like to not stand in the shadow of the glory of his heroic father. He is all together rather devoid of proper worries and thus falls head over heels at first fight rather innocently. Through the course of the show he learns about the complexity of the world of not just the humans but beyond it. The story follows him on his way to maturity, triggered by his romance to Eureka - who starts at about the right opposite of his character. It's a love story, a pretty classical hero's journey and gets a Sci-Fi war setting poured over it while preaching the universal values of peace, mutual understanding and coexistance.\\n\\n\r\nEureka 7 Ao is the story of Ao, a barely 13 year old boy, grown up as a scapegoat of political and superstitious discrimination, with no knowledge of his father, with a mother branded as evil and who vanished every since he was three years old. Ao has just about only two people dear to him, that care for him, two who have to suffer collateral damage due to him. He has any reason for scorn against this world that treats him badly out of no reason that he had a play with. He already knows and realizes a lot of what is going wrong in the world and the heaviness of not being able to do anything about it. Nonetheless he stands upright to the values taught to him by his old foster doctor grandfather, even if nobody would thank him and already makes responsible decisions right at the beginning and works his best to cope with the burdens that come with that. All the while a lot of it is quite heavy on him as he is still the child of 13 years old. Ao's story is that of a lonely boy trying to regain and protect the little that is dear to him by using what means he has and clinging to a vague hope of finding his mother again. It's about him finding a place where he truly can be at home despite his complicated mixed heritage. And, even if there are some slight romantic inklings - This is not a love story. It's also not a hero's journey.\\n\\n\r\nDoes that sound any much similiar to you?\\n\\n\r\nIf you start AO expecting a second E7, AO is pretty much doomed to fail. And unfortunately most will just do that, simply because it's the direct sequel show. The chances of somebody who didn't watch E7 to watch AO are probably very low. And the chances of someone did not like E7 starting AO is probably not much higher either. (How many would bother to sit through 50 episodes of it's prequel just for a sequel you mostly only hear about how most fans jolt it out into the trash bin?)\\n\r\nUnless you are perhaps like me starting the season out of some questionable reason like really just wanting to know whether or not they cleaned up the horrible moon graffiti.\\n\r\nYes, you inferred that right. I disliked the original E7. It has good production values, a very good illustrious soundtrack and a really great and interesting complex setting, which however felt completely wasted onto the cast. I found most of the cast (and especially Renton) absolutely obnoxious. They grew to be a bit less so later on, but not quite enough to me. And seeing those I'm not even cheering for being presented as the righteous \"winners\" who proved their ideals and love, felt rather unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThis is were the second major punch of this sequel towards original E7 lovers comes in: AO invalidates the pathos of E7.\\n\r\nThe crux of the show is basically, Renton and Eureka did what they did in E7 and it looked all happy, peaceful and optimistic. Happy ending, whatever comes, they'd be just fine, right? But it turns out, they actually messed up. Despite all the best intentions, whatever they fought for turns out to be probably not really the best and to some degree an outright bad decision after all. And that is the cause of anything that happens in AO.\\n\r\nWhoever thought that invalidating a happy ending was a good idea - it definitely is daring. Some will find it pointless to downright outrageous. But personally I find that almost pretty genius and lacking in precedence. Of course I enjoy that fact all the more because I loathed the TV ending of E7. Which appearantly wasn't even supposed to be as obnoxiously corny of a happy ending, given the Last Order or the Manga adaption's alternate ending.\\n\\n\r\n--- Setting ---\\n\r\nE7 was a far in the future world, making it an own world of unique fantastical flair. AO is set in a near future world of ours, year 2025, only 13 years away from when the show aired. It doesn't have so much fantastical illustrious novel landscapes but is pretty down to earth. As such it dabbles a good deal in real life (money) politics. \\n\r\nI think this is worth mentioning, since most people probably don't seem to pick onto this. It's really a lot more enjoyable, if you can pick up on some background on some of those conflicts. Given though it's mostly focused on politics with Japan in the mix, so references of political conflics of the US vs. some moslem state may feel superficial for Western audiences, while that's probably really just about as much as Japanese on their remote island would realistically care over happenings on the other side of the globe. \\n\r\nOkinawa is an island group in Japan. Naru's garb's pattern is that of a native traditional clothing from there. Okinawa is part of Japan, but there is an independent movement going on for a while already and in that political issue Americans and Chinese play a hand. It's not pulled out and utterly explained to death, but it does give the location a very clear sign of territory. I haven't seen that particular setting in any other anime. \\n\r\nThe Okinawian setting is also where Ao's \"anma\" for calling his mother comes from. Since it reccurs it also serves as a further charactarization for Ao, who was born there, is also a child of the island and does once state, he loved the island, even if it never really offered a place for him to be there. \\n\r\nI think the the whole island setting is quite beautifully written with all sorts of little subtle things. Other territories also show up, the world is pretty global which gives quite a nice variety of locations. \\n\r\nWhat is a bit shorthanded through - as in most anime - is a complete lack of actually spoken dialects. The Okinawa folks speak normal Japanese as do all the obvious non-Japanese characters in the show. There is also a rather clear avoidance of any shown language barriers, but these also don't appear too abnormal either, since Ao or the other children don't really interact much outside of their social circle and those who do, are all adults with negotiation responsibilities who ought to have no such language barriers. I vastly prefer this workaround over massively hilariously failing Engrish (or doitsu/furansu) insertions. \\n\\n\r\n--- Visuals ---\\n\r\nThe show is animated well above average for a TV Show. Every episode does offer enough material to really draw out a lot of chances to make it shine. There is always some action of some sort happening in every episode, but there are also calmer moments in which subtle character interactions and gestures shine. Beautiful landscapes and various locations around the world give way for beautiful backgrounds. There are a number of mystery scenes which give way for colour plays and directing choices. There are even some dementia-ish episodes with a completely diffrent directing. While they may feel like monster of the week so some or very much disjointed (despite the contents relating to character themes), they were a visual feast to look at. There is also not all that much gory/bloody shock effect shown. Ao realizes the meaning of life and death even without a close up on some ripped off human arm rubbed into his face.\\n\r\nThe colours are also more vibrant than E7. It also seems to fuller use the whole spectrum of the palette much more than E7 TV did. \\n\\n\r\n--- Audio ---\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. It's however definitely not a Sato Naoki score anymore. His E7 scores are mostly dramatically suspenseful or depicting some fantastical landscape with a sense of majestic epic grandness, which sure fit E7's Scub lanscapes and its pathos nicely. Koji Nakamura's score feels more grounded and subtle, a sense of subtle mystery, playfulness, \"reality with a tint of fantasy\" and complexity which fits this show really well. It's also still quite E7, given that the E7 score also features tracks that he had created. One old E7 track also makes a short comeback, when Renton enters the show again creating a nice contrast between old and new. All of the tracks have been really well used with their scenes, but even listening to them on their own they feel like telling a story.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting does a very good job, too. All the children do sound some 5 years older than their actual age, but they are also in more responsible positions. Eureka does feel a bit off, since she sounds like she does in E7 and that felt to me a bit too young to downright juvenile, than the age she now should have. A bit of a chuckle comes from Renton now having the voice of Holland.\\n\\n\r\n--- English dub ---\\n\r\nThe voices have been pretty well choosen and their tone colours fit their japanese counterparts very nicely. Being able to understand Japanese, I can't say it sounded all that less natural or stiff than the Japanese version already did simply by being Anime. Some nuances get lost, like Ao's Okinawian Anma, which has been dubbed as simply mother. (But still appears just like that in the subs.) The dub script generally looks pretty good. There is just one thing that jumped at me. There is a scene in which some hold the enemy and urge Ao to shoot. He says he can't just shoot them all (\"minna\") with the enemy, it gets translated to that he can't shoot his \"friends\". Which is just wrong, especially given that he never had any real interaction with those people that he would call them his friends. (He doesn't even call the ones in his team like that.)\\n\\n\r\nAside that I had an impression that the music/sound track vs. dialogue track in the dub was louder than in the Japanese dub. Sometimes (especially with black Georgs computer voice coming in with some static noise) it felt like the dialogue was drowning in background sounds somewhat. \\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Characters ---\\n\r\nI think it's pretty important to note that AO has a far diffrent characterization approach than E7. E7's character handling was far more explicitly extroverted (to overdramatized) and took it on to force the other character (and the viewer) into feeling something. Which has a point, since communication on some equal footing was the goal of the Scubs and a rather robotic and alien Coralian Eureka had to learn about emotions on the journey to become humanlike. She didn't get it, unless it was extroverted and clear, so immature Renton knowing almost no behaviour restraint was the perfect fit for it. It was one of the core themes around which everything in E7 was built. AO doesn't have this as a main theme at all. AO's plot is driven by human relationship contellations and politics. If in E7 Holland is a jerk to Renton, angry you should get at him. Anemone is a tragic victim, so pity you should feel for her and disdain for her tormetors. AO doesn't force it up as much. Nobody is outright blatantly evil. No action is all that bad from all angles. They just mostly all putting themselved before others, even if they know it's probably not the best and right thing to do. But everybody does that and there is no real reason not to, so they continue to do that. That makes the show more serious and realistic befitting the more real-world-like setting. The show also makes this really clear from the beginning, when the sister of one of Gazelle's group tries to sell off Ao to the Americans for a lot of money and weakly justifies herself in an empty room. \\n\r\nThat is not to say though that communicating and expressing ones wishes and feelings isn't still there, but it's it's pretty subdued. Everbody puts up some front, but everybody also has reasons to not disclose them so easily or talk about them, even if they wanted, because it would just not be proper or disadvantageous to do so. That approach is also evident from the first episode, as Naru verbally robs Ao of any right to feel bad over his life. (If that style sounds a bit like an Neon Genesis Evangelion characterization style approach, it probably does. But Ao is quite opposite of this whiny pressimitic emo boy shying away from any sort of responsibility as Shinji, whom you'd like to give some good slaps.)\\n\r\nI think the contrast between the two characterization styles becomes most notable, when a certain former titular E7 protagonist enters the stage again halfway though the show and pretty much acts excatly like in E7. It's like she is absolutely overreacting and overdramatising and annoyingly lovey dovey, feelings showing way to clearly on her face over just anything. It wasn't out of place in E7. But imo it felt quite alien in AO. So if one liked that extroverted style and expect it from AO as well, everbody in Ao is doomed to feel bland. Because they don't make it as obvious or simply go out there and scream out everything on their mind all the time. The show's first arc even concludes with Ao scornful over his unlucky fate, but then realizing that getting angry or running away really changes nothing. His feelings are still there through rippling out on all sorts of occasions. - With that in mind, I found this characterization style great. It's a \"show it, don't say it\" style and if you take a closer look, you will get a good deal of subtle facial expressions, visual tone variations, colour plays, little lines and gestures, that betray some complicated emotions. Also some really great scenes as people  hestitantly disclose inklings of their true feelings as a token of trust. And yes there are also situations with \"they really should just properly talk their minds to each other\" that may gnaw on some peoples patience. But the show makes a good effort in displaying, why it is so and that the \"properly\" part is tricky. As in a lot of cases that people would not accept it, because they are weak, selfish or because things are so out there, they would only be downright unbelievable to their peers. \\n\\n\r\nFor instance look at how Naru and Ao start. They are childhood friends. One pitiful boy growing up hated by everybody because he is diffrent, with no place on the island and one pitiful girl sick because of the Scubs and probably not going to live long. She defends him from the other islanders. He helps her out given her sickly condition. Who is off worse than the other? It's a fragile equilibrium of support between them, which gets disrupted as Ao leaves the island after having protected it. But he becomes special due to exactly what caused his pitiful circumstances. She gets left behind, because there is nothing left she can do for him anymore as others are more competent in helping him out of his circustances. Until she herself also becomes special due exactly what made her life miserable in the first place. And in constrast to Ao who does it out of a sense of responsibility she embraces it wholeheartedly right away. Also much to Aos chagrin, since the one who opened the doors to her happens to be his enemy. They both continue with a sense of paternalism towards each other. Ao at some point realizes, that none of them have changed their former outview towards each other much at all. But just knowing it doesn't necessarily change it. They even have a talk, but it ends up being an awkward talk solving nothing, because they never really truly talked to each other. Which is subsequently brilliantly shown as Naru angrily exclaims, she does not want to be just protected by Ao, but be his equal. - While doing the same as her accusation herself. Still both are convinced of doing the right thing. While it just turns out, they both aren't right either when a new perspective is added. Because there wasn't a really completely right thing in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has to be said through, AO obviously only has 24 episodes. There is by far not as much screentime to develop supporting characters or \"1-2 exclusive episode characters\" as in E7. Characters like those from Team Harlequin, with which Ao barely interacts with, don't get backstory at all. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. E7 was character driven, AO is far less so and feels more tight and with less distraction than E7. The story follows Ao and everybody whom he deals with more closely and whom he gets to know better is explored. In reality you also don't know so much about your neighbour three blocks away, whom you from time to time happen to see on the street, do you? But that doesn't mean, they aren't able to appear as people and to possibly still affect your life some way or another even without you seeing excepts and summaries on their lifes.\\n\r\nThere is some great handling about a mentor side character. He gets quickly introduced and killed off about just as quickly. Neither the viewer nor Ao never really gets to see much of him alive except like two lines of dialogue. Ao ends up visiting his to be vacated room after his death. There is some unspoken great characterization to be had from his bookshelfs and wall notes about this character we never got to know, never will, but still get an idea of. And this total foreigner still brought a realization and emotional impact to Ao, giving way for an understanding for support characters that did have relashionships with him, as his loss affects them even more. We don't get to know whatever they have lived through together in their own special dedicated episodes. But that's just fine, too. We do get see how their unknown past shape their present actions and how those affect Ao.\\n\\n\r\n--- Plot ---\\n\r\nEven if it is a spoiler, I think it really is good to know beforehand: This show has parallel universes, time travel and timeline resets. The latter two are pretty much the same way as the time machine and D-Mails in Steins;Gate if the reference helps out. \\n\r\nWhat however is prone to make it a bit confusing at first sight: the parallel universes are not the parallel universes as in the known parallel universe time travel concept. There is some travel between universes. But that happens literally between a slightly similiar, but completely seperate universes. It looks like they are jumping from the E7 12000 something AD to its own past of year 2025 at first, but that's not the case. It's World E (the E7 universe) and there is World A (AO universe) and they happened to be somewhat similiar, but aren't the same and from World E it happens to be possible to jump to any time point of World A. (As explained as \"space and time are the same\" for the Scubs.) Any time travel and world reset stuff all happen within World A. World E isn't the setting at all and except for some cameo scenes and a dialogue line everything remains unknown. This parallel universe concept as it is does get explained verbally once in the last episode. Before that there are numerous little hints showing it, as are the time travel and resets hints, but at least I missed them when airing on air, since numerous weeks later I'd all forgotten about the details, so the last third became a trainwreck to me. When it actually wasn't as I realized upon a rewatch.\\n\r\nThe show looks messy, but the pieces really do fall into place if you watch it attentively and then continuity issues disappear, too. Save for the 2 minute epilogue scene (which got remade to a full final episode years later) there is also no extra unnatural \"the characters already know that, but the viewer doesn't so let's explain it once more even though we all know it already!\" sort of exposition dialogue. This is great, but also means, nothing is served on a silver tablet.\\n\\n\r\nThe major general hurt point about this show's plot is admittingly that the original E7 universe is something we learn almost nothing about in this series. And the little we do know is adressed in some 3 minute explanation exposition in the last episode and some mysterious flashbacks (which never get further explained, but do indicate something went really awry in their world, too.) Given that anybody coming from E7 was waiting to see more of E7, what became of the world and the old characters and not getting what they expected, it's understandable they felt betrayed. But do make no wrong assumptions: This show is about Ao. From the old cast Eureka is the only one who really gets to have screentime. Renton gets a last episode show up and that's it.  \\n\r\nIt admittingly also doesn't help, that one of the narratives biggest initial driving mechanisms is a massive mystery box around \"What the heck is up with Eureka? How did she end up in this time/place? Why is she alone? Where is Renton?\" with all of the mysterious flashbacks of Ao of his lone mother and her being gone. It definitely is also intentional bait. And surely it did attract the most attention. But it never really gets focused on all that much. It gets resolved, but to the viewer the resolution feels short and unexplored as any of it is narrated, implied and not explicitly shown with a want for more been shown. Within the context of the show that actually feels very natural. Those two old characters are basically foreigners to the cast of AO whom the viewer is following. They would know nothing about them and any information will come from whatever those two outright tell them. And they don't say much. Eureka doesn't because she literally has no time to do so (and she has so see to some time line continuity) and Renton, because he doesn't even try. Because it's probably to painful to talk over his guilt and pain and as he wants to overwrite the world after all, so whatever talk there is would get erased in his agenda anyway. As a result, those two will mention stuff, that's evident to them and the E7 viewer (Nirvash, Mechas with souls, Archetype, Coralians, Limit of Questions...), without much of an explanation, but it only throws any of AO's characters into understandable puzzlement. To most viewers coming from E7 it probably feels like bad teasing.\\n\\n\r\nI also think there is also something about the basic point of the show, that many don't like. It's not about love, catharsis, not about getting a peaceful cooexistance and not fight, about having fun and getting happy as E7 had and which are universally successful themes. (And it doesn't seem to me like as if the creators didn't consider it, but intentionally chose not to.) In Ao it's mostly about guilt and resposibility. About decisions to be made in a complex net of interests and how they could turn out to be completely wrong. As I mentioned before: The whole show's happenings are set in gear by how Eureka and Renton in E7, despite the happy ending there, had actually screwed up. And so they try to fix it. Almost everybody has something in need to fixed up. Naru wants to fix up the world, as she got herself fixed up by accepting the Scubs. Fleur is guilty over her mother's death and own survival and in need of fixing up her relashionship with her father. Rebecka about her past deeds in media manipulation. Ivica over his deeds in the war and follow up resolve to never let children die again. The Okinawa folks for being so weak despite boasting their (actual fake) independence. Gazelle, who wants to do better than his father. The Japanese who want more political power as does about any other state. Elena who thinks she is in a wrong world and flees into Otaku escapism most of the time. Truth who also feels out of place of the world and clings towards the world as it was before the Scubs came, which at the same time would also end his own miserable existance. Ao, who tries to cope between, what he can do, should do, can justify before himself to (not) do and what he wants to do, all the while he is gradually more than just slightly overexerting himself. Everybody is in want and need for something. - And then pops up some omnipotent world resetting device that can fullfil wishes. \\n\r\nBut getting one thing fixed breaks another thing. Quite some responsibility and I do think the show makes a point in showing what this means. It also blends in really well with Ao's own character theme of finding a place where he belongs and his increasing doubts over if he really is somebody bringing only misfortune to others as everybody has ever blamed him for. He just got started getting along with Cloe, resetting the world has erased her team from his daily life. They are still alive and happy, but he is not amiss in their life, while left along with his memories of a now nonexistant timeline and nobody whom he can share that pain with. And moreover that omnipotent device sure makes situations go awry. Everybody would naturally want it and situations escalate quickly. And there is still his own wish of getting to be with his mother again. Should he use it? At what unknown cost? In the end he does, because the alternatives are even worse. And he does so by fixing up as many things up for the people whom he knew. He looses everything, but everyone whom he cares lives a nicer life. Without him. That surely isn't a cheesy happy ending as in E7.\\n\r\nAt that I really recommend the \"Final Episode\" ONA, it gives a really good roundabout that even if he decided to do it, it came with considerable pain and it also is much more positively rewarding as he gets to get a happy ending despite having lost so much.\\n\\n\r\nAside that, there is quite some fun to be had through mostly Elena. There are a number of Otaku-culture references and self-referencing in line jokes from the creators themselves. Things like the scene in which they are in space and they stand on silicon with Elena saying \"Zero gravity is hard to animate after all.\" In-series she makes one of her random eccentric remarks, outside of it it's a pretty witty meta-joke. There is even a scene in the last third, where some director of an in-series anime exclaimes that even of the show gets duped prematurely out of reasons that don't even have to do with its proper quality or due to a misinterpretation over what they were trying to tell with it, he is still all passionate about doing it. Given they bothered doing a full new final episode after 4 years to a show that gets dissed and rejected as much as this one, it does feel like a real statement. And there is Naru and Ao talking in \"private\" with an eavesdropping family including her sister exclaiming whenever the kiss is finally supposed to come, while that it's the last thing to expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--- Overall ---\\n\r\nI don't think the show was really messy, nor as if the creators had no clue what they wanted. It's also not really any worse paced than E7. (E7's last third also brushed over a lot of setting explanations rather quickly.) This shows one true major handicap is, that it's written so, that it expects you to have watched the original E7 and having been marketed mostly towards E7 fans, despite it trying and being really very much diffrent. This could have been avoided, by giving Eureka and Renton (or anybody else with knowledge) more chances of appearing and explaining in-series what had relevant things have happened in E7 leading up to their actions in AO and thus making the series accessable for complete newcomers and market it as its own independant story. As it is it doesn't really get through to the target audience, who would have enjoyed the show. \\n\r\nThere is an in-series argument between Renton and Ao at the end of the show. Renton argues that only one (Nirvash with an archetype), the original, is needed and negates Ao's. But Ao has come so far as having his own by then and so he has what it takes to stand on equal ground in a fight against Renton.\\n\r\nPerhaps I just randomly see some meta implication here. But it fits hilariously well. A lot of those who dissed the show, had even made jokes over that dialoge piece back in the days, agreeing with Renton. When in the show he's comes off more like a narrow minded stubborn dork who doesn't want to listen, trying to escape his responsibility by erasing the mistake instead of dealing with it. But isn't that actually really sad? Dismissing that AO also has its own powerful merits just because he's an offspring that's diffrent than its predecessor?\\n\r\nBut perhaps the announced remake movie trilogy might fix it up. The trailer sure looks more sober, serious and mature than the original E7. Are they going to make the prequel more like the sequel? Will they really dare to make immature Renton be less obnoxious? Or does that end up being just some bait again? Probably something in the middle. But I'm really crossing my fingers for a version with more likable E7 characters. And perhaps a moon cleanup.\\n",

            "content": "So, eureka seven ao....Fuck. Its like being a halo 3 /cod 4 veteran then picking up halo:reach/cod mw3. You just wonder after so long, what happened.\r\nLet's start with a brief summary of the predecessor, my verdict: \"Jizztastic\" i was like 8 when i watched it. On YTV canada, Gundam Seed (wait 4 E7) then Eureka Seven. It just simply made my week. Why was it so good, I can summarize it with just one word: CREATIVITY. The scenario, the plot, the design, culture, feel, the environment, it was just so \"different\" but interesting and exciting. It made me want to be apart of that awesomeplace. There is also CHARACTER i can name almost every single eureka seven character (even supporting or only shown in 1 episode). MUSIC = still makes me listen to TRANCE (form of techno used in eureka seven) over HOUSE any day. Even if you scraped out the romance part of it, it would still be a great show. The romance made it better :D. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for eureka seven ao. First of all the only reason people are still watching the show untill ep 21 is because they want to see the rebirth of the OG characters THATS ALL. But Why? Well, first of all or at least a big chunk of the characters are full of shit (excuse my language). They are as creative as grey mush, there is no sympathy for them, expect for Christopher Blanc (RESPECT). Secondly, ENVIRONMENT, earth, japan, USA, 3rd party company... SNORE, ZZZ, c'mon bones no one wants a story based on boring old earth, we live in it for christ sake. What happened to that mixture of \"urban, futuristic yet very natural\" feel :'( . Theres useless drama between the characters which as i mentioned before are boring as **** so no one cares. Sound and Art is amazing no doubts about that BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE SAME STYLE AS E7. The story is alright, good progression, and keeps you asking questions BECAUSE THEY ARE RELATED TO THE OG CHARACTERS. \\n\\n\r\nEverything that eureka seven ao changed made it suck, like characters and environment. But when it comes to Sound, Art, Story its great because they played it safe and STUCK TO THE PROGRAM. But without character development and a fresh new environment (like in OG E7) it just made the series suck. The ONLY reason i still watch this show is because it has EUREKA SEVEN plastered on it, and I really want to see eureka, renton, nirvash, etc.., etc.. Besides that everyone else (New E7 AO characters) can burn in a molting pool of lava, I would laugh more than cry. The only thing that can really put its series on the right direction is a really damn good ending (with all OG characters) or a season 2 where they can fix their shit, and put themselves toeghter. And mech design, was soo much better in E7 (my opinion :D)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion WTF happened.\\n",

And as I said, I'm totally disappointed...\nStory: 1\nIt's all messed up, I'm serious, it's a real black and white contrast from the original which focused more in the story than all the fireworks. Even though the moon writing thing in the original is pretty cheesy but I can't help just to giggle and felt really happy for Renton and Eureka, even anemone x dominic couple still manage to put tears to myeyes. On the other hand I don't really remember anything from Ao's story, just pretty much the last part, and even that still manages to get on my nerves.\\n\\n\nArt: 7\\n\nBones studio really did a great job on this department. beautiful animation. But somewhat it started to degrade midway and suddenly beautiful again at probably 3 to 4 last episodes. The original had a very consistent animation all the way through, even on the \"filler\" episodes.\\n\\n\nSound: 9\\n\nSound was great and original. Really enjoyed pretty much all the OPs &amp; EDs for this series.\\n\\n\nCharcter: 1\\n\nThere are pretty much 0 character development, Ao did not grew or find love or did something, he just did some gun firing. Fleur and Elena pretty much stopped being main characters after 7 or 8 episodes and they started to introduce random backup characters who played a somewhat big role but never really felt right. I had high hopes with Naru but she failed me miserably, I really hoped that she became the good girl and really helps Ao and becomes happy etc but at the end she's just a bitch. And 1 more, why the hell did they make grown up Renton like that? and why does he has the same voice as holland? They're not related, WHY?!?!?\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\nOverall, I did not enjoy the series, after I watched 12 episodes I thought \"Hang on a minute, I'm confused!\" it has too many mysteries, too many drastic change of hearts to the characters, too many time travels, too many laser beams and missiles, too many truth appearance, too many ILFs and too many things that does not make a series good and cherished. It lacks balance and taste in the writing, planning and direction department.\\n\\n\nOverall: 3\\n\nMaybe I was expecting too much coming straight from the original series, but I felt that this series really massively slapped the original in the nuts. It's really a shame that they decided to put in too much of things especially time travels, even the scrub corals time traveled, I was like, \"R U F***ing serious???\" honestly, I was expecting a sort of a back story on how the coralians managed to fill the earths, not some some traveling corals shit and a bunch of characters that doesn't have enough significance in the movie. I finished watching the series just for the sake of it and I truly hoped as I watched more episodes things will get better, but unfortunately more disappointments came instead.\\n\\n\nExcuse my ramblings, but I just felt betrayed by AO, it has every potential to be a great pre/sequel but they crashed it instead. A shame, really.",

Most people who complain about AO talk about Eureka 7 like itssome genius masterpiece but I really don't see where that comes from. Much of the original felt like filler to me and the real plot doesn't even seem to start until like after episode 30... then finally the real plot starts and they still take breaks to dedicate a whole episode to soccer playing or something. In contrast, every episode of AO contributes greatly to the plot and continues the threads and themes. There is not one wasted episode, much less second. '\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, Eureka 7's characters... the original had many characters that just annoyed me, were na\u00efve and annoying, or just plain creepy. The main character Renton is just na\u00efve to a fault and makes some of the most incomprehensible decisions. One of the main draws of this show is supposed to be the love story, which I thought was cringeworthy. Nothing engrossed me about watching Renton and Eureka's relationship develop. Cringeworthy events such as Eureka covering her face with makeup terribly, etc... I just really don't see the charm in watching two 14 year olds pretend like they are in love( and have kids much less) and fumbling through their relationship terribly. I would prefer a more mature love story. Also creepy and cringeworthy were characters such as Ray and Charles... Now don't get me wrong, I grew up without a father as well, but never once in my life would I cry and be happy about a grown man I just met rubbing my face in his sweaty hairy chest and saying \"I just worked up a sweat, smell that? that's the smell of your papa.. smells nice huh?\" creepy huh, is that supposed to be endearing?\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand ao  has none of these cringeworthy moments. AO is not na\u00efve like renton and doesn't cry through the entire show. He is a great main character. The music is better in AO, the action and art is better and more consistent as well. The only place that the original excels in is in expanding the character depth of its side characters, but I would attribute that more to the longer length than being a better show. I couldn't even imagine how much more depth AO would have if it had 50 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nthe plot in AO is awesome as well. It keeps you guessing and thinking on whats going on right up until the very end, whereas with the original they didn't even attempt to get the main plot going until like the final 10 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTruth is an amazing antagonist that grew on me so much... much more interesting than dewey who didn't do anything until the end or dominic who wasn't even really a villain anyway.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend watching this show, as well as the original since some knowledge of the original is required for AO, just don't go in expecting them both to be rehashes of the same thing. They both have their charm and are worth watching but IMO AO is definitely the superior of the two.",

            "content": "Welcome to my review of Retcon: The Anime! \r\nI'm sure you've heard a lot of things about Eureka Seven AO (a lot of them probably not that great). That said there are those who would like to tell you to go into Eureka Seven AO with an open mind, or that it's a stand alone series, that's more of an offshoot than a sequelfrom the original Eureka Seven. \r\nWell those people are wrong, and you should cut them off from your life, they are dead to you, KILL IT WITH FIRE. \r\nAnyone who tries to tell you that Eureka Seven AO isn't a direct sequelto the original series is lying to themselves. Cause the sad sad truth is that it is. That this series exists and nothing good comes from it. \\n\r\n_________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOn to the review. So do you remember all your burning questions to the fate of Eureka and Renton after they left on a journey? What happened to their adopted children? What happened to Holland and the Gekkostate crew? How did humans adapt in the new world? Did Eureka and Renton ever return from the forest with their blinking red and blue head lights?\\n\\n\r\nWell be prepared!\\n\\n\r\nCause Eureka Seven AO won't be answering those questions, and will instead thrown straight out the window, breaking the perfectly good window in the process. \\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO is essentially a direct sequel, although it's set about 13+ years after the original. As that is our protagonists age at the start. The star of E7:AO is none other Ao himself. The son of Eureka and Renton, although the only one Ao knows is his mother who has gone missing before the start of the show. He was raised by knock off Grandpa Thurston, Dr. Toshio Fukai. Don't worry who he is doesn't really matter cause he has such a small role to play in the story. Should also mention he also leaves behind Naru, a childhood friend of Ao's... there may be more between them, but not like the show cares to elaborate on it. \\n\\n\r\nShortly after the start of the series we are introduced to the digital black crystal monsters known as simply, Secrets. Through a series of unfortunate events with a Secret, Ao eventually stumbles into his mothers mech, the Nirvash Mk. 2 and this sparks the desire to go search her out. Leaving his care taker behind and joining the organization Generation Bleu. \\n\\n\r\nFrom here E7:AO turns into a \"monster of the week\" style anime. Also Ao seems to forget about the search for his mom as well as he gets wrapped up in the organization he joined. It's here we meet the shows cast, Fluer, Alena, Ivaca.... all of which are inconsequential. As they are all barely developed and ultimately the whole monster of the week thing just builds up to collecting Scub Cubes which form the series dues ex machina, the Quarts Gun, a.k.a the Retcon Gun. \\n\\n\r\nSpoilers!!!  \\n\\n\r\nIt's this single element of the series that manages to screw up any hope there ever was for some meaningful story to develop from this train wreck. \\n\\n\r\nAs this weapon's key attribute is the ability to erase the thing that it hits... entirely... from that timeline. With the wonderful after effect of changing any person or object it may have come into contact with. It should be mentioned that there was also already a time travel or alternate universe element at play with Eureka being sent back in time through some seven swell worm hole in order to save her and Rentons Son... and to add to the already convoluted nature of time travel in series, they threw on an element that just crushed any chance of it making a lick of sense. \\n\\n\r\nAnyhow now thanks to the Retcon gun. certain characters outright disappear cause they never end up meeting Ao, others personalities change cause of change of events in their past, villains become allies, allies become villains. Everything that the show had developed up to the point of use becomes pointless, grinds to a halt and resets. With the only character left unaffected being Ao. If only his character was good enough to carry the series on it's own through these events, but it doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nThe gun is used on very few occasions, and usually with it comes the side effect of head scratching as a re-written universe unfolds before the viewers eyes with no explanation or ground work to how things got to where they are. Worse off the rules of the time line changing gun are loose.... very loose. Some characters seem to be able to retain small chunk of memories from their previous life before the timeline was re-written... which makes no sense whats so ever. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the alterations to peoples personalities and character roles also don't add up or make sense either based on the change that was made as well. \\n\\n\r\nIf the Retcon Gun wasn't a problem enough. The show does us the courtesy of bringing Eureka and Renton back into the story in the second cour of the series. Mainly a form of fan service if anything. As everything you knew and loved about these characters in the original anime is long gone. In fact their plans and decisions also make no sense. One such thing for example that also happens to be a spoiler..... \\n\\n\r\nRenton sent Eureka to this alternate timeline in order to safely give birth to Ao. The whole point, and motive was to protect his family. When Renton finally reappears towards the end of the series after finding his family, his goal is to reclaim the Quartz Gun and use it on the Scubs so they never existed (and consequently it would mean that Eureka, and his son Ao wouldn't exist either as a result). Again... it makes no sense. Also apparently his motive is that the Scubs and Humans can't possibly live in peace together after all, so they must be eradicated so that humanity can survive. \\n\\n\r\nA contradictory point from the original series which saw the resolution of peace between Humans and Scubs. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully the show has a happy ending... and Ao does all of us a favor and uses the Retcon gun on all the Secrets and makes it so all of the Ao series never happened. Save yourself the heartbreak and just cherish the original series. \\n\\n\r\nUnless you like watching train wrecks for entertainment value. \\n",

            "content": "I will update this once the anime has finished. -Minor spoilers ahead- plus massive review sorry!\r\nAs a massive fan of the first Eureka SeveN series, hearing that their was a sequel couldn't have made me more happier. Elements of Eureka SeveN AO?, Action? check, Mystery? Check, Eureka? Check, Renton? Who knows. Romance? None =/. Not sure why Bones never incorporated the romance element, one of the main reason why the first series was a big hit Renton and Eureka's romance. Instead AO has A LOT of action, like there will be a fight scene in every single episode, I guess for those of you wholike action its a plus, but Eureka SeveN is really in my opinion suppose to be a romance anime, well at least thats why I love it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, is well very mysterious, be prepared to be confused, and not know what the hell is happening between episodes 1-16 or something. A new enemy is introduced the \"Secrets\", rather than fighting Humans this time, the enemy is some kind off Alien life form or some shit with a very unknown objective. After watching 2/3 of the series, they kinda reveal what the \"Secrets\" objective is but its unclear if its true or false. But what i think makes Eureka SeveN AO great is that new mysterious continue to pop up which adds to the suspense of the story, although I can't wait until they get solved, to many mysterious creates to much confusion =/. But I guess with so many mysteries it kinda forces the viewer to make links with the first series before the answer appears, I for one thought a lot of theories on what may be happening. Each time a link the first series appeared I was like 'OMG OMG, Thats from the first series!\" couldn't help but be thrilled.\\n\\n\r\nBones did a great job on the art it was definitely Eureka SeveN standard, the art is incredibly similar to the first series with some character design actually looking a lot like some characters from the first series, for example Gazelle and Holland except for the skin colour there basically the same lol. Eureka adopts a more mature and adult look with clothes similar to what Diane thurston wore in the first series. The new Nirvash looks kinda chunky and big, kinda looks a bit weird in my opinion. Whats quite cool is that each \"Secret\" actually look different, unlike the first series where the enemy IFO and ships was always the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound?, This is an Eureka SeveN sequel people, of course its going to be amazing, is what i thought, Don't get me wrong its not bad, the opening and ending songs are amazing, especially the first ending song that is REALLY good. Only thing i'm disappointed about is the OST, do you guys still remember in Eureka SeveN, where each scene basically had a different OST? or at least there was a lot of different OST's. Well in AO, this wasn't really the case, the fight scenes all use the same exact OST, the sad/happy scenes really only uses like the same 3-4 OST. Man Bones whats up with that, in Eureka SeveN there was like 4-5 different OST for the fight scene, even now i still remember the tecno tunes from the first season, or Eureka's theme song that makes you think of literally all the sad parts of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how you loved Eureka in the first series? Well your going to probably hate the main female character Naru in the second series, without the Romance Element, it literally feels like 2 childhood friend having a different opinion that leads to a massive fight, and Naru was the cause of it all. Even now i don't even know why the hell shes acting that way towards Ao, he's doing everything to try and help her but she's all like \"OHH NOO i don't want your help, i want Truth, because he's my giant\" not trying to sound weird but that is literally the reason >.> . I REALLY  hope this shit clears up soon because its pretty annoying seeing Ao get constantly rejected. But Naru is a VERY mysterious character, currently after watching 17 episodes NOTHING has came up on what Naru's objective is, all we know is that she wants Ao for something, and that Scub Corlian accepted her or some shit.\\n\\n\r\nLike father, Like son, Ao like Renton, both are amazing pilots, both are clumsy and easily charmed/embarrassed, both have that scaredy cat feel towards them. But unlike Renton, Ao is probably way more rebellious and straightforward with things and is much more stubborn and as a 12 year old kid, Ao is surprisingly coping REALLY well, remember all the mental break downs Renton had? Ao didn't have as much, and his break downs weren't as exaggerated compare to Rentons.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the side characters do nothing but to add to the mystery of the story, Just where is Eureka? and what happened to her?, which leads to a LOT of speculation but it does suck that there isn't a lot of character development with the sider characters for example there is hardly any development of the Pied Piper crew, except for Rebecka and Ivica the rest of the crew is basically not introduced... Kinda sucks, but i guess they don't have enough episodes for that kind off development plus they kinda made up for it by introducing Team Goldilocks. \\n\\n\r\nBut I feel that with all the characters in AO, theres not really any attachment towards any of them, Even with Ao, I don't really give a shit about him and actually care more about Eureka who has like a air time of less than 20 minutes.. Theres just not enough development with the main character and he doesn't really make you feel sorry for him. Even though he lost his mum at a young age theres just not enough sadness around that topic, plus nothing has really happened that will make you sympathise with him except for losing his mum at a young age. Remember how when Renton first see his sister, THAT had a big impact. When Ao first meets Eureka, that DID NOT have a big impact.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless this anime has provided me with plenty of enjoyment, it serves to fill up the hole that was left behind after season one finished. There is slight comedy scenes in this, not much but when they appear they are pretty funny. The fight scenes are pretty well made, really shows Ao's power over everyone else like with Eureka and Renton, literally every fight seen Fleur and Elena are completely useless, they either get shot down straight away, or their units can't actually fight that kind of Secret...  The best scenes for me are when things from the first series are mentioned/appear. When Eureka appeared for the first time, her entrance was the most nostalgic thing you will ever see, i just remember going \"omg, it can't be, thats nirvash, thats gekko go OMG WHY IS IT HERE?!?!?!?!\" I really can't wait when Renton will appear really looking forward to what his new look might be.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this anime overall is ok, its nothing compared to the first, I guess you can say i'm biased due to the fact i love the first series, but the only thing i'm actually looking forward to is the bits with Eureka and Renton in the rest seems kinda pointless, it is still good enough to act as the sequel of Eureka SeveN due to its action and art. I think Bones focused way to much on what the current trend is for anime, just having loads of \"Action\", and instead neglected the things that made the 1st series great.",

Also why did they make that Renton and Eureka can't have kids in their universe. I also hopped that the story would focus on more Eureka and Renton as adults. The only descent episodes were 23  and 24.\r\nRenton only had screen time of 3 episodes, that really sad. I was hopping to see more of the original gekko crew.\r\nOverall the Eureka Seven Astral Ocean was mediocre at best. Character Ao was kinda to into what is right or wrong. Astral Ocean shoulden'tbe connected to the Eureka Seven, if wasn't connected to the Eureka seven then it would'ev been a better anime.

So it's sad to see that I haven't seen any of the originals yet, besides the mention of Eureka. But before you be like me and judge a book by it's cover, seriously, just give it a chance. I did. I'm hooked, and I'm loving it.\r\nIt confuses me a bit, but the plot yanks you back and forth answering questions and making you ask new ones. The graphics, the sounds, the story, magnificent. The wholeconcept of him being Eureka's son, and Eureka is missing is absolutely great. Although it could be better if I could see a bit of the Gekko State.\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure Holland and Talho should have a grown kid by now, and Eureka's adopted children are older. But i must say Ao looks like a child made from Eureka and Renton. I know Renton was annoying and all, but you just gotta love the originals. Not all people can make a person love an anime sequel that still hasn't shown some originals. But I love it, none the less. I'm going to reread the manga from the beginning until I reach the manga version of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI need answers to questions, I'm sure that eventually all will be answered.

            "content": "Eurkea 7 Ao is better than i expected it to be. \r\nI liked its predecessor but the main character always made me cringe while watching it. This show is done a lot more to my liking tho character wise. Ao is a much stronger leading character with a lot of Independence and courage. He doesn't break into tears and act like a spoiled child every 5 minutes. \r\nWhen it comes to sound and visuals Ao is not shabby in either as its a very musically influenced show. You notice all the names of episodes are after various songs by various artists from dragon force toaerosmith? The opening and ending music i found was not the best part of the audio experience but the ambient sounds in quieter scenes were interesting to me personally. The art is not a overly complicated design expect maybe the machines which are done to convey a lot of sharpness while maintaining a sleek aesthetic style.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot so far has kept me interested, it answers lots of questions while still leaving bigger ones open for you. They even keep poking little bits and pieces into the bigger questions so you become even more engrossed by the series. The action sequences may be short lived throughout the entire series but that has never been the reason Eureka Seven has been so popular. Its the conspiracy and the philosophical aspects of it all which this series is ripe with.\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven Ao is a good sequel, it doesn't heavily demand its predecessor and it has its own charms that make you like the series for itself. The plot is well formulated and the characters are a lot more likable in some ways this time around. I think you should give this show at least 3 episodes before you say you like it or not cause they very first 2 don't set the tone for the entire show. Try giving it a fair view as the plot advances fairly quick. Solid 7, may go up as the series progresses.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Eureka seven AO astral ocean review\r\nStory 5/10\r\nIf you enjoyed the entertaining love story that comes with the original eureka seven, you'll find none of that here.\r\nSPOILERS!!\r\nSo here we go, eureka seven AO has a really confusing storyline, where throughout the series, the main antagonist remains somewhat ambiguous. Is the scub corral that appear from the ground? Is the the Secrets (antibodies that are against foreign objects, aka the scub corral)? Is it the mysterious Truth (creepy guy who kills a lot of people and overall disturbs the love relationships)? WHO KNOOOOooooOoOWs? In the end the scub corral are erased from history, thus the Secrets nolonger exists and since the Secrets no longer existed, Truth becomes the autopilot for the nirvash neo (so basically the buddy for Ao, which makes no sense because they were enemies before). So basically time was reset and a world without Ao and the scub corrals was born. Half the characters are gone and you don't really know what happens to them (kinda like in the original series, where the crew of the gekko's fate remains unknown).\\n\\n\r\nultimately the story feels somewhat incomplete, because it has one of those happy endings where the fate of the characters are left to the imagination of the viewers\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the  characters of Eureka seven AO are uninteresting and have little chemistry. Like I mentioned before, eureka seven AO is not a love story.\\n\\n\r\nFukui Ao\\n\r\nThe protagonist of the series and the son of eureka and Renton. And just like Renton, he only wants to protect the people he loves. However he doesn't really romantic love anyone, so really the people he platonically loves. He downs really have any character traits that really pop out to me personally as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nFleur Blanc and Elena Peoples\\n\r\nThe two friends and side characters. Overall they are fun and have complex back stories that are somewhat filled in. Incidentally they are two of the three attractive heroines of the series\\n\\n\r\nArata Naru\\n\r\nThe supposed love interest for Ao. However, their love is only hinted through one sided care for Ao by Naru. In the beginning of the series the character displays lots of enthusiasm and potential to be the next eureka/anemone (a mix of both characters). Ironically she becomes a reverse anemone, where she's in love with the MC and become a mindless boring character (almost as if she's on drugs). In addition, she actually seems to be attracted to Truth moreso than Ao. Also funny enough, she actually spends more screen time with Truth then Ao. This basically destroys any love interest between the two. So basically over  the course of the the episodes, I started to overlook her as an important character, because basically she just does her own thing and doesn't add to the story. Honestly she belongs in the original series rather than AO.\\n\\n\r\nTruth\\n\r\nThe semi-creepy somewhat antagonist of the series. Basically he kidnaps Naru (well she goes willingly) and through the interactions with him, she becomes a much less enjoyable character. Ao views him a somewhat of a threat, since Ao doesn't realistically seem to wanna hurt him, or take Naru back. However, ironically over time, Truth becomes a character with much more depth and feels like an actual antagonist. In the end he becomes apart of the operating system for the nirvash neo and ends up being good friends with Ao (which is really confusing).\\n\\n\r\nEureka and Renton\\n\r\nBoth characters are quite enjoyable when they appear in the series. Eureka has a lot more of a personality and pops up randomly through out the series. Renton only shows up for the last 2 episodes and is a lot like Holland. Either way, the motives of the two are based upon the fact that they love Ao very much and want to protect him. The reason for this is because in a world where trapars exist, Eureka's first child turns to stone and dies. Which is why Renton and Eureka want to create a world without trapars, so that Ao would live. Overall they are the anchor that links\\n\r\nThe original series to this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing spectacular, but is definitely superior to the original (duh, it's newer). It has the classic Eureka missile chase scenes and the the mecha designs are much more appealing than the previous series, however there is no real merchandise or figures for this series, so if you liked the characters or anything like that, sorry!\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNo real osts that stick out or escalate the scenes or action. The openings and ending are alright though and are quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAhhh if only eureka seven AO had more of the traits from the original series. It's a entertaining watch and definitely picks up after episode 7, mostly because Naru gets kidnapped and things get weird. If you liked the ordinal series and liked eureka and Renton, maybe watch it for them. (Kinda like watching the disappearance of yuki nagato for haruhi)",

Part of the reason why it isn't nearly as good as the first series is due to the time constraints. Eureka Seven was 50+ episodes and this is only 24 so there isn't nearly as much time for character development and other themes to be raised. Also, the series feels at times like theyare trying to do too much at once, which makes it somewhat chaotic and less fluid as the original series. I would say the later half of the show is more interesting than the first, because there are more references to the first series that fans might appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nBones did a very good job with the art for the show as well as the sound, although I think the ost for Eureka Seven was better overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters needed work, but mostly because the limited number of episodes allowed for character development and plot progression.",

            "content": "Eureka Seven Ao, the highly anticipated sequel of the incredibly Eureka 7 that... misses the mark. I mean, it wasnt bad, but compared to the original materpiece, all this anime did was pass some time while I worked out.  \r\nArt:10- Before I go into the generic characters and the incredibly flawed plot line, let me just say that the art is amazing, and I mean, amazing. I wish other anime had art this clear and vivid. Wow.\r\nCharacters: 4- Why, just why is there not a single character that has original traits. Seriously, there are no good characters in this. You know what, lets takethe 4 I just gave and make it a 2. This may feature the most generic, unoriginal characters that I have ever scene. Lets do a play by play for the three main characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAo Fukai- And for the hundredth or so time, your main character is...the generic male character with all of the usual protagonist traits. This man is willing to give up everything to save people he just met, causes every girl to fall in love with him and... oh wait I am describing the sword art online character. I wish this guy was the sword art online character, Ao is about as bland as water. Nothing about him sticks out other than his hair.\\n\r\nNaru Arata- I think everyone will agree with me on this, but Naru was easily the worst heroine of 2012. All she does is hold every character back. she allies with Ao and Pied Piper, holds them back. Allies with truth, and holds him back. She is just a plot device. What a waste of potential.\\n\r\nTruth- The most forced villain that I have ever scene. I feel like the producers just decided that they needed a villain due to the success of Dewey in the original. Truth is not even a tenth of how amazing Dewey was. \\n\\n\r\nPlot- So long are the days of good, deep plots from the original. Instead we have random sprints of action that make no sense at all. The plot is just incredibly flawed and the ending... well I will say that I respect the producers for trying that type of ending, it just doesn't work. \\n\\n\r\nA part of me seriously wishes that I could have written a positive review, as it is the sequel of an incredible anime. But this was no where near as good. It passed some time, but it wasn't memorable. \\n",

Not saying AO is bad, its not as good as the original Eureka 7. If you're a fan it is still a must watch, but don't expect too much, and I'll tell you why in this review.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nEureka's son, Ao Fukai, is living in Okinawa. Little does he know he is Eureka's real son. He finds out a lot about himself as the series introduces scub coral and Secrets. After learning aboutthese he gets sucked into chaos, fighting with his IFO, or Nirvash, together they uncover the mysteries of why he is there on Earth rather than where the original Eureka 7 took place many years in the future. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful in a sense that we get to see IFO fights clearly. Backgrounds are very unique. The same character designs but with different people. The art was probably the strong point in AO.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe Ost's didn't really stand out. It sounded a bit recycled. Nonetheless, Flow does it again with BravBlue as the 2nd opening. Probably the only thing I cared for listening to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt was good. Not great, not terrible, just good. Although many of the fans of Eureka 7 were expecting AO to be magnificent and even better than the original . It was not. But I still enjoyed AO, good mech fights. But lacking a love story. Really wished for a love story.. To sum things up, this series is a must watch for those Eureka 7 fans, just don't be expecting anything in particular.",

            "content": "yay, so much thanks to Eureka Seven Ao for ruining my day (literally watched this whole 24 episode in a day). Worst Sequel I've ever seen done to a beautiful original series (Eureka Seven).\r\nPlot: 3/10\r\nCompletely bullshit compared to the original series. So now Scub Corals can travel through time and universe. Oh, and so in the other timeline of the other world, Earth has antibodies called the SECRETs. Oh, so all the efforts of peace and harmonious living between humans and Scub Corals are useless in the 1st series as Renton is now a Scub Coral Killer. Reason? Because his daughter could not survive inhis world and he wants to destroy the scub corals in order for his soon-to-be-born son to be able to live there. There's so much more flaws in this sequel that I want to point out, but all in all the plot is questionable at its core.\\n\r\nWhile this is a sequel, if you would look at this as a standalone series, I would say it still consists tons of plot holes that cannot be explained.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nWell, the character development is pretty bad, except for Noah the sloth. And... Eureka =P\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good in my opinion, movements are fluid and mecha battles looks great in this anime. However this does not fill up the flaws made from the plot.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nMusics used in this anime is good. No comment on this. Most of you would enjoy this I think.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 5/10\\n\r\nNo matter how, this sequel does not lift up to be a continuation for the first series. Although in the end, explanations covers up most of gaps from the original series to this one, which appears to be so matching and makes sense in some ways (I do hope you guys who watched it will disagree), but the stupidity and illogical plot itself diverts its core purpose from the original.\\n\\n\r\nIs it a waste of my time? Kinda. It would be great to name this series as a spinoff alternate storyline instead of a direct sequel.",

Although it is the sequel to Eureka Seven it is only 24 episodes so don't expect the same thing from a 50 episode show.\r\nStory: [5/10]\r\nThe story is all over the place and it is hard at times to tell what the characters are after. It kind of keeps you on your toes but letting you think that you understand where the story is going and then the creators add an element that you didn't see coming and it makes more confusing or complex. Overall the story is about a teenager named Ao who lives a normal life until hisquiet life is interrupted by an attack on the island that he lives on. To keep my review as spoiler free as possible I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not you want to watch the show based on this. It is basically a show where a teenager's life is interrupted and goes on an adventure. Although like I said earlier the story is a bit lack luster and is hard to pinpoint at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nEureka Seven AO doesn't use one color through out the whole 24 episodes that you watch. It is extremely appealing to the eye, and is a breath of fresh air.\\n\\n\r\nSound: [9/10]\\n\\n\r\nA plus for those who enjoyed the original Eureka Seven will be glad to hear that FLOW is back for another single that is very pleasing to the ears. The music is very fitting and the OST is fantastic. If there is anything that you retain from watching the series the music is definitely something I know you will enjoy having watched for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: [3/10]\\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong the characters aren't that horrible, but they could be explained a lot more. Each character has their own spotlight, but it isn't enough to fully display who they are and what they feel. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the show quite a bit. A key note that I have to bring up again to fully enjoy the show is to for the most part forget that Eureka Seven AO is even a sequel to the original Eureka Seven. The first episodes were a blast (not that the latter ones weren't), but if it weren't for the alluring first episodes i don't think I could have stood to finish AO with all the bad gripe about the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [7/10 (rounded from 6.6)]\\n\\n\r\nCome in for the action, music, and animation. If that's what was missing from the original Eureka Seven for you than this could be your hidden gem. Overall the story and character development categories were lacking quite a bit but if you can look past those I am sure you will enjoy watching Eureka Seven AO.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Agreed, it was disappointing as compared to the previous series, but it wasn't as bad as the reviews claim it was. Not to me at least.\r\nSee first things first, the reviews SCARED me. They were the reason I did NOT watch this anime for almost 2 years after I watched the main series (E7). But that's not just it. Perhaps it was because of the humongous time gap that I put between the first part and the sequel. Because of the time gap, I could watch this series like an entirely new one, without comparing it to the previous. So guess you could say myopinion will be somewhat unbiased as compared to those.\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, the storyline. The plot was confusing (a bit), and it lacked the oomph of the primary series. But in the end, it kinda started making sense and it... well, wasn't as bad as Guilty Crown. So it was okay. *thumbs up* Though there were just too many factions... America, Japan, the private companies, Corals (I don't even know why they were so keen on destroying them because they were literally harmless), and Secrets (which were involved in a long debate whether they were the enemy or not, but in the start of the anime - it is FREAKING CLEAR that they are the enemy because they shot people and cars right before the protagonist's eyes).\\n\\n\r\nWhat really annoyed me was the characters... I mean, how bad can you make the characters? There's a limit! I am officially annoyed by how mainstream the characters can be. There is always this one male lead who, despite whatsoever his girlfriend does, will not stop sympathizing for her. Like his girlfriend literally ran away THRICE with another guy, and he was still \"ok\" with it. How bad can it be? And there were other characters. Characters who keep making mistakes on and on and on. The Pied Pipers - officially the worst team I have ever seen. And for some reason - EVERY GODDAMN GUY KNOWS EUREKA AS THEIR RESPECTIVE SAVIOUR! -_- \\n\\n\r\nBut honestly speaking, the most annoying character was still Naru. I never understood her from the start till the end - she was the dumbest female lead that could ever exist... Like she is really worse than Orihime from Bleach!\\n\\n\r\nI personally liked the villain. I don't know about you, but a villain that can annoy me is a good villain.\\n\\n\r\nThe good part was when we see Renton in the third last episode. It was like rain after a long and dry summer. You'd give a fangirl squeak - regardless you are a guy or girl. But Renton totally kills it in the last episode... He is a disgrace to a father. He hit his son with a football, he beat the shit out of his robot, etc. etc. and that was totally unlike a mature person. They turned him into a shit character.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the art. The art was beautiful, no doubts, but it was more about steel, metal, fall coloured broccolis, water, colourful robots, etc. BUT THERE WAS NO TRUE BEAUTY. If you don't get what I mean by true beauty - please, rewatch Eureka Seven. Or just google \"Eureka Seven wallpapers\" lmfao, you'll get some good examples.\\n\\n\r\nSound was great! I mean, the music they put in was amazing. I loved the music that played using battle sequences, and the OP and ED - everything was good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I'd say I got a bit more than what I was expecting after all those negative reviews. I'd say it was worth my time. Nothing more, nothing less. There was action, there were robots, and there was a story line that progressed steadily.\\n\\n\r\nTHE MOST ANNOYING PART OF THE ANIME - THE END\\n\r\nThe ending was INCOMPLETE. Like most anime show what happens to the characters after blahblahblah war ends, AO did not show ANYTHING except for the protagonist. Like that's the most disappointing thing that I have ever seen! Like what? What? What? What happened to the Pied Pipers? What happened to Eureka and Renton? What?\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: It is worth a watch. Just brace yourself for the fact that everyone except for the protagonist is an enemy - because that's kind of what happens in a nutshell.",

            "content": "I'd Imagine that following up an anime like Eureka Seven is no small task. That being said it isn't too hard to identify the reasons that made E7 so great in the first place. While E7:AO has some of that (pretty nice art and fairly enjoyable characters (most of the time)), It's hard to not feel disappointed. \r\n    Despite having nice artwork, the original and colourful environments present in E7 are all replaced by very generic modern Japanese scenery. This by itself is fine, as there are plenty of great mecha shows set in similar settings, however it justfeels like part of what gave E7 it's fantastic, unique identity is gone here. And with the inclusion of an Evangelion-esque organization guiding our heroes and the more team-focused character development, it just ends up feeling overly derivative of things that it shouldn't be deriving from, since E7 established such an interesting world.\\n\\n\r\n   Also, closure. This show has none.",

This \u201csequel\u201d lacks that certain excitement that the first series had. Indeed, the story of Eureka Seven was complicated but it was still well-made therefore, the storyline still became something exciting and interesting.\r\nEureka Seven is by FAR better in every way and that most particularly with the soundtracks because Eureka Seven have one ofthe best soundtracks out there!\\n\\n\r\nThe only time things get exciting is probably the time when Renton finally appeared and that\u2019s the last two episodes. It\u2019s extremely exciting to see characters you encountered before in a different way. It\u2019s very nostalgic. And the only one I love about the series is the very adorable Noah!\\n",

            "content": "The first Eureka 7 series was simply phenomenal in its blending of action and romance and drama. The characters were unique and memorable and having only seen the series once when it first came out stateside I could describe every character in detail (too bad I suck with names, my failing not the shows). Eureka 7 Astral Oceans greatest folly is that it has none of that character development and feeling. \r\nAo is kind of whiny and annoying but he has some sort of resolution to do something not quite resembling the right thing but it's what he wants to do for some reason thatis never really rationalized, his two squad mates are the one who is angry at her dad and the one who makes pop culture references and that's about it. There is no real character development, no real change, Renton went from a whiny kind who was just scared to being a kid who fought for what he wanted, Ao goes from a whiny kid to a whiny kid with brief moments of stoicism and insane choices that he goes back on an episode later. There's just nothing memorable about any of them. Ivica is probably the most interesting character with the most defined ethos and personality and it shows, he's likeable, he's memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe series feels like Eureka 7 only in name, there's not much relation to the original other than a few key concepts and two or three names. The arts fine, the voice acting and sound is fine. There is nothing objectionable about the show (barring the character issues). The biggest loss in translation was the freedom that the LFO's provided the pilots and population, it was surfing on the wind, it was sport and combat, and it was a beautiful, believable, and unique. AO goes back to the war mechs with no grace, it's really sad that it wasn't brought over to the new series. \\n\\n\r\nAlso when are we going to get away from the whole \"only children with their pure hearts can save the world/pilot the robot\". It just doesn't make sense when you say that only children can pilot the LFOs (or whatever acronym they have given to this generation) and give no reason for that, then show some grown ups piloting similar vehicles, and when you have an original series where grown ups were the predominant pilots.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly think that this would be a better series if it was a stand alone, there would be no comparing it its predecessor and it would be able to be its own show. Instead it feels like a story awkwardly shoved into the E7 universe with a lot of anime cliche alternate reality to avoid having to make the story work in the original universe.",

The story starts out 13 years in the future from where Eureka Seven left off, and follow the life Ao, a 13 year old boy who is apparently the child of Renton and Eureka.  He apparently never knew his parents, and is raised by his adopted grandfather.\r\nMy review has a lot of negative in it, which is very unusual for me because if I'm willing to watch 24 episodes of something, it has to have something of interest pulling me back in again and again.  Overall I enjoyed the series,but the frustration level with the illogic of the story line was higher than almost any other anime I can think of.   The payoff for me was to finally understand what ever became of Eureka and Renton.  The rest of the story was so contrived, contorted, and illogical it is almost not worth going through it.  Bottom line, if you want to find out what happened to Eureka and Renton, skip to the last two episodes and watch those -- you won't have missed much worth seeing in the first 22 episodes.",
