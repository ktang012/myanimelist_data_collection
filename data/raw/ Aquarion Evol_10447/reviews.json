            "content": "(Note: this review covers the whole series' content and has done so forever, but MAL stuck a little yellow tag on here that says \"preliminary\")\r\nAquarion EVOL. It's been 12,000 quarter-days since the first series came out back in 2005 and now it's been reincarnated for the new era. First, some history:\r\nTo my knowledge, not many people liked Genesis of Aquarion. It was an overly melodramatic, awkward, very episodic and somewhat girly mecha series where the robots were essentially powered by orgasms(You read that right) and it had to compete in an era where good mecha anime was still a thing. It was a show thatcouldn't take itself seriously even when it was trying to take itself seriously. Audience response was mostly apathetic, but people loved the theme song and the OST had some of Yoko Kanno's best work. Hell, that OP was the sole reason I decided to blindly download the whole show on dial-up back on Christmas of '05. It took 4 months to finish, and was actually my first subbed anime.\\n\\n\r\nI loved Aquarion. It was stupid and weird in all the best ways, and to this day it's still a very different spin on the super robot genre. The melodramatic characters and their reactions to everything, the complete nonsense shouted by the leader that would lead to victory in every episode, the omnisexual, ten-way, cross-dimensional love story... All of it was just grand in retrospect. I had no idea of what to expect from this series' new art direction and the effects of a near-decade hiatus, but ho-damn am I satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion EVOL opens 12,000 years after the end of Aquarion, with the main character, Amata, watching his favorite decade-old movie that (poorly) depicts events of the prequel series' final episode. This is followed by his boss coming out and telling him \"Amata, no one likes that movie but you, really. The theme song got popular, but that's about it.\" So yeah, the opening of this new foray into the orgasm-powered mecha genre is Shoji Kawamori brazenly declaring that he gives not a single fuck to the haters out there. I can't even tell you how happy that scene made me, I felt like Amata.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, you get treated to what's easily the prettiest god damn show of the season, and maybe year, as Amata takes this big-boobed blue haired girl on a date through the rivers of neo-Venice. The environments are always painted in absolutely beautiful detail and color, and many shots are screencap worthy because of how genuinely pretty they are. I strongly suggest watching this in HD. \\n\\n\r\nThe character and world designs are all very unique and memorable, infused with an injection of sharp detail, personality and visual originality that you don't see in many anime anymore. The world and characters feel alive, and there's even two full fictional alphabets that show up in the show that contribute to this. Also, each scene is well-composed on screen and because of that, Aquarion Evol is never a bore to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, Aquarion Evol's new cast of characters is what makes it shine, at least in my opinion. Rather than the really odd focus of the first episodes of the prior series, Evol began strong by introducing a cast of lively, thought-out and memorably designed little mecha pilots and having them ping off of each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are presented in a very neutral and borderline desperate way. They don't appear evil and their motivations and details about their pasts are kept as a mystery for a while, but the show gives many hints and allusions as to who they really are and keep the viewer interested rather than starve them for details.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is strong and sharp up until about 2/3rds the way through, and then it gets a little dumb near the end when old plot lines end in anticlimactic ways, pointless new plot lines appear and things get pretty drawn out in general. But then the final episode is pretty great and brings all the important stuff back to the forefront for the most part, and the series ends on a strong, melodramatic cheesy note that it should. \\n\\n\r\nThis is all in contrast to the first series, where the story and characters were a little unfocused until the final 6 or 7 and episodes, and then those were all amazing and climactic. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the titular fighting robots. Shit looks absolutely fantastic, though, honestly, the 3D animation is a bit stiff and the original Aquarion has a leg up on it in terms of good choreography and smooth movements.\\n\\n\r\nEVOL makes full and complete use of the \"orgasm when combining\" joke throughout the first episode, but actually lightens up on it as the show has progresses. So far, the only real mecha orgasm sequences have been for particularly climactic moments and new character introductions. The gag is used sparingly and after the first series it's apparent the creators took note that it alienated some people. This whole project in general looks like it's taking the widespread criticism of Aquarion both in stride and into consideration, creating a series that satisfies both old fans and newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is still amazing. If you watched the first series you'll probably recognize a number of the background tracks, remixed or reworked, along with a bunch of nice, new pieces. This show's opening theme is an orgasm of Japanese vocal work. Yoko Kanno knows what she's doing.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the base elements of Aquarion remain intact, for better or worse. It's still pretty cheesy and melodramatic, but this time they're hamming it up even more while at the same time keeping a good focus on down-to-earth elements like the cast, for the most part. I appreciate the hell out of it, but I'm sure some people still won't 'get' it. It's also still really, really pretty and the energy produced by the visuals and sounds carry the show's asinine writing like a thoroughly lubed bullet train.\\n\\n\r\n\"So should I watch the first series before getting into this one?\"\\n\\n\r\nYes. Or at least maybe the OVAs to get a feel for the characters and stuff. One of the main draws of this series (for me) was that it's actively referenced Aquarion quite a bit, such as one of the main villains basically being an evil version of the main character in the first show. Kawamori's also stated that the main cast in this show are reincarnations of the previous cast. Eventually learning how the two stories and their characters will tie together is going to be, as I predict, one of the most rewarding aspects of EVOL. So if you want to enjoy Evol as much as you can, experience the previous project a little bit first.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, honestly, while Evol might be more \"likable\", Aquarion was a better put-together show in the end, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n\"They... orgasm in the robot? that's stupid!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd ironically this show has far less ecchi and has more thoughtful writing than any series it's directly competing with. But really now, you probably just got done watching tit-infused garbage like Lagrange, you can't criticize this show lmao\\n\\n\r\n\"So, is it better than Lagrange, the other girly mecha show this year?\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, in just about every single possible way, shape and form.\\n\\n\r\n\"Is Fudo Gen in it? He was the only good thing about Aquarion\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, and he's a fucking pirate ohmygodit'sgreat\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol gave me colorgasms and excitement for something to see every week for half a year, and I hope it did the same for everyone else. Give it a shot.",

            "content": "One sentence: Stupidity at its best\r\nIntro: \r\nAquarion Evol is about a legenday robot named Aquarion, that takes diffrent forms with various powers, it is about an alien civilization that lost their reproductive capabilities thus being on the verge of extinction.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nAquarion Evol is about 2 planets that are the setting for the story of 2 gay angel-men in love, then 1 of them (Avallon) goes straight and falls in love with a human girl. The one that got dumped, (Mykage) wants his revenge and after 24 thousand years he still seeks revenge, he is the villain of this series. \r\nThe story takes place in thepresent, 24 thousand years after the gay break up. We have the reincarnation of the woman that caused the break up, Mikono, and the former gay couple, Avallon and the white haired dude, Mykage. We find out that Avallon got separated in a good side, Amato, and an evil side, Kagura. Both sides of Avallon are fighting for the same girl, Mikono, the reincarnation of Avallon\u2019s former sweetheart. \\n\r\nIt contains lots of pointless, sickening drama, lots of annoying characters overreacting and talking about their first time \u201emerging\u201d in robots like they are loosing their virginity and lots of gibberish talk trying to sound celever, complex and deep. After a while hearing the characters talking about \u201emerging\u201d like they are having sex, you ask yourself, why don\u2019t they just have sex? \\n\r\nThere is a lot of useless drama, for instance, the Djin drama. They all know him for 2 days then discover he is a spy sent by the enemy and after he dies, all the characters are heartbroken and they keep showing these pathetic scenes of Djin being alive, characters saying pathetic lines like \u201eI wish Djin was here\u201d, \u201eLet\u2019s do this for Djin\u201d, \u201eI want to be with Djin\u201d and characters being sad because of his death for the next 5 episodes. Really? You knew him for 2 days and he was a spy anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, cliched, pathetic, irritating and constantly overreacting.\\n\r\nAmato is the good side of Avallon and the MC, but he has no charisma, not a particulary strong character or special abilities, he is not the smartest in the bunch either. Amato is just a nice guy that is doing his best to get the girl he loves, there is not much else to his character. \\n\r\nThe female lead, Mikono, is your generic damsel in distress, she is mostly crying, whining and having mixed emotions over Amata and Kagura. \\n\r\nMikono once said \u2013 \u201eI\u2019ve worked to hard to stop now\u201d and I\u2019m just sitting there thinking \u201eExactly what the fuck have you been doing that is so hard?\u201d.\\n\r\nKagura, the evil side of Avallon, is the generic \"cool\" character that wants to steal Mikono from Amata, creating pointless drama.\\n\r\nThe support characters are just there, you will forget about them as soon as you finish the series, at least they were not as annoying as the main characters (Amato, Kagura, Mikono).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation is decent, mostly fluid but nothing special or memorable about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe openings are decent but ultimately forgettable, the OST is just bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI have not enjoyed one second of Aquarion Evol, not the fight scenes, not the backgrounds, not the dialogue, nothing. It is a series that makes you throw up in your mouth and it is a insult to the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the series is: Love conquers all, in the end, love ended the conflict between the two planets and as a symbolic idea, the strongest form of Aquarion was named \"EVOL\" backwards spelled resulting in \"LOVE\".\\n\\n\r\nMemorable ludicrous and idiotic lines: \\n\r\n\u201eThe reasons holes are made is to bring people toghether\u201d; \\n\r\n\u201eI want to fill the hole in you\u201d;\\n\r\n\u201eHey wretched bitch, make up your mind!\u201d; \\n\r\n\u201eBoy or girl, we\u2019ll be toghether\u201d;\\n\r\n\u201eGibberish Talk\u201d;\\n\r\nThese are a small portion of the stupidity this series delivers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.8/10\\n\r\nOne sentence: Stupidity at its best. This is truly a series that makes you feel sick and at the same time bothers you with the stupidity it contains. The only reason I don't rate it as a 1/10 is the fact that people actually worked to create this crap anime. I regret watching it and I DO NOT recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\r\nCharacter - 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\r\nOverall - 2",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so please bare with me, but for this series I felt like I needed to write my opinion of it.\r\nStory:\r\nEpisodes 1 - 13 = 7\r\nNow, the series started off very good, I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it was enough to pull me in and get me interested in the series. It was lighthearted and comedy filled at points, but it also had plenty enough action and mystery involved to keep you looking forward to what might come next.\r\nEpisodes 14 - 21 = 5\r\nUnfortunately at this point, the story seems to start getting thrown all overthe place. Some episodes I liked and some were just not so good... and I'm sad to say that it continued to get worse.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 22 - 26 = 2\\n\r\nThis is where everything in the plotline just falls apart. Revelations and twists are made and it all seems to turn into a horrible joke. It didn't end well either as there will a lot of plotholes and loose-ends in the series that were left unanswered. You know it's bad when you root for the antagonist in the series to win and hope that the heros will lose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plotline was decent, but definitely no where near amazing.\\n\r\nTotal Average: 4.5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nTha animation quality was overall pretty, but not overly fantastic, especially since the CG wasnt really well done on some points. It had a lot of recycled footage through out the anime and unfortunately the reused footage from Sousei no Aquarion stuck out like a sore thumb against Evol's animation. But for the most part it was very pretty to look at, especially the first ending.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAh, the saving grace of the show and probably one of the few things I will remember from Evol. The music is just astounding; I could listen to it all day and not get tired of it. Gekkou Symphonia, Paradoxical Zoo, Eve no Danpen, Kimi no Shinwa, Yunoha no Mori, Aquaria Mau Sora... they're all wonderful songs, there's not one I do not like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMain Characters = 2\\n\r\nThe main characters are some of the worst I have ever experienced in a show. I started off liking Amata quite a bit; he was a weak willed character but he seemed very devoted and it looked as if he would develop into a stronger character; how wrong was I. He continued to be weak and couldn't seem to function without Mikono around; it was unbearable to watch him near the end.  I think most will agree with me when I say that I definitely won't miss his \"MIKONO-SAAAAAAAAANNNN!\"\\n\r\nMikono... she starts off as quite a snotty character a little bit in the beginning and shes always looking down on herself and calling herself useless... at one point it seemed that she stepped up and looked as if she would actually do something and help out, but in the end, remains to be useless and forever stuck in the damsel in distress mode.\\n\r\nZessica- as much as I love Zessica, she was a poorly developed character. She started off amazing and had the potential to be a great person, but gets stuck in her mopey and dull self as her unrequited love for Amata beats her down repeatedly into a deeper depression. If Zessica's character taught me one thing, it's that no matter how you try to go against fate/ destiny, you can't and it will beat you down.\\n\r\nKagura started off as an interesting character, but I also think he was poorly developed. Has a very beast-like personality and his sole focus is to get Mikono and anyone in his way will get hurt/killed... there's really not much else to him. But the thing that will continue to bug me to the end of days is his OOC'ness at the very end of the series... he is suddenly shown capable of being a human being and rather intellectual when that was definitely not the case from before.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting Characters = 8\\n\r\nThe supporting characters, to me at least, outshown the main characters by far. Jin and Yunoha were some of my favorites, separately they were both very good, but when they were together, something sparked and they quickly became my favorite love interest in the show. Andy and Mix provided a lot of comedy, especially when they were together, but their love at the end really moved me. Both JinxYunoha and AndyxMix were by far better love interests than AmataxMikono and much more enjoyable. The other side characters were also very enjoyable in their own way- Cayenne and Shrade, along with Sazanka and Malloy were just wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nTotal Average: 5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe first half of the series was very enjoyable and I was always looking forward to the next episode, unfortunately my high expectations from the first half led to a lot of disappointment in the second half. It became a trainwreck; the plotline became something that I didn't look forward to and I found myself groaning at a lot of scenes or just not really caring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI think it was my high expectations from the first half that led to my great disappointment, but Evol just stands as average to me. The terrible plotline, poorly developed main characters, and lack of enjoyment for the second half really hit me. Despite the not so good things, there was still enjoyment from the supporting cast and especially from Mykage(whom was a great villain), so overall it wasn't terribly awful, I just felt it could have been handled better.",

            "content": "I haven't watched the first season (don't really need to imho since they basically bring up the past a lot of times and you really only need a few tidbits to get whats going on). However, I will be watching the first season after this season is over to get a better feel of the story.\r\nStory: The story is really good imo. You have 2 guys who clash together in order to win over the girl they love. The season isn't over yet but in my opinion it feels like 1 side represents \"old love/destined love\" and the other represents \"new love/breaking chains of fate\".It's a typical space/sci-fi/school life anime where a boy gets involved in a cross-planetary war and his whole life is changed. He gets introduced to various \"special\" people who possess unique powers that are used to protect the planet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is beautiful. It's basically a 2012 looking anime so of course the colors are vibrant and very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier for some reason. Music plays big rolls in major events that happen throughout the show. New powers = music, dramatic events = music, etc , etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are really good. You have the perverted male friend who clashes with the tsundere boy hating goodygoody girl and the typical bishounen guys that the girls are head over heels for. Then you have the various girls that are in love with the MC (One is more open, the other is the typical conservative shy soft spoken girl).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is really really good. I honestly only watched this for Zessica Wong (she's cute :3) but I wound up enjoying the show a lot. It reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier + Isekai No Seikishi Monogatari which happens to be my favorite anime :3\\n\\n\r\nENJOY IT and don't forget! ZESSICA IS #1 F*CK MIKONO\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I finished watching the first season. I recommend it to those of you that want to a get a better feeling of the whole Aquarion history. However, it is not necessary to watch S1. All you basically need to know is that 12000 years ago 2 lovers fought to save the world from destruction and through self sacrifice they were separated from each other, destined to fall in love again when they were \"reincarnated\". It's basically a recurring 12k year cycle of lovers. All of this information is shown in EVOL (episode 1 for that matter).\\n\\n\r\nIf you would like to get to know more about the past lives of some of the characters you should watch S1. You can see how Kagura and Apollo share MANY traits which leads viewers to believe he is the true reincarnation of Apollo, yet Amata has the Sun Wings. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you watch S1 you still won't understand why Mykage does what he does or why he looks like the dude from S1 (forgot his name... wait it's Toma, now I'm too lazy to change what I just wrote -____-) \\n\\n\r\nBasically the reincarnations as I see it are:\\n\\n\r\nAmata/Kagura = Apollo\\n\r\nSilvia = who cares, she's a betch :3\\n\r\nToma = Zessica (can't say why because that's a spoiler, message me if you want to discuss)\\n\r\nSilvia's Brother = who cares, he's a loser. Seriously, he really is. Go watch season 1.",

            "content": "If there was one thing that absolutely stood out for me in Aquarion EVOL, it was the artwork. Aquarion EVOL shines brightest in its absolutely gorgeous setting and consistent animation. Each location is drawn with such care and beauty and there were plenty of places for us to see. The artwork is what I'd would call \"eyegasmic\" or \"scenery porn\". It was a completely positive surprise. As of 2012, I can only list a handful of TV series that had such amazing artwork on display.\r\nUnfortunately, aside from the delightfully eyegasmic setting it was in, the story and characters leave a bit to be desired. Atit's core, it's not a story to be taken seriously. Like the prequel, there are a lot of ridiculous and ludicrous events that happen throughout the show. How about a punch move that wraps the entire planet just to punch the enemy into space? How about each time the characters combine into the Aquaria mech they experience near-orgasms? If you can suspend a great amount of belief, you can enjoy this show since there are lots of funny and exciting material here. For some, the lack of a serious and well-thought out story can really be a disappointment. Indeed, the story in Aquarion EVOL had a lot of potential. The villains of Altair and their motives belong in a moral gray area, but the planet Altair is mostly left undeveloped and unexplored as the credit rolled. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters also suffer from wasted potential in terms of depth and attitude. The main characters, especially, come off quite shallow and frankly, annoying. Both Amata and Mikono are shy and often unreliable, and they often misunderstood each other for both comedic purposes and really shallow and cliche reasons. On the opposite spectrum is Kagura - the bad boy villain who lusts over Mikono and Zessica - the scantily dressed confident girl who lusts over Amata. These main characters came off as largely one-dimensional. While they do receive character development, it was often too late in the series to really appreciate them. Kagura's sudden change of character near the end is frankly just sloppy writing. Their one-dimensional personalities became repetitive quickly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter writing was undoubtedly not a strong point of Aquarion Evol. However, the side characters certainly were pretty entertaining even if they were one-dimensional. There is Andy W. Hole who is completely obsessed with holes, Mix who is obsessed with neatness, the loli president Crea who amuse with weird puns, the immortal Fudou who speaks in riddles, and many more. Their character interactions are usually amusing to watch even if the main characters comes off as annoying and boring.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode often starts with light-hearted character interactions, and usually ends with the mech Aquarion in action against an opponent mech. The CG in these fights is really obvious and differs in style from the beautifully rendered artwork, but it doesn't really take away any entertainment value. Combat flows fluidly and is entertaining in general since each fight seem to end really differently. Sometimes, it's just not enough to destroy an opponent with a punch. Aquarion EVOL will punch with such profound disregard to physics that will make other mecha series tame in comparison. Still, the problem with Aquarion EVOL is each episode becomes formulaic. The series is what I'd call mindlessly entertaining, but it really could've had more depth if it spend more time developing the villains and developing the world instead of spending time on flat characters and formulaic mech fights.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the presentation value is really high and I was pleasantly surprised. AKINO returns to this sequel with catchy j-pop insert themes and OP/ED credits. The soundtrack is varied with grand orchestra pieces, solo piano or violin pieces, as well as light-hearted or solemn moody pieces. Character models are pleasing to look at and remains in quality even if zoomed out. And of course, the gorgeous landscapes and space artwork whether it was day or night made lasting and unforgettable impressions. Words can't really describe the beauty I've seen, but I highly recommend it if anyone enjoys what the anime medium could offer in looks.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Aquarion EVOL was an enjoyable series full of heart and ridiculous combat, albeit often ending up as melodramatic and exaggerated. The artwork and sound are gorgeous and catchy, but the story and characters came off as wasted potential. For someone looking for a serious and well-thought plot with realistic characters, this is definitely not the series for you. But if you are simply looking for some fun, Aquarion EVOL is definitely an entertaining series.",

And when i saw the trailer i saw Good looking characters and animation, and i could tell right away it was of a Romance genre. This show has alot of Fan service, but some of the fan service thats shown is shown when they begin to use the Aquarion as a group and i wont spoil what its called\r\n(Im guessing thats what those robots are called since they always shout out \"GO. AQUARIOON\" when they start to fight which can give a corny feel. I watched it all but if i sound ignorant ofit its cause i watched it a few months ago.) \\n\\n\r\nSo the \"Fanservice\" during those parts can get corny. \\n\r\nIt definitely has some funny moments so you will laugh while watching it, but most of it is based on the romance. \\n\\n\r\nNow the story....im not gonna spoil it but the story is understandable but its explained horribly, you just have to use the information you get while watching it to get the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is very hard to explain because it is hard to understand while watching it. I havent watched the Original Aquarion because others told me this is the second season, and i heard the first is better than this one.\\n\\n\r\nIts watchable, but if you have other anime you know has good recommendations and you're itching to watch those then go ahead and put this one on hold.",

            "content": "Aquarion Evol is not an anime to be taken literally. It is saturated with an abundance of metaphors and symbolism; some painfully and intentionally obvious whiles others subtle. Nevertheless, it is not particularly intelligent and never makes any attempts at being profound. Aquarion Evol distinguishes itself from others with its ostensibly ludicrous gimmicks: homosexual angels and donut philosophy to name a couple. Most significantly, however, is the amount of passion and love that pervades the series. Evol spelled backwards is love, and is filled to the brim with exactly that.  \r\nAquarion Evol is a dog bereaved of life, revived, and bestowed with wings. Itis conceived and directed by Kawamori Shoji, known for his works teeming with passion such as the Macross series and AKB0048. Aquarion Evol may not be his best work to date in terms of quality, but it is the absolute pinnacle of his creations in spirit. Set 12,000 years after Genesis of Aquarion, it renews the legend that the first series paved way for. Evol is not dependent on the original; it gives the audience bits and pieces of backstory throughout its duration, as well as incorporating an exposition episode which contextualizes all prior events. I have not seen the original myself, and the standalone experience of Evol was nonetheless seamless.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is the ugly duckling: scorned for unsightliness, but an ethereal swan from the start. The intricate backstory notwithstanding, the premise of Aquarion Evol is simple and trite. Set in a city constantly terrorized by \u201cAbductors\u201d who kidnap women for unknown purposes, Sora Amata and Suzushiro Mikono are forced to enroll in a school for people with supernatural abilities that pilot mechas known as Aquaria. The nearly banal story then gradually escalates into an ambitious tale of fallen angels and inter-dimensional love. Similar premises have been seen countless times before, but Evol adds to it its heart. As the grandeur of the story unfolds, the audience is presented with an exceedingly corny story that despite its seeming unoriginality is bursting with genuine passion. Aquarion Evol exudes such love and imagination that it is difficult to blame it for being clich\u00e9d. Ultimately, Evol can be seen as a massive allegory for the indiscriminate power of love which, both figuratively and literally, brings worlds together.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is a boy helplessly in love: mistaken for indecency, but with feelings ever so pristine. The public often fallaciously presume that Evol is filled with vulgar or lowbrow humour. Indeed, the robots are fueled by bodily communion and metaphorical orgasms. Though sexual it may be; vulgar it is not. Evol treats sexuality with utmost earnestness, approaching it indirectly through metaphors and symbolism. The mecha battling is another appropriate example of Evol\u2019s tactfulness: the combat not only advances the story or provides enjoyment, it serves primarily as a platform for character growth and thematic development. During combat, the characters confront themselves as well as their enemies, and the battles are usually accompanied by some sort of symbolic exploration into sexuality or love. This is not to say that Evol is completely devoid of pandering, but the earnestness with which it is handled makes it forgivable. \\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is a puzzle; its fragments hollow of meaning are but emergence potentials for its, if assembled, holistic magnificence. In the presentation of its themes, Evol\u2019s characters play a far more pivotal role than anything else in the grand scheme. The cast of Evol consists of a wide array of characters; most of which are extremely likable in their simplicity. Their personalities are often defined by a single trait, and none of them are particularly complex. There is Andy W. Hol, whose obsession for digging holes embodies the desire for connecting worlds. There is the dying musician Shrade, whose love for music composition symbolizes the equilibrium between life and perilous passion. These simple characters are thematic representations more than anything else; each of them embody an abstract idea related to love, and it is through these ideas and their interplay with one another that the audience receives the messages of Evol.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is love; nothing more and no less. The greatest charm of the series is the overflowing passion emanating from every single one of its components, from its characters to its symbols. In the end, no one and nothing is cast in a negative light. Even the antagonists, who initially appear heartlessly sadistic, eventually become heart-felt characters that the audience can sympathize with. The ending beautifully wraps up all the conflicts and strife using one thing only \u2013 ephemeral yet eternal, earthly yet ethereal \u2013 love. It is a conclusion so overwhelmingly corny, yet undeniably satisfying. Evol\u2019s atmosphere is dramatically enhanced by its production values, which while not exceptional are above average in all respects. The art is sharp and detailed, the CG mecha combat is a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack is fitting to say the least as some of the more touching tunes can be tear-jerkers by themselves. The production quality is epitomized by its ending theme, which complements a gorgeously archaic montage of the characters with an ambient ballad which perfectly captures the romantic and melancholic air of the series. The producers poured all of their heart into Evol, conceiving a series that is by no means insightful, but by all measures enchanting.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It is perhaps best treated as a lengthy parable; an anime allegory for the power of love. It does not feature complex characters or tactful development; nor is there any profound exploration of humanity or society. What it does offer is its heartiness unparalleled by any other anime. With a wealth of giant robots, radiant characters, corny passion, and unwavering love, it captures the anime spirit more than most other shows do. Words cannot possibly do its magic justice; Aquarion Evol is an anime that needs to be experienced.",

            "content": "\u201cTo inherit a legend is to become a legend\u201d\r\nI first started this anime because I thought it would be about evil fishes, no joke. I translated the words at random and developed this idea that it would be like Finding Nemo with a twist. Don't find that too surprising, it insults my creativity (lets call it that) since my mind read the title as \"Aquarium Evil.\"  Anyway, I was a tad disappointed.\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; evil fishes would have made my day but I\u2019m trying to be \u201ccup half full\u201d for the New Year\u2019s crap. So I decided to watch even after the firstfive minutes confirmed that evil fishes were, in fact, nowhere present, but it was better in a way.\\n\\n\r\nFor those wondering, this is a review based on one episode (long one it is!) that I\u2019ve seen. I know nothing of this genre or if this has any previous works but there\u2019s always a first and I\u2019ll forget to write my thoughts on it later, I\u2019ll share them now:\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple of minutes create a sort illusion that Aquarion Evol is just about Sora Amata, who\u2019s name I only remember because of Kingdom Hearts. He\u2019s a loner, who works at a movie theater and is in love with a movie (Skies of Aquaria) and wishes people loved it as much as he does. While talking to a girl about his favorite movie he blushes at something she says and starts floating in air. At first I thought it was a weird-anime-guy-thing and he floated when he got turned on or something, even though that isn\u2019t weird by anime standards (meaning I\u2019ve heard/seen of weirder). I decided to postpone that thought and let the show tell me why he has to stuff his boots with metal pieces to keep from floating up.\\n\\n\r\nThe story\u2019s attention shifts and action drops into our lap (finally!).\\n\r\nWe learn about their world, how it\u2019s divided and the boys and girls don\u2019t \u201cmingle,\u201d so to speak.  How members from their force have elemental powers (can it be called that?). How Aquarion has been battling with beings from an alternate dimension who wreak havoc by kidnapping citizens from Aquarion with spirit like machines called Abductors(not very creative there but it gets the point across and if your memory sucks like mine it\u2019ll also help you remember) and take them back to their dimension. Aquarion fights back and sends their army called Aquaria to defend Aquarion.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way we get confirmation of what we already suspect, that Sora isn\u2019t an ordinary boy but a chosen one who is \u201cdestined\u201d to be fighting alongside Aquaria in his own special mecha spirit thing that he eventually unlocks by calling it by its name:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cGO! Aquarion!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cAquarion. He knows the forbidden name.\u201d -----Are you kidding me!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nice and sort of reminds me of a role playing game sometimes. The characters each have their own uniqueness even in their own particular hair color. It\u2019s a colorful world that\u2019s for sure, but it gives it the aquatic feel to it that the anime wants to express (I guess). Something\u2019s looked out of place for me, like one minute they were in a high tech building where everything seemed robotic or futuristic and the next it looked like a street in Paris. Threw me off a bit but I expected evil guppies so, eh.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, it's too soon to tell and I can't get a feel of them right of the bat, I mean I can make assumptions and say it'll be like so and so but I like to assume they'll surprise me even if they end up not doing it. The main cast pair, you know who it is right off the bat, I wasn't a fan of much after 40 minutes just because the girl is annoying, but she's cute (in an Princess Euphemia way) so that'll make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, but honestly I would only notice something is off if it didn\u2019t belong, like if Taylor Swift started playing during a fighting scene, otherwise I just notice that the music and instruments were in sync with the action scene and the mellow ones.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t a fan of all the \u201caqua\u201d to everything but I was surprised that I was enjoying the first episode more than I thought I would.\\n\r\nWhy did I keep watching this show even though I don't watch sci-fi? Well because apart from the fish thing (above) it was the one show that I clicked on that during the first five minutes didn\u2019t use the phrase, \u201cwet panties.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an entertaining show and even though I am probably not making sense in this review since I don\u2019t review non-romance anything I think it has potential and it reminds me a little of the fighting scenes in Code Geass which is the only other mecha anime I\u2019ve watched, ever. Aquarion Evol is also one of the few anime I liked from the winter lineup.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The orgasm powered robots are back and ready to kick some ass. Now at this point I would like to say that if you dont already know, this is a sequal and I will admit that you dont need to see the first to understand this, I think you still should, because you will be able to appreciate this more. \r\nThe original was good but the main problem I had was that I didnt really think a whole lot of the characters. There wasnt that one guy that I was like, hey I can relate to this; it just didnt happen. Here however they dida far better job creating appealing characters which is the biggest step up in my book. Another change is that the show isnt about the orgasm powered robots, in fact they kinda go away from that. I like that because while I can say it was funny as hell at first it got old after so long and I was scared that that was all it was gonna be for a second season. Instead its used more in a symbolic nature, saying yeah thats whats up, but we're not here to make a vulgar display. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself starts 12000 years after the stuff in Aquarion goes down, and as you probably know it follows the reincarnates of those characters, and of course the characters before that. As was the case in Aquarion, Evol follows a group of teenageish characters as they pilot Aquarion to save the world from abductors. It focuses on their relationships with one another and shit like that, but at the same time it is able to maintain an interesting story that keeps you going all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the story does is this: it changes alot of stuff that happenned in the original Aquarion, as in details that mattered alot to the story. This was risky because if you start changing stuff people can become confused, but I didnt and I doubt anyone will because they do such a good job in just the overall story-telling effort. It answers all of your questions which is very very important in any show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. I thought that the art in the original was pretty decent but damn, this just takes it all up several notches. The fight scenes are terrific and everything is so clear. The character models are done far better than in Aquarion and that was just fantastic to see.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters themselves. As ive already said, the characters were far more appealing to me this time around and I found myself rooting for them, which is something that didnt happen in the original. It follows Amata and his friend (who he'd like to be more than friends with) Mikono as they enter the Neo-deava academy and become elements for Aquaria. As you should have figured out by now, or will shortly these are supposed to be the reincarnates of celian and apollonius which is kinda true but at the same time not and as it goes on you'll see what i mean. Also in this you have a villain who looks suspiciously like Amata and some others make return appearances such as that shadow-angel dude from Aquarion and that crazy bastard Fudo shows up(yeah 12,000 years later). \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progressed, it got more and more tragic. There are just sad situations and the whatnot popping up everywhere at a point and I was all depressed and shit like \"aw damn, this is gonna have a sad ending\" which was the vibe I was getting. The actual ending though is very good and all the sad stuff that goes down at least gets brought to points where theres closure if nothing else. The ending also provides an actual end, by this I mean that the whole 12,000 year repeating cycle can finally be ended by the end to this.\\n\\n\r\nOn a whole I was really happy with this show. It had subtle humor, good characters, orgasmic animation(sorry I just had to use that pun) and it fixed alot of the crap that Aquarion didnt do so hot with. I will recomend thsi to anyone who liked the original, hell, Ill recomend this if you didnt like the original because this is just on such a higher level. Enjoy.",

            "content": "This Is the 2nd season Of Aquarion. Its By Kawamori Shoji and is currently writing the manga as well. I officially liked the ending but really needs a third season because it didn't describe or answer many questions about the previous series. I'm happy for this anime but a few of the fans are hating cause it had an alternate ending to it.The other Aquarion was more serious,in a way. This starts with a boy named Amata who goes to a village and meets a girl named Mikono, they share deep love connection to each other. This season is about destiny,faith and Forbidden love(That everyaffection that everybody has, yeah its forbidden). Even a few Shadow angels are reincarnated here and want world domination against humans and want to be with there favorite angel but don't get the love...eh to bad. Love makes you do crazy things in life, Good and bad times. \\n\\n\r\nI really loved the story but I wish they make more episodes for the season..like an \"ongoing\" Anime or something. I liked the Art because it felt more new than the before series.The only thing I didn't like about it was that they didn't answer every question about everybody. By the way don't let a shadow angel use Aquarion..It doesn't look to well. I was also happy that they had new Aquarion vectors and names for them.\\n\\n\r\nI chose a 7 for the Story cause It didn't feel like it actually answered enough questions about everyone. I still like the story and characters with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art was a 10 because its different than the other that Its stunning with everything around it. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was a 10, because the music and the attacks had the same melody as The first series did, which was good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters was a 10 because every character stayed in there place during the series. They listen and help one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was a 9 and Overall was 10, I really enjoyed watching it so I recommend you go watch it if you haven't seen it yet. Its great and new chapter for you as well.",

            "content": "Mikono X Amata..........awesome, so finally this 26 episode anime has ended, so what now? Duuuuh, I guess, I'd probabaly say that this is all good, the genres indicated like Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Mecha, Romance and Sci-fi did proved well  for this anime, ok so there is that  fujoshi element in the last episode of this thing which for me is EEEEEEEWWWWW. But then again the romance genre has the most impact in the story so for the \"Story\" part I'd give it a \"Very Good\" number 8, since I like the main plot were there are challenges that comes with Amata's quest forMikono's heart, aside from it every episode has its own set of climatic thing in it which make the whole 26 episode worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI just have nothing to say about these parts, since the art is similary with \"Sousei No Aquarion.\" Plus, the fanservice is kinda off, though Zessica looks hot in her skimpy outfit. As for the sound, I kinda like the mechs changing theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the romantic role that Amata and Mikono played as lovers who are fighting to reverse the destinity that keeps them apart, also I kind like that role of Andy breaking into Mix's heart I guess you may say that the comedy genre of this anime is them, as for the other characters like Sharade, Cayenne, Kaguya and Mallory they really did their part well as part of the  of this anime for as they represent the anime's action genre . I also like that the antagonist is solely reside in Mykage, in fact his role is a total representation of evil behind that angelic look. For Fudo.... well I guess since this anime has a fantasy genre, he may well be that genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so for me, to give it such rating is because I've always expected that the arc would be a Mikono X Amata arc and it did happen, ok so most would expect a Kaguya X Mikono arc and a Zessica x Amata arc.....good thing it didn't happend which it the enjoyable part of the anime. Overall, this anime is worth watching every episode and this is one anime which you don't have to watch its prequel, since the way that  Mari Okada of studio Satelight created it can stand on its own. In fact you might say that it is unrelated to the prequel- even if it is, then again who cares? This anime is all good, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that Satelight studios would make another sequel or a spin-off of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBtw: Mykage X Fudo (or Apollonius) arc?????????EEEEEEWWWWWW I hate shonen-ai or should I say Otoku-ai. No offends to LGBT's out there, just my personal opinion.\\n\\n",

But if you don't have anything to watch and are itching for some corny romance and fanservice aboard big mechas, then go ahead and enjoy the show.  Once I got what the show was about, I was able to enjoy it fully. \r\nI was drawn to the series by its colorful and pretty animation, and the show doesn't disappoint in this regard.The story as a whole doesn't make much sense to me but, as stated before, we are not here for the plotbut for the romance and big mecha fights!   \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are pretty silly and overdramatic (and also a bunch of horny teenagers). The show delivers its load of bishounens and bishoujos at will and it focuses on their relationships with the other gender by slapping some ridiculous situations, cheesy lines and metaphors as subtle as... an elephant in a room maybe? I found myself snorting at how silly the whole ordeal was.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, if you are here to watch mecha fights, you will be served.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is pretty enjoyable, if you are into that.   \\n",

Some obvious similarities are drawn in the first episodebetween Amata/Kagura (Evol) and Apollo (Genesis)...and Mikono (Evol) and Sylvia (Genesis). \\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to also hear some of my favourite Genesis Akino songs reused in this series. \\n\\n\r\nBut my favourite part of the series is the clash between the mysterious Kagura character with the humble Amata. Both desire \"the hand\" of Mikono but both share a secret that makes the relationship between the three so much more complicated than \"just another love triangle\".\\n\\n\r\nSo for those who love action mixed with romance, this is definitely the anime for you.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nSo, as always, Aquarion as a franchise is a mixed bag.  The original series received quite a bit of criticism for both its throwbacks to older style \"Super Robot\" anime, as well as for an at-times silly set of subplots surrounding its characters.  The original conceits of the series were often cringe-inducing as well: the action of the series focuses aroudn Aquarion, which is a giant robot formed of 3 \"vectors\" which combined into a giant robot, accompanied by the pilots undergoing a \"gattai\" (union) which results in them, well, orgasming.  \r\nAquarion Evol is not going to do much for peoplewho disliked the original series, and in fact may not be a great show for people who loved it, either.  I do think that there's a lot to enjoy here, particularly if you are a fan of romance + giant robots or the original series itself.  Just don't expect too much.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The Soundtrack is by the always wonderful Yoko Kanno, with frequent vocals by AKINO.  If you're a little older-school anime fan like me, you might find yourself wishing that Yoko Kanno had collaborated with Maaya Sakamoto instead, but AKINO has plenty to offer here, and once again displays some quite good English skills (which makes sense, since the singer and her siblings all hail from Utah by way of Mesa, Arizona) alongside a strong voice seemingly made for belting out Yoko Kanno classics.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of new music on display however, other than the OP/ED themes and a few insert songs.  Most of the music is recycled from the first series, but rather than seeming lazy or cheap on the part of the producers, I think that the music does a great job of tying together the two series, which is doubly important since there are only a few characters in common, the character designs are a little different, and Aquarion and Aquarion EVOL are also separated by a 12,000 year gap.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the rest of the sound, which is to say it's inoffensive.  Aside from several of the female characters having your usual squeaky childlike voices and one character (Schrade) sounding like he had a cold the entire time, the cast does a decent job with their characters.  The sound effects and environmental sound are good, and fit well with the fight scenes and quiet scenes alike.  \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION:  The character designs and actual animation are great in this show, presumably because SATELIGHT used all their money on the digipaint scenes after saving a boatload by reusing assets from the first series.  The character designs, provided by Chinatsu Kurahana, Kana Ishida, & Hirotaka Marufuji are vibrant, unique, and make it visually easy to distinguish between characters.  There are a few weird choices here (like the prudish Mix wearing a dress that lifts and flaunts her breasts to an absurd degree) but all of it seems fitting with the tone of the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the original series, the 3dcg itself is not great, but then, it never is in anime.  Animations can be jerky, as if there aren't enough 'tween frames, and the mecha often have very stilted and awkward movements.  They do their best to work around these limitations, and since I didn't turn the series off in disgust I guess that they succeeded.  \\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTER:  This is where the good turns a little towards bad.  Way too much time is spent on side characters (particularly the duo of happy, perverted ANDY W HOLE and prudish, frosty MIX) and the main romance never gets much development.  Worse, the main character is written (on purpose) to be indecisive and passive, which really saps the enjoyment from watching him.  There's a lot to be praised here for the way that main characters confront their feelings for each other head-on, and the willingness to develop some of the relationships in the series far beyond the usual \"confession in the last 30s of the series\" bullshit, but the truth of the matter is that head writer Mari Okada didn't seem to find much interesting in the relationship between Amata and Mikono, and it shows.  As I said before, we spend a lot of time with the characters Jin and Yunoha, and MIX and Andy, and while both of their arcs have relatively satisfying conclusions, Amata and Mikono seem to come together in the end (after 26 episodes of Mikono waffling about Amata and his evil twin Kagura) more because they should for plot reasons than because they seemed a good fit together.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, we spend a lot of time doing silly \"anime trope\"-ish episodes: a school festival, a beach episode, etc etc etc.  While none of them are BAD per se, they are also not particularly good either.  The little bit of character growth we get during them is usually ignored completely next episode.  \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, whereas the theme of the original Aquarion may have been \"love as destiny\" this series clearly embraces the idea of \"love in spite of it\".  Kagura claims to have been born to love Mikono who is a reincarnation of Aquarion's Silvia, but Amata (her eventual choice) loves her for herself, not because of some 12,000 year long arc towards a destined ending.  Likewise, most of the other characters in the show do not seem interested in finding out about their previous lives the way Apollo, Silvia, &c in the first season were.  Instead they are all focused on their love and relationships in the here and now, and to hell with what your past lives wanted.  \\n\\n\r\nI will say, one thing this show does fantastically is present homosexual love and homosocial relationships in a positive, engaging manner.  Schrade and Cayenne are clearly deeply in love, but their relationship is hardly even commented on by the other characters except to present sympathy when the inevitable occurs. Meanwhile, while Toma & Mikage may technically be non-gendered or genderqueer, they both present as masculine, as do the objects of their love, Apollon.  This is not presented a prurient, or weird, or even worthy of mention: they simply love each other in a way that shows gender has no meaning in love.  Much later in the series as well, MIX is transformed into a man but Andy doesn't even blink: it doesn't matter to him.  he loves Mix the person, not Mix the walking pair of breasts with some glasses perched on top.  And while this may seem a little too \"perfect\", it also shows excellent growth in the character from his roots at the beginning of the show where he was desperate to sneak into the girls' side of the dormitory to get himself a peek at some \"big bangs.\"\\n\\n\r\nOther than the diffuse focus on the cast and the at-time silly one-off episodes however,the biggest thing that bothered me is retconning.  The identity of Apollo is retconned during Aquarion EVOL,  and while Shoji Kawamori insists this was always part of the plan, There certainly was no evidence in the original Genesis of Aquarion series (there may have been in the OVA released later, but I have not seen that).  This changes the nature of the ending of the original series, and changes Toma's character (and his reincarnation in Mikage) substantially, seemingly only because this was the need of having an angel as a villain to manipulate everyone else.  \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, it's about time for me to wrap this one up, and I will say that despite my complaints, I enjoyed my time with Aquarion EVOL and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take as a given the silly trappings of the Aquarion universe (gattai as sex, bad cgi robots, totally ignoring forced gattais as metaphors for rape, etc) and enjoy a series that tries its hardest to fit in some shallow meditations on the nature of love and the connections between humans in between the giant robot fights and eye candy.  Just don't expect too much depth here, and prepare for a lot of silliness.",

I would always wait every week for this anime. This anime has everything I'm looking for; Cute Girls, Robots, Comedy and Romance.\r\n  At first i had no clue where this anime was going, so i deiced to watch the first season \"Genesis of Aquarion\". It was okay, ijust needed a clue what the whole series was about. Mostly about fight invaders who were harvesting humans so they could stay alive or so, and the only way to stop them are to use these people so called \"elements\" to pilot a Robot.\\n\\n\r\n  Aquarion Evol revolves around a boy name Amata which i THINK who is the recreation or Apollo. Amata is a boy who is an element (he has wings in his feet) user who meets a girl name Mikono and starts liking her. Mikono seems to be a shy and timid type of person. They then get involve in the Robot fighting with the invaders, and then has been made to stay at this school that is separated between girls and boy. Lets just put it to that for now, I'm still watching. (x\\n\\n\r\n  To be honest this anime will drag you in, with great art as if you are watching in HD, and with also great Opening and Ending songs. I love the Characters.

            "content": "Before I begin let me say that I used to kinda like the series when the first episode came out. Then as the series progresses it began to suck even more and more. To the point of feeling unconformable to even watch an episode due to the plot and character interaction. That reminds the the PLOT.....YEAH THE PLOT after 12000 years after the first series the new characters have some similarities of the old series back in 2005 but that didn't help from preventing itself from SUCKING EVEN MORE. I forgot about most of the story because it became convoluted to the point of confusionalso it makes kingdom hearts story like reading abcs. The only thing good about this one is the art design THAT'S ABOUT IT JUST PRETTY COLORS AND NOTHING ELSE!! The OST forgettable as HELL FOR A MECHA ANIME COME MAN PUT SOME ELECTRIC GUITARS, DRAMATIC ORCHESTRA OR EVEN BLOOD PUMPING ENERGETIC TECHNO MUSIC. That's my review of this series and I wonder how in the living heck I manged to watch 18 episodes or 25",

            "content": "The series definitely started off strong, and had alot more going on between characters then the prequel which focused mostly on slyvia and apollo's relationship. It was great all the way up till they throw in probably one of the most pathetic plot twists I've ever seen, that being completely ruining the story of the first one, which had a pretty much well ingrained fact that apollo was the reincarnation of apollonius. But they throw that out and say that he wasn't bust instead hes the reincarnation of the dog, which isn't shown in the previous series at all, maybe the other retelling they showhim but other then that he never existed in the prior series. \\n\\n\r\nIt was at this point I lost all enjoyment from the series, as I enjoyed the previous series although melodramatic, it still came around for a decent romance drama. Which was founded on the fact apollo was apollonius that gets thrown out the window near the end of this show. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the horrible turn of events for the story, the characters are good and develop very well, they entertain multiple relationships between characters which is nice. I mean theres not much to say besides the story was going well until that horrific twist, other then that it was pretty good.",

Though I do prefer Amata over Kagura, Amata barely did anything outside of his stupid robot! \r\nI may be a little harsh on this anime, but I cannot say I absolutely enjoyed it! The plot was great! The mechs fights were ok, the romance was a bitdull(still Ok)! The music was amazing! They could've easily done a better job on this anime, but they decided not to. If I were to make this anime better. I would add something like Amata suddenly becoming badass and actually standing up to Kagura!\\n\\n\r\nAlso btw Mikono was the most useless(she says so herself) anime girl I have ever seen! But she was the cutest(obviously) girl that got paired up with an ugly ass guy Amata! Though Zessica and Amata would have been a better match, I still like AmataXMikono better.",

            "content": "(Note: this review covers the whole series' content and has done so forever, but MAL stuck a little yellow tag on here that says \"preliminary\")\r\nAquarion EVOL. It's been 12,000 quarter-days since the first series came out back in 2005 and now it's been reincarnated for the new era. First, some history:\r\nTo my knowledge, not many people liked Genesis of Aquarion. It was an overly melodramatic, awkward, very episodic and somewhat girly mecha series where the robots were essentially powered by orgasms(You read that right) and it had to compete in an era where good mecha anime was still a thing. It was a show thatcouldn't take itself seriously even when it was trying to take itself seriously. Audience response was mostly apathetic, but people loved the theme song and the OST had some of Yoko Kanno's best work. Hell, that OP was the sole reason I decided to blindly download the whole show on dial-up back on Christmas of '05. It took 4 months to finish, and was actually my first subbed anime.\\n\\n\r\nI loved Aquarion. It was stupid and weird in all the best ways, and to this day it's still a very different spin on the super robot genre. The melodramatic characters and their reactions to everything, the complete nonsense shouted by the leader that would lead to victory in every episode, the omnisexual, ten-way, cross-dimensional love story... All of it was just grand in retrospect. I had no idea of what to expect from this series' new art direction and the effects of a near-decade hiatus, but ho-damn am I satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion EVOL opens 12,000 years after the end of Aquarion, with the main character, Amata, watching his favorite decade-old movie that (poorly) depicts events of the prequel series' final episode. This is followed by his boss coming out and telling him \"Amata, no one likes that movie but you, really. The theme song got popular, but that's about it.\" So yeah, the opening of this new foray into the orgasm-powered mecha genre is Shoji Kawamori brazenly declaring that he gives not a single fuck to the haters out there. I can't even tell you how happy that scene made me, I felt like Amata.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, you get treated to what's easily the prettiest god damn show of the season, and maybe year, as Amata takes this big-boobed blue haired girl on a date through the rivers of neo-Venice. The environments are always painted in absolutely beautiful detail and color, and many shots are screencap worthy because of how genuinely pretty they are. I strongly suggest watching this in HD. \\n\\n\r\nThe character and world designs are all very unique and memorable, infused with an injection of sharp detail, personality and visual originality that you don't see in many anime anymore. The world and characters feel alive, and there's even two full fictional alphabets that show up in the show that contribute to this. Also, each scene is well-composed on screen and because of that, Aquarion Evol is never a bore to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, Aquarion Evol's new cast of characters is what makes it shine, at least in my opinion. Rather than the really odd focus of the first episodes of the prior series, Evol began strong by introducing a cast of lively, thought-out and memorably designed little mecha pilots and having them ping off of each other. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists are presented in a very neutral and borderline desperate way. They don't appear evil and their motivations and details about their pasts are kept as a mystery for a while, but the show gives many hints and allusions as to who they really are and keep the viewer interested rather than starve them for details.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is strong and sharp up until about 2/3rds the way through, and then it gets a little dumb near the end when old plot lines end in anticlimactic ways, pointless new plot lines appear and things get pretty drawn out in general. But then the final episode is pretty great and brings all the important stuff back to the forefront for the most part, and the series ends on a strong, melodramatic cheesy note that it should. \\n\\n\r\nThis is all in contrast to the first series, where the story and characters were a little unfocused until the final 6 or 7 and episodes, and then those were all amazing and climactic. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the titular fighting robots. Shit looks absolutely fantastic, though, honestly, the 3D animation is a bit stiff and the original Aquarion has a leg up on it in terms of good choreography and smooth movements.\\n\\n\r\nEVOL makes full and complete use of the \"orgasm when combining\" joke throughout the first episode, but actually lightens up on it as the show has progresses. So far, the only real mecha orgasm sequences have been for particularly climactic moments and new character introductions. The gag is used sparingly and after the first series it's apparent the creators took note that it alienated some people. This whole project in general looks like it's taking the widespread criticism of Aquarion both in stride and into consideration, creating a series that satisfies both old fans and newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is still amazing. If you watched the first series you'll probably recognize a number of the background tracks, remixed or reworked, along with a bunch of nice, new pieces. This show's opening theme is an orgasm of Japanese vocal work. Yoko Kanno knows what she's doing.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the base elements of Aquarion remain intact, for better or worse. It's still pretty cheesy and melodramatic, but this time they're hamming it up even more while at the same time keeping a good focus on down-to-earth elements like the cast, for the most part. I appreciate the hell out of it, but I'm sure some people still won't 'get' it. It's also still really, really pretty and the energy produced by the visuals and sounds carry the show's asinine writing like a thoroughly lubed bullet train.\\n\\n\r\n\"So should I watch the first series before getting into this one?\"\\n\\n\r\nYes. Or at least maybe the OVAs to get a feel for the characters and stuff. One of the main draws of this series (for me) was that it's actively referenced Aquarion quite a bit, such as one of the main villains basically being an evil version of the main character in the first show. Kawamori's also stated that the main cast in this show are reincarnations of the previous cast. Eventually learning how the two stories and their characters will tie together is going to be, as I predict, one of the most rewarding aspects of EVOL. So if you want to enjoy Evol as much as you can, experience the previous project a little bit first.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, honestly, while Evol might be more \"likable\", Aquarion was a better put-together show in the end, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n\"They... orgasm in the robot? that's stupid!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd ironically this show has far less ecchi and has more thoughtful writing than any series it's directly competing with. But really now, you probably just got done watching tit-infused garbage like Lagrange, you can't criticize this show lmao\\n\\n\r\n\"So, is it better than Lagrange, the other girly mecha show this year?\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, in just about every single possible way, shape and form.\\n\\n\r\n\"Is Fudo Gen in it? He was the only good thing about Aquarion\"\\n\\n\r\nYes, and he's a fucking pirate ohmygodit'sgreat\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol gave me colorgasms and excitement for something to see every week for half a year, and I hope it did the same for everyone else. Give it a shot.",

            "content": "One sentence: Stupidity at its best\r\nIntro: \r\nAquarion Evol is about a legenday robot named Aquarion, that takes diffrent forms with various powers, it is about an alien civilization that lost their reproductive capabilities thus being on the verge of extinction.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nAquarion Evol is about 2 planets that are the setting for the story of 2 gay angel-men in love, then 1 of them (Avallon) goes straight and falls in love with a human girl. The one that got dumped, (Mykage) wants his revenge and after 24 thousand years he still seeks revenge, he is the villain of this series. \r\nThe story takes place in thepresent, 24 thousand years after the gay break up. We have the reincarnation of the woman that caused the break up, Mikono, and the former gay couple, Avallon and the white haired dude, Mykage. We find out that Avallon got separated in a good side, Amato, and an evil side, Kagura. Both sides of Avallon are fighting for the same girl, Mikono, the reincarnation of Avallon\u2019s former sweetheart. \\n\r\nIt contains lots of pointless, sickening drama, lots of annoying characters overreacting and talking about their first time \u201emerging\u201d in robots like they are loosing their virginity and lots of gibberish talk trying to sound celever, complex and deep. After a while hearing the characters talking about \u201emerging\u201d like they are having sex, you ask yourself, why don\u2019t they just have sex? \\n\r\nThere is a lot of useless drama, for instance, the Djin drama. They all know him for 2 days then discover he is a spy sent by the enemy and after he dies, all the characters are heartbroken and they keep showing these pathetic scenes of Djin being alive, characters saying pathetic lines like \u201eI wish Djin was here\u201d, \u201eLet\u2019s do this for Djin\u201d, \u201eI want to be with Djin\u201d and characters being sad because of his death for the next 5 episodes. Really? You knew him for 2 days and he was a spy anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters are generic, cliched, pathetic, irritating and constantly overreacting.\\n\r\nAmato is the good side of Avallon and the MC, but he has no charisma, not a particulary strong character or special abilities, he is not the smartest in the bunch either. Amato is just a nice guy that is doing his best to get the girl he loves, there is not much else to his character. \\n\r\nThe female lead, Mikono, is your generic damsel in distress, she is mostly crying, whining and having mixed emotions over Amata and Kagura. \\n\r\nMikono once said \u2013 \u201eI\u2019ve worked to hard to stop now\u201d and I\u2019m just sitting there thinking \u201eExactly what the fuck have you been doing that is so hard?\u201d.\\n\r\nKagura, the evil side of Avallon, is the generic \"cool\" character that wants to steal Mikono from Amata, creating pointless drama.\\n\r\nThe support characters are just there, you will forget about them as soon as you finish the series, at least they were not as annoying as the main characters (Amato, Kagura, Mikono).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation is decent, mostly fluid but nothing special or memorable about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe openings are decent but ultimately forgettable, the OST is just bad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI have not enjoyed one second of Aquarion Evol, not the fight scenes, not the backgrounds, not the dialogue, nothing. It is a series that makes you throw up in your mouth and it is a insult to the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the series is: Love conquers all, in the end, love ended the conflict between the two planets and as a symbolic idea, the strongest form of Aquarion was named \"EVOL\" backwards spelled resulting in \"LOVE\".\\n\\n\r\nMemorable ludicrous and idiotic lines: \\n\r\n\u201eThe reasons holes are made is to bring people toghether\u201d; \\n\r\n\u201eI want to fill the hole in you\u201d;\\n\r\n\u201eHey wretched bitch, make up your mind!\u201d; \\n\r\n\u201eBoy or girl, we\u2019ll be toghether\u201d;\\n\r\n\u201eGibberish Talk\u201d;\\n\r\nThese are a small portion of the stupidity this series delivers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.8/10\\n\r\nOne sentence: Stupidity at its best. This is truly a series that makes you feel sick and at the same time bothers you with the stupidity it contains. The only reason I don't rate it as a 1/10 is the fact that people actually worked to create this crap anime. I regret watching it and I DO NOT recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\r\nCharacter - 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 1\\n\r\nOverall - 2",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so please bare with me, but for this series I felt like I needed to write my opinion of it.\r\nStory:\r\nEpisodes 1 - 13 = 7\r\nNow, the series started off very good, I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it was enough to pull me in and get me interested in the series. It was lighthearted and comedy filled at points, but it also had plenty enough action and mystery involved to keep you looking forward to what might come next.\r\nEpisodes 14 - 21 = 5\r\nUnfortunately at this point, the story seems to start getting thrown all overthe place. Some episodes I liked and some were just not so good... and I'm sad to say that it continued to get worse.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 22 - 26 = 2\\n\r\nThis is where everything in the plotline just falls apart. Revelations and twists are made and it all seems to turn into a horrible joke. It didn't end well either as there will a lot of plotholes and loose-ends in the series that were left unanswered. You know it's bad when you root for the antagonist in the series to win and hope that the heros will lose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plotline was decent, but definitely no where near amazing.\\n\r\nTotal Average: 4.5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nTha animation quality was overall pretty, but not overly fantastic, especially since the CG wasnt really well done on some points. It had a lot of recycled footage through out the anime and unfortunately the reused footage from Sousei no Aquarion stuck out like a sore thumb against Evol's animation. But for the most part it was very pretty to look at, especially the first ending.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAh, the saving grace of the show and probably one of the few things I will remember from Evol. The music is just astounding; I could listen to it all day and not get tired of it. Gekkou Symphonia, Paradoxical Zoo, Eve no Danpen, Kimi no Shinwa, Yunoha no Mori, Aquaria Mau Sora... they're all wonderful songs, there's not one I do not like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMain Characters = 2\\n\r\nThe main characters are some of the worst I have ever experienced in a show. I started off liking Amata quite a bit; he was a weak willed character but he seemed very devoted and it looked as if he would develop into a stronger character; how wrong was I. He continued to be weak and couldn't seem to function without Mikono around; it was unbearable to watch him near the end.  I think most will agree with me when I say that I definitely won't miss his \"MIKONO-SAAAAAAAAANNNN!\"\\n\r\nMikono... she starts off as quite a snotty character a little bit in the beginning and shes always looking down on herself and calling herself useless... at one point it seemed that she stepped up and looked as if she would actually do something and help out, but in the end, remains to be useless and forever stuck in the damsel in distress mode.\\n\r\nZessica- as much as I love Zessica, she was a poorly developed character. She started off amazing and had the potential to be a great person, but gets stuck in her mopey and dull self as her unrequited love for Amata beats her down repeatedly into a deeper depression. If Zessica's character taught me one thing, it's that no matter how you try to go against fate/ destiny, you can't and it will beat you down.\\n\r\nKagura started off as an interesting character, but I also think he was poorly developed. Has a very beast-like personality and his sole focus is to get Mikono and anyone in his way will get hurt/killed... there's really not much else to him. But the thing that will continue to bug me to the end of days is his OOC'ness at the very end of the series... he is suddenly shown capable of being a human being and rather intellectual when that was definitely not the case from before.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting Characters = 8\\n\r\nThe supporting characters, to me at least, outshown the main characters by far. Jin and Yunoha were some of my favorites, separately they were both very good, but when they were together, something sparked and they quickly became my favorite love interest in the show. Andy and Mix provided a lot of comedy, especially when they were together, but their love at the end really moved me. Both JinxYunoha and AndyxMix were by far better love interests than AmataxMikono and much more enjoyable. The other side characters were also very enjoyable in their own way- Cayenne and Shrade, along with Sazanka and Malloy were just wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nTotal Average: 5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThe first half of the series was very enjoyable and I was always looking forward to the next episode, unfortunately my high expectations from the first half led to a lot of disappointment in the second half. It became a trainwreck; the plotline became something that I didn't look forward to and I found myself groaning at a lot of scenes or just not really caring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI think it was my high expectations from the first half that led to my great disappointment, but Evol just stands as average to me. The terrible plotline, poorly developed main characters, and lack of enjoyment for the second half really hit me. Despite the not so good things, there was still enjoyment from the supporting cast and especially from Mykage(whom was a great villain), so overall it wasn't terribly awful, I just felt it could have been handled better.",

            "content": "I haven't watched the first season (don't really need to imho since they basically bring up the past a lot of times and you really only need a few tidbits to get whats going on). However, I will be watching the first season after this season is over to get a better feel of the story.\r\nStory: The story is really good imo. You have 2 guys who clash together in order to win over the girl they love. The season isn't over yet but in my opinion it feels like 1 side represents \"old love/destined love\" and the other represents \"new love/breaking chains of fate\".It's a typical space/sci-fi/school life anime where a boy gets involved in a cross-planetary war and his whole life is changed. He gets introduced to various \"special\" people who possess unique powers that are used to protect the planet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is beautiful. It's basically a 2012 looking anime so of course the colors are vibrant and very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier for some reason. Music plays big rolls in major events that happen throughout the show. New powers = music, dramatic events = music, etc , etc.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are really good. You have the perverted male friend who clashes with the tsundere boy hating goodygoody girl and the typical bishounen guys that the girls are head over heels for. Then you have the various girls that are in love with the MC (One is more open, the other is the typical conservative shy soft spoken girl).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is really really good. I honestly only watched this for Zessica Wong (she's cute :3) but I wound up enjoying the show a lot. It reminds me a lot of Macross Frontier + Isekai No Seikishi Monogatari which happens to be my favorite anime :3\\n\\n\r\nENJOY IT and don't forget! ZESSICA IS #1 F*CK MIKONO\\n\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I finished watching the first season. I recommend it to those of you that want to a get a better feeling of the whole Aquarion history. However, it is not necessary to watch S1. All you basically need to know is that 12000 years ago 2 lovers fought to save the world from destruction and through self sacrifice they were separated from each other, destined to fall in love again when they were \"reincarnated\". It's basically a recurring 12k year cycle of lovers. All of this information is shown in EVOL (episode 1 for that matter).\\n\\n\r\nIf you would like to get to know more about the past lives of some of the characters you should watch S1. You can see how Kagura and Apollo share MANY traits which leads viewers to believe he is the true reincarnation of Apollo, yet Amata has the Sun Wings. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you watch S1 you still won't understand why Mykage does what he does or why he looks like the dude from S1 (forgot his name... wait it's Toma, now I'm too lazy to change what I just wrote -____-) \\n\\n\r\nBasically the reincarnations as I see it are:\\n\\n\r\nAmata/Kagura = Apollo\\n\r\nSilvia = who cares, she's a betch :3\\n\r\nToma = Zessica (can't say why because that's a spoiler, message me if you want to discuss)\\n\r\nSilvia's Brother = who cares, he's a loser. Seriously, he really is. Go watch season 1.",

            "content": "If there was one thing that absolutely stood out for me in Aquarion EVOL, it was the artwork. Aquarion EVOL shines brightest in its absolutely gorgeous setting and consistent animation. Each location is drawn with such care and beauty and there were plenty of places for us to see. The artwork is what I'd would call \"eyegasmic\" or \"scenery porn\". It was a completely positive surprise. As of 2012, I can only list a handful of TV series that had such amazing artwork on display.\r\nUnfortunately, aside from the delightfully eyegasmic setting it was in, the story and characters leave a bit to be desired. Atit's core, it's not a story to be taken seriously. Like the prequel, there are a lot of ridiculous and ludicrous events that happen throughout the show. How about a punch move that wraps the entire planet just to punch the enemy into space? How about each time the characters combine into the Aquaria mech they experience near-orgasms? If you can suspend a great amount of belief, you can enjoy this show since there are lots of funny and exciting material here. For some, the lack of a serious and well-thought out story can really be a disappointment. Indeed, the story in Aquarion EVOL had a lot of potential. The villains of Altair and their motives belong in a moral gray area, but the planet Altair is mostly left undeveloped and unexplored as the credit rolled. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters also suffer from wasted potential in terms of depth and attitude. The main characters, especially, come off quite shallow and frankly, annoying. Both Amata and Mikono are shy and often unreliable, and they often misunderstood each other for both comedic purposes and really shallow and cliche reasons. On the opposite spectrum is Kagura - the bad boy villain who lusts over Mikono and Zessica - the scantily dressed confident girl who lusts over Amata. These main characters came off as largely one-dimensional. While they do receive character development, it was often too late in the series to really appreciate them. Kagura's sudden change of character near the end is frankly just sloppy writing. Their one-dimensional personalities became repetitive quickly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter writing was undoubtedly not a strong point of Aquarion Evol. However, the side characters certainly were pretty entertaining even if they were one-dimensional. There is Andy W. Hole who is completely obsessed with holes, Mix who is obsessed with neatness, the loli president Crea who amuse with weird puns, the immortal Fudou who speaks in riddles, and many more. Their character interactions are usually amusing to watch even if the main characters comes off as annoying and boring.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode often starts with light-hearted character interactions, and usually ends with the mech Aquarion in action against an opponent mech. The CG in these fights is really obvious and differs in style from the beautifully rendered artwork, but it doesn't really take away any entertainment value. Combat flows fluidly and is entertaining in general since each fight seem to end really differently. Sometimes, it's just not enough to destroy an opponent with a punch. Aquarion EVOL will punch with such profound disregard to physics that will make other mecha series tame in comparison. Still, the problem with Aquarion EVOL is each episode becomes formulaic. The series is what I'd call mindlessly entertaining, but it really could've had more depth if it spend more time developing the villains and developing the world instead of spending time on flat characters and formulaic mech fights.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the presentation value is really high and I was pleasantly surprised. AKINO returns to this sequel with catchy j-pop insert themes and OP/ED credits. The soundtrack is varied with grand orchestra pieces, solo piano or violin pieces, as well as light-hearted or solemn moody pieces. Character models are pleasing to look at and remains in quality even if zoomed out. And of course, the gorgeous landscapes and space artwork whether it was day or night made lasting and unforgettable impressions. Words can't really describe the beauty I've seen, but I highly recommend it if anyone enjoys what the anime medium could offer in looks.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Aquarion EVOL was an enjoyable series full of heart and ridiculous combat, albeit often ending up as melodramatic and exaggerated. The artwork and sound are gorgeous and catchy, but the story and characters came off as wasted potential. For someone looking for a serious and well-thought plot with realistic characters, this is definitely not the series for you. But if you are simply looking for some fun, Aquarion EVOL is definitely an entertaining series.",

And when i saw the trailer i saw Good looking characters and animation, and i could tell right away it was of a Romance genre. This show has alot of Fan service, but some of the fan service thats shown is shown when they begin to use the Aquarion as a group and i wont spoil what its called\r\n(Im guessing thats what those robots are called since they always shout out \"GO. AQUARIOON\" when they start to fight which can give a corny feel. I watched it all but if i sound ignorant ofit its cause i watched it a few months ago.) \\n\\n\r\nSo the \"Fanservice\" during those parts can get corny. \\n\r\nIt definitely has some funny moments so you will laugh while watching it, but most of it is based on the romance. \\n\\n\r\nNow the story....im not gonna spoil it but the story is understandable but its explained horribly, you just have to use the information you get while watching it to get the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is very hard to explain because it is hard to understand while watching it. I havent watched the Original Aquarion because others told me this is the second season, and i heard the first is better than this one.\\n\\n\r\nIts watchable, but if you have other anime you know has good recommendations and you're itching to watch those then go ahead and put this one on hold.",

            "content": "Aquarion Evol is not an anime to be taken literally. It is saturated with an abundance of metaphors and symbolism; some painfully and intentionally obvious whiles others subtle. Nevertheless, it is not particularly intelligent and never makes any attempts at being profound. Aquarion Evol distinguishes itself from others with its ostensibly ludicrous gimmicks: homosexual angels and donut philosophy to name a couple. Most significantly, however, is the amount of passion and love that pervades the series. Evol spelled backwards is love, and is filled to the brim with exactly that.  \r\nAquarion Evol is a dog bereaved of life, revived, and bestowed with wings. Itis conceived and directed by Kawamori Shoji, known for his works teeming with passion such as the Macross series and AKB0048. Aquarion Evol may not be his best work to date in terms of quality, but it is the absolute pinnacle of his creations in spirit. Set 12,000 years after Genesis of Aquarion, it renews the legend that the first series paved way for. Evol is not dependent on the original; it gives the audience bits and pieces of backstory throughout its duration, as well as incorporating an exposition episode which contextualizes all prior events. I have not seen the original myself, and the standalone experience of Evol was nonetheless seamless.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is the ugly duckling: scorned for unsightliness, but an ethereal swan from the start. The intricate backstory notwithstanding, the premise of Aquarion Evol is simple and trite. Set in a city constantly terrorized by \u201cAbductors\u201d who kidnap women for unknown purposes, Sora Amata and Suzushiro Mikono are forced to enroll in a school for people with supernatural abilities that pilot mechas known as Aquaria. The nearly banal story then gradually escalates into an ambitious tale of fallen angels and inter-dimensional love. Similar premises have been seen countless times before, but Evol adds to it its heart. As the grandeur of the story unfolds, the audience is presented with an exceedingly corny story that despite its seeming unoriginality is bursting with genuine passion. Aquarion Evol exudes such love and imagination that it is difficult to blame it for being clich\u00e9d. Ultimately, Evol can be seen as a massive allegory for the indiscriminate power of love which, both figuratively and literally, brings worlds together.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is a boy helplessly in love: mistaken for indecency, but with feelings ever so pristine. The public often fallaciously presume that Evol is filled with vulgar or lowbrow humour. Indeed, the robots are fueled by bodily communion and metaphorical orgasms. Though sexual it may be; vulgar it is not. Evol treats sexuality with utmost earnestness, approaching it indirectly through metaphors and symbolism. The mecha battling is another appropriate example of Evol\u2019s tactfulness: the combat not only advances the story or provides enjoyment, it serves primarily as a platform for character growth and thematic development. During combat, the characters confront themselves as well as their enemies, and the battles are usually accompanied by some sort of symbolic exploration into sexuality or love. This is not to say that Evol is completely devoid of pandering, but the earnestness with which it is handled makes it forgivable. \\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is a puzzle; its fragments hollow of meaning are but emergence potentials for its, if assembled, holistic magnificence. In the presentation of its themes, Evol\u2019s characters play a far more pivotal role than anything else in the grand scheme. The cast of Evol consists of a wide array of characters; most of which are extremely likable in their simplicity. Their personalities are often defined by a single trait, and none of them are particularly complex. There is Andy W. Hol, whose obsession for digging holes embodies the desire for connecting worlds. There is the dying musician Shrade, whose love for music composition symbolizes the equilibrium between life and perilous passion. These simple characters are thematic representations more than anything else; each of them embody an abstract idea related to love, and it is through these ideas and their interplay with one another that the audience receives the messages of Evol.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is love; nothing more and no less. The greatest charm of the series is the overflowing passion emanating from every single one of its components, from its characters to its symbols. In the end, no one and nothing is cast in a negative light. Even the antagonists, who initially appear heartlessly sadistic, eventually become heart-felt characters that the audience can sympathize with. The ending beautifully wraps up all the conflicts and strife using one thing only \u2013 ephemeral yet eternal, earthly yet ethereal \u2013 love. It is a conclusion so overwhelmingly corny, yet undeniably satisfying. Evol\u2019s atmosphere is dramatically enhanced by its production values, which while not exceptional are above average in all respects. The art is sharp and detailed, the CG mecha combat is a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack is fitting to say the least as some of the more touching tunes can be tear-jerkers by themselves. The production quality is epitomized by its ending theme, which complements a gorgeously archaic montage of the characters with an ambient ballad which perfectly captures the romantic and melancholic air of the series. The producers poured all of their heart into Evol, conceiving a series that is by no means insightful, but by all measures enchanting.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It is perhaps best treated as a lengthy parable; an anime allegory for the power of love. It does not feature complex characters or tactful development; nor is there any profound exploration of humanity or society. What it does offer is its heartiness unparalleled by any other anime. With a wealth of giant robots, radiant characters, corny passion, and unwavering love, it captures the anime spirit more than most other shows do. Words cannot possibly do its magic justice; Aquarion Evol is an anime that needs to be experienced.",

            "content": "\u201cTo inherit a legend is to become a legend\u201d\r\nI first started this anime because I thought it would be about evil fishes, no joke. I translated the words at random and developed this idea that it would be like Finding Nemo with a twist. Don't find that too surprising, it insults my creativity (lets call it that) since my mind read the title as \"Aquarium Evil.\"  Anyway, I was a tad disappointed.\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; evil fishes would have made my day but I\u2019m trying to be \u201ccup half full\u201d for the New Year\u2019s crap. So I decided to watch even after the firstfive minutes confirmed that evil fishes were, in fact, nowhere present, but it was better in a way.\\n\\n\r\nFor those wondering, this is a review based on one episode (long one it is!) that I\u2019ve seen. I know nothing of this genre or if this has any previous works but there\u2019s always a first and I\u2019ll forget to write my thoughts on it later, I\u2019ll share them now:\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple of minutes create a sort illusion that Aquarion Evol is just about Sora Amata, who\u2019s name I only remember because of Kingdom Hearts. He\u2019s a loner, who works at a movie theater and is in love with a movie (Skies of Aquaria) and wishes people loved it as much as he does. While talking to a girl about his favorite movie he blushes at something she says and starts floating in air. At first I thought it was a weird-anime-guy-thing and he floated when he got turned on or something, even though that isn\u2019t weird by anime standards (meaning I\u2019ve heard/seen of weirder). I decided to postpone that thought and let the show tell me why he has to stuff his boots with metal pieces to keep from floating up.\\n\\n\r\nThe story\u2019s attention shifts and action drops into our lap (finally!).\\n\r\nWe learn about their world, how it\u2019s divided and the boys and girls don\u2019t \u201cmingle,\u201d so to speak.  How members from their force have elemental powers (can it be called that?). How Aquarion has been battling with beings from an alternate dimension who wreak havoc by kidnapping citizens from Aquarion with spirit like machines called Abductors(not very creative there but it gets the point across and if your memory sucks like mine it\u2019ll also help you remember) and take them back to their dimension. Aquarion fights back and sends their army called Aquaria to defend Aquarion.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way we get confirmation of what we already suspect, that Sora isn\u2019t an ordinary boy but a chosen one who is \u201cdestined\u201d to be fighting alongside Aquaria in his own special mecha spirit thing that he eventually unlocks by calling it by its name:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cGO! Aquarion!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cAquarion. He knows the forbidden name.\u201d -----Are you kidding me!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very nice and sort of reminds me of a role playing game sometimes. The characters each have their own uniqueness even in their own particular hair color. It\u2019s a colorful world that\u2019s for sure, but it gives it the aquatic feel to it that the anime wants to express (I guess). Something\u2019s looked out of place for me, like one minute they were in a high tech building where everything seemed robotic or futuristic and the next it looked like a street in Paris. Threw me off a bit but I expected evil guppies so, eh.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, it's too soon to tell and I can't get a feel of them right of the bat, I mean I can make assumptions and say it'll be like so and so but I like to assume they'll surprise me even if they end up not doing it. The main cast pair, you know who it is right off the bat, I wasn't a fan of much after 40 minutes just because the girl is annoying, but she's cute (in an Princess Euphemia way) so that'll make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, but honestly I would only notice something is off if it didn\u2019t belong, like if Taylor Swift started playing during a fighting scene, otherwise I just notice that the music and instruments were in sync with the action scene and the mellow ones.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t a fan of all the \u201caqua\u201d to everything but I was surprised that I was enjoying the first episode more than I thought I would.\\n\r\nWhy did I keep watching this show even though I don't watch sci-fi? Well because apart from the fish thing (above) it was the one show that I clicked on that during the first five minutes didn\u2019t use the phrase, \u201cwet panties.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an entertaining show and even though I am probably not making sense in this review since I don\u2019t review non-romance anything I think it has potential and it reminds me a little of the fighting scenes in Code Geass which is the only other mecha anime I\u2019ve watched, ever. Aquarion Evol is also one of the few anime I liked from the winter lineup.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The orgasm powered robots are back and ready to kick some ass. Now at this point I would like to say that if you dont already know, this is a sequal and I will admit that you dont need to see the first to understand this, I think you still should, because you will be able to appreciate this more. \r\nThe original was good but the main problem I had was that I didnt really think a whole lot of the characters. There wasnt that one guy that I was like, hey I can relate to this; it just didnt happen. Here however they dida far better job creating appealing characters which is the biggest step up in my book. Another change is that the show isnt about the orgasm powered robots, in fact they kinda go away from that. I like that because while I can say it was funny as hell at first it got old after so long and I was scared that that was all it was gonna be for a second season. Instead its used more in a symbolic nature, saying yeah thats whats up, but we're not here to make a vulgar display. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself starts 12000 years after the stuff in Aquarion goes down, and as you probably know it follows the reincarnates of those characters, and of course the characters before that. As was the case in Aquarion, Evol follows a group of teenageish characters as they pilot Aquarion to save the world from abductors. It focuses on their relationships with one another and shit like that, but at the same time it is able to maintain an interesting story that keeps you going all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the story does is this: it changes alot of stuff that happenned in the original Aquarion, as in details that mattered alot to the story. This was risky because if you start changing stuff people can become confused, but I didnt and I doubt anyone will because they do such a good job in just the overall story-telling effort. It answers all of your questions which is very very important in any show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. I thought that the art in the original was pretty decent but damn, this just takes it all up several notches. The fight scenes are terrific and everything is so clear. The character models are done far better than in Aquarion and that was just fantastic to see.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters themselves. As ive already said, the characters were far more appealing to me this time around and I found myself rooting for them, which is something that didnt happen in the original. It follows Amata and his friend (who he'd like to be more than friends with) Mikono as they enter the Neo-deava academy and become elements for Aquaria. As you should have figured out by now, or will shortly these are supposed to be the reincarnates of celian and apollonius which is kinda true but at the same time not and as it goes on you'll see what i mean. Also in this you have a villain who looks suspiciously like Amata and some others make return appearances such as that shadow-angel dude from Aquarion and that crazy bastard Fudo shows up(yeah 12,000 years later). \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progressed, it got more and more tragic. There are just sad situations and the whatnot popping up everywhere at a point and I was all depressed and shit like \"aw damn, this is gonna have a sad ending\" which was the vibe I was getting. The actual ending though is very good and all the sad stuff that goes down at least gets brought to points where theres closure if nothing else. The ending also provides an actual end, by this I mean that the whole 12,000 year repeating cycle can finally be ended by the end to this.\\n\\n\r\nOn a whole I was really happy with this show. It had subtle humor, good characters, orgasmic animation(sorry I just had to use that pun) and it fixed alot of the crap that Aquarion didnt do so hot with. I will recomend thsi to anyone who liked the original, hell, Ill recomend this if you didnt like the original because this is just on such a higher level. Enjoy.",

            "content": "This Is the 2nd season Of Aquarion. Its By Kawamori Shoji and is currently writing the manga as well. I officially liked the ending but really needs a third season because it didn't describe or answer many questions about the previous series. I'm happy for this anime but a few of the fans are hating cause it had an alternate ending to it.The other Aquarion was more serious,in a way. This starts with a boy named Amata who goes to a village and meets a girl named Mikono, they share deep love connection to each other. This season is about destiny,faith and Forbidden love(That everyaffection that everybody has, yeah its forbidden). Even a few Shadow angels are reincarnated here and want world domination against humans and want to be with there favorite angel but don't get the love...eh to bad. Love makes you do crazy things in life, Good and bad times. \\n\\n\r\nI really loved the story but I wish they make more episodes for the season..like an \"ongoing\" Anime or something. I liked the Art because it felt more new than the before series.The only thing I didn't like about it was that they didn't answer every question about everybody. By the way don't let a shadow angel use Aquarion..It doesn't look to well. I was also happy that they had new Aquarion vectors and names for them.\\n\\n\r\nI chose a 7 for the Story cause It didn't feel like it actually answered enough questions about everyone. I still like the story and characters with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art was a 10 because its different than the other that Its stunning with everything around it. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was a 10, because the music and the attacks had the same melody as The first series did, which was good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters was a 10 because every character stayed in there place during the series. They listen and help one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was a 9 and Overall was 10, I really enjoyed watching it so I recommend you go watch it if you haven't seen it yet. Its great and new chapter for you as well.",

            "content": "Mikono X Amata..........awesome, so finally this 26 episode anime has ended, so what now? Duuuuh, I guess, I'd probabaly say that this is all good, the genres indicated like Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Mecha, Romance and Sci-fi did proved well  for this anime, ok so there is that  fujoshi element in the last episode of this thing which for me is EEEEEEEWWWWW. But then again the romance genre has the most impact in the story so for the \"Story\" part I'd give it a \"Very Good\" number 8, since I like the main plot were there are challenges that comes with Amata's quest forMikono's heart, aside from it every episode has its own set of climatic thing in it which make the whole 26 episode worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI just have nothing to say about these parts, since the art is similary with \"Sousei No Aquarion.\" Plus, the fanservice is kinda off, though Zessica looks hot in her skimpy outfit. As for the sound, I kinda like the mechs changing theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the romantic role that Amata and Mikono played as lovers who are fighting to reverse the destinity that keeps them apart, also I kind like that role of Andy breaking into Mix's heart I guess you may say that the comedy genre of this anime is them, as for the other characters like Sharade, Cayenne, Kaguya and Mallory they really did their part well as part of the  of this anime for as they represent the anime's action genre . I also like that the antagonist is solely reside in Mykage, in fact his role is a total representation of evil behind that angelic look. For Fudo.... well I guess since this anime has a fantasy genre, he may well be that genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so for me, to give it such rating is because I've always expected that the arc would be a Mikono X Amata arc and it did happen, ok so most would expect a Kaguya X Mikono arc and a Zessica x Amata arc.....good thing it didn't happend which it the enjoyable part of the anime. Overall, this anime is worth watching every episode and this is one anime which you don't have to watch its prequel, since the way that  Mari Okada of studio Satelight created it can stand on its own. In fact you might say that it is unrelated to the prequel- even if it is, then again who cares? This anime is all good, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that Satelight studios would make another sequel or a spin-off of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBtw: Mykage X Fudo (or Apollonius) arc?????????EEEEEEWWWWWW I hate shonen-ai or should I say Otoku-ai. No offends to LGBT's out there, just my personal opinion.\\n\\n",

But if you don't have anything to watch and are itching for some corny romance and fanservice aboard big mechas, then go ahead and enjoy the show.  Once I got what the show was about, I was able to enjoy it fully. \r\nI was drawn to the series by its colorful and pretty animation, and the show doesn't disappoint in this regard.The story as a whole doesn't make much sense to me but, as stated before, we are not here for the plotbut for the romance and big mecha fights!   \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are pretty silly and overdramatic (and also a bunch of horny teenagers). The show delivers its load of bishounens and bishoujos at will and it focuses on their relationships with the other gender by slapping some ridiculous situations, cheesy lines and metaphors as subtle as... an elephant in a room maybe? I found myself snorting at how silly the whole ordeal was.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, if you are here to watch mecha fights, you will be served.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is pretty enjoyable, if you are into that.   \\n",

Some obvious similarities are drawn in the first episodebetween Amata/Kagura (Evol) and Apollo (Genesis)...and Mikono (Evol) and Sylvia (Genesis). \\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to also hear some of my favourite Genesis Akino songs reused in this series. \\n\\n\r\nBut my favourite part of the series is the clash between the mysterious Kagura character with the humble Amata. Both desire \"the hand\" of Mikono but both share a secret that makes the relationship between the three so much more complicated than \"just another love triangle\".\\n\\n\r\nSo for those who love action mixed with romance, this is definitely the anime for you.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nSo, as always, Aquarion as a franchise is a mixed bag.  The original series received quite a bit of criticism for both its throwbacks to older style \"Super Robot\" anime, as well as for an at-times silly set of subplots surrounding its characters.  The original conceits of the series were often cringe-inducing as well: the action of the series focuses aroudn Aquarion, which is a giant robot formed of 3 \"vectors\" which combined into a giant robot, accompanied by the pilots undergoing a \"gattai\" (union) which results in them, well, orgasming.  \r\nAquarion Evol is not going to do much for peoplewho disliked the original series, and in fact may not be a great show for people who loved it, either.  I do think that there's a lot to enjoy here, particularly if you are a fan of romance + giant robots or the original series itself.  Just don't expect too much.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The Soundtrack is by the always wonderful Yoko Kanno, with frequent vocals by AKINO.  If you're a little older-school anime fan like me, you might find yourself wishing that Yoko Kanno had collaborated with Maaya Sakamoto instead, but AKINO has plenty to offer here, and once again displays some quite good English skills (which makes sense, since the singer and her siblings all hail from Utah by way of Mesa, Arizona) alongside a strong voice seemingly made for belting out Yoko Kanno classics.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of new music on display however, other than the OP/ED themes and a few insert songs.  Most of the music is recycled from the first series, but rather than seeming lazy or cheap on the part of the producers, I think that the music does a great job of tying together the two series, which is doubly important since there are only a few characters in common, the character designs are a little different, and Aquarion and Aquarion EVOL are also separated by a 12,000 year gap.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the rest of the sound, which is to say it's inoffensive.  Aside from several of the female characters having your usual squeaky childlike voices and one character (Schrade) sounding like he had a cold the entire time, the cast does a decent job with their characters.  The sound effects and environmental sound are good, and fit well with the fight scenes and quiet scenes alike.  \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION:  The character designs and actual animation are great in this show, presumably because SATELIGHT used all their money on the digipaint scenes after saving a boatload by reusing assets from the first series.  The character designs, provided by Chinatsu Kurahana, Kana Ishida, & Hirotaka Marufuji are vibrant, unique, and make it visually easy to distinguish between characters.  There are a few weird choices here (like the prudish Mix wearing a dress that lifts and flaunts her breasts to an absurd degree) but all of it seems fitting with the tone of the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the original series, the 3dcg itself is not great, but then, it never is in anime.  Animations can be jerky, as if there aren't enough 'tween frames, and the mecha often have very stilted and awkward movements.  They do their best to work around these limitations, and since I didn't turn the series off in disgust I guess that they succeeded.  \\n\\n\r\nSTORY & CHARACTER:  This is where the good turns a little towards bad.  Way too much time is spent on side characters (particularly the duo of happy, perverted ANDY W HOLE and prudish, frosty MIX) and the main romance never gets much development.  Worse, the main character is written (on purpose) to be indecisive and passive, which really saps the enjoyment from watching him.  There's a lot to be praised here for the way that main characters confront their feelings for each other head-on, and the willingness to develop some of the relationships in the series far beyond the usual \"confession in the last 30s of the series\" bullshit, but the truth of the matter is that head writer Mari Okada didn't seem to find much interesting in the relationship between Amata and Mikono, and it shows.  As I said before, we spend a lot of time with the characters Jin and Yunoha, and MIX and Andy, and while both of their arcs have relatively satisfying conclusions, Amata and Mikono seem to come together in the end (after 26 episodes of Mikono waffling about Amata and his evil twin Kagura) more because they should for plot reasons than because they seemed a good fit together.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, we spend a lot of time doing silly \"anime trope\"-ish episodes: a school festival, a beach episode, etc etc etc.  While none of them are BAD per se, they are also not particularly good either.  The little bit of character growth we get during them is usually ignored completely next episode.  \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, whereas the theme of the original Aquarion may have been \"love as destiny\" this series clearly embraces the idea of \"love in spite of it\".  Kagura claims to have been born to love Mikono who is a reincarnation of Aquarion's Silvia, but Amata (her eventual choice) loves her for herself, not because of some 12,000 year long arc towards a destined ending.  Likewise, most of the other characters in the show do not seem interested in finding out about their previous lives the way Apollo, Silvia, &c in the first season were.  Instead they are all focused on their love and relationships in the here and now, and to hell with what your past lives wanted.  \\n\\n\r\nI will say, one thing this show does fantastically is present homosexual love and homosocial relationships in a positive, engaging manner.  Schrade and Cayenne are clearly deeply in love, but their relationship is hardly even commented on by the other characters except to present sympathy when the inevitable occurs. Meanwhile, while Toma & Mikage may technically be non-gendered or genderqueer, they both present as masculine, as do the objects of their love, Apollon.  This is not presented a prurient, or weird, or even worthy of mention: they simply love each other in a way that shows gender has no meaning in love.  Much later in the series as well, MIX is transformed into a man but Andy doesn't even blink: it doesn't matter to him.  he loves Mix the person, not Mix the walking pair of breasts with some glasses perched on top.  And while this may seem a little too \"perfect\", it also shows excellent growth in the character from his roots at the beginning of the show where he was desperate to sneak into the girls' side of the dormitory to get himself a peek at some \"big bangs.\"\\n\\n\r\nOther than the diffuse focus on the cast and the at-time silly one-off episodes however,the biggest thing that bothered me is retconning.  The identity of Apollo is retconned during Aquarion EVOL,  and while Shoji Kawamori insists this was always part of the plan, There certainly was no evidence in the original Genesis of Aquarion series (there may have been in the OVA released later, but I have not seen that).  This changes the nature of the ending of the original series, and changes Toma's character (and his reincarnation in Mikage) substantially, seemingly only because this was the need of having an angel as a villain to manipulate everyone else.  \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, it's about time for me to wrap this one up, and I will say that despite my complaints, I enjoyed my time with Aquarion EVOL and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to take as a given the silly trappings of the Aquarion universe (gattai as sex, bad cgi robots, totally ignoring forced gattais as metaphors for rape, etc) and enjoy a series that tries its hardest to fit in some shallow meditations on the nature of love and the connections between humans in between the giant robot fights and eye candy.  Just don't expect too much depth here, and prepare for a lot of silliness.",

How many of you actually watched the original Aquarion 7 years ago? \r\nit came at a time where anime was just starting to be popular where i came from, and where i lived, to love anime as much as i did, or rather, japanese games, art music, etc etc, was anathema to the social ladder. didnt really care. point being i watched it years ago. i still watch it. i have the damn thing in my hard drive right now. when the characters said that the movie the characters were watching was a let down and only the music was good, goodenough to warrant its own show, i felt so vindicated.\\n\\n\r\nnvrmind, after all this years thinking how underappreciated it was kinda riles me up. the music it uses now is a variation, remixed and improved. if you loved the music 7 years ago, you'll love it now. \\n\\n\r\ngraphics? arts? i had a fucking orgasm over the beauty. nuff said. the venice like river of the first date, absolutely beautiful. the characters are drawn far more aesthetically pleasing compared to the original. i mean, put amato and apollo side by side and start laughing. i dont really follow anime as avidly as i used to, but i can honestly say this might just be the best animation of 2012.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters? eh.... just two spisodes..... no comment except that most people in the show seem to have a stick up their arse. especially the single sex ladies in the robot. to be honest though? the first thing that struck out to me when i watched the first ten minutes were how the Celiane and sylvia was depicted in a movie. i had visions of Apollo and Appolonius bursting out of Amato's back old school style and LAUGH at how girly the heroine is now compared to the real thing 12000 years and 24000 years ago. i kid you not. basically so far the blue haired heroine has shown herself to be a typical japanese Yamato Nadeshiko. soft spoken, sensitive, utterly beautiful as opposed to the rough housing, amazon warriors the first two heroines were.\\n\\n\r\noverall? i sat in my chair and ate salted peanuts while staring at a blank wall  for 12 hours straight because i was waiting for the thing to be released. so i have to say i might be a little biased. if you like visually pleasing shows though? this might whet your appetite and if not the characters dont, the story will drawn you in.",

I would always wait every week for this anime. This anime has everything I'm looking for; Cute Girls, Robots, Comedy and Romance.\r\n  At first i had no clue where this anime was going, so i deiced to watch the first season \"Genesis of Aquarion\". It was okay, ijust needed a clue what the whole series was about. Mostly about fight invaders who were harvesting humans so they could stay alive or so, and the only way to stop them are to use these people so called \"elements\" to pilot a Robot.\\n\\n\r\n  Aquarion Evol revolves around a boy name Amata which i THINK who is the recreation or Apollo. Amata is a boy who is an element (he has wings in his feet) user who meets a girl name Mikono and starts liking her. Mikono seems to be a shy and timid type of person. They then get involve in the Robot fighting with the invaders, and then has been made to stay at this school that is separated between girls and boy. Lets just put it to that for now, I'm still watching. (x\\n\\n\r\n  To be honest this anime will drag you in, with great art as if you are watching in HD, and with also great Opening and Ending songs. I love the Characters. This show is Random and Weird at the same time, that's why I love it.",

To the point of feeling unconformable to even watch an episode due to the plot and character interaction. That reminds the the PLOT.....YEAH THE PLOT after 12000 years after the first series the new characters have some similarities of the old series back in 2005 but that didn't help from preventing itself from SUCKING EVEN MORE. I forgot about most of the story because it became convoluted to the point of confusionalso it makes kingdom hearts story like reading abcs. The only thing good about this one is the art design THAT'S ABOUT IT JUST PRETTY COLORS AND NOTHING ELSE!! The OST forgettable as HELL FOR A MECHA ANIME COME MAN PUT SOME ELECTRIC GUITARS, DRAMATIC ORCHESTRA OR EVEN BLOOD PUMPING ENERGETIC TECHNO MUSIC.

It was great all the way up till they throw in probably one of the most pathetic plot twists I've ever seen, that being completely ruining the story of the first one, which had a pretty much well ingrained fact that apollo was the reincarnation of apollonius. But they throw that out and say that he wasn't bust instead hes the reincarnation of the dog, which isn't shown in the previous series at all, maybe the other retelling they showhim but other then that he never existed in the prior series. \\n\\n\r\nIt was at this point I lost all enjoyment from the series, as I enjoyed the previous series although melodramatic, it still came around for a decent romance drama. Which was founded on the fact apollo was apollonius that gets thrown out the window near the end of this show. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the horrible turn of events for the story, the characters are good and develop very well, they entertain multiple relationships between characters which is nice. I mean theres not much to say besides the story was going well until that horrific twist, other then that it was pretty good.",

Though I do prefer Amata over Kagura, Amata barely did anything outside of his stupid robot! \r\nI may be a little harsh on this anime, but I cannot say I absolutely enjoyed it! The plot was great! The mechs fights were ok, the romance was a bitdull(still Ok)! The music was amazing! They could've easily done a better job on this anime, but they decided not to. If I were to make this anime better. I would add something like Amata suddenly becoming badass and actually standing up to Kagura!\\n\\n\r\nAlso btw Mikono was the most useless(she says so herself) anime girl I have ever seen!

            "content": "Story - The story for AE seems more progressive and less episodic than the previous series (Sousei no Aquarion), it is has some good action and comedic scenes which are good, but as a whole, the anime suffers unfortunately because it incorporates the easily misunderstood belief of reincarnation. That combined with some people's disagreement at the coupling at the end despite being obvious from the beginning, it does have a lot criticism, which I feel is unfair. I think it has one of those plots in which you either like it or hate it. \r\nArt -  The art is very good and detailed, allof it from the mechs to the background enviroments. Most certainly the strongest aspect of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Sound in this anime is also very good, the variation of music is good and is nicely timed to the fighting scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Just like Sousei no Aquarion, Aquarion Evol has characters that your going to like and others that you hate, that includes the antagonists as well. I don't know why but I much prefer the characters in AE than in SNA, the characters personalities seem more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - There are some flaws with the story and the characters, but Aquarion Evol is still very enjoyable. The action scenes are well timed with the music, the enviroments, character designs, mechs and lighting are easy on the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - I enjoyed watching it, also Aquarion Evol was designed so that people didn't need to watch Sousei no Aquarion to understand it, so you can watch it without watch SNA.",

It is also true that some rather particular themes are dealt with, not in an extreme way, but fortunately they will be solved.\\n\r\nFor the rest, it remains a very beautiful series to look at, where once again the feeling of love will be the winning card. Finally I do not recommend the vision of this anime for those like me who love Aquarion deeply, or at least don't start with the assumption that it can reach the levels of Aquarion.\\n\r\nAlthough EVOL's graphics are far better, the story is decidedly commercial. 12,000 years have passed since the final battle against the angels of darkness, culminating then with the sacrifice of the Aquarion and its pilots, who remained inside to prevent the destruction of the planet, and this battle has become legendary among books, religious cults and even cinematographic films, with the foundation of the Sacred Angel Institute, dedicated to the legend of the Aquarion and frequented by young people endowed with Element powers.",

            "content": "Aquarion Evol is not just a plain mecha anime. Aquarion Evol is a mecha and an over-the-top cheesy romance anime. This series is a sequel of \"Genesis of Aquarion\" but you need not watch the first series to understand the plot since both were set on different eras.(about 12,000 years apart). When i first started watching it i expected a serious mecha (I haven't watched the original series) i had no idea it would be an exaggerated love story.\r\nEvery episode they would focus on love and romance, heck even the mecha's powers are triggered by love. Faith and destiny are also things that are consistentlymentioned in this series. Characters are overly melodramatic, they always shout and their emotions are always exaggerated. The plot is about a young male named Sora Amata. Sora Amata is a fanatic of a movie called \"Skies of Aquaria\" and always spends time alone in an old theater watching it. (There is a reason behind this fanaticism which i won't spoil).One day, after finishing the movie again and was about to clean the theater, he was taken by surprise when he saw that he wasn't alone. There he met a girl named Mikono Suzuhiro and it was Love at first sight!! Now Sora Amata has the special power to \"fly\" or levitate. Funny thing is he levitates whenever he gets excited or scared. To cut the story short, Abductors came and tried to abduct Mikono. The earth defenders who flying ships called \"vectors\" came and tried to defeat the Abductors but failed. Somehow, Sora with his levitation power, accidentally boarded an aquarion (with Mikono). Sora's vector, by pure chance, combined with two other vectors piloted by Zessica Wong and Cayenne Suzuhiro which then formed Aquarion Evol, which then proceeded to beat the abductors. The two joined NEO-DEAVA an academy for teenagers with Elemental Powers (Sora's Levitation is an Elemental Power). NEO-DEAVA's purpose is to defend the world from the abductors. Students of the academy are also the ones who pilots the vectors. Now the story revolves around love and the battle between the academy and the abductors.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a ton of characters here, and i'm happy to say that most of them aren't flat or one dimensional, a bunch of eccentric ones. Each student has their own weird and unique elemental power, from Sora's Levitation, Cayenne's Prophecy to Andy Hole's dig or hole creating power. The good stuff about aquarion is that nobody is left out, each had their own time to shine, each have their own romance problem, whether it was a love triangle ,unrequited love, forbidden love, love between abductor and earthling, and even destined love reborn through reincarnation. This makes the series entertaining to watch, watching the interaction between each characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is definitely good, the animation of the characters is consistently good and I love the colorful style. The 3D for the mecha is quite awesome too, it's colorful and vivid, and the way they presented those over-the-top fighting scenes and special moves are a thing of beauty, really an eye candy. The special attacks of the aquarion (born from the different trio combinations of element users) are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow the plot is thick, not complex but a lot of things are going on, from the characters (tons of them) and even the enemies. The enemies aren't your one dimensional bad guys, there's a reason they're doing the abductions, and the show really did a good of job of showing the viewers the \"other\" side or the issues of the Alteans/Abuctors. (Abductors  are some form of aliens from a planet called Altea \"Altair\" who comes to earth and abducts females). Now the acting may be cheesy and exaggerated but it never became annoying, it was quite entertaining to watch, it's like your typical heroes in RPG games who would be over melodramatic. The soundtrack is amazing too! just like the over dramatic lines the soundtracks are over the top and are one of the best that i have ever heard in an anime. Good vocals and a lot of beautiful instruments, not your typical anime pop or rock song. The sound effects works quite well with the grand visuals too. You can tell that Aquarion Evol isn't trying to be some serious mecha, but stands firmly with it's unique style, which was effective and was genuinely really entertaining. I seriously recommend this to anyone, except those not interested in love stories  It has a lot of quality mecha battles to offer too and you'll never get bored with this one.\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Rating: 9/10",

I'll tell you that I actually liked this one a lot better than the original. (>:C Don't judge. )\r\n- STORY - 9 - Ok, so the story doesn't stand out that much, but it is still pretty good. You can read the synopsis for that.\r\n- ART - 10 - Even if you hate this anime, no one can argue that the art wasn't AMAZING. In fact, I think it's the best in any anime I've ever watched. ( again, no judging.>:C)\\n\\n\r\n- SOUND - 10 - The sound was quite amazing, and the first ending theme was probably the best ending theme of any ending theme ever in any anime. It was simply incredible, as was the rest of the music. I really connected with it. \\n\\n\r\n- CHARACTER - 9 - The characters are pretty good, though, some lf them aren't very strong personality- wise. O_o\\n\\n\r\n- ENJOYMENT - 10 - I enjoyed this anime a lot, and thought it ended amazingly, and I don't usually like mecha anime.\\n\\n\r\n- OVERALL - 10 - Again, I am very disappointed most people didn't like it, but I thought it was amazing, though, there are some unneeded ecchi parts (every time they merged mecha (gatai? O_o) that I thought were very unnecassary, I loved it.",

I didn't watch GoA first, which made it more difficult to put parts together from the show, but in all it still made it pretty clear. \r\nAction is phenomenal. Also once you begin to watch the show and get into it, you'll probably pick a favorite character. If you get into shows like ALOT, be ready for an emotional roller coaster. All in all, I enjoyed this show and recommend it to anyone that likes Eureka Seven or in general robot fighting.",

            "content": "People may think I'm Dumb for rating this anime so High, but I have my reasons. First, the first time I watched this I was still a kid and I was missing episodes. Now I rewatched it, I still felt the same excitement and thrill.\r\n This Anime is a rare breed. It gives you the \"I wanna love this character\" feels in most of the pairings. I really adored all the main characters and the way the story was played I felt the emotion that was being portrayed. I hated Mikage when the story wanted him to be hated, I hated Kagura when the storywanted him to be hated, I felt sorry for them when the story tells their side and showed that they can be forgiven and what they did made sense.\\n\\n\r\n I say this is rare because it showed a lot of mini genres in it. a pure love story between Amata and Mikono, A romcom yet so real pairing of Andy and Mix. Mikono's attraction to Kagura that gives that bitter taste. Shrade's relationship with everyone that suites him. And to be honest even tho I hate BL, Shrade and Cayenne portrayed a beautiful relationship. There's Yunoha and Jin too. It showed a lot of comedy too. The Action mecha part doesn't make complete sense because of the power of love and friendship tho, but that sets it apart from other mecha anime. Watching this anime can put you in the edge of your sit or bed whatever, specially when Kagura comes to Vega and look for Mikono, you can really feel the thrill and connect to the characters and just shout how dumb and weak Amata is whenever Mikono will get taken away. \\n\\n\r\nThe story about the two planets was portrayed well too and specially Alicia and Izumo's love story too. And the story about Kagura, Amata and his parents was really expressed in a lot of ways. The way they told the legend was really cool, and really makes you feel like you wanna watch the other Aquarion series too. \\n\\n\r\n-In short this Anime is not like the Anime this days that are One sided. The art may be outdated but id say in its prime it was one of the best. Story wise not everyone will like it, but if you like and understand deep and meaningful story about love and relationship and destiny then you can relate because in that genre this Anime is #1 for me -",

            "content": "Aquarion Evol is a mix of Action, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Mecha, Romance and Sci-Fi. For you guys that don\u00b4t like long reviews I summit up here in the beginning about what I liked and disliked with show. \r\nLiked: Great art, character designs, and animation - the best thing about Aquarion Evol. Some good characters and character development. The story the first 2/3 of show. Kagura. Quite entertaining to watch.\r\nDisliked: The story the last 1/3 of the show. Mikono\u00b4s and some other characters development (or lack of it). The lack of deeper explanations of some elements within the story.\r\nFor you guys that like to really getto know a show before watching it, here follows a more detailed version about how I experienced Aquarion Evol.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 \\n\r\nIts really a shame because the first 2/3 of the show are actually really good, but falls a part and spacing out towards the end. \\n\r\nAquarion Evol is the independent sequel to Genesis of Aquarion, so you dont have to watch the first show to understand or enjoy this one. The story takes place 12000 years after the first show. New cast and so on. The story takes up speed already in the first episode, the main characters are meeting for the first time and we are introduced to the world they live in. After that we get introduced to side characters (they are more then sides, many of them have own chapters and good development) and the main plot. The main plot is basically that men in mecha suites from another dimension attacks their world, and kidnap women back to their dimension. Why you may ask? If you watch the show you will know, cant spoil it here - its one of the plots pillars. The world that most of our main cast is living in has an organization that countermeasure these attacks in their own mecha suits (the mecha fights is often quite entertaining). The story builds up nice and steady and becomes quite intresting... Until we are getting to the last 1/3 of the show.. There I feel like the plot was smeared all over the place, and lost it direction to throw in lot of random lines and events. Much of the build ups mostly ran out in the sand, or changed direction. Always sad to see lost potential, but I will still state that it was worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Aquarion Evols best trade. Great art and animation. Beautiful scenery`s and detailed backgrounds. How the light fell in throw a window or sparkling sunset - it was all gorgeous. Great and beautiful character designs (more Kaguras to the people). The mechas didnt feel out of place in the backgrounds, which they often can do. Overall very pleasing for the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nOST was overall ok, some songs better then others. It did its job to highlight the atmosphere in the scenes, but wasnt breathtaking. OPs was also little catchy, but nothing spectacular for me. I watched the dubbed version, and voice acting was above average and put life and feelings in the characters. Backgrounds sounds was also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe main thing about the characters in A.E. is that the main cast has very little development. They start out with the tools to be much greater but never really goes there. Some of the \"sides\" the other hand has a lot of development. A.E., would I state, is equally character and plot driven. I like that in a show, but then it has to pull throw to the end with both, and A.E. fails some in both departments. Now its sound like im bashing the show, but I actually liked a lot of it. So let\u00b4s go down to way I liked and disliked some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nMikono - Our main girl. The very cute and shy kind of girl. She doesn't believe in herself and think she\u00b4s useless, which is a result of her past. Nothing usual to begin with but she kind of stays that way the whole show. Mikono had the potential to be something great but stays in \"damsel in distress\" state pretty much the whole 26 episodes. She has some moments of developing but are soon back on square one. \\n\\n\r\nAmata: Pretty standard shounen MC male character. Is very cute but dont know it, and girls falling in live with him and he dont now how to deal with it. Amata has a special gift that give him gravity related powers. Unlike Mikono he train his power and become stronger and stronger to protect his comrades and Mikono. Even do he actually had some development, it was to little and bleak to be that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWas it any good characters in A.E. at all? you may ask now. And yes, there was some great characters.\\n\\n\r\nAndy, Shrade, Mix, Yunoha and Jin where all interesting and made the most development in their characters. I enjoyed the relationship development between Andy & Mix and Jin & Yunoha much more then that between Amata and Mikono. All mentioned did a very touching personal development as well, and was the cast i mostly enjoyed to watch. \\n\\n\r\nKagura is his own special case. I loved the character Kagura. He is the shows antagonist, but I ended up shearing for him. Why? Because is a sexy sad lonely badass. What I didnt like was how little time they had put in to his character development, he had so much potential but didnt come throw in the end (or more like a non-logical 180). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nFor you poor souls that stayed with me for this long, I keep it short here. Maybe its sounds like I didnt enjoyed the show, but many times I really enjoyed it. Then it was good, it was really good! A combination of beautiful art and animation, with some interesting characters and mostly a good plot let A.E. in to may heart. 2/3 of the show is really worth more like 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI really wanted to give this show a higher score, but the last episodes wont allow it. If for nothing this show should be watched for the amazing art and character designs, that it self is worth the time. But I really enjoyed many parts of the show, I think i cried a couple of times and had some laughs to, so I was moved by the show anyway. I definitely would recommend this show if you want to see something beautiful with some great characters and romance.    \\n\\n",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\nThe theme of this show is kinda like the theme of Final Fantasy VIII: Love. Viewed through this lens, the show is as meandering and at times frustrating to watch as its predecessor, but still a pretty decent show.\r\nLet's begin with the setting. Evol continues the \"12000 years\" mythos of its predecessor, only now series 1 is the myth. Most of our heroes' adventures take place on the planet \"Vega\", with the adversaries coming from the planet \"Altair\" (at least in the Japanese version). This is significant in Japanese (and Chinese) culture, because these are the names of the stars in theTanabata story, the weaver girl (Vega) and the cowherd (Altair). So \"Star-crossed lovers\" is a good way to partly describe the three romantic subplots: the young lovers are torn apart across dimensions, circumstance, or the veil of death. The rest of the story (the young lovers can only meet on one day of the year) doesn't really factor in, unfortunately, but there are a number of elements that make use of the \"separation\" motif-- the big wall at the beginning of the series, for example.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style (and character designs) are a bit more towards recognizable anime styles than series 1, which went for \"anime, but with more realistic shapes for facial features\". Like series 1, it's a combination of CG and drawn, but because of the \"cleaner\" art style in the designs, the characters and CG mechs mesh a little bit better. Honestly I prefer the mech designs of series 1, but Evol isn't bad, Aquarion Gephardt is based on one of the forms of the military Aquarion in series 1, while Spada and Evol are original designs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization... Amata, the hero of the show is a bit of an \"unlikely hero\", or rather, an \"herbivore\" to use the Japanese term. Now, I can understand some people being rather annoyed or even upset with his lack of self-confidence, but y'all are looking at a boy who was not only abandoned by his mother, but also ostracized by his peers because of his ability, and comes face to face with a girl he falls for at first sight. I defy you to find another teenaged boy with the same background and in the same situation who isn't a stammering mess. Personally, I was fine with Amata, as he started at a good place to climb up, he displayed courage when it counted, and that's the kind of journey I like to see.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think Mikono could've been better written since she's the reincarnation of Silvia (spoiler, though honestly, that was very predictable, with the \"wings\" scene and all). I think there was just a bit too much effort trying to throw fans off the scent by writing Zessica as a strong love interest and Mikono as a damsel in distress, or to push a love triangle in the process, but the chemistry between Amata and Mikono was just too strong for it to go any other way. Mikono does have a journey, sort of, but it was pretty contrived.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike series 1 where the mythos and lore was revealed in dreams and \"echoes\", series 2 opted for \"story time with Sakura Kinomoto, I mean, Crea\" with a storybook motif (speaking of Sakura, I hadn't heard her voice for ages until Evol, and she was well written and directed, though some lines were cringeworthy). It was a creative take on \"telling\" the story rather than showing it, but it was still telling the story. I thought perhaps there could've been a better way to show the story, but they were running short on episodes. During the story revelation, a bit of a retcon was introduced to the lore. It was based on a background \"character\" that was seen in both series 1 and the movies, so it's not like it was made out of whole cloth. Despite this, I thought the \"blurring\" of details like names (Apollo to Apollon, etc.) over the course of twelve thousand years was a cool way to show the passage of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here reuses Yoko Kanno's magnificent soundtrack from series 1 and adds a few new tracks by Ayako Otsuka. The new tracks aren't bad, but they tend to be recorded from a synthesizer or a studio orchestra, whereas the series 1 tracks were performed by full symphony orchestra with choir. You can clearly hear the difference, though Otsuka went to great lengths to make sure the new tracks blended into the production. Yoko Kanno still composed the theme songs, and Akino's performances, this time with the rest of bless4, are glorious. The first ending theme, Moonlight Symphonia, is a beautiful duet, and introduced me to Akino's brother Aiki. The second ending theme features Yunoha's voice actress, Yui Ogura. I like her voice, but I feel that perhaps this was better marketed as a character song.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode plots in the first part of the series somewhat follow a similar pattern as series 1, but with a bend to the ridiculous (bananas and doughnuts? really?). Again, story isn't Satelight's strong point (especially when Kawamori is involved), but the story of the concluding episodes is actually pretty good-- there's betrayal, there's conflict aplenty, there's bitter reunions, the drama building up to the climactic scenes is good viewing. The climax, well, the \"clash of David and Goliath\" has been a thing for centuries. The closing scenes of the climax are well-written and animated, the lines immediately after, however, are ridiculously cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nHow does it compare to series 1? The story is a touch more on the ridiculous side, but it builds up well towards the end. I liked the characters in both, so that's a wash. Overall I think series 1 is a bit stronger because of the \"mythical\" and \"epic\" themes, but Evol is good watching as well. How about its sequel? Ah, well, I think Satelight should've left well enough alone in Logos.",

Mikono, Mikano, whatever her name is... there isn't anything special about her and she's not useful in any way- even in her final attempt to do something she fails. Zessica, who is head over heels in love with Amata, gets no love despite at least being useful and capable and having an actual personality with emotions and opinions. \\n\\n\r\nThere were far more interesting couples in the show, such as Andy and Mix, and I wouldn't have minded if the main characters had fallen into obscurity while these guys, as well as a few other characters, took the main stage.

            "content": "\"Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened\" -Dr Seuss\r\nAquarion Evol is a thrilling story about the adventure of a weak boy, Sora, and how he struggles to become stronger. In this sense, it is very much like Naruto because it is about how our main character overcomes the challenges presented to him. Naruto overcomes his curse and accepts his fate as a human and likewise Pico overcomes the bonds of sexual taboo and dives into the deep depths of homosexuality. \r\nAt times, it will have you laughing.\r\nAt times, it will have you crying.\r\nAt times, it will have you shuddering.\r\nAt times, it will haveyou enveloped into the sharp folds of the powerful, compelling storyline of this masterpiece - Aquarion Evol\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most extravagant and well-written stories I have ever seen. You really need to pay attention to experience it all, small details may have you puzzled over the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nWell, what is it about? \\n\\n\r\nThis story is about Sora, our main character, and his travels. He meets many people on his journey to overcome the overshadowing darkness of heterosexuality. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is incredibly well-scripted and paced. Each individual scene is crafted with such elegance that it's hard to believe that this was originally a low-budget anime. However, I shall warn you - it is written by none other than the butcher himself, Gen Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Aquarion Evol is simply eye-dazzling.\\n\\n\r\nSuch detailed and bright, colorful artwork contrasts with the deep storyline of Aquarion Evol to create a brilliant blend of excellency, as opposed to Starbucks, which is shite.\\n\\n\r\nI fail to see how anyone couldn't like this art style.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the outstanding points is that there is no QUALITY. Faces are all drawn extremely accurately and with care and effort. Laziness is not a factor which you will find in the artwork of Aquarion Evol. I would even say it rivals the results you get from typing 'futa bara rainbow dash' on DeviantArt.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much about Aquarion Evol's soundtrack that I can say that hasn't already been said.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are extremely talented and the emotions they portray are so realistic that you would almost think that the VAs were living the story of Aquarion Evol in real life.\\n\\n\r\nAquarion Evol's voice actors are nothing you would find in an amateur animation like any Ghibli movie. From teary solemn to absolute bliss, each voice actor displays a wide array of voice dynamics, and they're a pleasure to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is astounding. The background music is crafted with various instruments to create the stinkiest beats you will ever hear. A lot of piano and violin is used to play perfected melodies which will have you downloading the whole OST just to listen to it over and over again. It also features various audio samples from artists such as Death Grips, namely songs such as 'Sandstorm'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nEach individual character is unique and cliche characters are completely absent. The character development is paced so well that the viewer actually grows up with the characters, and learns to understand their motives and emotions in the form of empathy. In this way, by the time the viewer has finished watching Aquarion Evol, he will have developed as a person himself. \\n\\n\r\nThe emotions felt by the characters - ranging from happy, to medium, to sad, are all very lifelike. You will never have thought they were fabricated with video and audio. Such genuine emotion rivals the deep emotions of Sasuke from Naruto. I also think Sora is a lot like Ulquiorra from Bleach, my favourite anime character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nA fucking blast. Sheer brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nI said it once and I'll say it again. Aquarion Evol is a masterpiece among masterpieces. It is just simply outstanding.\\n\r\nshow less",

(which btw i did not see so i am very sorry if that makes my review inconclusive). but somehow, when everything comes together it makes a gorgeous picture and this became one of my all time favorite anime. this anime may not be for you, but for me---it was love!!",

Don't get me wrong, there were some things about it that bugged me (the orgasmic power-up ended up making me laugh by the end of the series), but overall I thought it was actually a pretty unique storyline.\r\nLike any lover of an original, I was scared when I heard they were doing a sequel, because, as a in general, sequels have usually sucked.  I know, huge over-generalization, but it felt like that to me.  I will admit, sequels do seem to be getting better and better, so ifthis trend keeps up, I'll be willing to change my opinion.  I hope I get to.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not very far into the series yet, so this will of course need to be changed when I finish the series, or even get more into it, but I wanted to start with how much I'm actually excited to watch it.  I thought I was going to hate it, but I was completely wrong.  \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of this anime have blown me away, absolutely breath-taking, and the characters are unique and have depth.  I'm confused by some of them, but I know it'll all make sense in the end.  I won't give spoilers away (darn!), but I'm excited to see how the characters will end up relating to their counter-parts in the original series, and for some of them, how they will relate to the characters from 24,000 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, I'll just have to watch and see.

            "content": "24,000 Years later the story of Aquarion comes full circle. This review will often elude to Sousei no Aquarion and at times compare the two. The aim of this practice is to show how the span of 7 years allowed the creators to expand on the foundation and improve greatly on Sousei no Aquarion\u2019s flaws. As it is part of one gigantic story, I feel as though it futile to speak of Aquarion Evol as a standalone series.\r\nAquarion Evol takes place 12,000 years after the events of Sousei no Aquarion. The world has changed a lot and no longer is there a struggle over Earth,but a clash between the \"Abductors\" of the planet Altea (Altair in some translations) and the humans of planet Vega. Altea is a dying planet struggling for survival while Vega is a prosperous, Earth-like planet. As the conflict continues, the world hurdles toward disaster and history is set to repeat itself once more.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhile Aquarion Evol still references the legendary battle of old between the Shadow Angels and humans (often referenced by an in-series film titled Skies of Aquaria), that conflict has been laid to rest. DEAVA has given way to a new organization named neo-DEAVA under new leadership while operating as an academy for young pilots, or Elements. Men and women are separated and there are two \"Aquaria,\" one for each gender, meaning merging is strictly unisex. The Aquaria are similar to the Aquarion of old as it is also a three form, three component mecha composed of Vectors. During the first encounter with the \u201cAbductors,\u201d Sora Amata and Mikono Suzushiro, two civilian teenagers who both claim to have no special talents, take control of a Vector and form AQUARION with students of neo-DEAVA, much to neo-DEAVA\u2019s surprise and dismay.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Sousei no Aquarion, the story in Evol progresses much cleaner and each episode builds on the episode prior. Additionally, the plot does not seem to disappear compared to its predecessor. An explanation may be due to the fact that the plot is only slowly revealed episode by episode, not totally laid out for you as Sousei no Aquarion had. Additionally, gone is the formula Sousei no Aquarion used to mold their episodes that revolved around some special training that were just simple team-building exercises that added nothing to the plot. While there are some training aspects in Evol, they do not consume the entire episode. What may be the biggest departure from Sousei no Aquarion is that it also is no longer predictable in that not every episode leads up to some grand merging of Aquarion to combat an enemy. In Evol, characters also rely on hand-to-hand combat in some instances, while other instances show the characters in their daily lives outside of neo-DEAVA. Ultimately, what makes Evol\u2019s story so compelling is that it keeps you guessing. If you had watched Sousei no Aquarion, you often wonder when what you already know about the story comes into play. It makes going from episode to episode much more enjoyable than watching meaningless battle after meaningless battle waiting for the plot to return. However, Aquarion Evol does tend to fall into the same corny traps as Sousei no Aquarion\u2014mostly from attack names\u2014and also does get a little too \u201ccute.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhat a difference 7 years makes. The animation is much more vibrant and consistent. The clipping and quality issues that led to unflattering appearances are no longer there. The animation is very crisp with a wider array of colors. I recommend watching Aquarion Evol in HD to fully appreciate how beautiful this series is drawn. The scenery, the cities, the character designs, everything is leaps and bounds beyond what was presented in Sousei no Aquarion. The CGI is on par with what was presented in Sousei no Aquarion and the fight and merge scenes are very good. One welcome change is the introduction of Aquarion Gepard which features projectile weapons, signs of evolution and adaptation to the changing world. The character designs are a little more \u201cfan-servicy\u201d as most all the females have enormous breasts and some wear highly revealing clothing.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMuch like its predecessor, Aquarion Evol earns high marks for music. Akino returns with two very loud, vigorous, and exciting tracks for both its openings. The endings are dialed back into somber ballads; the second performed by voice-cast member, Yui Ogura. As you learn more of her character, Yunoha, it becomes a very touching track. Many OSTs from Sousei no Aquarion return, namely Genesis of Aquarion. The consistency of OSTs and opening artist is much appreciated and lends to the idea that it is indeed one big story spanning many generations. There is a heavy reliance on the track \u201cAquaria Mau Sora\u201d which appears in the in-series film, Skies of Aquaria. The voice cast in Aquarion Evol is stacked with tremendous talent and is executed brilliantly. Aquarion Evol also scales back the orgasmic moans and grunts that were far too prevalent in Sousei no Aquarion. While merging still seems intense and full of bliss and passion, it no longer seems to equate to sex, though it still is inferred by character interaction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is where the biggest upgrade Aquarion Evol has over its predecessor. Where Sousei no Aquarion had no overly spectacular characters where they all seemed somewhat annoying, Aquarion Evol has more characters, and most of them are thoroughly appealing and likable. There are two areas of character that Aquarion Evol far outdoes its predecessor. First, the characters receive a lot of development throughout the series apart from their own character-centric episodes. This makes characters a lot more likable as you see their development episode by episode. This makes the characters highly relatable and sympathetic. Second, the formation of character relationships is far more prevalent in Aquarion Evol than Sousei no Aquarion. Sousei no Aquarion focused much on the relationship between Apollonius and Celiane. While other characters often intimate at love, nothing ever develops. In Aquarion Evol, deep friendships are forged, romance is found, loss is experienced, and heartbreak appears. This also leads to characters being relatable and sympathetic. Aquarion Evol also has a clear evil that needs to be defeated.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend that Sousei no Aquarion be watched before watching this series, though it not be entirely necessary. However, it alludes to the story quite frequently and may seem confusing to those who are unfamiliar with the events of Sousei no Aquarion. While Sousei no Aquarion seems, at times, boring, Aquarion Evol takes the story to a whole new level. For 7 years, the creators were sitting on this thrilling conclusion to a highly captivating story. In watching the story in whole, the plot twists are much more twisted and you may even start to question what you truly even know. As a standalone series, it still is very strong. It carries its own rendition of the legend that sets it apart from Sousei no Aquarion (even though both renditions come into one plot-line in the latter part of the series). A story of love and betrayal, a story of vengeance, a story of survival, a story that spans 24,000 years, Aquarion Evol is a must see.",

            "content": "Actually I started to watch this Anime last year and dropped it midway, because I didn't like some things which happened...but some days ago I decided to try this anime again and I don't regret it!\r\nStory:\r\n- The story is quite interesting and there are some new things which you don't see in other anime.\r\n- Although you can sometimes guess what will happen in the next few episodes it's still exciting and I didn't care even though I knew what was going to happen.\r\nArt:\r\n- I love anime which have a nice drawing style and Aquarion Evol was definitely one of them. Although there were little mistakes(which happens in nearly every anime) it was nice to watch. Also it's quite colourful which makes the anime even better.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n- I love the soundtrack of Aquarion Evol, there were some songs from the prequel but also new ones and this was definitely an anime where you noticed that there was music but it also matched the scenes perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n- Well, there are good ones, bad ones and if I had to say which I didn't like I couldn't really name one. Although I liked some of the characters better than others, all in all, all of them were quite funny and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI watched Aquarion Evol in 2 days! I really enjoyed watching it, becaue it has a nice feeling and is perfect for a little break between some other anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I don't think Aquarion Evol is a Must-Watch Anime if it is about all genres but if we speak about the mecha/romance genre I think it's quite interesting and I recommend watching it...I think I also liked the anime because it has so many different elements (genres) in it.",

            "content": "Aquarion Evol, what a ride it was. Legendary battles that took place more than 12,000 years ago, separated lovers, futuristic world, high-school, vehicle pilots possessing supernatural abilities, giant robots powered by orgasms...\r\nWait what? But alas, that's exactly what it is. First time you'll see it, you'll be like wtf; second time you'll see it you'll be face-desked and probably crying tears of laughter. That in a nutshell, is what Aquarion Evol is about. It's a bit of every genre (musics included)  and it manages to make them work together at that.\r\nAquarion Evol is not meant to be taken too seriously though. It has unimaginableamounts of cheesy-corny moments (take that orgasm-driven mechas for instance) and quite a bit of melodramatic high-school scenes, but it's all perfectly bearable if you'd grin and laugh at it. If you seek military or action driven mecha anime, you'll probably be bitterly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nStory. \\n\r\nThe main story is simple. One futuristic world experiences systematic human abductions due to unknown entities called \"abductors\", and the students of futuristic academy being the mecha pilots they are have to fight this unknowable unknown. With time, the intentions of abductors become clear and our heroes will be faced with tough choices. Meanwhile the main hero, a freshly enrolled student of aquaria academy, discovers mysterious competitor for the love of his life which is revealed to be tied to a sinister prophecy and a legend. The story per se, is not bad. Apart from main protagonists the series explores a bunch of secondary characters and gives some insight into the events of previous series, so you won't be left in the dark. The issue with this kind of story is that any side-story episodes do feel like fillers and the series would have been better without few of them. Otherwise this anime loses some of its event-driven focus. Unfortunately, this lack of focus and coherence becomes even stronger towards the end of the series, some events prior the ending come off as baffling and illogical.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe art is gorgeous. You'll want to stare and stare at beautifully rendered backgrounds inspired by Shanghai and Venezia. The light and sfx are also quite on par. The anime boasts memorable character designs. Animation is smooth and lively, particularly during the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is filled with loveable ambient music, consisting from instrumental pieces, most notably crisp and dreamy piano arrangements. It also has quite a few songs in it, Aquaria Mau Sora probably being most beautiful out of all. The OP has classical epic feel to it, and it basically carves itself in your memory.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nOverall characters are a likeable bunch. It's shame though that Aquarion Evol suffers same disease as most shounen anime: the protagonists are much less appealing than secondary characters. Hell, even antagonists look better against main duo. By main duo I mean Amata and Mikono by the way. Amata no thanks to his way too meek demeanour comes off as spineless, and Mikono pretty much embodies that I-am-useless-but-I-try-to-be-better girl stereotype. Naturally these two would engage in all sorts of silly melodrama, but hey something gotta sustain romantic suspense, no? Having said that, I very much prefer secondary characters including minor antagonists. They offer much more badassery and humor. In the end of the day, even villains of Aquarion Evol are not that villainous. Misunderstood, driven to despair, having no other choice, but not inherently evil evil.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nPretty enjoyable anime spiced with cheesy moments and humor, with both action and mystery involved. Well, minus the fillerish melodrama. A little awkward considering it's both high-school AND mecha, but still watchable. Me, I personally loved the music most. And Kagura's manner of speech :D",

            "content": "Getting this out of my system, MOANING WHILE MWERGING GIANT ROBOTS! LOL!!! \r\n*ahem* The first half of this story was great but the second half, I'd have to say was AWESOME! There was more drama, more conflict, fewer annoying characters, and the art was WAY better. The colors really came out better than in Sousei no Aquarion. The music, like the other one, was a must get and there were a few I could play all day just because they're THAT GOOD. And the characters, though most were semi-1Dimensional and only one really annoyed me (sadly it was the heroine; she kept getting childishly jealousover misunderstandings with one guy after making NO effort to take him for herself), were fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starded with a love triangle 24,000 years ago between two male angels and one female human (angel 2 likes angel 1 but angel 1 gave up his wings for the girl, it hurt angel 2 badly) 12,000 years later (Sousei no Aquarion) they reincarnate and the same story repeats. angel 1 reincarnates as a human and falls for the girl again leaving angel 2 lonely. In the end, to save the world, the angels' souls come together again and angel 1 prmoses to meet the girl again in another few thousand years.\\n\\n\r\nBUT, 12,000 more years later (Aquarion EVOL; takes place on earth when another planet is abduction their women and they have to fight again) angel 2 realized during the soul merge 12,000 years ago that he was trick and now he's back for revenge on the new reincarnations. I won't DARE spoil anything for you but the Plot twist are wonderful and this I will say, the bad guy is pulling ALL the strings and this story is ENTIRELY in his hands. \\n\\n\r\nThis is worth a see and the best part is you don't have to see Sousei no Aquarion first (though I highly recommend it) to understand what's going on, they give you full backstory (even more than the first actually). I LOVE the anime.",

            "content": "I was really excited to start watching this anime. I watched the first episode before I watched the first season and then I realised it was a sequel, so I watched the first season first. I totally loved that one, so I really hoped this would be as good as the first season, but it wasn't quite what I expected it to be. However, it wasn't bad though.\r\nIn the beginning I didn't really get it, the story was different and I had no idea what would happen in this season. That was kind of fun though, because everything would be a surprise.\r\nLet me start withthe story... \\n\r\nLike I said.. in the beginning I didn't really get it. It was different and I didn't know if I really liked it or not. But lucky for me it became more and more interesting. I was hoping that it would be as good as the first season, and it seemed like it would. But then the whole story changed in the last episodes, and of course everything became more clear, but I totally disliked it. I wished I hadn't seen it, because it changed my opinion about the whole story( both season one and two). I still liked the story, but it was a complete twist of the story as we knew it in the first season. I totally regretted watching it at first, but later I was happy with it, because it was a good story anyways. Because of my extreme love for Sousei no Aquarion it was almost impossible to rate this anime low, but I actually considered it for a moment because of the huge story twist. But after calming down a little I knew that this story was good in it's own way. I just didn't want to see Sousei no Aquarion and Aquarion Evol als one anime, with the same story. \\n\r\nApart from the story twist in the end, I really liked a lot of things in de anime. There were a few sad parts, and parts where you could laugh or were you would just feel really happy. It was a kind of emotional anime for me and I really enjoyed it though. \\n\r\nAs for the fights...they weren't really much in my opinion. I don't really like fights to start with, but there wasn't that much action. I really didn't watch it for the fights, because if I would .. I guess I would be really disappointed in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, I really liked the colors and actually at first I started to watch this series because of it. ( But in the end the story of the first season just really grew to me and I totally loved it for the story.)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were okay. I don't really have anything to say about it. There were just a few characters which voice I didn't like, but that doesn't really matter though, because it didn't ruin the anime or anything.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters.. some of them were really weird and I didn't like every one of them, but there were a few characters that I totally loved( A few characters were weird in a good way, you don't see them in every anime, but a few of them were just stereotyped anime characters in my eyes). I was wondering the whole anime long \"maybe that character is a reincarnation of that character\" and stuff, and I found that kind of funny and interesting. But it doesn't really matter that I didn't like all the characters, because it would be really hard to let the viewer like every single character in the anime wouldn't it? \\n\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the anime, but it wasn't what I expected. It's still really a shame that they came up with such a twisted story in the end, so that screwed up the story for me and I enjoyed it less because of it, but I did enjoy the rest of the story. But in my eyes it just wasn't as good as the first season, not even close actually. But I love the aquarion series, so I gave it a 9 anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend you to actually watch the first season first. I know a lot don't do that, but you will understand a lot more if you watched the first season first. And in my opinion that season is better anyways.",

            "content": "Having not seen the previous Aquarion I would have to say that this anime does a great job of filling in the details for new people to watch. Gicing this anime a 9 overall I generally liked it. However, there are a great meany things that I really disliked about the show. \r\nThe story overall was good, very complex and detailed. However, some details within the story killed me! I couldn't stand some of the ways things happened and the ending. If you turn out to be a MikonoXKagura fan, this ending is not for you. Also many of Fudo's 'special training' episodes were notvery good either when it came to the story. BUT! out of the entire thing I would say that it was generally a good concept but in some ways it was just too hard to belive. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime however to me was spectacular! I loved how each character was detailed, unqie, and had amazing coloring. No matter if you pause or are in the middle of a fight scene the detail is amazing and you can really see how much time and effort was put into Aquarion EVOL. The landscapes were also another part of my enjoyment in this anime. I am a relatively picky person when it comes to anime art and I gave this section a 10. Then again, it is very similar to the art in Code Geass. Oh well! I loved it! :)\\n\\n\r\nFalling in love with the music was also another great thing for me and I would assume many others. The first OP and ending songs were fantastic to me, Sharades music was wonderful as well along with SOME of the battle music. Later on though I think there was more focus on wrapping up the storyline than attention to the music and sounds of the show. I gave this section a ten though because they included a lot of detail with the sounds. The never forgot to add in the sound of the weights in Amata's boots, ect. ect.\\n\\n\r\nDUN DUN DUN! Characters! Every single god dang one of them was amazing! Each had their own unique style and personality, some of them really fit together and made things more believeable. I wish I could cosplay many of these characters for their outfits alone. The only thing that bugged me was the ending with Kagura. He went very OOC in my opinion. But! I will leave those details out, you will have to see for yourself why. \\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed this series even though I felt Kagura never got a chance to even whoo Mikono, that a lot of the battle scenes were relatively cheezy (so cheezy it made me laugh and actually enjoy them), and that the ending could have been better. That said this review explains the good and bads of the anime in my opinion as a now Kagura fangirl, and as someone who is picky with the artwork and musics in an anime.",

It was probably the art, as I'm a very visual person. All those bright colors are eye catching as hell. \r\nThen there was the first episode. Cliche, but it made me curious. So here I amon the 22 episode and still curious, though as someone said somewhere, there is an apprehension that this anime tried to take on too much and the fast approaching end will leave us with more questions then answers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is good?\\n\\n\r\nThe music for sure. The first ending theme (that has returned in the 22 ep) is amazing (or maybe it's just my love for the piano talking). Also the OP's are not bat, quiet likable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Not so much. Mikono is too typical of a damsel in distress. Fudo is annoying and Dolosera is the type of character I hate the most - \"aloof 5 year old\" that's in charge (facepalm). Amata is... debatable, more so with the recent revelations, but he's cute.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't regret watching (at last yet), but won't ever repeat that feat.
