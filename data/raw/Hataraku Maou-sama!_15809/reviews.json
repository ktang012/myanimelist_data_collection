            "content": "I'm well aware this isn't going to be a popular review, so go ahead and downvote it just because I gave it a 5/10, but at least listen to why first, because someone has to shatter the illusion that this was actually a good show. \r\nThe basic premise of the show is that the overlord of the demon army and one of his generals are attacked by the hero during a large scale war to take over 'ente isle'. They attempt to temporarily retreat to an alternate dimension, but find themselves trapped in modern day japan and are unable to return. So must work menialjobs to survive while they attempt to find a way to recover their powers and return to ente isle. It's a solid premise that's fairly original and had a lot of potential, but ultimately failed in its execution. \\n\\n\r\nI know what your thinking, the main character of the show is a demonic overlord trapped in human form, working in McDonalds. So we'll get an evil anti-hero with dark tendency's who goes on to become good, accepting human values, and seeking reconciliation for his dark past. But instead we get your typical self sacrificing \"emiya shiro\" right from the get go. He becomes your generic harem/action protagonist, and never displays any regret over his past actions despite this. As such Maou gets no concrete development over the show, and the fact that he is a demon has no relevance to his personality whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show then goes on to introduce more and more female characters to the point where it becomes a slice of life harem with a little action and comedy scattered throughout. We also see scenes from ente isle but bizarrely there are no demons present at all, despite being on the verge of conquering the entire world before Maou left they apparently just got up and left. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the \"plot\" starts feeling like filler after each of the characters is introduced which ultimately meant they ran out of time to develop any real closure on the romance side. Making the ending feel like a half season break, rather than a satisfying end to the show. So you'll have to wait at least another year for season 2 to get any closure. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy starts off okay but there was never really enough of it to sustain the show purely on laughs, and as the show goes on the comedy becomes less and less frequent and much more repetitive (oh we are so poor, that's still hilarious the 1000th time we've heard it) \\n\\n\r\nThe opening isn't present for the first two episodes, because when it is finally introduced it just recycles footage from the first two episodes. The music in the show isn't awful, but it certainly isn't a selling point for the show. The art is of the same high quality we've come to expect of modern anime but doesn't do anything exceptional in that regard. \\n\\n\r\n Overall I believe it is a very overrated mediocre show. Whist its premise is fairly original its poorly executed and there's nothing here that hasn't been done much better elsewhere.",

            "content": "Unholy burger and fries. I would sure love to try them.\r\nSupreme comedy. That\u2019s what Hataraku Maou-sama is. I like to split the comedy genre into two types when it comes to it and the anime series in general: the first one is the comedy flow that is present through the entire series. It is there to make the series a tad lighter, to bring some more energy and by chance, to make us smile every once in a while. The second one, however, tends to focus on separate scenes rather than bringing the quirky atmosphere. It focuses on jokes and scenes that make us notonly smile, but laugh. From sadistic to well-planned situations alike, that would be the general purpose of the second type - making us laugh.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama is the second type. Furthermore, it is extremely successful.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 start is quite dark and serious, but if you\u2019ve taken a look at the genres and read the synopsis, then you can guess that it doesn\u2019t stay like that for long. We are presented to the situation that went down in the world of Ente Isla, the world in which our main characters originally lived in. After the great Satan Lord Jacob gets defeated by Hero Emilia, he, alongside with his fellow General Alsiel, is forced to pull back and escape. Just before departure, Jacob swears that he will return and regain control over Ente Isla once more. They open up a dimensional portal and go through it, not knowing that Emilia has followed them.\\n\\n\r\nRight after all the seriousness is gone, the fun begins.\\n\\n\r\nYes, right after that. Of course, the world in which our two demons have landed on is Earth. Japan, to be specific. The first thing they realize is that they cannot regenerate magic in this world, and since they\u2019ve used most of it up for opening the portal, magic becomes one of many things they have to go easy on from that point on. I could go on and on about what happens to them, but I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil much, since it would truly be best for you to see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOn short, our main characters that come from Ente Isla must now blend in the everyday life of a human. That includes getting a job, paying for everyday expenses, and so on. Does that sound a bit boring? Well, that\u2019s far from it. Besides being spiced up with some amazing comedy on every corner, supernatural activity comes in as well. Our lead characters are attacked! They are being pursued! Is this the time to be worried about them? No. It is the time for you to laugh to your heart\u2019s desire, since every scene is presented either in a badass, or funny way.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the story, we are presented to more and more new characters, most of them coming from Ente Isla themselves. After being \u201ctamed\u201d by our original main leads, they settle down on Earth as well, each of them living their lives in their own way. From working and having a job, being a housewife (housedude?), all the way to being a lazy NEET.\\n\\n\r\nSince most of the angels that come from Ente Isla are female, while the demons are male, you can get a picture of what kind of pacts are made. It is a wide-known saying that us, men, have no weapons against women, so the only thing we can do for us to prevail is stick together. Our demons do just that. Closely. On the start, Jacob and Alsiel rent quite a small apartment, barely containing enough space for the two already. But no, things get only (worse) funnier. One more demon comes and after being tamed and proven weaker, that little apartment becomes a smaller strongholds of idiots, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, our supernatural peeps head towards their everyday issues, with comedy awaiting us on every single corner.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing a little bit on other components as well, the art and sound are splendid. The art is really attractive, making the characters quite adorable for the eye to see (yeah, you get to love those pixels in front of you). Not to mention the great display of various actions, such as the all-lovable trollface out of nowhere. All in all, it presents the story in a great way. The sound fits in excellently. What is left to make us laugh besides the animation and the text? Of course, the way the text is spoken and delivered! I must compliment the voice actors here. They have all done a really good job at emphasizing the characters\u2019 emotions through voice, especially their common outbursts. A special shout-out goes to Ryota Ohsaka here, who is voicing our MC, Jacob, and has done it right all the way. Taking the scene in which Jacob is screaming on Alsiel: \u201cYou\u2019re freaking right you\u2019re late! It\u2019s all over, why do you even bother showing up now!?\u201d , I can say it is just presented in a way that I couldn\u2019t find a better one, in all honesty.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make the show. Alongside with the scenes they get caught in, we get to sympathize with them, we take them as some stupid idiots, we want to see them get stormed-over more, and so on. On short, we want more of each and every single one of them. It\u2019s one of those rare cases where the stupid characters in some series aren\u2019t annoying. The catch is that they are not mainstream. Far from that. They are totally unique, and their stupidity is unique as well. It reaches levels far beyond. Well, from everything I\u2019ve written so far, I think you can guess what my enjoyment is like. It is pumping high. Very high.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hataraku Maou-sama is stupid. There is not a single quality focus in the series. However, it is still grand. Oh yes, it is. In all honesty, I cannot remember the last time that I\u2019ve had such good laughs during watching some anime series, but I sure will remember Hataraku Maou-sama for a long period of time. Very worth the watch. Heck, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, make sure to emphasize its priority to the maximum if you\u2019ll ever feel like watching some great comedy. Extremely suggested.",

While most other stuff still don't know their true identities after 10 episodes, this anime knowswhere its comedy lies and executes it very well. It may not send you into hysterical fits of laughter, but rest assured you will be having a loony grin plastered on your face while watching it. The best word to describe it will be 'Delightful'. And it has a pretty decent story as well. Being 11 episodes only it will be a short journey though. But at least its a memorable one. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters make or break a show.

            "content": "This was one of the most pleasant surprises I got to experience in 2013. Since I just got into anime in the beginning of 2013, I saw that Kotaku listed Devil is a PT as one of the 5 spring 2013 anime that one should watch.\r\nI figure, hey, 13 episodes isn't much, let's give this a shot. Turns out I marathoned this anime in 2 days since it was just so much fun for me. The first episode has a bit more violence and is darker in tone than the rest of the anime, especially during the first 7 minutes or so, but I'd sayother than that, this anime is suitable for PG-13 and up. Younger children will probably not understand some of the jokes in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of this anime is very fresh, and thus very enjoyable. I found it drastically different than the usual school-based or workplace settings that are commonplace in other anime. \\n\r\nAll the characters (Maou, Yusha, and his minions and coworkers) all get a lot of valuable screen-time, and hardly any of the screen-time is wasted in my opinion. There is a bit of fan service in this anime, but it's not overused in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation quality, and sound are pretty typical. Nothing in the audio-visual department will WOW you, but they get the job done. Besides, the script and the banter amongst characters are what make this anime so darn appealing. \\n\\n\r\nIf I could say one thing, it's that the last episode in this series ends abruptly. There's no real closure to anything, and I can only hope for a season 2 that's in the works whenever the light novel has enough content to warrant a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nA solid 9 out of 10 overall from me. If it wasn't for the sudden ending, this would easily be a 10 just for sheer enjoyment purposes.\\n\\n\r\nFor those curious, Kotaku writer Richard Eisenbeis' full review for this anime is here\\n\r\nhttp://kotaku.com/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-is-clever-witty-and-just-p-606147259",

            "content": "We can all agree that most comedies in recent seasons of anime have always tried to cling on to a similar type of situations or settings, the most obvious one being school comedy shows. You never get to see writers try to come up with different kinds of circumstances that could be brilliant but once they do it usually comes off either decent or just plain forgettable. It\u2019s not often we get a show like Hataraku Maou-sama that is not only light-hearted and fun but also boasts some of the best comedy writing in an anime I\u2019ve seen in yet this year.\r\nThe title Hataraku Maou-samais exactly what the show is, in English it means The Devil is a Part-Timer. You have a character named Satan who is the dark overlord of this world that is unlike ours, and he is now put into our world in hopes of finding a way to bring his life in order and his magical powers back. What happens then is nothing short of rather very unique sets of humorous set pieces that are not only funny just by the jokes themselves but how they reflect our everyday lives in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they handle Satan\u2019s situation is done very maturely by making him do work that any citizen of any 1st world nation would do to live in stable conditions. The writers don\u2019t try to hammer in nonsensical exaggerated fluff into the mix to make it \u201cexciting,\u201d they make the actions the characters do feel very in tuned to how we would do in society\u2019s standards. Even with the smallest deals like trying to deal with house payments and workers pay. At first, you find it funny how a demon overlord can do all these things without breaking a sweat. Then, once you look beneath the background and delve in more in-depth, you start to notice how there\u2019s a hint of satire mixed in how we often hate working in part-time jobs because of the monotonous way of the work. It is great for the writers to make the message subtle so that it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s being forced down people\u2019s throats. Otherwise, the message would have a harsh tone to it.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can\u2019t just talk about the show without talking about the characters. Maou-sama casts a whole array of great comedic characters that fit together exceptionally well with smart writing to go with it. That isn\u2019t to say the script does every joke justice, but the it is self-aware that it\u2019s ridiculous in its subject matter and they take advantage of this fact. What works so well is how each character has very great chemistry that feels so real, and it doesn\u2019t feel contrived or cliched, it\u2019s an excellent connection whenever characters interact with one another. Satan and Emi, while rivals, both settle their disputes differently than you might think at first. It\u2019s handled cleverly and doesn\u2019t hamper on their archetypes at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWith the art and sound department, the art design is nice and clean without any limited budget. One special thing to mention is the facial expressions on the characters whenever a humorous scene is present; there are some that are unforgettable such as the famous tsundere Emi face that she makes in the police interrogation room. The voice actors do an excellent job in delivering their lines, more notably the jokes are made without any hyperbole.\\n\\n\r\nWith every comedy we get in the following seasons, there always seems to be this constant need for a plot structure that has to be serious. Maou-sama is no exception to this rule. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with comedies of any fashion delving into the drama to some degree, the plot given in Maou-sama is nothing spectacular at all. The worst part is that they even try to put in some comedy into the urgent moments here and there to remind us that it\u2019s a comedy show. That is not to say that it can\u2019t be done right but unfortunately for Maou-sama it just doesn\u2019t feel natural and it is not written very well in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, there is only one episode that isn\u2019t purely focused on comedy and quickly gets back to what makes it a brilliant one. There is the finale, but it is at least handled a little better in that respect. There is, however, another small gripe that involves the main villain of the show and the fact that he is not at all threatening. While this is supposed to be in context with the show being a comedy, they try to make us think we\u2019re supposed to take him seriously when it isn\u2019t at all convincing in the slightest bit.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the flaws mentioned above, this show is not meant to be missed by anyone who appreciates comedy. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that this can be funny by people who aren\u2019t a fan of comedy anime because it hardly draws any Otaku pandering like most comedies that have been released in the following months of the seasons. It is undeniably a nice break to see an anime comedy delve into different territory. It\u2019s a clear sign that shows like Maou-sama can capture an entire audience without regurgitating empty premises one after another. Sequels and moe comedies may sell big, but studios can\u2019t rely on them for long, people will eventually want something fresh. Only time will tell.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: -A",

Please read on to find out why!\r\nStory: 8\r\nI found that the story, although not completely original, was executed very well. It begins with a very action-packed opening scene, and transitions nicely into the characters arriving in this strange land known as 'Tokyo'. The comedic timing in this show is spot on, and because of that it often made me actually laugh out loud (that is rare). The story pans out a little slowly, and although the action at the start isquite flashy, there aren't many other moments in this anime where you get that. If you don't really like action though, then it will be just fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt was hard to find faults in this shows art and animation. The character designs were very attractive, and the scenery is quite plush. When it was time for the action scenes, the movement was fluid and there weren't any frames where the characters looke like a different person (has anyone seen Naruto vs Pain?). The only reason I didn't rate this section a 10 was because at times, and this is very infrequent, the characters face did look a little odd and disproportioned. Otherwise, the quality of artwork was top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening isn't played until quite late in the anime, but I found it well worth the wait. The chosen song is very enjoyable to listen to, and the animation complements it nicely. The ending is very soothing and finishes the episode very nicely. The voice actors were very good, portraying emotion well in many different situations, and it had a broad variety of voices. The soundtrack was nothing outstanding, but it fitted the scenes and one track in particular (The Devil Regains His Strength), after the first time it was used, every other time I heard it, I was filled with anticipation and knew something awesome was about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThere is a wide variety of different characters, each with very contrasting personalities. I found it quite enjoyable every time they introduced a new character. They did this every couple of episodes, but in a way that made it seem infrequent and fitting.  One thing that confused me was how Maou acted, as he is the demon Overlord who terrorised Ente Isla, and yet he does things in Tokyo that really makes me question his evilness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAlthough there are some negatives, I really did enjoy this show to the max, which is why I gave a 10. I just found it really fun to watch, and I had fun all throughout, even in the bits that looked a little 'icky'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! is definitely an anime I would recommend to all anime fans, as it is very entertaining and will give you a good laugh. In my opinion, this show should have a second season, as it doesn't quite give you that sense of fulfillment at the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt is my first review on this site, so it probably isn't great, but hey, thanks for taking the time to read it!",

The story is interesting and develops well throughout the series but an ending which Ifound was not as good as it should of been make Story get an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): The animation of Hataraku Maou-sama! is also great and is even more glorious in HD. The fights scenes in this series are brilliantly animated and are jammed packed. The series in colourful and does brilliantly to show what is happening at that part in the show, the animation is brilliant especially in this animes openings and ending sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): The sound is nice in this anime especially the ending themes which there are 4 of and the opening which combine brilliant animation and catchy music. The background music also fits well with what is happening at the exact moment whether the devil has done something good or something suspicious is happening. The English dub for this anime I think is done very well and all the characters especially Chiho and the devil. The Original Japanese is also great with the subs of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10): The characters in this show are brilliant and engaging. The Devil himself to the hero all the characters are amazing and are a vocal point of the show which sees you routing for all the characters and are sad when the series is finished because they were great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10) and Overall Verdict: I enjoyed this show very much and was interesting to watch and as soon as 1 episode finished I could not wait for the next episode.

Hataraku Maou-sama is one of those animes that will throw you in for a spectacular ride with a twist! \r\nStory- 8\r\nBesides the world-traveling part of the story, I believe most of the story was quite original. I mean where else can you find an Overlord working in McDonalds? Despite others saying the pacing was slow, I thought it was appropriate- not too slow or too fast. As for the comedy, romance, and fantasy aspect, Hataraku uses absurd and cliche ideas and incorporates it into an outrageousyet sensational anime that is outright hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nI gave the art a high score because I believe it is well done and fairly attractive. I especially like how the eyes were drawn.I think it serves as an additional factor of this anime's brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nThere wasn't anything special about the soundtracks so I'll give it a 7. The OP and ED was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nThe characters weren't the most original,however, they were quite likable and contributed a fairly large amount to the comedy of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nTo wrap this up, I think Hataraku Maou-sama is a great anime. I only picked it up today after seeing some reviews on it and the description drew me in. I found myself hooked at the first episode so I hope the same would be for you.I finished this anime today, and for some reason I just had to come here and write a review! Pick this anime up if you want something light-hearted and entertaining to watch. It'll definitely brighten your mood and bring you some laughter!!\\n",

            "content": "What happens when you take the most devious, evil being in the universe, zap him of his power and force him to live like a normal person in the hustle and bustle of normalcy? Hilarity ensues! White Fox\u2019s (Steins;Gate, Re:Zero) 2013 release has probably one of the most unique premises in anime history. King Satan himself has been transported to earth along with his right hand man, Ashiya and ends up working at a fast food chain so cleverly coined \u201cMgRonalds\u201d while warding off heroes and other nemeses from his past life in Ente Isla. Yeah, sounds pretty interesting to me! Unfortunately, past some situationalcomedy mixed with supernatural elements, The Devil is a Part Timer lacks consistency and ends up as an overrated title with lots of pondering of what could\u2019ve been.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the series starts off actually made me think I was watching the wrong show. Demon lords and valiant heroes battling with their magic and might within a mystical land. I was honestly confused. But no sooner did I get used to this scenery then it was flipped onto its head and into present day. The seemingly invincible King Satan now made vulnerable by his mistaken transport to earth. This juxtaposition perfectly embodies the deconstruction archetype, and to see a comedic approach on the subject was refreshing. The plot isn\u2019t anything 2deep4u, but that\u2019s honestly one of the weaker areas overall. Instead of being straight comedy like Nichijou or Cromartie High School, this anime unfortunately makes the mistake of continually teasing a plot, only to never make good on that suggestion. It never really goes anywhere, and as a result begins to rapidly peeter out by the end of its short run.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said in previous reviews that comedy is very subjective. The good thing about this series is how universal and digestible the humor really is. There are no Japanese references the Western audiences may find difficult to understand, nor are there many overly complex jokes present\u2026 just pure, situational comedy. At times it almost reminded me of a sitcom during some of the stagnant still scenes. The bad part of the comedy is how unrealistic it seems. I get the satirical nature of what the writers were trying to accomplish, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t think about how Satan would\u2019ve really behaved like in the same situation. I wish the writers would\u2019ve made it a tad darker with regard to Maou instead of the conformist approach.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part to point out is how much stronger the first half of the series is than the second. As more characters accumulate, the presence of Satan and his pals seem less out of the norm and more commonplace that their situational humor begins to falter. Not to mention I didn\u2019t care for anyone outside of the main four (Maou, Emi, Shirou and Chiho). Stringing these characters along on earth mixed with a few cameos probably would\u2019ve proved more effective in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a character perspective, there isn\u2019t much development outside of what you get in face value. There\u2019s not much growth with the exception of Emi and characterization is done mostly through the comedy. The main four were always enjoyable, and I think the writers just ended up stretching themselves too thin when the secondary characters were introduced. For being evil lords or powerful heroes from another world, they seemed to give up pretty easy when it came to living on earth. And of course you\u2019d want to live with someone you just tried to kill right?\\n\\n\r\nThe art, being that it is White Fox was rather attractive as always. Nothing too extravagant as far as detail goes, but just enough to get the job done. It\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve always given kudos to this studio for. The fight scenes are crisp and rendered well, and I can\u2019t think of any instances where the animation was inconsistent. I also wanted to make a mention of how accurate many of the environments were drawn concerning Japan. Some shows don\u2019t seem to get that right.\\n\\n\r\nSound is solid, but nothing to write home about. The OP is a generic JPop teen song, with quick beats and loud electronic tones while the ED turns it down a notch with a slow ballad accompanied by a revealing image of one of the characters. Pretty standard stuff here. The rest of the soundtrack I didn\u2019t even notice to be honest, and I don\u2019t know if I consider that a good or bad thing. The English dub is pretty stellar though, with Josh Grelle (Maou) and Tia Ballard (Chiho) earning full marks for performance.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, The Devil is a Part Timer is not a bad show\u2026 it\u2019s just not as good as I expected. Considering its popularity and rating I expected to find the next rare comedic gem but instead I was left with a lackluster run-of-the-mill show with a few funny jokes. I\u2019d still recommend it, especially to fans of more recent anime (since the comedy would probably be more attractive). Don\u2019t expect  to spit your food out from laughing so hard and you\u2019ll find a show worthy of a watch. Thanks again for reading!",

            "content": "What if the devil lost almost all of his power and was forced to live in modern world? What if the hero came to defeat him and was actually a really bad tempered yelling girl? What if the devil didn't really have any skills and was forced to work as a part-timer at MgRonalds to earn his living? Yeah, it really sounds like a hilarious situation and that's how this anime is. The writer does try to throw in some random romance or emotional stuff but this show really shines through it's comedy mainly and on that regard it really is one of the bestcomedies of 2013.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story is like almost as I described in the intro para but with 3-4 episodes small arcs which introduces new characters. There is the turmoil of the devil between whether to try to climb the social structure by climbing the work ladder on MgRonalds through working hard and finally take over our world (I don't know how that is even possible) or to get sufficient power to go back to his world. There is a romance sub-plot involving devil's co-worker who is deeply in love with him and people confusing devil & hero as couples. But the main shining point of the story is the comedy which is quite flawless in execution by the writer, sub-plots really gets annoying at times and also I find the fact that the story never really move towards a resolution quite frustrating but the comedy really kept me entertained. So the story gets 8 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe main character devil lord Maou is actually quite different from typical shounen heroes in a few aspects as he does not really wanna save anyone but himself but gets forced to do good work and tries to be responsible for his underlings; hero Yusa has this somewhat tragic back-story yet is confused by the change in the devil lord, so just follows him around being suspicious of him; devil lord's cute and energetic co-worker who falls madly in love with him despite knowing his true nature; Ashiya, devil lord's loyal general who takes the role of doing the household chores in this new world for them; all these characters while not terribly original serves their function quite well. The new characters which are introduced later on through the small story arcs are a bit lacking in comparison in my view as they somewhat does a failed attempt at giving the show a bit of serious nature. Overall this aspect gets 8.5 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nWhile it is really not top-notch it does serve its purpose quite alright. The character designs are quite interesting in their own regards. Although in my opinion there is a few unnecessary use of ecchi in some episodes the overall art & animation style was quite appropriate for the show. It gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening theme is \"ZERO!!\" by Minami Kuribayashi and the ending themes are \"Tsuki Hana\", \"Star Chart\" & \"Tsumabiku Hitori\" by nano.RIPE. Although I found the opening and the first ending quite catchy after a few listens, to be honest none of them really does highlight the comedy nature of the show which I found a bit disappointing. The in-show music never really catches any attention and are not noteworthy in my opinion either. I found the sound quite lacking and certainly the poorest side of the show. It gets 6 out of 10.\\n\r\nAlthough I found the lack of any resolution of the storyline quite disappointing and also was a bit bored at some unnecessary sub-plots overall I really enjoyed the show for its comedy. It really was quite unique in a fun way in that approach.\\n\r\nWhile not perfect by any means this is a must watch show 2013 for any fans of comedy.\\n\r\nOverall score -\\n\r\n                                 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "It was funny at times, but it didn't understand how its own comedy worked and eventually fell apart.\r\nThe show starts out well enough, the premise is a solid foundation for situational comedy, 2 enemies trapped together and have to co-exist sets up a number of fun little gags, the fact that the main character is the literal devil is honestly just a gimmick to get people to check it out, the writers either didn't understand or didn't care what the devil is supposed to be, but it was just semantics and the show still made me chuckle a number of times each episode, so Ilet it slide.\\n\\n\r\nAround half way through though, they resolve everything. They now know how to get home and can do it at basically any time if they want, they just...don't. The situation has changed from they are trapped and \"have\" to co-exist to they \"choose\" to co-exist. This completely ruins the entire show. For one, they don't sufficiently explain why any of them are choosing to stay in this world, they try to brush it off by Maou saying he used up all his magic every time, but they have ways of getting magic and they just don't. The show also loses any appeal of the conflict between the main characters, we now no longer believe they hate each other but they still act like they do, so any conflict feels empty.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that the show probably could've salvaged itself if it didn't waste several episodes on stupid harem clich\u00e9s. Emi acting all tsundere was fine, in fact made some sense given the situation, Chiho was pretty useless most of the time but at least contributed to Maou's suggested growing humanity, but Suzuno served no purpose in the plot but to add another cute girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe show did manage to salvage itself to some extent by introducing a new antagonist at the end the audience genuinely hated, but as they say, too little too late.",

            "content": "Well I have just completed this anime and therefore I am going to give my opinion about this anime too, as I think this anime does not deserve the rating it is given right now.\r\nWhen I heard about this series it immediately caught my attention. The demon Lord somehow ends up in the human world and starts a conquest to conquer the world! This all wrapped nicely in a comedy show and it immediately reminded me a bit of Beelzebub. So you could imagine how excited I was for it to air. And for the first few minutes my expectations where fullfilled but afterwards itwent downhill. And I will telly you why in this review.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFirst off the Art is good. Its not glorious but its good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSame wiht the sound. I didnt find anything to stand out, but neither was it bad its good.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ah yes the Story. Probably one of the most boring Stories I have watched recently, wasting a very interesting and good start by throwing it in the dark pits of average boring slice of life Hell. But more to that when I talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights: They are not even worth mentioning as they are quite boring, short and consist mostly of talking.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: This is were the show shines, this is what made me not stop watching the series. The comedy is simply hilarious and extremely funny. But there is one problem. The show only consists of 20% comedy. The other 80% are wasted on the extremely boring story and some boring slice of life which is not funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This was the probably weakest point of the show. And its not the characters themselves that are bad but their progression.\\n\\n\r\nMao: The main character is the probably weakest of them all. Starting off as an epic Demonlord worthy of his title killing thousands of his enemys, he then lands on the human world, providing us with the funny awkward comedy that only a demonlord stranded on the human world could provide, just to change in the mere time of about 5!! minutes off the anime into the most law abiding and good-hearted citizen you have ever seen! Like wtf? How the hell does a Demonlord that has killed thousands of people change into the most naively good-hearted guy you have ever seen? This is what the main character basically is. Another generic anime good guy, with the exception that he is the demonlord. And the anime sometimes lets hin show off his powers just to remind you that he in fact is actually a demonlord, cause otherwise you would surely forget!\\n\\n\r\nAshija: He is the Demonlords right hand who accompanies him from the beginning to the end. While he suffers from the same issues as Mao-same as in loosing his demonlord character and becoming a loving a caring housewife for Mao Darling, he at least keeps a certain form of awkwardness regarding the human world and its custodys. He STILL feels like he is from another word and he also provide most of the funny moments and comedy this anime had making him my favourite character of them all.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia: Ah Yes the generic tsundere. The Demonlord slaughtered her whole family and town killed many of her friends and brothers in arms, she herself risked her life in fighting the demonlord, but hey on the human world everything is different. After the first encounter being one where she immediately attacks him, she soon after seeing that the demonlord has lost his bite she forgots all her grudges against him and is as worryfree as ever around him.\\n\\n\r\nChi-chan: Well while she wasnt highly original either she was a very likeable and lovely character. She also had this interesting ability where she responded to magic in some sort but the show never bothers to explain it further and simply throws the fact away after the first time it shows up in the show. So making Chi-chan the loveable yet useless potential love interest for the demonlord. But wait what for this anime doesnt have romance.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I do not recommend this anime to people looking for a great comedy or for people that care about character development that does not make any sense at all. On the other hand if you enjoy some semi-serious slice of Life this show might be just for you.",

            "content": "Anime. Comedy.\r\nFor me, those two dreaded words have slowly warped in meaning over the years, once instilling excitement and anticipation and then slowly drying up into a well of disappointment and crushed expectations. As I took recommendation after recommendation I figured that surely, eventually, I would find a show that clicked with my sense of humor and leave me crying tears of sweet mirthful bliss. Comedy is all personal, remember, so I'm not bashing any of these shows for those who enjoyed them, but these were my personal reactions.  Noazki-kun didn't quite elicit a confession of love from me. Cromartie High was a littleoff-the-mark. Detroit Metal City got me to nod appreciatively, but never actually laugh. Konosuba just made me wish there were more D&D episodes in Community. My recommendation list stretched thin, I finally turned to the looming behemoth, the all-mighty and universally revered Gintama, and after three separate attempts to watch it I finally collapsed 20 episodes in, bored out of my mind. Craving the sweet release of mindless, hilarious entertainment, I crawled back to my roots and checked to see if The Devil is a Part-Timer was still on Netflix.\\n\\n\r\nIt was. Could it stand the test of time? Well, it was worth the risk. The answer?\\n\\n\r\n...Kindof? Let's take a look. But before that, let's talk comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest comedies all have a few things in common. First off, they HAVE to be innovative. Comedies of course dry up when they recycle the same humor over and over (helllooo One Punch Man) but just presenting different types of humor isn't enough. Shows have to be imaginative, constructing new and unheard-of situations that belong solely to them. Gintama is pretty stellar at this once in awhile, but it suffers from a lack of consistency, which is something else great comedies have in common. Dud episodes stand out a lot more in comedies than other shows, as you can kind of ignore weird filler in a plot but when your objective is face-value entertainment, 20 minutes of boredom will snap you right out of a laughing mood. The best comedies though aren't just consistent and creative, they have strong central casts that have uniquely compelling dynamics and garner strong emotional ties from their audience. This is something anime comedies usually do well, as most 'comedies' are actually really just feel-good and often random slice-of-life shows. That feel-good feeling is crucial, as it elevated the impact of the jokes if you also CARE about the characters, and is often enough to get you through the slower parts. Finally, and this is the one that nearly every comedy, anime or not, fails at, there's propulsion. By having a status quo that actually shifts you dramatically increase investment in the character's lives, create a plethora of opportunities for fresh humor, and introduce another level of investment as people will now actually care about the plot. Unfortunately, most shows will excessively spam the 'reset' button at the end of each brief story arc, forcing everything back to exactly how it was, or, in the case of American sitcoms, they'll just have all the main cast take turns dating each other to the point where these romances cease to mean anything. This ploy makes sense: once you have a formula that works, messing with it too much can be dangerous, especially as it can muck up that comfort of reliability so many viewers crave. However, only those comedies with propulsion to their story line truly rise majestically above the rest to become real masterpieces. \\n\\n\r\nSo where does The Devil is a Part-Timer stand in all this?\\n\\n\r\nIn a bit of an odd place, truth be told.\\n\\n\r\n'Hataraku Maou-sama!' or 'The Devil is a Part-Timer' is a glossy 1-cour saga following a premise that sounds extremely anime. The Demon King, referred to often simply as \"Satan\", finds himself cornered by the forces of Good and decides to flee the generic fantasy realm of Ente Isla with his trusted remaining general. Whoops though, they end up in Tokyo, looking like regular people and missing nearly all of their magic. A classic blunder. While I guess this is technically a nifty spin on the isekai genre, this endearing set-up isn't exactly revolutionary, and so as usual a lot of it comes down to how it's handled. From the beginning the show really leans into the contrast between the two words, focusing on the difference between the mundane streets of Tokyo and the mythic kingdoms of Ente Isla. Though it may be a generic world, Ente Isle seems to be fully-enough realized to act as an actual counterweight for the show's Japanese adventures, a gimmick that pulls a lot of weight. What also helps is how utterly serious everything in Ente Isla is: from the dramatic lofty church music to the stern faces of every lord and king we get a glimpse of, this is a place perpetually trapped in the dramatic stakes of a Tolkien story, something that goes a long way towards making Satan's bumbling adventures in Tokyo that much funnier.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while the contrast with Ente Isla is great, there isn't enough of it. For a show entirely predicated on the humor derived from putting medieval mythology into a modern setting, the mythology gets under-served. There's a thin trickle of problems that make their way over to harass the devil, but there's not enough focus on establishing these elements in their home world first. By the time characters arrive in Tokyo they've usually already pretty much instantly normalized their surroundings, and their mythic auras are curtailed before we get the chance to see them shine. What I'm really trying to say here is that I feel as though Ente Isle could have been an absolutely phenomenal source of drive for the story as a whole, with consistent cutaways to a slowly-mounting crusade intent on the final eradication of the Devil juxtaposed against him trying to handle tough customers as a cashier. The slow stream of scouts and assassins slowly mounting into a full-on clusterfuck war would have given the show the kind of overarching storyline that it really craved. As is, the show is kind of broken into somewhat-detailed but unrelated arcs that give temporary senses of direction but ultimately fall into that classic, horrid pitfall: they reset to the status quo at the end, at most adding another character to the main cast but never truly altering the dynamic. It's a bit of a bizarre dance because the truth is that what makes the show so compelling a lot of the time is the fact that it's clearly straining against this urge. There are multiple moments where characters have straightforward emotionally-charged conversations out of nowhere that directly and explicitly shift the future nature of their relationship. However, these shifts are clearly holding back, wanting to push the show forward but afraid to change too much lest the magic formula get shattered. The show asks some big questions about the contradictory natures of its characters, but, ultimately, it is afraid to give a real answer to any of them. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, the show for the most part triumphs with its main cast. Establishing a cast dynamic easy to invest in and open to lots of options can be quite difficult, but Satan and his general Alciel provide a rock-solid core by presenting a duo that is capable, endearing, randomly ignorant, and most of all mysterious. The cause for the shift in Satan's attitude upon arriving in Japan is one that plagues both the viewer and the rest of the show's cast, and the fact that we never see what he was really like back in Ente Isla adds to the confounding nature of his personality. On top of being intriguing, Satan and Alciel capitalize on their dual existence in everything they do, often relapsing into old speech or the fictional language of Ente Isla, framing their daily lives on a grand scale (they refer to their apartment as the 'castle', most dilemmas as 'battles', and their bicycle as 'Dullahan, the Trusty Steed'.) Though the depiction of their adjustment to Japan is rushed, the do the premise justice on a constant basis. The problem is that they are constantly degraded, both in-show and on a meta level, by the show's single most obvious problem: Emelia Yusa, the Hero. Framed as a foil to Satan, Emi the angelic legendary hero whose quest is the slay the Devil is riddled by every bullet the demon pair managed to dodge. Unsubtle, obnoxious, and cliche, Emi serves essentially to remind us that the Devil is supposed to be evil, and outside of a few scenes with legitimately earned dramatic weight she is written as an emotionally-volatile tsundere identical to every other character of the archetype. Her rampart immaturity, lack of confidence, and general inability create a mockery of the fantasy-real world dynamic that sabotages the self-serious vibe of the other world and actively detracts from the atmosphere-based humor by making Ente Isle seem like it's filled with samey high-school girls like anywhere else. Coupled with her complete lack of any traits, ticks or struggles indicating she used to live somewhere else and the fact that her already eye-rolling contributions to the humor are repeated as many times as possible, Emi is the show's most poorly-handled element. Her irreversible entrenchment at the heart of the show is the greatest thing holding it back.\\n\\n\r\nThe ACTUAL highschooler, on the other hand, is a totally different story. The show's token character that's actually from Japan is Satan's bubbly co-worker Chiho, and the weight that Emi drops she is more than ready to pick up. Endearingly earnest, simple, energetic, and adorable, Chiho is the foil Satan deserves. She's brash, she speaks her mind, she's strikingly more competent than the actual hero, and she's unabashedly a totally standard teenage girl who loves to dress up and go shopping and hang out with her friends and just also happens to be friends with Satan. Chiho's reckless involvement with the elements of Ente Isle and her endearing and wholesome relationships with both Satan and Alciel make her the light of the show, and the occasional melancholy the show dips into capitalizes on the bittersweet divide between her rather ordinary life and the grand scale of the world of Angels and Demons that she brushes up against every day. The show is honestly worth it just for Chiho and Satan's interactions, which is exactly the kind of dynamic that carries good comedies. Chiho is a complete success.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to touch on consistency and innovation. The show has one or two episodes that are actual duds, but the main problem is that it peaks around episode 5 with the resolution of its first arc. After that, the show stays funny, but it finds itself unable to mount a scenario to riff off of as compelling as its first one and suffers from an overall slight decline in the consistency of its humor. This of course is tied to the show's innovation: while several of its later episodes stand out as creative and uniquely enjoyable, the show's second actual arc is simply a re-spun version of its first one, utilizing several of the exact same details and gimmicks and, in spite of a new antagonist, it begins to feel rather cyclical. On top of this, the show dips into cliche comedy territory once or twice, yanking out the pool episode and haunted house episodes with no real unique characteristics, a sign that perhaps the creator was running low on ideas. The show never becomes truly repetitive, but it oftentimes fails to push its own limits, seeming to take the 'safe' route. While the second half does still have some real stunners and certain relationships continue to have meaningful development late into the show, a general decline in creativity and consistency makes me wish for what could have been if just a little more thought and effort had been put into expanding the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, that's about how I feel about the show as a whole: that just a little more thought and effort could have tipped this show into the territory of truly great comedies. It half-succeeds at just about every criteria I laid out for great comedies, presenting reasonable consistency, a mostly-endearing cast, the makings of a driving overarching plot, and an acceptable amount of creativity, but never truly masters any of them. Considering when I watched it and the realness of the merits it DOES have, I'll always consider it a classic, but it will never quite reach the heights of stuff like Scrubs or Community or the Ranma 1/2 manga. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for specifically ANIME comedy, I cannot recommend this show enough. I've watched just about every anime comedy that's been highly recommended to me, and I've enjoyed few of them enough to even finish them. The fact that I was still laughing out loud fairly often at this show when I had even already seen it before is extremely unique for me among anime comedies. I completely and totally understand the drive to seek out things that are specifically anime: while I would say \"just go watch Community,\" there is an itch in all of us that only anime can scratch, and if you're feeling that way and wanna laugh and unwind with something fun, The Devil is a Part-Timer might be one of your very best bets. This show is no masterpiece, but it is very watchable by any standards, and if I were just comparing it to other straight anime comedies it's probably more like a 9. I'll keep trying those recommendations, but for now, I'm at least happy to know I can come back to this one. \\n",

The Devil starts to find jobs, get a apartment just like a real person. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, as I constantly ask myself over the time I spent watching it, I just don't see the objective of the show. Alright it is all cool that these magical characters are living at the bottom of the human society, so... what? Why would I care? Where are they going? Are they gonna conquer the human world? I understand that this series is unfinished, but can they at least give us a little bit of clue?\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all, the story is funny. And for the pure sake, brainless entertainment this show does it pretty well. Unlike most other comedies I watched, the jokes in the show are actually \"relatable\" and funny. I guess that is the whole point of the series. (The pop cultural references are very very funny)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 4/5, Developement 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that the characters are unique and interesting. The demons are not so demonic, the hero is not so heroic and the angels are not so angelic. This idea is simply fun and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this series has pretty much all the characters we can find in a comedy series, A try-hard protagonist, he's BFF, the girl, the Moe and the others. \\n\\n\r\nThey characters really changed overtime. The The demon King, begins with a calm and ambitious nature, gradually becomes a characters with inner strength and justice. He decides to stay in the human world, cuz he found something good and worth living for. It is a little dramatic, but the development is pretty neat. \\n\\n\r\nThe hero wants to kill the demon, but slowly she realizes she doesn't have a reason to do so. She learns about her enemy gradually understand him as a person. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are less important, but they all have their comedic purpose and little stories. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the problem stands, \"so what?\" This may not be as big of a problem for other people, but for me... yea I just don't like slice of life, not so objective-centred stories. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 4/5, Animation 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very pleasant and fresh, which is part of the reason I watched it in the first place. The background captures the \"past and present\" feeling of Tokyo, and the characters all have distinct style and colors. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem that this kind of art is so lack of style. The art is just too typical and doesn't make the show memorable graphically.\\n\r\nOh right I'm just gonna briefly mention the fan service. Alright that's it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation... Let me just say that when the screen moves, they move smoothly. You guessed it, the screens barely move other than the talking mouths. \\n\r\nCome on, this was made in 2013, why are they still using 2-D clip art to represent fading dusts in the action scenes?  And the laser beams combined with huge color balls appearing in the sky literally just summarizes the battles. They are not well done. \\n\\n\r\nI can't believe the graphic is actually the largest weak point this series has, very disappointed. But hey, after all it is not a high-budget anime with a million action scenes. This will do. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 1/3, OST 2/3, Dub/Sub 4/4) \\n\\n\r\nThe opening isn't a bad song. But the distinct lack of recognizable melody truly destroys the overall feeling when I enter the show. It is just so not memorable to a point that I didn't even bother listen to it online. The ending, bad animation aside, is also a very generic song. Overall, the music really isn't well done. (you may like it, but certainly not above average)\\n\\n\r\nOST are decent. In the \"serious\" scenes, the music is both intense and calm, so you really wouldn't feel worried or scared in anyway (it's a comedy, they are supposed to do that), and in the funny scenes, the music does fit the atmosphere nicely. After all that, the music wasn't memorable and symbolic. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few comedy dubs that I actually laughed at. They really smoothed out the puns and languages so it doesn't feel awkward despite that fact that the jokes were targeting Japanese audience. It is actually so funny to watch. All the pop cultural stuff on top of the \"MgRonald, Moonbucks, SFC\" makes the journey one hell of a run. \\n\\n\r\nThe subs are also very well done. If you want to choose between the two, I'd say if you like westernized animes with good westernized dialogues and jokes, go watch dub; if you want pure Japanese (well at least pureer), watch the sub and it is very entertaining too. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a personal thing. I did laugh at some if not most jokes and I really thought it was a well done series, but as I said I don't like this kind of semi-serious shows. It really felt like I was wasting my time. Not that the jokes were bad, it's just, they aren't smart enough for me to spent 4 hours of time to watch it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAfter criticizing the show too seriously, I figured it is only fair to consider the comedic nature of the show. This show was never meant to be a masterpiece that makes people remember it for decades. It is simply a show that make you have this instant and short time of joy. It is a funny show, check it out if you have the time, but don't expect anything deep or meaningful in any way whatsoever, you aren't getting much out of it. \\n\\n\r\nYea, I'm too harsh. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "I would say that Hataraku Maou-Sama tries too hard to be what it's not. It's meant to be a comedy but there are many scenes inside which try to make it seem like there's some deeper plot/reveal when everyone knows that there obviously isn't because the style has made it clear that the anime doesn't take itself seriously at all.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nI don't know if you can call anything in this anime a \"story\". Sure there were some minor conflicts about, but most of it was just routine. I would give the story 3 points just because there seemed to be 3 major arcs where therewas any form of development, namely the first encounter with Lucifer, the second encounter with Suzuno and the third encounter with Archangel Sariel. The others are rather filler, or small and don't add much.\\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, I have nothing to say much, because nothing including their powers makes sense and nothing is expected to make sense anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt was generally pleasant, I like the bright colours, but it was mediocre at best and nothing really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't actually any good sound in this anime. I didn't like the OP or EDs, I thought they were very mehh and skipped all of it entirely. Background music was okayish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is some extent of character breath on Maou's part, but still zero depth, and even less for the rest of the characters. Depth of characterization was strongest when the three main females were talking in out about Maou, and that was honestly not very strong anyway. The character cast is interesting though, but it was very undeveloped for Urushihara, Orba, Ashiya.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely, one of the higher points for this anime. It was quite slapstick in nature for the first few episodes (tripping, falling, accidents...etc). Funny remarks like how characters diss each other, and things like \"Damn I wish the elevator was working\", I found the Mg Ronald and Sentucky Fried Chicken conflict incredibly hilarious, to be honest. I particularly remember the part with \"Double Quarter Pounder Burger\" and \"McRonald Burger\", that was quite classic.\\n\\n\r\nI love how the show ends up not even taking the serious fights seriously, and how Maou keeps going on about the things that absolutely dont make sense. Oh yes, not to mention the poor little Dullahan bicycle. Definitely, one of the funnier animes out there, but I thought it could have made me laugh a lot more. Most of these humourous things lasted only briefly and was never built-upon to become a solid comic series.\\n\\n\r\nBesides humour, I also enjoyed the action scenes with Maou, but I was sad that it didn't amount to much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a great anime series, it's probably only worth your time if you seriously have nothing else to watch (like I was, and ended up watching something like this). But it can possibly make you laugh, because of all the funny scenes in it. So watch it if you have some spare time.",

            "content": "I'm well aware this isn't going to be a popular review, so go ahead and downvote it just because I gave it a 5/10, but at least listen to why first, because someone has to shatter the illusion that this was actually a good show. \r\nThe basic premise of the show is that the overlord of the demon army and one of his generals are attacked by the hero during a large scale war to take over 'ente isle'. They attempt to temporarily retreat to an alternate dimension, but find themselves trapped in modern day japan and are unable to return. So must work menialjobs to survive while they attempt to find a way to recover their powers and return to ente isle. It's a solid premise that's fairly original and had a lot of potential, but ultimately failed in its execution. \\n\\n\r\nI know what your thinking, the main character of the show is a demonic overlord trapped in human form, working in McDonalds. So we'll get an evil anti-hero with dark tendency's who goes on to become good, accepting human values, and seeking reconciliation for his dark past. But instead we get your typical self sacrificing \"emiya shiro\" right from the get go. He becomes your generic harem/action protagonist, and never displays any regret over his past actions despite this. As such Maou gets no concrete development over the show, and the fact that he is a demon has no relevance to his personality whatsoever.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show then goes on to introduce more and more female characters to the point where it becomes a slice of life harem with a little action and comedy scattered throughout. We also see scenes from ente isle but bizarrely there are no demons present at all, despite being on the verge of conquering the entire world before Maou left they apparently just got up and left. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the \"plot\" starts feeling like filler after each of the characters is introduced which ultimately meant they ran out of time to develop any real closure on the romance side. Making the ending feel like a half season break, rather than a satisfying end to the show. So you'll have to wait at least another year for season 2 to get any closure. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy starts off okay but there was never really enough of it to sustain the show purely on laughs, and as the show goes on the comedy becomes less and less frequent and much more repetitive (oh we are so poor, that's still hilarious the 1000th time we've heard it) \\n\\n\r\nThe opening isn't present for the first two episodes, because when it is finally introduced it just recycles footage from the first two episodes. The music in the show isn't awful, but it certainly isn't a selling point for the show. The art is of the same high quality we've come to expect of modern anime but doesn't do anything exceptional in that regard. \\n\\n\r\n Overall I believe it is a very overrated mediocre show. Whist its premise is fairly original its poorly executed and there's nothing here that hasn't been done much better elsewhere.",

            "content": "Unholy burger and fries. I would sure love to try them.\r\nSupreme comedy. That\u2019s what Hataraku Maou-sama is. I like to split the comedy genre into two types when it comes to it and the anime series in general: the first one is the comedy flow that is present through the entire series. It is there to make the series a tad lighter, to bring some more energy and by chance, to make us smile every once in a while. The second one, however, tends to focus on separate scenes rather than bringing the quirky atmosphere. It focuses on jokes and scenes that make us notonly smile, but laugh. From sadistic to well-planned situations alike, that would be the general purpose of the second type - making us laugh.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama is the second type. Furthermore, it is extremely successful.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 start is quite dark and serious, but if you\u2019ve taken a look at the genres and read the synopsis, then you can guess that it doesn\u2019t stay like that for long. We are presented to the situation that went down in the world of Ente Isla, the world in which our main characters originally lived in. After the great Satan Lord Jacob gets defeated by Hero Emilia, he, alongside with his fellow General Alsiel, is forced to pull back and escape. Just before departure, Jacob swears that he will return and regain control over Ente Isla once more. They open up a dimensional portal and go through it, not knowing that Emilia has followed them.\\n\\n\r\nRight after all the seriousness is gone, the fun begins.\\n\\n\r\nYes, right after that. Of course, the world in which our two demons have landed on is Earth. Japan, to be specific. The first thing they realize is that they cannot regenerate magic in this world, and since they\u2019ve used most of it up for opening the portal, magic becomes one of many things they have to go easy on from that point on. I could go on and on about what happens to them, but I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil much, since it would truly be best for you to see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOn short, our main characters that come from Ente Isla must now blend in the everyday life of a human. That includes getting a job, paying for everyday expenses, and so on. Does that sound a bit boring? Well, that\u2019s far from it. Besides being spiced up with some amazing comedy on every corner, supernatural activity comes in as well. Our lead characters are attacked! They are being pursued! Is this the time to be worried about them? No. It is the time for you to laugh to your heart\u2019s desire, since every scene is presented either in a badass, or funny way.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the story, we are presented to more and more new characters, most of them coming from Ente Isla themselves. After being \u201ctamed\u201d by our original main leads, they settle down on Earth as well, each of them living their lives in their own way. From working and having a job, being a housewife (housedude?), all the way to being a lazy NEET.\\n\\n\r\nSince most of the angels that come from Ente Isla are female, while the demons are male, you can get a picture of what kind of pacts are made. It is a wide-known saying that us, men, have no weapons against women, so the only thing we can do for us to prevail is stick together. Our demons do just that. Closely. On the start, Jacob and Alsiel rent quite a small apartment, barely containing enough space for the two already. But no, things get only (worse) funnier. One more demon comes and after being tamed and proven weaker, that little apartment becomes a smaller strongholds of idiots, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, our supernatural peeps head towards their everyday issues, with comedy awaiting us on every single corner.\\n\\n\r\nFocusing a little bit on other components as well, the art and sound are splendid. The art is really attractive, making the characters quite adorable for the eye to see (yeah, you get to love those pixels in front of you). Not to mention the great display of various actions, such as the all-lovable trollface out of nowhere. All in all, it presents the story in a great way. The sound fits in excellently. What is left to make us laugh besides the animation and the text? Of course, the way the text is spoken and delivered! I must compliment the voice actors here. They have all done a really good job at emphasizing the characters\u2019 emotions through voice, especially their common outbursts. A special shout-out goes to Ryota Ohsaka here, who is voicing our MC, Jacob, and has done it right all the way. Taking the scene in which Jacob is screaming on Alsiel: \u201cYou\u2019re freaking right you\u2019re late! It\u2019s all over, why do you even bother showing up now!?\u201d , I can say it is just presented in a way that I couldn\u2019t find a better one, in all honesty.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters make the show. Alongside with the scenes they get caught in, we get to sympathize with them, we take them as some stupid idiots, we want to see them get stormed-over more, and so on. On short, we want more of each and every single one of them. It\u2019s one of those rare cases where the stupid characters in some series aren\u2019t annoying. The catch is that they are not mainstream. Far from that. They are totally unique, and their stupidity is unique as well. It reaches levels far beyond. Well, from everything I\u2019ve written so far, I think you can guess what my enjoyment is like. It is pumping high. Very high.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hataraku Maou-sama is stupid. There is not a single quality focus in the series. However, it is still grand. Oh yes, it is. In all honesty, I cannot remember the last time that I\u2019ve had such good laughs during watching some anime series, but I sure will remember Hataraku Maou-sama for a long period of time. Very worth the watch. Heck, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, make sure to emphasize its priority to the maximum if you\u2019ll ever feel like watching some great comedy. Extremely suggested.",

It may not send you into hysterical fits of laughter, but rest assured you will be having a loony grin plastered on your face while watching it. The best word to describe it will be 'Delightful'.

            "content": "This was one of the most pleasant surprises I got to experience in 2013. Since I just got into anime in the beginning of 2013, I saw that Kotaku listed Devil is a PT as one of the 5 spring 2013 anime that one should watch.\r\nI figure, hey, 13 episodes isn't much, let's give this a shot. Turns out I marathoned this anime in 2 days since it was just so much fun for me. The first episode has a bit more violence and is darker in tone than the rest of the anime, especially during the first 7 minutes or so, but I'd sayother than that, this anime is suitable for PG-13 and up. Younger children will probably not understand some of the jokes in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of this anime is very fresh, and thus very enjoyable. I found it drastically different than the usual school-based or workplace settings that are commonplace in other anime. \\n\r\nAll the characters (Maou, Yusha, and his minions and coworkers) all get a lot of valuable screen-time, and hardly any of the screen-time is wasted in my opinion. There is a bit of fan service in this anime, but it's not overused in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, animation quality, and sound are pretty typical. Nothing in the audio-visual department will WOW you, but they get the job done. Besides, the script and the banter amongst characters are what make this anime so darn appealing. \\n\\n\r\nIf I could say one thing, it's that the last episode in this series ends abruptly. There's no real closure to anything, and I can only hope for a season 2 that's in the works whenever the light novel has enough content to warrant a season 2.\\n\\n\r\nA solid 9 out of 10 overall from me. If it wasn't for the sudden ending, this would easily be a 10 just for sheer enjoyment purposes.\\n\\n\r\nFor those curious, Kotaku writer Richard Eisenbeis' full review for this anime is here\\n\r\nhttp://kotaku.com/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-is-clever-witty-and-just-p-606147259",

            "content": "We can all agree that most comedies in recent seasons of anime have always tried to cling on to a similar type of situations or settings, the most obvious one being school comedy shows. You never get to see writers try to come up with different kinds of circumstances that could be brilliant but once they do it usually comes off either decent or just plain forgettable. It\u2019s not often we get a show like Hataraku Maou-sama that is not only light-hearted and fun but also boasts some of the best comedy writing in an anime I\u2019ve seen in yet this year.\r\nThe title Hataraku Maou-samais exactly what the show is, in English it means The Devil is a Part-Timer. You have a character named Satan who is the dark overlord of this world that is unlike ours, and he is now put into our world in hopes of finding a way to bring his life in order and his magical powers back. What happens then is nothing short of rather very unique sets of humorous set pieces that are not only funny just by the jokes themselves but how they reflect our everyday lives in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe way they handle Satan\u2019s situation is done very maturely by making him do work that any citizen of any 1st world nation would do to live in stable conditions. The writers don\u2019t try to hammer in nonsensical exaggerated fluff into the mix to make it \u201cexciting,\u201d they make the actions the characters do feel very in tuned to how we would do in society\u2019s standards. Even with the smallest deals like trying to deal with house payments and workers pay. At first, you find it funny how a demon overlord can do all these things without breaking a sweat. Then, once you look beneath the background and delve in more in-depth, you start to notice how there\u2019s a hint of satire mixed in how we often hate working in part-time jobs because of the monotonous way of the work. It is great for the writers to make the message subtle so that it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s being forced down people\u2019s throats. Otherwise, the message would have a harsh tone to it.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can\u2019t just talk about the show without talking about the characters. Maou-sama casts a whole array of great comedic characters that fit together exceptionally well with smart writing to go with it. That isn\u2019t to say the script does every joke justice, but the it is self-aware that it\u2019s ridiculous in its subject matter and they take advantage of this fact. What works so well is how each character has very great chemistry that feels so real, and it doesn\u2019t feel contrived or cliched, it\u2019s an excellent connection whenever characters interact with one another. Satan and Emi, while rivals, both settle their disputes differently than you might think at first. It\u2019s handled cleverly and doesn\u2019t hamper on their archetypes at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWith the art and sound department, the art design is nice and clean without any limited budget. One special thing to mention is the facial expressions on the characters whenever a humorous scene is present; there are some that are unforgettable such as the famous tsundere Emi face that she makes in the police interrogation room. The voice actors do an excellent job in delivering their lines, more notably the jokes are made without any hyperbole.\\n\\n\r\nWith every comedy we get in the following seasons, there always seems to be this constant need for a plot structure that has to be serious. Maou-sama is no exception to this rule. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with comedies of any fashion delving into the drama to some degree, the plot given in Maou-sama is nothing spectacular at all. The worst part is that they even try to put in some comedy into the urgent moments here and there to remind us that it\u2019s a comedy show. That is not to say that it can\u2019t be done right but unfortunately for Maou-sama it just doesn\u2019t feel natural and it is not written very well in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, there is only one episode that isn\u2019t purely focused on comedy and quickly gets back to what makes it a brilliant one. There is the finale, but it is at least handled a little better in that respect. There is, however, another small gripe that involves the main villain of the show and the fact that he is not at all threatening. While this is supposed to be in context with the show being a comedy, they try to make us think we\u2019re supposed to take him seriously when it isn\u2019t at all convincing in the slightest bit.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the flaws mentioned above, this show is not meant to be missed by anyone who appreciates comedy. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that this can be funny by people who aren\u2019t a fan of comedy anime because it hardly draws any Otaku pandering like most comedies that have been released in the following months of the seasons. It is undeniably a nice break to see an anime comedy delve into different territory. It\u2019s a clear sign that shows like Maou-sama can capture an entire audience without regurgitating empty premises one after another. Sequels and moe comedies may sell big, but studios can\u2019t rely on them for long, people will eventually want something fresh. Only time will tell.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: -A",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama! is one of my favourite anime for many reasons, and I think it is a must watch for any comedy/action loving fan. Please read on to find out why!\r\nStory: 8\r\nI found that the story, although not completely original, was executed very well. It begins with a very action-packed opening scene, and transitions nicely into the characters arriving in this strange land known as 'Tokyo'. The comedic timing in this show is spot on, and because of that it often made me actually laugh out loud (that is rare). The story pans out a little slowly, and although the action at the start isquite flashy, there aren't many other moments in this anime where you get that. If you don't really like action though, then it will be just fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt was hard to find faults in this shows art and animation. The character designs were very attractive, and the scenery is quite plush. When it was time for the action scenes, the movement was fluid and there weren't any frames where the characters looke like a different person (has anyone seen Naruto vs Pain?). The only reason I didn't rate this section a 10 was because at times, and this is very infrequent, the characters face did look a little odd and disproportioned. Otherwise, the quality of artwork was top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening isn't played until quite late in the anime, but I found it well worth the wait. The chosen song is very enjoyable to listen to, and the animation complements it nicely. The ending is very soothing and finishes the episode very nicely. The voice actors were very good, portraying emotion well in many different situations, and it had a broad variety of voices. The soundtrack was nothing outstanding, but it fitted the scenes and one track in particular (The Devil Regains His Strength), after the first time it was used, every other time I heard it, I was filled with anticipation and knew something awesome was about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThere is a wide variety of different characters, each with very contrasting personalities. I found it quite enjoyable every time they introduced a new character. They did this every couple of episodes, but in a way that made it seem infrequent and fitting.  One thing that confused me was how Maou acted, as he is the demon Overlord who terrorised Ente Isla, and yet he does things in Tokyo that really makes me question his evilness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAlthough there are some negatives, I really did enjoy this show to the max, which is why I gave a 10. I just found it really fun to watch, and I had fun all throughout, even in the bits that looked a little 'icky'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! is definitely an anime I would recommend to all anime fans, as it is very entertaining and will give you a good laugh. In my opinion, this show should have a second season, as it doesn't quite give you that sense of fulfillment at the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt is my first review on this site, so it probably isn't great, but hey, thanks for taking the time to read it!",

The story is interesting and develops well throughout the series but an ending which Ifound was not as good as it should of been make Story get an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): The animation of Hataraku Maou-sama! is also great and is even more glorious in HD. The fights scenes in this series are brilliantly animated and are jammed packed. The series in colourful and does brilliantly to show what is happening at that part in the show, the animation is brilliant especially in this animes openings and ending sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): The sound is nice in this anime especially the ending themes which there are 4 of and the opening which combine brilliant animation and catchy music. The background music also fits well with what is happening at the exact moment whether the devil has done something good or something suspicious is happening. The English dub for this anime I think is done very well and all the characters especially Chiho and the devil. The Original Japanese is also great with the subs of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10): The characters in this show are brilliant and engaging. The Devil himself to the hero all the characters are amazing and are a vocal point of the show which sees you routing for all the characters and are sad when the series is finished because they were great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10) and Overall Verdict: I enjoyed this show very much and was interesting to watch and as soon as 1 episode finished I could not wait for the next episode. This is a funny show with brilliant comedy, animation and characters and good music with a solid story to hold it together. Overall I would recommend this anime to you.\\n\\n\r\nMy scored on MyAnimeList : \\n\r\nStory:8/10\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nOverall:9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy Scores without MyAnimeList:\\n\r\nStory:8.3/10\\n\r\nArt:9.4/10\\n\r\nSound:8.4/10\\n\r\nCharacter:9.7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9.8/10\\n\r\nOverall:9.12/10 (Watch It!!)\\n",

Hataraku Maou-sama is one of those animes that will throw you in for a spectacular ride with a twist! \r\nStory- 8\r\nBesides the world-traveling part of the story, I believe most of the story was quite original. I mean where else can you find an Overlord working in McDonalds? Despite others saying the pacing was slow, I thought it was appropriate- not too slow or too fast. As for the comedy, romance, and fantasy aspect, Hataraku uses absurd and cliche ideas and incorporates it into an outrageousyet sensational anime that is outright hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nI gave the art a high score because I believe it is well done and fairly attractive. I especially like how the eyes were drawn.I think it serves as an additional factor of this anime's brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nThere wasn't anything special about the soundtracks so I'll give it a 7. The OP and ED was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nThe characters weren't the most original,however, they were quite likable and contributed a fairly large amount to the comedy of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nTo wrap this up, I think Hataraku Maou-sama is a great anime. I only picked it up today after seeing some reviews on it and the description drew me in. I found myself hooked at the first episode so I hope the same would be for you.I finished this anime today, and for some reason I just had to come here and write a review! Pick this anime up if you want something light-hearted and entertaining to watch. It'll definitely brighten your mood and bring you some laughter!!\\n",

            "content": "What happens when you take the most devious, evil being in the universe, zap him of his power and force him to live like a normal person in the hustle and bustle of normalcy? Hilarity ensues! White Fox\u2019s (Steins;Gate, Re:Zero) 2013 release has probably one of the most unique premises in anime history. King Satan himself has been transported to earth along with his right hand man, Ashiya and ends up working at a fast food chain so cleverly coined \u201cMgRonalds\u201d while warding off heroes and other nemeses from his past life in Ente Isla. Yeah, sounds pretty interesting to me! Unfortunately, past some situationalcomedy mixed with supernatural elements, The Devil is a Part Timer lacks consistency and ends up as an overrated title with lots of pondering of what could\u2019ve been.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the series starts off actually made me think I was watching the wrong show. Demon lords and valiant heroes battling with their magic and might within a mystical land. I was honestly confused. But no sooner did I get used to this scenery then it was flipped onto its head and into present day. The seemingly invincible King Satan now made vulnerable by his mistaken transport to earth. This juxtaposition perfectly embodies the deconstruction archetype, and to see a comedic approach on the subject was refreshing. The plot isn\u2019t anything 2deep4u, but that\u2019s honestly one of the weaker areas overall. Instead of being straight comedy like Nichijou or Cromartie High School, this anime unfortunately makes the mistake of continually teasing a plot, only to never make good on that suggestion. It never really goes anywhere, and as a result begins to rapidly peeter out by the end of its short run.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve said in previous reviews that comedy is very subjective. The good thing about this series is how universal and digestible the humor really is. There are no Japanese references the Western audiences may find difficult to understand, nor are there many overly complex jokes present\u2026 just pure, situational comedy. At times it almost reminded me of a sitcom during some of the stagnant still scenes. The bad part of the comedy is how unrealistic it seems. I get the satirical nature of what the writers were trying to accomplish, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t think about how Satan would\u2019ve really behaved like in the same situation. I wish the writers would\u2019ve made it a tad darker with regard to Maou instead of the conformist approach.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part to point out is how much stronger the first half of the series is than the second. As more characters accumulate, the presence of Satan and his pals seem less out of the norm and more commonplace that their situational humor begins to falter. Not to mention I didn\u2019t care for anyone outside of the main four (Maou, Emi, Shirou and Chiho). Stringing these characters along on earth mixed with a few cameos probably would\u2019ve proved more effective in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a character perspective, there isn\u2019t much development outside of what you get in face value. There\u2019s not much growth with the exception of Emi and characterization is done mostly through the comedy. The main four were always enjoyable, and I think the writers just ended up stretching themselves too thin when the secondary characters were introduced. For being evil lords or powerful heroes from another world, they seemed to give up pretty easy when it came to living on earth. And of course you\u2019d want to live with someone you just tried to kill right?\\n\\n\r\nThe art, being that it is White Fox was rather attractive as always. Nothing too extravagant as far as detail goes, but just enough to get the job done. It\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve always given kudos to this studio for. The fight scenes are crisp and rendered well, and I can\u2019t think of any instances where the animation was inconsistent. I also wanted to make a mention of how accurate many of the environments were drawn concerning Japan. Some shows don\u2019t seem to get that right.\\n\\n\r\nSound is solid, but nothing to write home about. The OP is a generic JPop teen song, with quick beats and loud electronic tones while the ED turns it down a notch with a slow ballad accompanied by a revealing image of one of the characters. Pretty standard stuff here. The rest of the soundtrack I didn\u2019t even notice to be honest, and I don\u2019t know if I consider that a good or bad thing. The English dub is pretty stellar though, with Josh Grelle (Maou) and Tia Ballard (Chiho) earning full marks for performance.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, The Devil is a Part Timer is not a bad show\u2026 it\u2019s just not as good as I expected. Considering its popularity and rating I expected to find the next rare comedic gem but instead I was left with a lackluster run-of-the-mill show with a few funny jokes. I\u2019d still recommend it, especially to fans of more recent anime (since the comedy would probably be more attractive). Don\u2019t expect  to spit your food out from laughing so hard and you\u2019ll find a show worthy of a watch. Thanks again for reading!",

            "content": "What if the devil lost almost all of his power and was forced to live in modern world? What if the hero came to defeat him and was actually a really bad tempered yelling girl? What if the devil didn't really have any skills and was forced to work as a part-timer at MgRonalds to earn his living? Yeah, it really sounds like a hilarious situation and that's how this anime is. The writer does try to throw in some random romance or emotional stuff but this show really shines through it's comedy mainly and on that regard it really is one of the bestcomedies of 2013.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story is like almost as I described in the intro para but with 3-4 episodes small arcs which introduces new characters. There is the turmoil of the devil between whether to try to climb the social structure by climbing the work ladder on MgRonalds through working hard and finally take over our world (I don't know how that is even possible) or to get sufficient power to go back to his world. There is a romance sub-plot involving devil's co-worker who is deeply in love with him and people confusing devil & hero as couples. But the main shining point of the story is the comedy which is quite flawless in execution by the writer, sub-plots really gets annoying at times and also I find the fact that the story never really move towards a resolution quite frustrating but the comedy really kept me entertained. So the story gets 8 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe main character devil lord Maou is actually quite different from typical shounen heroes in a few aspects as he does not really wanna save anyone but himself but gets forced to do good work and tries to be responsible for his underlings; hero Yusa has this somewhat tragic back-story yet is confused by the change in the devil lord, so just follows him around being suspicious of him; devil lord's cute and energetic co-worker who falls madly in love with him despite knowing his true nature; Ashiya, devil lord's loyal general who takes the role of doing the household chores in this new world for them; all these characters while not terribly original serves their function quite well. The new characters which are introduced later on through the small story arcs are a bit lacking in comparison in my view as they somewhat does a failed attempt at giving the show a bit of serious nature. Overall this aspect gets 8.5 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nWhile it is really not top-notch it does serve its purpose quite alright. The character designs are quite interesting in their own regards. Although in my opinion there is a few unnecessary use of ecchi in some episodes the overall art & animation style was quite appropriate for the show. It gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening theme is \"ZERO!!\" by Minami Kuribayashi and the ending themes are \"Tsuki Hana\", \"Star Chart\" & \"Tsumabiku Hitori\" by nano.RIPE. Although I found the opening and the first ending quite catchy after a few listens, to be honest none of them really does highlight the comedy nature of the show which I found a bit disappointing. The in-show music never really catches any attention and are not noteworthy in my opinion either. I found the sound quite lacking and certainly the poorest side of the show. It gets 6 out of 10.\\n\r\nAlthough I found the lack of any resolution of the storyline quite disappointing and also was a bit bored at some unnecessary sub-plots overall I really enjoyed the show for its comedy. It really was quite unique in a fun way in that approach.\\n\r\nWhile not perfect by any means this is a must watch show 2013 for any fans of comedy.\\n\r\nOverall score -\\n\r\n                                 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "It was funny at times, but it didn't understand how its own comedy worked and eventually fell apart.\r\nThe show starts out well enough, the premise is a solid foundation for situational comedy, 2 enemies trapped together and have to co-exist sets up a number of fun little gags, the fact that the main character is the literal devil is honestly just a gimmick to get people to check it out, the writers either didn't understand or didn't care what the devil is supposed to be, but it was just semantics and the show still made me chuckle a number of times each episode, so Ilet it slide.\\n\\n\r\nAround half way through though, they resolve everything. They now know how to get home and can do it at basically any time if they want, they just...don't. The situation has changed from they are trapped and \"have\" to co-exist to they \"choose\" to co-exist. This completely ruins the entire show. For one, they don't sufficiently explain why any of them are choosing to stay in this world, they try to brush it off by Maou saying he used up all his magic every time, but they have ways of getting magic and they just don't. The show also loses any appeal of the conflict between the main characters, we now no longer believe they hate each other but they still act like they do, so any conflict feels empty.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that the show probably could've salvaged itself if it didn't waste several episodes on stupid harem clich\u00e9s. Emi acting all tsundere was fine, in fact made some sense given the situation, Chiho was pretty useless most of the time but at least contributed to Maou's suggested growing humanity, but Suzuno served no purpose in the plot but to add another cute girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe show did manage to salvage itself to some extent by introducing a new antagonist at the end the audience genuinely hated, but as they say, too little too late.",

            "content": "Well I have just completed this anime and therefore I am going to give my opinion about this anime too, as I think this anime does not deserve the rating it is given right now.\r\nWhen I heard about this series it immediately caught my attention. The demon Lord somehow ends up in the human world and starts a conquest to conquer the world! This all wrapped nicely in a comedy show and it immediately reminded me a bit of Beelzebub. So you could imagine how excited I was for it to air. And for the first few minutes my expectations where fullfilled but afterwards itwent downhill. And I will telly you why in this review.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFirst off the Art is good. Its not glorious but its good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSame wiht the sound. I didnt find anything to stand out, but neither was it bad its good.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ah yes the Story. Probably one of the most boring Stories I have watched recently, wasting a very interesting and good start by throwing it in the dark pits of average boring slice of life Hell. But more to that when I talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights: They are not even worth mentioning as they are quite boring, short and consist mostly of talking.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: This is were the show shines, this is what made me not stop watching the series. The comedy is simply hilarious and extremely funny. But there is one problem. The show only consists of 20% comedy. The other 80% are wasted on the extremely boring story and some boring slice of life which is not funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This was the probably weakest point of the show. And its not the characters themselves that are bad but their progression.\\n\\n\r\nMao: The main character is the probably weakest of them all. Starting off as an epic Demonlord worthy of his title killing thousands of his enemys, he then lands on the human world, providing us with the funny awkward comedy that only a demonlord stranded on the human world could provide, just to change in the mere time of about 5!! minutes off the anime into the most law abiding and good-hearted citizen you have ever seen! Like wtf? How the hell does a Demonlord that has killed thousands of people change into the most naively good-hearted guy you have ever seen? This is what the main character basically is. Another generic anime good guy, with the exception that he is the demonlord. And the anime sometimes lets hin show off his powers just to remind you that he in fact is actually a demonlord, cause otherwise you would surely forget!\\n\\n\r\nAshija: He is the Demonlords right hand who accompanies him from the beginning to the end. While he suffers from the same issues as Mao-same as in loosing his demonlord character and becoming a loving a caring housewife for Mao Darling, he at least keeps a certain form of awkwardness regarding the human world and its custodys. He STILL feels like he is from another word and he also provide most of the funny moments and comedy this anime had making him my favourite character of them all.\\n\\n\r\nEmilia: Ah Yes the generic tsundere. The Demonlord slaughtered her whole family and town killed many of her friends and brothers in arms, she herself risked her life in fighting the demonlord, but hey on the human world everything is different. After the first encounter being one where she immediately attacks him, she soon after seeing that the demonlord has lost his bite she forgots all her grudges against him and is as worryfree as ever around him.\\n\\n\r\nChi-chan: Well while she wasnt highly original either she was a very likeable and lovely character. She also had this interesting ability where she responded to magic in some sort but the show never bothers to explain it further and simply throws the fact away after the first time it shows up in the show. So making Chi-chan the loveable yet useless potential love interest for the demonlord. But wait what for this anime doesnt have romance.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I do not recommend this anime to people looking for a great comedy or for people that care about character development that does not make any sense at all. On the other hand if you enjoy some semi-serious slice of Life this show might be just for you.",

            "content": "Anime. Comedy.\r\nFor me, those two dreaded words have slowly warped in meaning over the years, once instilling excitement and anticipation and then slowly drying up into a well of disappointment and crushed expectations. As I took recommendation after recommendation I figured that surely, eventually, I would find a show that clicked with my sense of humor and leave me crying tears of sweet mirthful bliss. Comedy is all personal, remember, so I'm not bashing any of these shows for those who enjoyed them, but these were my personal reactions.  Noazki-kun didn't quite elicit a confession of love from me. Cromartie High was a littleoff-the-mark. Detroit Metal City got me to nod appreciatively, but never actually laugh. Konosuba just made me wish there were more D&D episodes in Community. My recommendation list stretched thin, I finally turned to the looming behemoth, the all-mighty and universally revered Gintama, and after three separate attempts to watch it I finally collapsed 20 episodes in, bored out of my mind. Craving the sweet release of mindless, hilarious entertainment, I crawled back to my roots and checked to see if The Devil is a Part-Timer was still on Netflix.\\n\\n\r\nIt was. Could it stand the test of time? Well, it was worth the risk. The answer?\\n\\n\r\n...Kindof? Let's take a look. But before that, let's talk comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest comedies all have a few things in common. First off, they HAVE to be innovative. Comedies of course dry up when they recycle the same humor over and over (helllooo One Punch Man) but just presenting different types of humor isn't enough. Shows have to be imaginative, constructing new and unheard-of situations that belong solely to them. Gintama is pretty stellar at this once in awhile, but it suffers from a lack of consistency, which is something else great comedies have in common. Dud episodes stand out a lot more in comedies than other shows, as you can kind of ignore weird filler in a plot but when your objective is face-value entertainment, 20 minutes of boredom will snap you right out of a laughing mood. The best comedies though aren't just consistent and creative, they have strong central casts that have uniquely compelling dynamics and garner strong emotional ties from their audience. This is something anime comedies usually do well, as most 'comedies' are actually really just feel-good and often random slice-of-life shows. That feel-good feeling is crucial, as it elevated the impact of the jokes if you also CARE about the characters, and is often enough to get you through the slower parts. Finally, and this is the one that nearly every comedy, anime or not, fails at, there's propulsion. By having a status quo that actually shifts you dramatically increase investment in the character's lives, create a plethora of opportunities for fresh humor, and introduce another level of investment as people will now actually care about the plot. Unfortunately, most shows will excessively spam the 'reset' button at the end of each brief story arc, forcing everything back to exactly how it was, or, in the case of American sitcoms, they'll just have all the main cast take turns dating each other to the point where these romances cease to mean anything. This ploy makes sense: once you have a formula that works, messing with it too much can be dangerous, especially as it can muck up that comfort of reliability so many viewers crave. However, only those comedies with propulsion to their story line truly rise majestically above the rest to become real masterpieces. \\n\\n\r\nSo where does The Devil is a Part-Timer stand in all this?\\n\\n\r\nIn a bit of an odd place, truth be told.\\n\\n\r\n'Hataraku Maou-sama!' or 'The Devil is a Part-Timer' is a glossy 1-cour saga following a premise that sounds extremely anime. The Demon King, referred to often simply as \"Satan\", finds himself cornered by the forces of Good and decides to flee the generic fantasy realm of Ente Isla with his trusted remaining general. Whoops though, they end up in Tokyo, looking like regular people and missing nearly all of their magic. A classic blunder. While I guess this is technically a nifty spin on the isekai genre, this endearing set-up isn't exactly revolutionary, and so as usual a lot of it comes down to how it's handled. From the beginning the show really leans into the contrast between the two words, focusing on the difference between the mundane streets of Tokyo and the mythic kingdoms of Ente Isla. Though it may be a generic world, Ente Isle seems to be fully-enough realized to act as an actual counterweight for the show's Japanese adventures, a gimmick that pulls a lot of weight. What also helps is how utterly serious everything in Ente Isla is: from the dramatic lofty church music to the stern faces of every lord and king we get a glimpse of, this is a place perpetually trapped in the dramatic stakes of a Tolkien story, something that goes a long way towards making Satan's bumbling adventures in Tokyo that much funnier.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while the contrast with Ente Isla is great, there isn't enough of it. For a show entirely predicated on the humor derived from putting medieval mythology into a modern setting, the mythology gets under-served. There's a thin trickle of problems that make their way over to harass the devil, but there's not enough focus on establishing these elements in their home world first. By the time characters arrive in Tokyo they've usually already pretty much instantly normalized their surroundings, and their mythic auras are curtailed before we get the chance to see them shine. What I'm really trying to say here is that I feel as though Ente Isle could have been an absolutely phenomenal source of drive for the story as a whole, with consistent cutaways to a slowly-mounting crusade intent on the final eradication of the Devil juxtaposed against him trying to handle tough customers as a cashier. The slow stream of scouts and assassins slowly mounting into a full-on clusterfuck war would have given the show the kind of overarching storyline that it really craved. As is, the show is kind of broken into somewhat-detailed but unrelated arcs that give temporary senses of direction but ultimately fall into that classic, horrid pitfall: they reset to the status quo at the end, at most adding another character to the main cast but never truly altering the dynamic. It's a bit of a bizarre dance because the truth is that what makes the show so compelling a lot of the time is the fact that it's clearly straining against this urge. There are multiple moments where characters have straightforward emotionally-charged conversations out of nowhere that directly and explicitly shift the future nature of their relationship. However, these shifts are clearly holding back, wanting to push the show forward but afraid to change too much lest the magic formula get shattered. The show asks some big questions about the contradictory natures of its characters, but, ultimately, it is afraid to give a real answer to any of them. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, the show for the most part triumphs with its main cast. Establishing a cast dynamic easy to invest in and open to lots of options can be quite difficult, but Satan and his general Alciel provide a rock-solid core by presenting a duo that is capable, endearing, randomly ignorant, and most of all mysterious. The cause for the shift in Satan's attitude upon arriving in Japan is one that plagues both the viewer and the rest of the show's cast, and the fact that we never see what he was really like back in Ente Isla adds to the confounding nature of his personality. On top of being intriguing, Satan and Alciel capitalize on their dual existence in everything they do, often relapsing into old speech or the fictional language of Ente Isla, framing their daily lives on a grand scale (they refer to their apartment as the 'castle', most dilemmas as 'battles', and their bicycle as 'Dullahan, the Trusty Steed'.) Though the depiction of their adjustment to Japan is rushed, the do the premise justice on a constant basis. The problem is that they are constantly degraded, both in-show and on a meta level, by the show's single most obvious problem: Emelia Yusa, the Hero. Framed as a foil to Satan, Emi the angelic legendary hero whose quest is the slay the Devil is riddled by every bullet the demon pair managed to dodge. Unsubtle, obnoxious, and cliche, Emi serves essentially to remind us that the Devil is supposed to be evil, and outside of a few scenes with legitimately earned dramatic weight she is written as an emotionally-volatile tsundere identical to every other character of the archetype. Her rampart immaturity, lack of confidence, and general inability create a mockery of the fantasy-real world dynamic that sabotages the self-serious vibe of the other world and actively detracts from the atmosphere-based humor by making Ente Isle seem like it's filled with samey high-school girls like anywhere else. Coupled with her complete lack of any traits, ticks or struggles indicating she used to live somewhere else and the fact that her already eye-rolling contributions to the humor are repeated as many times as possible, Emi is the show's most poorly-handled element. Her irreversible entrenchment at the heart of the show is the greatest thing holding it back.\\n\\n\r\nThe ACTUAL highschooler, on the other hand, is a totally different story. The show's token character that's actually from Japan is Satan's bubbly co-worker Chiho, and the weight that Emi drops she is more than ready to pick up. Endearingly earnest, simple, energetic, and adorable, Chiho is the foil Satan deserves. She's brash, she speaks her mind, she's strikingly more competent than the actual hero, and she's unabashedly a totally standard teenage girl who loves to dress up and go shopping and hang out with her friends and just also happens to be friends with Satan. Chiho's reckless involvement with the elements of Ente Isle and her endearing and wholesome relationships with both Satan and Alciel make her the light of the show, and the occasional melancholy the show dips into capitalizes on the bittersweet divide between her rather ordinary life and the grand scale of the world of Angels and Demons that she brushes up against every day. The show is honestly worth it just for Chiho and Satan's interactions, which is exactly the kind of dynamic that carries good comedies. Chiho is a complete success.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to touch on consistency and innovation. The show has one or two episodes that are actual duds, but the main problem is that it peaks around episode 5 with the resolution of its first arc. After that, the show stays funny, but it finds itself unable to mount a scenario to riff off of as compelling as its first one and suffers from an overall slight decline in the consistency of its humor. This of course is tied to the show's innovation: while several of its later episodes stand out as creative and uniquely enjoyable, the show's second actual arc is simply a re-spun version of its first one, utilizing several of the exact same details and gimmicks and, in spite of a new antagonist, it begins to feel rather cyclical. On top of this, the show dips into cliche comedy territory once or twice, yanking out the pool episode and haunted house episodes with no real unique characteristics, a sign that perhaps the creator was running low on ideas. The show never becomes truly repetitive, but it oftentimes fails to push its own limits, seeming to take the 'safe' route. While the second half does still have some real stunners and certain relationships continue to have meaningful development late into the show, a general decline in creativity and consistency makes me wish for what could have been if just a little more thought and effort had been put into expanding the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, that's about how I feel about the show as a whole: that just a little more thought and effort could have tipped this show into the territory of truly great comedies. It half-succeeds at just about every criteria I laid out for great comedies, presenting reasonable consistency, a mostly-endearing cast, the makings of a driving overarching plot, and an acceptable amount of creativity, but never truly masters any of them. Considering when I watched it and the realness of the merits it DOES have, I'll always consider it a classic, but it will never quite reach the heights of stuff like Scrubs or Community or the Ranma 1/2 manga. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for specifically ANIME comedy, I cannot recommend this show enough. I've watched just about every anime comedy that's been highly recommended to me, and I've enjoyed few of them enough to even finish them. The fact that I was still laughing out loud fairly often at this show when I had even already seen it before is extremely unique for me among anime comedies. I completely and totally understand the drive to seek out things that are specifically anime: while I would say \"just go watch Community,\" there is an itch in all of us that only anime can scratch, and if you're feeling that way and wanna laugh and unwind with something fun, The Devil is a Part-Timer might be one of your very best bets. This show is no masterpiece, but it is very watchable by any standards, and if I were just comparing it to other straight anime comedies it's probably more like a 9. I'll keep trying those recommendations, but for now, I'm at least happy to know I can come back to this one. \\n",

            "content": "As a person who isn't interested in comedy in general, it is really hard to find a not-so-serious show that is actually enjoyable. The devil is a part-timer! was quite a surprise for me. \r\nTen years from now if I still remember this anime, it would be the built-in commercials... \r\nConstructive Criticisms are welcomed via PM or comment, they will be appreciated greatly. \r\nSTORY (Concept 4/5, Developement 3/5)\r\nIn an age when all animes are set in a world where people from reality somehow fall into some sort of fantasy (shout out to SAO and No game no life), this show is brave enough to dothe reverse. I like how the characters in the fantasy world love the human world and stay in it, which is quite cool. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I am a bit too harsh on this series. Demon? Hero? I can seriously name at least 10 other animes that have the similar stage from the top of my head. I mean, can they be slightly more creative? \\n\\n\r\nSo when these people run in to the human world, they quickly adapt the rules and orders. The Devil starts to find jobs, get a apartment just like a real person. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, as I constantly ask myself over the time I spent watching it, I just don't see the objective of the show. Alright it is all cool that these magical characters are living at the bottom of the human society, so... what? Why would I care? Where are they going? Are they gonna conquer the human world? I understand that this series is unfinished, but can they at least give us a little bit of clue?\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all, the story is funny. And for the pure sake, brainless entertainment this show does it pretty well. Unlike most other comedies I watched, the jokes in the show are actually \"relatable\" and funny. I guess that is the whole point of the series. (The pop cultural references are very very funny)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 4/5, Developement 4/5)\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that the characters are unique and interesting. The demons are not so demonic, the hero is not so heroic and the angels are not so angelic. This idea is simply fun and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this series has pretty much all the characters we can find in a comedy series, A try-hard protagonist, he's BFF, the girl, the Moe and the others. \\n\\n\r\nThey characters really changed overtime. The The demon King, begins with a calm and ambitious nature, gradually becomes a characters with inner strength and justice. He decides to stay in the human world, cuz he found something good and worth living for. It is a little dramatic, but the development is pretty neat. \\n\\n\r\nThe hero wants to kill the demon, but slowly she realizes she doesn't have a reason to do so. She learns about her enemy gradually understand him as a person. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are less important, but they all have their comedic purpose and little stories. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the problem stands, \"so what?\" This may not be as big of a problem for other people, but for me... yea I just don't like slice of life, not so objective-centred stories. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 4/5, Animation 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very pleasant and fresh, which is part of the reason I watched it in the first place. The background captures the \"past and present\" feeling of Tokyo, and the characters all have distinct style and colors. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem that this kind of art is so lack of style. The art is just too typical and doesn't make the show memorable graphically.\\n\r\nOh right I'm just gonna briefly mention the fan service. Alright that's it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation... Let me just say that when the screen moves, they move smoothly. You guessed it, the screens barely move other than the talking mouths. \\n\r\nCome on, this was made in 2013, why are they still using 2-D clip art to represent fading dusts in the action scenes?  And the laser beams combined with huge color balls appearing in the sky literally just summarizes the battles. They are not well done. \\n\\n\r\nI can't believe the graphic is actually the largest weak point this series has, very disappointed. But hey, after all it is not a high-budget anime with a million action scenes. This will do. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 1/3, OST 2/3, Dub/Sub 4/4) \\n\\n\r\nThe opening isn't a bad song. But the distinct lack of recognizable melody truly destroys the overall feeling when I enter the show. It is just so not memorable to a point that I didn't even bother listen to it online. The ending, bad animation aside, is also a very generic song. Overall, the music really isn't well done. (you may like it, but certainly not above average)\\n\\n\r\nOST are decent. In the \"serious\" scenes, the music is both intense and calm, so you really wouldn't feel worried or scared in anyway (it's a comedy, they are supposed to do that), and in the funny scenes, the music does fit the atmosphere nicely. After all that, the music wasn't memorable and symbolic. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few comedy dubs that I actually laughed at. They really smoothed out the puns and languages so it doesn't feel awkward despite that fact that the jokes were targeting Japanese audience. It is actually so funny to watch. All the pop cultural stuff on top of the \"MgRonald, Moonbucks, SFC\" makes the journey one hell of a run. \\n\\n\r\nThe subs are also very well done. If you want to choose between the two, I'd say if you like westernized animes with good westernized dialogues and jokes, go watch dub; if you want pure Japanese (well at least pureer), watch the sub and it is very entertaining too. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a personal thing. I did laugh at some if not most jokes and I really thought it was a well done series, but as I said I don't like this kind of semi-serious shows. It really felt like I was wasting my time. Not that the jokes were bad, it's just, they aren't smart enough for me to spent 4 hours of time to watch it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nAfter criticizing the show too seriously, I figured it is only fair to consider the comedic nature of the show. This show was never meant to be a masterpiece that makes people remember it for decades. It is simply a show that make you have this instant and short time of joy. It is a funny show, check it out if you have the time, but don't expect anything deep or meaningful in any way whatsoever, you aren't getting much out of it. \\n\\n\r\nYea, I'm too harsh. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "I would say that Hataraku Maou-Sama tries too hard to be what it's not. It's meant to be a comedy but there are many scenes inside which try to make it seem like there's some deeper plot/reveal when everyone knows that there obviously isn't because the style has made it clear that the anime doesn't take itself seriously at all.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nI don't know if you can call anything in this anime a \"story\". Sure there were some minor conflicts about, but most of it was just routine. I would give the story 3 points just because there seemed to be 3 major arcs where therewas any form of development, namely the first encounter with Lucifer, the second encounter with Suzuno and the third encounter with Archangel Sariel. The others are rather filler, or small and don't add much.\\n\\n\r\nPlot wise, I have nothing to say much, because nothing including their powers makes sense and nothing is expected to make sense anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt was generally pleasant, I like the bright colours, but it was mediocre at best and nothing really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't actually any good sound in this anime. I didn't like the OP or EDs, I thought they were very mehh and skipped all of it entirely. Background music was okayish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is some extent of character breath on Maou's part, but still zero depth, and even less for the rest of the characters. Depth of characterization was strongest when the three main females were talking in out about Maou, and that was honestly not very strong anyway. The character cast is interesting though, but it was very undeveloped for Urushihara, Orba, Ashiya.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely, one of the higher points for this anime. It was quite slapstick in nature for the first few episodes (tripping, falling, accidents...etc). Funny remarks like how characters diss each other, and things like \"Damn I wish the elevator was working\", I found the Mg Ronald and Sentucky Fried Chicken conflict incredibly hilarious, to be honest. I particularly remember the part with \"Double Quarter Pounder Burger\" and \"McRonald Burger\", that was quite classic.\\n\\n\r\nI love how the show ends up not even taking the serious fights seriously, and how Maou keeps going on about the things that absolutely dont make sense. Oh yes, not to mention the poor little Dullahan bicycle. Definitely, one of the funnier animes out there, but I thought it could have made me laugh a lot more. Most of these humourous things lasted only briefly and was never built-upon to become a solid comic series.\\n\\n\r\nBesides humour, I also enjoyed the action scenes with Maou, but I was sad that it didn't amount to much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a great anime series, it's probably only worth your time if you seriously have nothing else to watch (like I was, and ended up watching something like this). But it can possibly make you laugh, because of all the funny scenes in it. So watch it if you have some spare time.",

            "content": "A failed gateway drug.\r\nSlice of life and romantic comedy genres have always been behind shounen and fantasy/ sci-fi in popularity. It stands to reason that eventually a producer would try to encroach on that territory with a special formula pure-bred to draw in a new audience and teach them appreciation of your genre.\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! is that special formula, sadly it is not a very good one.\r\nAt first glance, the concept lends itself very well to what they are trying to do. Satan gets exiled to Japan along with his most loyal henchman, and has to learn the ways of a new life while trying tofind a way back. It should be a comedy goldmine, but the amount of missed opportunities for comedy far surpass the actual comedy in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! is a schizophrenic show split down the middle between comedy and action. The action parts contain no comedy, and the comedy parts contain no action. Heck, even the comedy parts sometimes don't contain comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe brunt of the comedic weight in Hataraku Maou-sama! is carried by Maou's henchman Ashiya. His fish-out-of-water coping mechanisms are a joy to behold in the early series, and his reactions to seeing the changes in his master are a treat. Unfortunately, Maou himself skips right past the fish-out-of-water stage, jumping straight into overzealous fast food worker mode, and a huge goldmine of comedy is seemingly boarded up by the producers. As far as the plot development goes, Maou again comes short as a character because his true motivations are questionable. The writer expects you to take Maou's motivation to 'become a good guy' at face value.\\n\\n\r\nEnter carbon-copy arche-tsundere Emi Yusa. Maou's mortal enemy. She has followed Maou from Ente Isla, and begins her existence on earth stalking Maou and conspiring to finally dispose of him, but seeing the changes in his personality, starts to have second thoughts. At first, Emi seems to be an interesting character with promise for a lot of depth, unfortunately that promise has so far been a false dawn.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of Emi and Maou are exceedingly symmetrical and predictable. It feels overall like a waste of time that the producers would devote such an exorbitant amount of screentime to this dynamic. The two need more real conflict eventually or become entirely dried up as a plot anchor.\\n\\n\r\nAbout halfway in, the show started boring me and I became conscious to that fact. Luckily, the arrival of Kamazuki Suzuno, a new character, saved this anime from becoming the first anime I'd ever dropped. Kamazuki is all the things that the rest of the cast aren't. Funny and deep while advancing the plot, and despite seeming to be unimportant to the main plot, she pretty much steals the title of 'main plot' with her backstory and character development for me personally. Her arrival livens up the rest of the cast as well, especially the one-dimensional dere-dere Sasaki Chiho, who takes her to be her new rival in love with Maou.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings up another point, why is this even tagged with 'romance'? Chiho surely displays intentions of romance in the show, but Maou himself seems utterly asexual. It takes two to romance.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I have high hopes for this show to get a second season, because Kamazukis arrival in the anime has given me hope of the potential of this anime. She could very well become the glue that finally sticks some sense on to the rest of the group.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hopefully, if it does get another season, Emi and Maou's characters stop being so utterly boring.",

            "content": "The anime industry is not unlike any other industry in that popular themes or ideas are often duplicated. Some themes or ideas become mainstays, like shows centered around a group of girls doing aimless things, while others don't catch on as much such as the brief \"young girl detective\" phase that spawned Gosick and Kamisama no Memochou.\r\nHataraku no Maou-sama! looks like to fall into the latter category. Arriving right after Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, it could end up being the last new series chronicling the unlikely relationship between a Hero and Demon Lord. Which may not be such a bad thing.\r\nHataraku no Maou-sama!, which I fromhereafter will abbreviate as HnM, chronicles the blue collar struggle of the titular Maou as he works to be the best MgRonald's employee he can be whilst simultaneously dealing with new arrivals from his fantastical homeland of Ente Isla and a Hero who wants him dead and all without the aid of his magical powers, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with HnM's plot is that the series establishes quite quickly that there won't be much animosity between Maou and Emilia (the Hero) and that it is more content to depict their misadventures rather than expound on the war on Ente Isla or detail a serious effort by the characters' to return home. This results in a plot that stutters between the average, realistic life of the characters and supernatural developments. Both of which are mingled with comedy. And speaking of the comedy, it is undeniably HnM's strongest asset. Unfortunately, it can't bear the weight of a story that trades progression for levity which, in turn, has the effect of weakening any ambition put forth by the cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the characters themselves. To put it simply, none are particularly developed and if they are, marginally so. To make matters worse, there's glaring dichotomy between how the Ente Isla natives behaved in Ente Isla and how they behave on Earth. There's some consistency, from character such as Olba and Sariel, who are one dimensional anyway, but otherwise, what appeared to be hatred and cruelty built from years of vicious war, dissipate almost on arrival. \\n\\n\r\nThis would be understandable if we were subjugated to only the humans' perspective of the demons but it's quite obvious the demons are everything they're said to be...they just don't act like it. The same could be said for Emilia, who never looks convincing in her quest to kill Maou despite having more than enough reason to do so. The characters motives and history are defined but their actions are often to the contrary to the without proper reasoning or sound evidence.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound itself, the seiyuus do a commendable job for each character although I didn't think much of the OST, in fact I don't recall a single track. Similarly, the art is of a fine quality and the scenes that involve depictions of supernatural powers are well animated. Simply put, I didn't have a problem with either.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku no Maou-sama! is a show that never seems to have any sense of urgency and it creates an ambivalent plot and questionable character behavior. Still, it's by no means a bad show and while I did mention there likely could be no more new shows based around demon lords and heroes, it doesn't mean that this will be the last season of this one. Which may not be such a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for your time.",

            "content": "When Satan, the physical manifestation of evil is flipping burgers and dipping fries part-time at a 'MgRonalds to pay for an economy apartment', you know you're in for one monster of a comedy show.\r\n\"The Devil is a Part-Timer!\" (hereafter TDiaPT) makes for pretty good entertainment. I do have a few complaints, which will come later, but generally the positive aspects of TDiaPT outweigh the negatives, and most of my complaints are conditional.\r\nThe story is lacking in some respects, but this is by no means a serious series, no matter what the first five minutes lead you to think. TDiaPT made short work or making melaugh, and continued to do so for almost the entirety of the season. Some of the people I've talked to concerning TDiaPT expressed concerns about how little time the series spends on backstory, specifically the Ente Isla conflict, but objectively I believe this has little impact on the quality of the show. With what we're given, I was able to get the jist of what happened before Satan showed up in Japan. The show does an outstanding job of blending drama and slice-of-life style, while maintaining regular comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as art style is concerned, I found the show very pleasing to watch. The action (when it does appear) is fast-paced and fluid, and the calmer scenes feel just that, calm. The character design is above average, with powered-up Satan, Emi and company looking quite believable as dangerous fighters, and human-form aforementioned looking like average folk. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack doesn't play as big a role in this series as it would in a more dramatic example, but when it is needed it delivers. For the sake of ease, I'll throw subtitle concerns in this category as well. The people of Ente Isla speak a different language (in both dubs) than the people of Earth. The language is essentially English with a few letters switched about, but the medium through which I watched the show didn't provide any subtitles for this alternative language. Downloaded versions may come with subtitles, and if you're already watching subbed this shouldn't become an issue.\\n\\n\r\nThe character developement is surprisingly good, for what TDiaPT is. Without spoiling much, I can tell you that Satan and friends will act quite differently from what you might expect.\\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment, I found TDiaPT to be a great palate cleanser to watch between more serious series. The story is generally jovial with few exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a good show to check out if you're getting burnt out on mature, intense stuff. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama is sort of about a demon king from another fantasy world is defeated and teleported to our world in Japan. He needs money so he becomes an employee at the royalty-free McDonald's. That's what the show's synopsis would have you believe, but really this show is a whole mess of other things.\r\nSTORY 3/10\r\nThe story is the weakest part of the entire show. I read the description and I rightfully thought this was going to be an up-beat work place comedy about someone trying to adjust to another world. And I was right... for only 1 episode. I would've much preferred it to bejust that, but instead we got a romantic, action, comedy, fantasy. Those 4 elements rarely ever work together, and this is no exception. So many conflicting tones and side plots are being juggled against each other to the point where at times, the comedy is completely absent.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 8/10\\n\r\nEntertaining at best. The shows' characters are very diverse in terms of personality and roles. By the end of the series, there are only 6 important characters, and they are entertaining to watch, impact the story, offer good comedy and get plenty of attention. Emilia is your standard tsundere, and when I say standard I man standard! She's a generic tsundere and if those piss you off, you might not enjoy this as much. My only other complaint about these characters is their arcs, or lack Therof. Emilia has an arc, but it takes too long for it to happen, not to mention it's obviously going to happen. Maou's arc happens within the first episode, which is WAY too fast. He's supposed to be Satan, so he should at least act like it and learn how to be nice. Disappointed to not see that happen. No one else has arcs.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation is the best part of the show. It looks nice, pretty, shiny and new. The few action scenes spread out through this show (yes, there are action scenes), looks awesome! Despite my complaints about the exsistence of action earlier in the review, I at least loved how they looked. The sound is also good. I watched this in English, with the dubbed cast. For the most part, they're really good. Emilia's voice got on my nerves eventually, and I couldn't get enough of Suzuhara's voice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nIn the end, this show feels like a mixed bag of good and bad. Did I enjoy this show? Ehhh, it could've been much better. Was this show good? I mean it's not bad. It's not great and it's by no means horrible, but I was still disappointed by all these different genres fighting each other for dominance. So should you watch it? It's short (13 episodes) so it won't eat up much of your time, but then again, that's 6 hours you can be watching something like Baccano.",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama, aka The Devil is a Part Timer, is an amusing little comedy from White Fox, the studio that brought you Jormungand, Steins;Gate, and Katanagatari. \r\nIt follows the exploits of Satan himself, along with his loyal servant Alciel, after being transported from their world to the human world by the hero Emilia. As you can imagine, hilarity ensues. Having no money, no magic, and no knowledge of the language, they naturally run around causing all sorts of trouble in the human world. After getting some basic grasp of the language and an incredibly tiny apartment, Satan is forced to work at the local fastfood joint MgRonald\u2019s to make ends meet. Going by the name Maou Sadao, he attempts to adjust to life in the human world. All while avoiding the vengeful wrath of the hero Emilia, as she\u2019s followed him to the human world.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show so entertaining is perhaps its endearing characters and their often hilarious interactions with each other and the world around them. It is in no way deep and complex, nor is its story even anything to get excited over. But keep in mind that this is a comedy. Hataraku maou-sama is silly and unserious from beginning to end. Or rather it is for the most part. But more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nSatan, or Maou Sadao as he goes by in the human world, was a ruthless conqueror in his dimension. His foray into the human world reveals another side to his personality. As a human, he actually shows affection for his friends and cares about their well-being. He\u2019s also laid back and a bit of a ditz, only occasionally showing off his true general colors when MgRonald\u2019s needs him. Alciel, or Shirou Ashiya, is a frugal, responsible, and loyal servant of Maou. He\u2019s everything Maou isn\u2019t, leading him to frequently chastise Maou for his irresponsible behavior (namely with their limited finances). \\n\\n\r\nThe hero Emilia, or Emi Yusa, is a nice, proper young lady to her human friends, yet hostile and borderline obsessive in her quest to destroy Satan. Her extremely hostile and oftentimes hilarious fixation with destroying Maou brings about quite a few laughs over the course of the series. There\u2019s also Chiho Sasaki, mostly there as eye candy, who has a not so subtle crush on Maou.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the four main characters, there are a number of side characters, most coming from the same world as Emi and Maou. They all end up having extremely odd personalities, and even less knowledge of the human world than Maou when he first comes. This includes Lucifer, who comes to the human world, is curbstomped by Maou, then for some odd reason, freeloads off of them and becomes a NEET in the process. There\u2019s also Suzuno, walking around in a kimono after having studied the wrong era of Japan and coming to the conclusion that this is what everyone wears. They also happen upon some very quirky villains that cause all kinds of mayhem to the unsuspecting citizens of Tokyo. There\u2019s also the hilarious landlady Miki Shiba, whose appearance is used as the butt of some jokes that involve sending Maou and Ashiya some interesting postcards, much to their horror. \\n\\n\r\nThese characters don\u2019t develop or grow much over the course of the anime. Most of the characters don\u2019t get a lot of backstory either. In other words, many of the characters remain largely static throughout the entire anime. That doesn\u2019t mean they are bad characters though. As stated above, their interactions and vivid personalities are what make the show. Some of the characters such as Emi do fall into some clich\u00e9d archetypes, like the tsundere. But again, they\u2019re entertaining and lively enough not to be annoying or too generic. Although one glaring problem with some of the characters is the discrepancy between how they act in the human world and how they acted in their original worlds. Satan in particular was a ruthless conqueror, but who\u2019d have guessed that based on his sweet, laid back, and caring demeanor through the duration of the show? It is never really explained why these characters had such a change of heart either. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is character driven, mostly revolving around the daily exploits of the main characters. In a way, this is simply a slice of life comedy with a fantasy twist. The show thrives on the jokes revolving around the na\u00efve otherworldly characters. It\u2019s nothing \u201claugh out loud until there are tears in your eyes\u201d funny. But the anime is entertaining enough with what it presented, taking care not to rinse and repeat too many gags too often.  \\n\\n\r\nA little pet peeve of mine is when comedy anime takes a turn for the dramatic and tries to have this thing called a \u201cplot.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t work out most of the time. It\u2019s too abrupt a shift from comedy to angsty drama. It usually ends up spiraling downward into painful, forced melodrama. Maou didn\u2019t do this\u2026for the most part. There were times where it seemed like it was going to go that route. One part in particular that stands out was when giving Emi her backstory. Yes, it was meant to tell us why she pursues Maou so relentlessly. But in a way, this disturbing reveal about what Maou did to make her hate him so much actually ends up making their antagonistic relationship a lot less hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are good, sporting quite a few great actions scenes. The character designs are a bit plain, though that was probably to contrast the flashy designs of the characters in their previous life. The opening theme is an upbeat poppy number while the ending theme is more relaxed and mellow. The insert songs weren\u2019t really noticeable or special in any way. \\n\\n\r\nIt is by no means flawless, but Hataraku Maou sama is still a funny and entertaining little comedy that will keep you entertained for all thirteen episodes. It\u2019s a very light watch that seamlessly blends comedy and action. It\u2019s an interesting little fantasy twist to the slice of life comedy. It is definitely worth a watch.\\n",

However, as I was watching it I realized that instead of providing some fun takes on the usual mundane nature of everyday life, the show itself was just mundane. Despite an interesting premise the show never really ever become enthralling and the main problem is the characters. \r\nThe Devil himself is just boring and not very interesting and as the show goeson you question how he could have been a demon commander. He never does a single bad thing once there on Earth, in fact, he's a stand up citizen. I can't understand why they went this direction because it never feels like your watching the Lord of all Demons, he just seems like a normal middle class worker and that bothered me to no end. The other characters characters don't fair much better with Emi being embodiment of a annoying tsuendere, Chiho obsession with Maou being more odd then endearing and the rest of the cast failed to leave much of an impression. \\n\r\nI'll admit that at times the show was entertaining but it failed to ever be engrossing. I never cared about the characters or their problems and while the premise is interesting the show fails to ver capitalize on it in any interesting way. There is a lot of good anime on Netflix but \"The Devil is a Part-Timer\" is not one of them.",

            "content": "Being a part time McDonald's employee, I realized that Hataraku Maou-sama was a must watch for me after having a friend recommend it. I love it when I can personally relate to an anime, which gives it a more powerful and lasting effect. Although, even if you're not a part time MgRonald's employee, I still think there's something for everyone in Hataraku Maou-sama. \r\n-Story- 7/10 \r\nNothing special here. Obviously all of it is new, being the Devil works at McDonald's and such, however, nothing particularly interested me about the story, either. From a critical standpoint, this still isn't a big deal, because other parts ofthe anime well make up for this. But if you're looking for an anime with a heavy and interesting story, well, this show might not be for you. That's probably the only major complaint, but even so, I wouldn't consider it a complaint since the anime is focused mostly on comedy. \\n\\n\r\n-Art- 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is clean, refreshing, and nice to look at. It's nothing super amazing, but it's definitely above average. No complaints here at all. If you want something easy on the eyes, then this anime is definitely for you. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound- 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to give this a 10/10 for one reason. The English Dub! It's actually done well. This is one of the rare cases where I'd recommend you give the English Dub a shot over Subbed. I don't even care about anything else. The . voice acting here just... is good... I'd recommend you give it a listen! \\n\\n\r\n-Character- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the best aspects of the show - the characters. They're what bring the comedy into the show and make it enjoyable. You'll love the Devil and his general, along with the Hero. You'll love the antagonists, and best of all, everyone is funny in their own way. Obviously, if the Devil integrated himself into human society, how would that not be interesting to watch? \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this short anime all too well. With the brilliant English voice acting,  great and funny characters, along with some character development squeezed in, Hataraku Maou-sama makes for a good anime. You could definitely binge watch it in a day. I'd recommend this anime to anyone. There's comedy, some action - a dash of romance, give it a shot, yo! \\n\\n\r\n-Overall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBesides a dull story that didn't play much of a part in the anime, while still, not being able to get into at all, and some cheesy dialogue at times, Hataraku Maou-sama stands as a great anime. Watch it by yourself, with friends, or even your family! Finally, don't expect anything ground-breaking, but do expect a good laugh or two.",

The comedy from this anime is special - you don't see this kind of comedy from other anime produced nowadays in 2018. It takes a genius to create a comedy such as the one this anime produced if you really come to think about it. It's because you can really feel the humanity between the character's relationships as you laugh to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe producer of this anime was no amateur. From the perspective of the producer, the producer has two options: adapt the light novel straight as it is written or add some of your own condiments. This producer did very well to adapt the light novel as well as he can but also add what can't be felt through a book but through images - anime. It may be the author who created the characters of this anime, but I think the producer also helped in creating the characters because the way he added the comedy in this anime seems to have been just what this anime needed for the characters to shine. If you read the light novel, it is not as comedic as the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe light novel series apparently won silver prize of some sort of reward system in Japan, and I think I might understand why. The humanity within each of the characters can be felt enough to give you a nice smile on your face as you read it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was made with very few shortcuts. By that I mean the art doesn't feel rushed and looks detailed and good enough to still be called as  average in 2018. \\n\r\nAll animes need some good OSTs at the right timing, and smooth lines from the VAs. Because all those passed the average mark for me, I said that the producer didn't seem to be an amateur.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot over the years, and I think I watched it more than five times now. I recommend it to anyone who might be interested in what I mean by \"being able to feel the humanity within the characters\" and the superb comedy and if you laughed to the comedic shorts on Youtube.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give it a 10/10 because I liked it very much, but a more critical and objective opinion might give it an 8 or 9.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime was released in 2013, I wanted to review this anime because I had so much to say about this anime.",

The jokes are great and so is the overall atmosphere of the show, however the show lacks in 1 major way- instead of being a 'pure' comedy show (which would have been perfect) the show tries to tie in a story about the Ente Isla, where the characters all came from. While its necessary to setup things in the first few episodes, the whole story about Ente Isla took away from the comedy and at times made the show boring. Though many people are upset about the lackluster ending, I believe that the showended perfectly, and gives hope about a possible second season in the near future.",

            "content": "One night as I was lying in my hidey hole of a room, I was searching through the Netflix titles to see what I wanted to put on my instant que to watch later. While searching through the anime I ran across Hataraku Maou-sama!, titled in English 'The devil is a part-timer!'. The title instantly caught my attention, and I thought I would give the first episode a try. I ended up loving it.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWe are thrown into the fictional world of Ente Isla, where the humans are at war with the demons. King Satan, the ruler of demons controls the army with plans toconquer the world. The humans fought back, sending in a hero to kill Satan--and it was actually working. The hero cornered Satan in his castle and charged to kill, only to have Satan open up a portal to escape with his right hand man, Alciel.\\n\r\nTheir plan went horribly wrong, however. Somehow Satan and Aciel ended up in Tokyo Japan and stripped of their powers, becoming human! With no way of regaining the magic that they lost they are forced to live as humans, getting jobs and an apartment.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is comedy from start to finish, making me laugh until the very last moment. It relies heavily on character interaction, name calling, and miscommunication. There is some action thrown into the mix, but I think the show was truly made to be a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe show seems episodic, but as more characters and background are introduced we see a plot forming, filled with antagonists that want to destroy Satan's bike and ruin his perfect attendance record at McRonald's (not really, but I don't want to spoil anything). \\n\\n\r\nThere are 13 episodes, but the story really concludes at 12, with the 13th shows what happens the next day, and ends on a comedic note. I know others have been disappointed with the ending, and I would be lying if I said that the ending didn't bother me. However, the last episode sort of suggests that there could be a second season. There hasn't been any talk of a sequel yet, but a girl can hope, right?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are cute, especially the girls. The guys look pretty standard, with nothing standing out too much in their character design beside eye and hair color. But the boys don't really matter, it's all about the ladies. The art style suggests to me that the animators were leaning towards something like moe. But I can't be too sure. The backgrounds are beautiful, especially in Ente Isla; and it compliments the character designs well. The color is bright and cheery, utilizing a wide array of color schemes. Even the darker scenes are rich with color. This sort of color technique has been pretty standard in the industry for a few years, but such vibrance is more common in 'moe', cute anime (which is another reason why I think this is the direction the animators wanted to go with).\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and consistent, but the fight scenes are nothing special. This is okay because the show is more about comedy, rather than action.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm giving sound an 8 purely for the English voice acting. Now I know there will be sub diehards that will snuff me for watching dubs (although I love subs too), but I have watched the show in both English and Japanese. Both are good, but I think that the dub better picks up on the emotion of the characters, and definitely catches the bickering between the characters better. In my opinion it's better than the original Japanese voice actors, and without it I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the show as much.\\n\r\nThe music in the anime was nothing special, and I barely paid attention to it unless they decided to cut the music all together. The opening theme grew on me, and I ended up listening to it for every episode. I really disliked the ending theme however, and never listened to it after the second episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI absolutely love all of the characters. All of them are just very exaggerated and theatrical, which is so counter intuitive in the human world that they seem eccentric to normal humans. It's perfect because they try to blend in with normal humans, but if they get excited it all gets thrown out the window.\\n\r\nBut what I really like is how Satan and Emelia the hero interact. For the longest time, they justify their actions due to their respective roles (Satan = evil, Emelia = hero). But we see that Satan has an easier time throwing away his role and becoming, dare I say, nice. Emelia has a harder time letting go of her role, but she eventually does. It shows that anyone can change, which is a pretty nice message coming from the king of demons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not really a comedy fan, but I truly enjoyed this show. There was enough plot to keep my interest. And while the characters were exaggerated, their human struggles were very real; and as a college student I can sympathize with their poor as dirt life styles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall I give this show two thumbs up! Seriously, give this show a try. You don't even have to watch the dub (although I recommend it if you speak English), just give it a try. It's sort of a hidden gem, filled with comedy gold. Once you finish it, you'll want a second season as well.",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama! is a great 13 episode adaptation of the two light novels it is based off of, with many others yet to be animated. But they need to be animated! This adaptation, though short, managed itself very well and produced great comedy, adventure, character development, etc. \r\nNow here is my review of Hataraku Maou-sama!- A typical comedy, or an ingenious character-driven story. Or perhaps something else? Read to understand what I have understood from this anime.\r\nStory: 8.2\r\nThe story of Hataraku Maou-sama! is relatively simple, centered around the Demon King Satan, who upon his defeat to the Hero Emilia Justina, is forced to flee tomodern day Tokyo. With a quick introduction set right after his defeat, one has to wonder how and where this anime gets its name. This is all explained when the story is revealed to have Satan, now a human known as Maou Sadao, working at a MgRonalds. But where could a story, now centered around a fast-food chain take us? Well, almost everywhere but it. Without revealing the story, most of the episodes are self-contained, and as a result characters are introduced very quickly and become part of the adventures and misadventures of Sadaou and Ashiya, his loyal general. Enilia, now Emi Yusa, also becomes part of the story, as she observes and investigates Sadao at every chance, no matter who he is with and where he goes, whether it be a fight or his house. Though there are a few episodes centered around the fast-food chain, as well as an overall motivation for Madao to seize power through use of the food chain, the anime doesn't cover  anything too serious in its adaptation, seeing as it is only based on two of the novels, and leaves the door open for a second season. With an okay ending to a great adaptation, the story receives an 8.2 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.7\\n\r\nThe art in this show is amazing! The color seems to match well with the very diverse surroundings, such as the simple and small apartment of Madao and Ashiya, the call center where Emi Yusa works, the MgRonalds where Madao works, and the overall surrounding of Tokyo. The character interactions are very well done, especially in instances of comedy, as the character expressions are supreme in quality. The action scenes do not disappoint, blending the color, magic and semi-human fighting scenes to a great level. To be frank, the final fight was very well done, but as the final episode of the show, it seemed to lack the detail and refinement in animation of the first major fight, mostly due to the night setting, but was great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.8\\n\r\nThe sound in Hataraku Maou-sama! is just a tad bit better than its art. The OP and ED songs are all very nice, but the actual show and characters are wonderful. With a variety of characters from Ente Isla, the world from which the main characters escaped from, as well as several from Earth, the voice actors are considerably well chosen, and definitely nail their characters, especially during their over-reactions. Sound during the more intense scenes are very well done as well, as the fights are both meaningful and fulfilling when couple with the good audio. White Fox did a really good job in 2013 with this adaptation in terms of art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10.0\\n\r\nYES! The best part of this show! Hataraku Maou-sama! has some of the best comedy in all of anime, let alone anime of 2013, and there can't be amazing comedy with hilarious characters. For Maou, his humor comes from his more relaxed way of experiencing life on Earth, as well as his fiery determination to rule Japan through MgRonalds. Some of his funniest scenes come from his sudden character change from demon to human, as he proudly displays his earned money and promotion to Ashiya. Ashiya probably has to have the best humor out of the whole group. His interactions when he first arrives with Maou are ingenious, and his later interactions with Maou and their combined living conditions is hilarious. Once Chiho, Emi Yusa, Rika, Kamazuki and especially Lucifer, who goes by Urushira, all meet and interact with Ashiya, the variety of comedic sequences that come as a result are both outstanding and very well crafted. Emi Yusa herself has her fair share of comedy, with her well known internet meme with her and Chiho, and her interactions with Maou, which find her in a difficult state of disbelief and anger. With great characters for this episodic adaptation, Hataraku Maou-sama! earns a 10.0 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.3\\n\r\nOverall, for me, this series was both surprising and refreshing. After delving in more darker anime such as Psycho Pass, the pure comedy and intense character interactions were both startling and awesome. I was disappointed that this was only 13 episodes in length, but I am pretty pleased Hataraku Maou-sama! is growing ever more popular, as Viz Media just licensed the series and is releasing the first light novel in North America April 21, 2015. Hopefully I can enjoy this series even more if White Fox dcides to adapt teh second season after completing Akame Ga Kill. Till then, I am very happy with my experience with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.1\\n\r\nOverall, Hataraku Maou-sama! hits all of its goals very well. With an interesting story, great character interactions, intense comedy and overall themes of magic, change, and the real world, Hataraku Maou-sama! is a great anime for anyone off any age to watch. Till we get a second season, Hataraku Maou-sama! is a near-perfect comedy anime to watch. Hope you all enjoyed my review!\\n",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama!, or The Devil is a Part Timer!, is an anime that's been on my list for a while, thanks to it's interesting concept, but I'd just never had the drive to start because I was wrapped up with something else. Sitting around bored yesterday, I decided to start it, as I saw it on Netflix, and figured why not. I am so, so glad I decided to take the plunge into the hilarity that is The Devil is a Part-Timer!, because quite simply this anime was amazing. It is easily the funniest anime I have seen, and one of the funniest things thatI've watched in general.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe very first thing I heard about this anime was its absolutely ridiculous concept; the devil and his right hand man appear on Earth after escaping a large battle in their native land, Ente Isla, and have to adapt to life in Japan. They do so by renting a one room apartment, and the devil gets a part time job at the local MgRonalds, while the right hand man, Alziel, plays housewife. This gets crazy as they make human friends and other characters from the mystical land of Ente Isla come to Earth to hunt them down, and everything spirals from here.\\n\\n\r\nThis concept is executed unbelievably well. The story was interesting, and the way different characters played off of one another to advance their development, and the story, was an absolute joy to watch. Humor, drama, and slice of life (to a degree) were all mixed together and pulled off without a hitch. \\n\\n\r\nWell, almost without a hitch. As much as I loved the plot and concepts, I feel as though certain components could have been improved. Yeah, we got some cool backstory about Ente Isla and the characters while they were there, but I wish they had delved a bit more into that. The war-torn land these characters originated from seems like it could have been explained more, and while I enjoyed the flashbacks, I just wish there had been more (either from a longer season, or second season). Yes, I understand that this story is primarily about these characters adapting to Earth, but that leads into my second problem; I feel as though certain actions and relationships shown on Earth were slightly abrupt and would have gone over better had we been given a more in-depth introduction to them ahead of time (or even after, to help clear it up). But, all in all, the flashbacks that are there are great, and the main part of the story, their shenanigans on Earth, are very interesting and I was definitely invested in seeing what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is great. The animation for the characters looks very good, and the battle scenes were always a pleasure to watch. The bright colors of Earth contrasted the darker, muddier palette used for Ente Isla, much like how humans and the hero had a brighter feel to them while the demons (well, at least when they looked demonic) were dark. When the art shifts were used, they were definitely appropriate and well placed, as they definitely conveyed the feelings and tone for the different characters and locations quite well, and each character was undoubtably designed just how I would have imagined them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nFirst things first, the OP is awesome. Really, really awesome. The song is great, catchy, and memorable, and the accompanying art is also great. The OST isn't something I honestly picked up on much at first, but as I got more invested I definitely noticed it and find it to be very well done. Both the battle scenes and casual hang out/humor filled scenes had great music going along with them. Finally, the voice acting was also top notch (both the sub and dub). Personally, I would recommend watching this in your native language if possible, as I feel that for a comedy, you should hear the jokes and inflections on the character's lines fluently rather than reading at a different speed than the lines are delivered; what's the fun reading a joke before they finish saying it? In addition, some of the subs for jokes aren't quite as funny, because the jokes will be adjusted in the dub to flow better than a sub would allow. If you really desire to go subbed, then by all means go for it as the sub and original Japanese VAs are great, though I would really suggest at least giving the dub a shot. I think the english dub was really good, and every VA actually put their all into it which resulted in some great punchlines and deliveries. \\n\\n\r\nMy one negative for sound is that I was not a big fan of the ED. I really liked the art, but something about the song seemed off to me. Don't get me wrong, I think it fit with the tone of the show and the accompanying art, but I just wasn't much of a fan.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is another part where The Devil is a Part-Timer! really shines. I LOVED the cast of characters. The protagonists were perfect; as previously stated, the art/animation and VAs for each character were exactly what I would have wanted, and the characters themselves were all relatable, hilarious, and experienced genuine growth. The villains were also great, and I loved the way a certain one changed after his big battle. There was one character I didn't particularly like for a couple episodes, but even that was resolved by the end. Ashiya was my favorite, but really I could see there being endless arguments about which character is best because they're just all so lovable and entertaining. This is a cast I wholeheartedly want to see more of, and I'll certainly remember their crazy shenanigans for quite some time. I really can't put into words how much I genuinely enjoyed this cast.\\n\\n\r\nMy one criticism of the characters is that there are two who are introduced, would seem to be important, and then basically entirely disappear for the remainder of the season. There is not mention or explanation of them, which was a little disappointing. They're even in the OP with the other main characters, and I feel like they don't have a place there because they're so uninvolved and not really important to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDespite some previously mentioned issues, like an underdeveloped backstory and two characters seeming out of place, I thoroughly enjoyed The Devil is a Part-Timer!. The humor was consistently funny and had me bursting out laughing multiple times, the cast is amazing, the art/animation and sound are both great, and the concept and resulting situations the characters get into are a riot. I would wholeheartedly recommend this not only to people who like anime, but also people who like comedy. I will without a doubt be purchasing the bluray collection and hope to see a season 2 sometime soon, as I want to go back into this world. Anyone looking for a truly great anime should be quite pleased with The Devil is a Part-Timer!.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTo the helpful and not helpful voters, feedback is appreciated!",

Start comedy of the Spring 2013 season.\r\nThis shows main draw is the characters. Just about all of them are exceptionally entertaining, even the ones that tend me be kind of annoying have some truly hilarious moments, especially when you add in their facial expressions.\r\nMany watchers will be pleased by the fact that they show never really goes into full out harem. Although each girl has some level of feelings for the MC, they vary basedon their background with him.\\n\\n\r\nI mean obviously the show is a social dialogue on the state of the economy where the great demon king Satan (Sadao) has to work at a McRonalds in order to scrap together rent. Well, maybe that's stretching it a bit. But part of what makes the show great is the setting that it's put in.\\n\\n\r\nThe early episodes are clearly better than the ones in the middle. This is kind of problematic because there is a slight decline in quality throughout the series until you get to the ending (which are really good episodes). The comedy is still there and it's still very entertaining, but the funniest character is essentially sidelined. This is not to say the episodes are not bad, they are actually pretty good, but it's like the difference from an A to a B.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is well done and on closer examination looks kind of like a more polished Katanagatari based on how the colors are done and such.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a unique comedy with entertaining characters look no further than this show. It's one of the best that Spring 2013 had to offer.",

When I saw this on there I knew I was going to watch it eventually and when I did I ended up watching it all the way in one day and in eng dub. Thank god for it being good.\r\nWell the story is Sadao, basically Satan, with his 2nd in command, Ashiya,  go to Earth Tokyo, of course, after beating narrowly beaten in their homeworld by the hero and the forces of good, then tries to gain power there, though he is working as a part timer ata parodied McDonalds and trying to rise in the ranks there till eventual takeover of the world... omg I just realized how Invader Zim that sounds. Anyways, they are not alone as other members of their world comes to Earth as well including the hero, Emilia, who tries to figure out the reason as to why Sadao doesn't just evil it up in this world like he did before.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the characters are pretty stellar to me, nothing about them really got on my nerves and even the background no name characters were honestly good to look at. A few of my favs are Ashiya, James er I mean Sarue, and Suzuno. As for how the characters are, just get in there, watch the anime, see if your personality allows you to like them like mine does.\\n\\n\r\nSound and enjoyment are pretty top since I never skipped either op or ed and the ost is something I need to hear more of on youtube.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, that seal punch Sadao did on Lucifer was just amazing in execution.",

            "content": "When I read the synopsis for Maou-sama, I sincerely hoped I was in for something special.\r\nIn some spectacularly fun ways, I was.\r\nAbove all else, Maou-sama is a sitcom, driven by bizarre satire and wacky situations made crazier by the clash of incompatible and fairly inflexible personalities. Right from the get go, I was entertained immensely, and you will be as well, though the more familiar you are with classic RPG tropes, the funnier. Given my longstanding love for the genre, seeing the old fantasy traditions turned upside down as \"protagonist hero\" and \"antagonist overlord\" alongside their companions are flung into sanitized modern Japanese society asfish out of water was a breath of fresh air. A superb first episode is dramatic, silly, and instantly engaging. The titular demon lord, Maou, in particular, is a beaming whiplash of a character, who never ceases to bring a smile to everyone's face (besides him or in the audience). Most of the primary characters are lovable goofs in one way or another, and it's hard not to laugh as they stumble all over themselves across disaster and daily routine. There's a backstory that crucial as well, and it kept me pondering when there weren't jokes tickling me.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this anime--however loaded with potential--never quite steps up to its promise. Provided, there are laughs aplenty throughout, and the silly characters never stop being silly, but they fail to rise above a superficial interpretation of the tropes they set out to subvert, and development grinds to a halt. The first five episodes make bounding leaps of narrative progress, establishing the setting and maximizing its usage, introducing and exploring likable characters, punching my funny bone with fresh humor, defeating expectations, stirring up tension and resolving conflict... and ultimately coming to a conclusion for the narrative arc. So then I thought, Wow, so much in 5 episodes! If it keeps pace this will be one hell of a packed 13 episode series! Can't wait to see what's next!\\n\\n\r\nAs it turns out, not much, actually. \\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 5, nothing noteworthy happens in terms of story development, character relationships, conflicts or humor as devious as before. Being a 2-volume adaptation of an ongoing light novel series that is 11 volumes and counting, I understand the limitations yet can't help but sense that the anime had simultaneously been held back by its source material. Had the back 8 episodes moved as nimbly on all fronts as the first 5, the story could easily have concluded in self-containment. It would have been one of the greats of recent times. Instead, we get more of the same humor as before (which is still funny but increasingly repetitive), less screentime and interaction devoted to the most compelling relationship of all--the one between demon lord and heroine (giving way to lesser characters), and dead-end situations that are hit or miss in terms of hilarity. \\n\\n\r\nAt points the show sinks to generic situations where I question whether or not I am watching YET ANOTHER tight-friends-group-slice-of-life-with-integrated-harem-plus-beach-episode-show. Primary characters will fire constant pot-shots at each other's tropes, and though novel at first, there is a strange disconnect between their awareness of their supposed roles and their actions. As much as the cast likes to reference their old traditions, they are surprisingly quick to adapt to the new surroundings and customs, making them too comfortable too soon, and thus less interesting. The two sides are quick to adapt to each other as well, fitting into new anime tropes, making me wonder if they view their previously life-defining alignments as no more than say, a grade-school feud.  Perhaps they band together because they are all strangers in a strange land, but even within their own world they surely must come from vastly different backgrounds... yet so little culture shock and discovery of differing habits between them is happening. Are you telling me when the forces of darkness and the crusaders of the church sit together to eat, they interact exactly like high school students who grew up together? How... disappointing (incidentally, this exchange is something Gargantia did exceptionally well and should be followed). If I wanted to see that I could have watched many other anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nWhat irks me as well is how little the demon lord and heroine interact over the course of the show, with Emilia (the heroine) eventually getting as much screen time as any other support character, or all of them just meshing into group activity. I understand that this is the Maou demon lord show --and boy does he put one up-- but the priorities shifted in the wrong direction. What is more potentially tantalizing than more interaction between role models of good and evil in the ol' fantasy sense flipped on their morally grey head with a hint of sexual tension thrown in? As much as the other characters can entertain (especially the two generals of Maou), they are stock anime characters who do not necessarily struggle or embody the epicenter of the ancient world turned upside down, and do not have backstories I am nearly as curious about. The writers seem to know this --that the plot and development between leads has been throttled by the novels-- and so the story ends in a teasing way that evokes how it began, while hinting at things to come. \\n\\n\r\nIf I seem overly negative towards this show, that's only because I had such high hopes, and for the first five episodes, those hopes were fulfilled and lead me to thirst for more. The premise is just so ripe, the characters so endearing, and so much fun was delivered, even now I wish to find out what happened and read all 11 of the untranslated novels. If you keep your expectations in check, you will find much to love here. Amusing at its worst, and brilliant at its best, Hataraku Maou-sama is definitely worth a watch.",

I often looked back and laughed at how poor of a situation he's in, for an Overlord.\r\nThe art was good. Nothing to spectacular, but definitey not poor either.\r\nI particularly liked the opening theme. Background music sounds good and fits well.\r\nAh, the characters. They're all enjoyable. One thing I don't quite understand though is how the Demons don't retain some of their Demonic ways. However, I thought this could be due to the influence of living a human life instead ofa Demon. Which makes sense to me, but I wish it would've cleared up more in the anime on their adaption to the Human world on earth.\\n\\n\r\nVERY few series keep me interested throughout the whole season, and this definitely did that, while other series kinda feel like a drag when it comes to half of the season. There wasn't a moment where I was bored of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it's the enjoyment of the show that counts at the overall score. I almost gave it a nine, but seeing how much I enjoyed it, I had to give it a ten. I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for a solid good comedy anime. Watch it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So, this is my first review in this site, i do however have some experience in the reviewing area, mostly in other subjects like movies,  games and sports, but i thought i would give a shot with one of my other passions, animes.\r\n I decided to go with hataraku maou sama (hms for short) because it was the last anime i finished watching, so lets get started shall we ?\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe plot in hataraku, although may seem as a cliche, regular story at first glance, (specially if this first glance is just reading the anime summary) its actually pretty original. Sure it has thecharacters we are used to see, the demons versus angels/mankind thing, and love couples we can see from a mile away, but thats not where hataraku brilliance lies, what hms does, and very well, is take all these cliches scenarios and add to them a completely crazy unexpected twist, making the viewer laugh his ass off in the process, for example, how could someone ever picture a Maou working at mcdonalds ? i mean its just outrageous to think of it, and thats exactly what makes it so funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in hataraku is pretty good, good character design and all... of course is no masterpiece but it does its job good enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in hms is ok... nothing flashy, no memorable soundtrack or anything like that, but its good enough. The opening song is cool, i will not download it to my iphone but i still could sit throug it without complains, the same goes for the ending, which is actually really sweet by the way, specially combined with that nice set of Chiho images.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is where hatraku really shines in my opinion, again we do have some cliche characters, like Chiho, but despite their being a bit annoying at some points its nothig unbearable. Luckily these dull characters are more than compensated by some terrific characters like Lucifer (be honest, do you really thought that when he showed up for the first time, looking all bad ass and evil he would turn out the way he did ?), Maou itself, who is a good lead character for a change, and of course my favorite one, the brilliant Ashiya, by far for me the best character from last season, everytime this guy stepped on the scene i couldnt stop laughing, congrats for the outstanding voice acting by Yuuki Ono.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama ! was a delightful anime to watch, i got sad when it got over, and i really hope to see a continuation soon, the comedy was top quality, and the plot got interesting near the end, i'm sure it can develop even more if given the chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best animes in the last season, got me tottaly by surprised, and hooked me up from the first episode to the last, I definetly recomend it if you are looking for a light hearted comedy, with some pinches of action.\\n",

XD Yeah it is like so familiar to a hentai I just read called Power Play by the godly Yamatogawa about a demon lord who was forced to retreat with his faithful sidekick.  Into what is known as the human world. In there, he cannot use his powers so he had to adjust with his new life. But they were not the only ones who went there. As the person who almost defeated him followed him there. Yeah a funny start. Imagine SATANworking as an employee McDonalds LOL! The only thing you hate about this is the awaiting of the next season. Because this is a light novel and it is relatively short.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: White Fox who brought you Steins;Gate and the widely awaited Akame ga Kill. Expect clean and consistent animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7 : Nothing special but it gets the job done during dramatic scenes\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: I was really amazed on Maou as he progressd in the story. He was known as the demon lord in his world but he became Maou Sadao and became a normal person with a normal job. His ways have changed or maybe not as he was just forced to change. He is so badass even when he is in his human form. His sidekick's loyalty to him should also be highlighted as his reactions are so funny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: It was shortlived because it was only 13 episodes. I really enjoyed it and deviated it from the hentai manga Power Play. I really had no problems regarding with its enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: I know some people dont like it because it is so generic but it does entertain you but remember that you dont have to get too attached to it because you will hope for a second season just like me XDD",

This does not contain any type of story but it'll give you the answer to the question of WHY?\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n There are 3 rules of reviewing-\r\nFirst rule- No anime is shit\r\nSecond rule-No anime is shit\r\nThird rule-No anime is shit\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIt is based on the following parameters--\r\n1)What is good about it?\r\n2)(Probability of)Whom'll the anime appeal to?\r\n3)Questions that other reviews raised in your head.\r\nP.S.-If you don't want to read the whole, read the summary at the end of every question.\r\n======================================\r\n1)What is good about it?\r\n  As a regular watcher of anime, Ican vouch of the good premise it offers. The setting set is intriguing and hilarious itself. \\n\\n\r\n  It is stupid. Yes, the fact that it is stupid makes it better. There are a lot of things wrong in it if you measure it with your logic meter but if you just watch it for fun it may also become one of your favorites.\\n\\n\r\n  The comedy. As given its genre, the show's main feature is comedy which is similar to almost all others in the same genre.\\n\\n\r\n  It is not serious. Now this is questionable that this is a good point but still I'll put it here anyway. People are more interested in gore and action packed stuff, now this here is a light show with some action and more reasoning.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n Summary: Mild but good action with regular but well timed comedy with a carefree interesting premise.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n2)Whom'll the anime appeal to?\\n\r\n  There are many type of anime watchers--casual ones, picky ones, serious ones, fanboys/girls and other brats. Here the question is to who'll the anime appeal? \\n\\n\r\n  If you know what type of watcher you're let me make it easier for you. It is not the most logical or realistic anime(like most ones), so if you tend to find (too much) reason in the things you watch you might wanna skip it. But if you want to pass your time carefree you jump right into it.     \\n\\n\r\n  Appealing is a spontaneous thing and there is not any particular said reason behind it. So there is not any surety, but we can still consider the possibility of it. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n Summary: If you find concept of appealing weird or wrong you should go ahead (Probability=1) but if not try and decide for yourself.(0<Probability<=1)\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n3)Questions that other reviews raised in your head.\\n\r\n  *Overrated--Yes it is. But it doesn't matter it is still a fun show.\\n\r\n  *Stupid--I too said it is stupid but that is what it makes it what it is.\\n\r\n  *Fanbase and anti fanbase --No need to say anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n Overall Summary-\\n\r\nStory-9/10\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\n==========\\n\r\n||Overall-9/10||    \\n\r\n==========\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAny questions and criticisms are welcomed.",

            "content": "I'm going to start by saying that, while HMS is not the most amazing anime you will ever watch, it very quickly became one of my favorites for one simple reason: it made me laugh. It's not uncommon for some anime series to make me snort or giggle occasionally, but this one had me laughing out loud the entire time I watched it, sometimes even to the point that my stomach hurt.\r\nI think the biggest critique on the series is the seemingly unfinished storyline, which is a perfectly fair complaint. There's a lot of backstory that goes unexplained, a lot of holes in the plot,and the characters seem to be missing important traits that their history indicates they should have (e.g. the Devil conqueror isn't all that evil, and the hero who supposedly hates him doesn't regard him with much of a grudge). I would have loved to see it explore the darker parts of the story and go truly in-depth with the characters and their histories, but that would have taken away from the lighteartedness of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other aspects of it are fairly... Average. The art style is attractive but not amazing, and the sound isn't really memorable. The characters are even quite cliched, but they're funny and lovable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this for being an awe-inspiring masterpiece, but I *would* recommend it because it was nothing but fun and hilarity, and it made me laugh more than any other anime or TV show I've watched. I fell in love with it five minutes into the first episode, and I absolutely adored every moment of it after.",

The sidekick Alciel kinda reminds us of Hayato Gokudera from Katekyo hitman reborn (KHR). Overall a good comedy anime, brings a lot of laughs. What I thought is amusing is that one of the demon general that shows up later (Lucifer) went from \"I WANT TO CONQUER EARTH\" to settling in the apartment with Satan and Alciel after being defeated. If you're looking for a comedy and short anime, this is the one towatch.",

            "content": "Ay, yay, yay, As I've finished watching this anime's last episode, I can't help but wonder if  studio white fox should be making a 2nd season of this anime, since there are indications that there will be. Now, what do I think about this anime in general, humm, I think I'll state each of this anime's categories:\r\nStory- fair 6.\r\nThe plot was pretty simple to say the least, about a demon lord who went into escape to the human world and live life as a commoner, the climax here is about those people from Ente Isla who seems to make his new life hellish, until2 of them saw how much of a change being he is. So for the most part this anime genre fantasy, comedy and action did fanned out for this anime's plot, but not so much for the romance part, since the plot put more emphasis on an Emi X Maou arc that with a Chiho X Maou as if the Chiho is being betrayed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nSince the art form was pretty much the usual as for my POV, though, I glad that the fan service was minimal.\\n\\n\r\nSound- decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nDecent enough for me, 'bout the opening and ending songs, I jaz don't have anything to say 'bout it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's did play well as to this anime's genre, though I may have given this anime's category a good remark, it was basically wasn't good enough because of the reverses of the character's roles, i.e we have Moau who was suppose to be the antagonist plays the protagonist and Emi who is suppose to kill Maou, ended up siding with him or at least that's what it looks like, of course there are the other strange bedfellows that follows like Ashiya, Hanzo, Suzuno and Chiho who somehow makes for Maou's posses of sorts, I guess you might say that the 3 guys are the comedy aspect of this animem the girls are the action and Chiho is the romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nGood enough to be enjoyed even if the comedy part will only make one gigil and not Lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI only hope that if studio \"White Fox\" plans to push through with a season 2, it would be better than this first season, overall I really like that this anime shows what may only look like a metaphor that the church can be as evil as the devil and the devil can change and be as kind as a lamb.\\n\\n\r\nAdios. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A disappointment. The premise sounds good, and like it could lend itself to a Swiftian satire of modern society, provide interesting contrasts between the poverty and inequity of the stock fantasy medieval setting and the world now, do fish-out-of-water and lowered-status gags, but instead, it's an inept package. The worldbuilding is nonexistent; the lead character *completely* implausible (there's *not even* a scene where he decides to become a hardworking peasant, much less a scrap of justification for abandoning world conquest for the joys of McDonald's) and adapts instantly & unamusingly to his new world ('gift of tongues', please), and the tsundere Hero is little better(he killed your family for no good reason, handing you an umbrella is not a reason to fall for him!); it indulges in the excuse of 'oops used up all my power repairing stuff' what, 3 or 4 times? which is 2 or 3 times more than it should've; the 'dialogue' is moronic (so, the final member of the harem is reproached for being an assassin for whom the end justifies the means just like for the demon? yes, yes, how very accurate - wait a second, when the deuce were we told the demons *had* any ends beyond bestial lust/greed/ambition?); and finally and worse of all: the comedy is bad. How many times is it funny to have Ashiya puke or talk about coupons, or have Lucifer order something online? Apparently 3 episodes' worth - except the series has 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you just want the fantasy highschool romcom, stick to _Shakugan no Shana_. For fish-out-of-water, _Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid_ comes to mind as much funnier. For action... well, pretty much any series will do better. For world conquest by a misunderstood villain, _Maoyuu Maou Yuusha_sounds like it's at least thought-out. For economics, _Spice and Wolf_. For business lessons, _Moshidora_. _Hataraku Maou-sama!_ does nothing well.",

It definitely made my day better than i expected!.\r\nAnd don't forget how funny this anime is, i still remember some scenes that made me laughhard. Heck the first episode has a really funny scene when they landed at the human world and he tried to do magic with his hand then a wild Taxi stopped as if they called for him (that was really something i laughed at), if i mention every little funny thing happened i would probably finish this review as a novel. \\n\\n\r\nThey did an amazing job making the story in the best possible way you could ask for.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the devil (Satan) escaped from Ente Isla, and fell into the human world where he can't use his full power then he just has to do what a normal human do, like get a job and stuff. Then hero Emilia followed him to the human world to deal with Satan. After that the story gets driven here in there, mostly funny as hell(sometimes epic).\\n\\n\r\nDon't forget the amazing characters in this anime, just wow. They definitely made an amazing and loving characters, there is no way someone would hate a character in this anime (unless you want heaven, then you'd hate Sadao).\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation, it's nothing special to be honest, if it was really that overwhelming then i would say it deserves more than 8.\\n\r\n8 means really good, but it's not perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI would love to write more about this anime but i think i reached my peak, sadly.\\n\r\ni just wanna clear that this anime is something i liked so much and deserves 9 in every aspect.

In essence, it accomplishes perfectly what many anime fail at (at least to some degree).  It does its job as entertainment.  It is engrossing.  It is fun.  \r\nIt does work in a little romance, and a little humor, but it doesn't sit heavily over one genre line.  It is also refreshingly free of the ecchi content that so frequently sours other shows.\r\nI'm not saying that \"it's fun... caveat, caveat, caveat\",like you might expect.  It is pure fun.  Where most shows fail, this one balances all its elements perfectly, with an elegance to this purity of fun that can have me saying only one thing:  Give me more!",

I loved the characters and how they interacted with each other. For me,there was never a dull moment. \\n\r\nThis isn't an anime that you need to turn your brain off to enjoy, like some other anime (cough cough Mirai Nikki cough cough). That being said, you do need to subdue the part of you that overanalyzes plot and characters and things like that.

So i asked my followers on a Facebook page i admin for, they all said.  \r\n\"Watch this. It's really good.\" \r\nwith that in mind i had to emphasize my guidelines for anime that i will watch.  I don't believe that i have high standards for anime to watch.  I want a show that has a good story and does a really swell job of influencing me to actually care for these characters.    \r\nWhen i started, i was unsureof what i was watching because of the introduction; viewers are thrown into the middle of a war going on between king Satan and his rival 'the hero'  \\n\\n\r\nNow when i was watching i had been absorbed into the comedic aspect of the dialogue between Satan and Hero emilia.  Almost completely forgetting the holy war that was going on.  I was disappointed to finish the show and NOT see a second season.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end,  i would recommend this show to anyone looking for a Light hearted and funny show to watch.    \\n\\n\r\nI would re watch at a later time.",

            "content": "Maou Sadao is a model employee at McRonalds. He is diligent, capable and SUPER keen and he is also the Lord of all things evil who gains power from suffering, Satan himself. It's a pretty fun premise and the anime plays out with a fun comedic vibe. Sadao finds himself living in modern Japan with his right hand man from another dimension, the slightly melodramatic Ashiya Shirou, who falls naturally into the role of frugal housewife and much hilarity ensues. Its a little bit of a shame that the women in the story aren't as interesting. There is the legendary hero living under the aliasYusa Emi who despite being some legendary hero of justice or something is just your typical needlessly confrontational tsundere who spends more time being embarrassed that everyone seems to think she is dating Sadao then she does doing anything particularly hero-like. No spoilers but her personality makes even less sense once her backstory gets developed. Then you have your typical cute junior at work complete with pigtails and G-cups who just desperately wants to make Sadao food all the time, Sasaki Chiho. She does archery too but only in the credits, it's never mentioned in the show which is kind of weird. They kind of complement the antics of the guys nicely but Emi (like most tsunderes) is quite annoying and I get the feeling Chiho is just there so they can make flat chest jokes about Emi. No, I am being unfair to Chiho, she is ok but just a teensy bit boring especially compared to the guys, her thing is pretty much being girly and in love with Maou. There are some other fun characters but I wont spoil them.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who are curious the art is quality. The first episode features some fight scene eye candy that made me wish it was actually an action anime. But even though it isn't so the rest of the show has a modern nice feel to it. It isn't particularly unique if that is what you are into but other than that it is pretty good. The character designs are fairly standard, as I mentioned before the women in general aren't particularly original; long red hair on the tsundere, orangy/brown pigtails on the cute junior and long dark hair on the emotionless girl in the traditional kimono. It's been done before but it looks quality so its ok. To be fair Maou's design also looks pretty standard for a comedy with harem tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nI always put in a note about fan service because I personally don't really like it. This series starts out with not that much except an ending credit animation that is basically all fan service, but toward the end it gets a bit more. Mostly its in the form of the occasional boob joke, it didn't really bother me and if you aren't looking for it you wont really notice it. If you are looking for it you will get a few chances to see the girls in their underwear, even Maou gets some underwear scenes in this show. Anyways this show has something of a harem happening so naturally a few scenes where the girls forget to wear pants walking around the house is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all its a pretty fun watch. It kind of fizzles something serious in the very last episode but the rest of it is entertaining and kept me watching all the way through. Its a fun way to spend some time, it won't rock your world or anything like that but it was fairly funny.",

I first watched this show when I was just starting to get into anime so I still didn't have high expectations for this medium and then The Devil is a Part Timer was recommended to me. I watched the first episode and that was the first time an anime made me laughed, the first time I grew attached to the characters and wide eyed from the action, I loved every minute of my experience and was devastatedwhen it was over.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY-7\\n\r\nWhile watching this anime I was engaged in the story and eager to see the next revelation, but as I think back at it I can't really remember what the plot was really about. To be honest I don't think the story is really an important part of this series, it leads the characters into their new setting and allows them to adjust in the ways they see fit. The Devil is a Part Timer had a story that most will enjoy but it is nothing ground breaking, where this show really stands out is with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS-10\\n\r\nI love these characters because this show instead of painting these characters into their usual tropes it portrays them as normal everyday people with there own problems and responsibility (which is the cause of most of the humor), many of which we can all identify with. The devil is not the evil, menacing entity we would assume him to be, he's a man with bills and responsibilities, the hero isn't the big strong man that we should all base our decisions of of, she's a strong woman with her own personal grudges against the devil and who was pushed to take on the role of the hero. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-10\\n\r\nThis is simply one of the most enjoyable shows you will ever watch, you will laugh at the humor, get pumped from the action and love the character interactions this is a very fun show.\\n\\n",

Now have you ever considered how the demon lord feels after being vanquished?\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! shows you a glimpse as to how those stories might continue. This anime cuts through the long cliche'd epic and bring you directly to the point where sequels will never be based on.\r\nWhen the demon lord Sadao gets plunged into a world where there is no need for an ultimate evil, he does what every unemployed (and broke) villain might do: get a crappy dayjob and aspire to rebuild his now lost kingdom in the modern day.\\n\\n\r\nSure it has your light hearted comedy, slice of life fervor, and even over the top action scenes every now and then but what I really like about this anime is the chance to see what a villain would do given a chance to start over following their defeat.\\n\\n\r\nNow I must admit this anime has its flaws (especially towards the last episode) but it was enjoyable to see such a story make its way into the scene. All I really hope is that it continues the way it started off and also continue adding dimension to a seemingly 2 dimensional role seen in most anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe rating I gave was really for what it could've or can become given a little more thought and heart. I recommend picking this anime up but I must warn viewers that you may ask for more and probably not get it anytime soon.",

The fusion of fantasy and modern day concepts sets the show up for some pretty funny situations. While I watched it for the laughs, I do have to say the story was satisfying enough but still leaving a possibility for a second season (which would be great).\r\nArt\r\nThe whole show was visually appealing and battle scenes looked cool.\r\nSound\r\nThe sound affects in terms of background noise and battle soundswere good, but lets get to the real meat and potatoes.**Comments on the English dub** The two male leads were great in their roles having adequate emotions when they needed to. My biggest grip with the sound would probably be the female lead, who can be a bit annoying to listen to when she complains, but it was bearable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nIt made be an overused anime trope but I love the good guy (which is ironic) who is a hard worker. I also love the overpowered main character trope which sadly doesn't seem to do as well in Japan all of the time. (In terms of characters starting out overpowered) But Satan is a really like-able guy overall. The Hero starts of annoying, but she's fine overall, they just get her to butt heads with the MC to cause tension obviously. One of my favorite characters has to be King Satan's general Shiro. He is super loyal and often times funny, that pretty much sums him up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI have to say this is personally my favorite comedy anime. The banter between the characters can be hilarious and it's just overall a good time. The story is enjoyable enough, but the laughs combined with King Satan having his occasional kick butt moments are great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis is just a very solid anime. If you want to relax, or want a good anime to binge watch, this is the one for you. I enjoyed my time with it significantly, and I hope you do too.",

A complete virgin with a good heart (maybe).\r\nThis could have been forgiven if his partner who is also a demon suffered this massive change of heart as well but he stays in character for the rest of the show (which is pretty much one of the only charming points of this anime sinceAshiya character is genuinely entertaining).\\n\\n\r\nThe Maou himself is so cliche that it kinda hurts and the whole \"he is the lord of darkness\" seems like a lazy explanation as to why so much bullshit happens around him instead of being actually true (probably there is a good explanation on the novels or manga but there wasnt one in the anime).\\n\r\nAlso to add to the last point. This is so bullshit that the premise of the show could be considered fake.\\n\r\nThe Hero is beyond stupid and annoying to the point i was genuinely happy when she was being tortured or being beaten the shit of.\\n\r\nOh right there are a few action scenes and they were nice i guess.\\n\r\nAside from Ashiya and Chio the rest of the cast is so damn forgettable, cliched, unoriginal or simply a complete waste of screen time (a little bit of drama was tried to be presented with the Inquisitor but the carefree nature of the show didnt allowed her story to be presented properly).\\n\r\nAside from a few lines the comedy is nothing innovative. I was pretty much able to predict in which way the shots were being made so nothing was too much of a surprise.\\n\r\nI mentioned early that the show is carefree so no drama can be properly presented but this works on the opposite way (i know it makes no sense but what the hell), the show is so serious that the comedy is too limited and the jokes are really weak.\\n\r\nAlso something really serious happens on ep 9 or so but the Maou or any other of the characters that were present at that time says anything about it so you just end up wondering if that was just a crazy allucination that you had, to cope with the massive ammount of \"meh\" that this show is.\\n\r\nThe only reason i didnt dropped this by the 6\u00ba episode was because i wanted to see more of Chio.\\n\r\nI tried really hard to enjoy this show and i'm actually going to read the manga because i know i predicted everything right (and also im a complete masochist). I know exactly what the Maou, the hero and where the plot is going to go, but i wanna be wrong.\\n\\n\r\ntl dr: The story is so cliched and unoriginal that you could fall asleep, 90% of the characters are annoying or boring, the sound and art are nothing spectacular.\\n",

It\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re translating it across cultures. Humor is weighed down by where you\u2019re from. To really appreciate a joke you need to have grown up with TV, pop culture, and socialize with the people around you. A joke referencing the stagnant Japanese economy just isn\u2019t the same. That\u2019s a why a punch in the groan is funny here and funny in China. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s visual, and everyone can relate. Who hasn\u2019t had their genitals harmed?\r\nThe fundamental, molecular parts of a joke are the setup and punchline.You create expectations, and you surprise your audience. The Devil Is A Part-Timer doesn\u2019t rely on references or your cultural baggage to be funny. But the show doesn\u2019t try hard to be funny. It\u2019s the natural tone of it. It\u2019s a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nSo you\u2019ve got this Devil king who escapes into the real world. He loses his powers and needs to find a way home. He starts at the bottom of society and gets a part time at a \u201cMcRonald\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s not called \u201cMcDonald\u2019s\u201d, but, let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s fucking McDonald\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nDo you remember that kid in your class\u2014yeah, the fat one?\u2014they were the class clown and everyone thought they were funny? It\u2019s because when you expect someone to be funny they come off that way. Or you really like someone and you\u2019ll just laugh at whatever shitty joke they tell just to get into their pants?\\n\\n\r\nI found the cast of characters to be immensely charming. They had chemistry and plenty of friction to keep things exciting. There\u2019s the loyal sidekick, a girl the main character fights with, another girl he fights with, and someone trying to kill him but ends up being roommates with. Did I mention he becomes a shift leader at his job, too?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to complain about. It ends suddenly because it\u2019s an adaption so enjoy it for what it is. It\u2019s a fish-out-water story.",

Everything about this show is great, it has a very developed and vibrant story, it has stunning and very colorful art work, the music and sound is awesome the characters are fun and likable and this show is very enjoyable.\r\nStory: Defiantly a 10/10. The story progresses very fluently and there aren't many holes or disturbances in the story and plot, for example the development of Maou working at MgRonalds is very fluent and smooth.\r\nArt: 10/10. Since this show was from FUNimation I was expecting top notch art and visuals, and FUNimation didn'tdisappoint. The art was very colorful, vibrant and appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. The sound in this show is very good. The theme song is nice and catchy the in show music is also very nice to listen to. Even the voices on the characters match their personalities and appearances well. Frankly, the English dub had the best voices on the characters especially Chi's voice in the dub. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. I LOVE THE CHARACTERS. Every character is likable and has their own charm. My personal favorite character was probably either Maou or Emi. Most of the humor came from Emi and Maou is really cool and likable (when he isn't the devil king)\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show but there was only one thing wrong with this show, The Ending. I thought the ending just came out of no where and that it just left the viewer dumbstruck. I really encourage FUNimation to continue with this show because this is a great show. Overall this show gets a 10/10 and I would highly recommend this show!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nFor many people, it is always difficult to go to a foreign land. Different languages, money, locales, and people make going to new places both exciting and daunting. Thus the stage is set for the Overlord in The Devil is a Part-Timer.\r\nSTORY\r\nOur story begins in a completely fantastical land known as Ente Isla, where Dark Lord Satan and his demons wage war against Emilia the Hero and the Church. After these two titans of battle clash, Satan flees through the Gate, only to arrive in modern day Japan. Emilia, whose only purpose in fighting is to defeat theOverlord, gives chase.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows afterwards is actually a slice-of-life anime where our two protagonists and their compatriots learn to deal with the troubles of their new world. Namely, being human and having to work to earn money. This all seems rather simple. And to be honest, it is. But it works (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I liked most about the story was how human it all seemed. Emilia herself is human, but watching her and especially Maou (the name he gives himself) having to deal with getting food, worrying about their finances, or helping out a local park were interesting mainly because their actions on Earth were in the completely opposite direction to what they were doing in Ente Isla. And this is true for the rest of the cast, such as Ashiya maintaining his complete devotion to Satan while keeping a strict eye over what was cheap enough to eat.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also incorporates the mythical side of their characters and the lore even though they live in Japan. Many of the arcs that the characters go through are ultimately related to the happenings in the world in which they originally called home. These parts as well were fine.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why I picked this up was for the romance element. I will say that there are splashes of romance here and there (and it is pretty obvious that Emilia is tsundere early on) but I wish there was more romance to be had.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at another thread, I agree that the first episode had very good production quality. This was mainly because it makes the show out to seem as if what is going to be occurring is an action anime. So many of the fight scenes and designs/environments are nicely animated.\\n\\n\r\nFor the remainder of the show, the animation itself is passable, but nothing great or even good. It is average at best. This is mainly because most of what the characters do on-screen throughout the show is more commonplace activities, but there are moments when the animation does increase in quality (again, this is during the action sequences).\\n\\n\r\nI actually liked the character designs. I think what I liked most about them were the use of color. Emilia's hair is a somewhat dark-red (as opposed to someone like Rias Gremory with her bright red hair), Lucifer is a calm purple, etc. This may also sound weird, but what I liked most about the character designs were their eyes. The animators went with more dull looking colors and no extra details. With Maou's orange eyes, Emilias dull green (I really liked her's), and Suzuno's baby blue eyes, they seemed kind of unique to me in a strange way.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily the strongest part of the show. I think the best way to describe them would be \"smart\". That is, there really aren't many misunderstandings that take place and even when they do they are resolved rather quickly. Their \"smart\" behavior also comes from how they talk with one another. I think with the exception of Chiho, all of the main cast are 18 years old or older, meaning everything they say or do is more adult oriented. And this was refreshing when many anime tend to take place within the high school/pre-adulthood setting.\\n\\n\r\nThe two strongest characters are obviously, in this case, the two protagonists, Maou and Emilia.\\n\\n\r\nMaou is probably one of my favorite MCs. He is kind, intelligent, and hard-working. On top of that, he can be a badass when he needs to. And for an MC in a potential harem he isn't even that dense (except for the gag with Chiho). It's sort of difficult to describe really. I think a lot of it has to do with the dichotomy between his human persona (really good guy) versus his devil persona (really bad guy). His evil side is especially cool because when he enters that state he is extremely overpowered, and rightly so (he is the king of the devils after all).\\n\\n\r\nEmilia is also very fun to watch. I enjoy a good tsundere character, and she fits the bill nicely. She reminds me of a more angry and older Asuna of SAO fame. I enjoyed watching her interact with Maou and the other characters. She acts like a big sister to Chiho, she gets easily annoyed with Lucifer, and she has these rather complicated feelings towards Maou. Overall, she was definitely a joy to have on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, I liked them too. Ashiya, Lucifer, Chiho, and Suzuno all have their moments, and their personalities are fun and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe only gripe I have is that besides their base personality traits, there is no actual character growth. I would have liked to see more development within the first season in regards to Maou, Emilia, and the rest, but I guess that will just have to wait for season two.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the show was not that good, but the ED grew on me. It's good but not amazing. The rest of the soundtrack is nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the show was nicely done by each of the cast members. There were no stand out performances, but I thought the actors/actresses did a very nice job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to most shows, I like them a lot. Perhaps it is just me being more open to everything, but I guess that's just the way I am. This is especially true when romance is mixed in, even if it is small. For Hataraku, there isn't technically a small amount of romance but it is also not the main focus. However, I still enjoyed the romance elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also quite funny. This is mainly due to how well the cast interacts with one another. Chiho is also one of the funnier characters in the show due to how she over-reacts to most situations. Maou and Emilia are also great on-screen together, and I was always smiling when they were. On top of that, the writing is also nicely done. Much of the comedy comes from how serious Maou, Ashiya, and Emilia can be about the simple things in their new life, but it is all very nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable parts of the show is when Maou is able to fight properly. When watching it, you can definitely tell how strong and intimidating he becomes. This scene in particular (spoilers, don't watch otherwise) demonstrates well how scary he can be when he goes all out.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, Dark Lord and the Hero deal with everyday life\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, nice character designs with adequate fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, cast works very well together but lacks character development\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good voice acting and a good ED\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, some romance, pretty funny, and good writing\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "(This review is 98% SPOILER FREE. The 2% is negligible. Also,  for a quick summary, refer to the FINAL THOUGHTS section)\r\nA demon lord working at MgRonalds!!\r\nWhat pops up in your mind? (i.e:Apart from Ronald reagan..)\r\nHilarious situational comedy? Eccentric characters?\r\nWell, that is what you expect when starting this show and for the most parts that is what you get.\r\nStory:\r\nThe main core of the story as well as it's direction is quite predictable once you've read the synopsis. \r\n5 minutes into the first episode and you can already see where it is going but that is not a bad thing at all.\r\nAn all-conquering, all-powerful demon lordhas been forced to flee from his world called Ente Isla to modern day Japan along with his demon general. \\n\r\nBut, (and it's a big but necessary 'but') they have lost most of their powers and so are left to fend for themselves which leads us to the main point in the story where the demon lord (now with the adopted name of Maou Sadao) is forced to work at the local outlet of MgRonalds to earn a living for the two of them.\\n\r\nBeing from a foreign world, it is easy to see that they are gonna have problems settling down in this newfound environment. But, slowly but surely they are able to do so. Add in the female  'hero' who defeated the demon lord in Ente Isla + a human girl in love with the now quite humanly demon lord + other characters from the other world and what we get is lots of laughs.\\n\r\nWhat I most liked about this setting was that it didn't involve the word 'school'! That was a bit refreshing to me after watching lots of high-school based SoLs and romcoms. This setting was made for the comedy aspect and does very well for the series. The characters' attempts at making ends meet and adapt produces lots of laughs.\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the plot was that the 'demon-lord' along with his army supposedly committed lots of heinous crimes on their attempt at conquering the world. However, in the modern-day-Japan setting where most of the story takes place, I started to feel that that dark-history was a bit misplaced for this comedic and light show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are not that unique. Or a better statement would be that they are how you'd guess them to be. But that doesn't stop the viewer from loving them.\\n\\n\r\nMaou Sadao: The main protagonist Maou Sadao/Demon Lord is a little bit more eccentric and rash than the average male protagonist. He has a fair amount of leadership qualities, is thankfully not dumb and not (too) dense. But of course, he is kind and such.  His main objective has shifted to 'world domination' by climbing the coorporate ladder at MgRonalds. He starts to become more and more attached to this new-found world of burgers and fries and it slowly becomes clear that he doesn't intend to try to go back to his world any time soon. \\n\r\nHe is especially cool when he gets back his powers and demonic form through people's negative emotions. In that form, his power knows no bounds!!\\n\\n\r\nAshiya Shirou: The devoted and loyal demon general of the demon lord who is now in more of a 'housewife' role. A constant source of LOLs is his attempt at trying to help Maou in any way he can including making sure they don't spend more than they can afford!! An enjoyable character.\\n\\n\r\nYusa Emi: The 'hero' is your typical tsunderish girl. She followed Maou and Ashiya into Japan and is now working at a call centre. She is independent, rather capricious and is not so keen on holding back her fists and sword. She has a tragic past caused mostly due to the demon lord and his minions. So, it is hard for her to accept the fact that Maou is now a harmless (i.e in his long term plans) bum who finds delight in becoming the shift manager at a fast food outlet. Her dilemma at how to come to terms with this sudden transformation in the demon lord is shown in the right amounts: just enough to make us remember/acknowledge the events of Ente Isla but not overly present so as to add too much unnecessary drama.\\n\\n\r\nSasaki Chiho: A high-schooler who has fallen head over heels for the demon lord. Forbidden love?? Don't know. But fortunately for us: unforbidden hilarity. Her attempts at making Maou realize her feelings and her subsequent reactions/expressions when they fail are to die for. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are mostly from Ente Isla. They include Angels, demons and priests along with the humans of course. What is interesting to see is how each of them adopt a different lifestyle and slowly but surely blend into the Japanese community along with the main set of characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was pretty decent. Nothing unusual about it. What did strike the right cord are all the varied facial expressions. I thought they were really well done ( a possible treasure trove for memes and trolls). The fight scenes were also animated well along with the transformations of the characters from their human forms to the supernatural forms. So, basically average in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also average. No annoyingly voiced characters as far as I'm concerned. \\n\r\nThe sound tracks were not worth remembering. \\n\r\nAlthough at first I found the opening 'Zero' to be better, as the series went on I started to prefer the endings by nano.RIPE .\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-The plot is not engaging enough. Although in all sincerity, it is probably not meant to be.\\n\r\n-The dark story from Ente-Isla and the light-hearted comedic one that unfolds in Tokyo seem to belong to different shows altogether.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n++The comedy. The LOLs. \\n\r\n+the out-of-the-norm setting\\n\r\n+Interesting transformations: Demon Lord-> Part-timer , Former angel/demon general -> a NEET!! \\n\r\n+slight romance but no forced dramas.\\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nEntertainment: 8.5\\n\r\nEverything-else: 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.25 = 7\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for those searching for a series with lots of laughs, light hearted theme and no mind-benders.\\n\r\nEnjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSide-note: A second season would be nice. Something with the same amount of comedy, a bit more romance and tying up of the unresolved plot. The LN is ongoing, so hoping for it.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n(Feedbacks and comments (both +ve and -ve) would be highly appreciated.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review may contain spoilers as I am writing whatever comes into mind)\r\nI was really excited for this anime when I saw the preview and I was so happy when the first episode was released. It is a fantasy,comedy and a maybe a little bit of romance anime. \r\nStory : 9/10\r\nThe story shows about a world where humans and demons are at war in a world called Ente Isla. And of course there would be the dark lord and the hero. However the dark lord was defeated by the hero and was forced to retreat to another world which is modern day Tokyo, and itshows how the dark lord which is registered as a citizen of Japan named Maou Sadao and the hero Emi Yusa. The story was definitely very interesting as it shows how the hero and the dark lord both try to survive the financial trouble of their everyday life. Overall its rare to see this kind of story but they managed to pull it off really well.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\r\nArt was amazing in this anime and the colours were very fitting and vivid. The animation was very smooth and fluid especially during the fight scenes. OP and ED animations were good but the ED was just a few pictures but they were really well done. Character are really well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8/10\\n\r\nSound was nothing spectacular for me but your opinion might be different, most memorable song would definitely be the OP song which made me buy the song. ED song was ok but not my favorite. The BGM was well done but it didn't have any memorable tracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10/10\\n\r\nI have to say that the dark lord was the most interesting of them all especially when his personality changes during work and during fight scenes. And I have to say the foreign language that they speak in the world of Ente Isla really surprised me. The hero which is Emi Yusa now works at a customer service centre and it was definitely interesting on how a hero from another world becomes a everyday stalker. Characters like Ashiya and Chiho were great comedy givers and they always give me a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! is definitely a must watch for comedy,fantasy lovers or maybe even romance lovers if they don't mind the action. I enjoyed every single episode for the anime and I even find myself watching the whole series again. This anime definitely needs another season! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First, something I want to get out of the way. Go take a look at the english dub. This is the only anime I would ever recommend the english dub for. Why? \r\nThey say YOLO in it.\r\nMoving on to the actual review, this is my second favorite anime of all times. The setup is fantastic, the characters are all thoroughly likable (even the side characters) and the music and art are both great. The only thing that this anime could have improved on is the weak 2nd half, but character interaction and humor makes it very bearable.\r\nStory: The story has a fantastic first episode, settingit up for various comedic moments throughout the series. The demon overlord and his general are transported to the human world, where they have to fit in. It's funny, but the demon world is a source of some serious story development. The serious overtones aren't out of place, though, and culminates in a fantastic first half. Really, the only weak point is that after the first half, the story drags...hard. The serious storyline involving the demon world doesn't really move forward except for the introduction of a new character. So the reason I'm giving story such a low mark is because of this second half.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is clean. Every character has a distinct design. The animation is very smooth. Really, I'm no good at judging art. It's either \"good\" or \"crap\" to me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice actors in the japanese dub did their job juust fine, but the english voice actors felt like they were really into their role...Is it because they're speaking english? Because it felt like they put way more emotion, tone, and perfect deadpan snark at the perfect time than the japanese voice actors. Perhaps it's because I've become so used to the japanese VAs.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the music's good, but not too memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You can't have a good story without good characters (looking at you, Expelled from Paradise). This anime is completely carried by character interaction, and I'm 100% alright with that. The two demonic main characters adapt to the human world so quickly it's played for laughs. \\n\\n\r\nEverything mundane in our world is treated with utter seriousness. They treat money with such seriousness that they would completely ignore a threatening villain in favor of arguing over allowances. The demon overlord would seriously consider using what's little left of his magic to fix the potato frying machine. \\n\\n\r\nThen the hero enters the picture, and she notices that the two demons are completely innocent and following the human world's laws. This is both a fantastic setup for humorand makes for great character development by both her and the demon overlord. She has to constantly struggle for a reason to continue fighting him when he's doing basically nothing wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThose are just some of the characters. I'm not going to go through what makes each of them so great, I'll leave that up to you guys.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Likable characters allowed me to overlook a mediocre story. That's rare. Kudos, Hataraku.",

            "content": "The world of Entei Isla is under siege. Resting in a dimension that lies parallel to our own, this feudal world of magic and sorcery has been set upon by the generals of Satan himself, a man as thirsty for blood as he is for power. Millions of people have perished, both soldier and civilian alike, and only a union of Heaven and Earth could ever hope to stand a chance against the demonic dictator and his terrifying troops. Thankfully, such a union has occurred. A young hero has risen, born from the carnal embrace of a human man and an angel woman, young Ameliahas been raised with both a human heart and an Angel\u2019s might, and with a rare heavenly sword bestowed upon her, she has grown to lead the forces of good and righteousness against Satan and his scourge! Pushing back against him, challenging his power and stripping away his defenses, this young warrior has pushed Satan and his remaining general Alciel to the point of desperation. With nowhere left to run, no hope of defeating the forces of Heaven, and a radiant hero aiming a sword of light at his throat, Satan has fled the dimension of Entei Isla with Alciel in tow!\\n\\n\r\nPromising to return someday and exact his revenge, Satan and his follower travel through the magical gate and begin their plans to bide their time and gather their strength in the world of... Modern day Japan. A world of strange conventions, strange people, and a language neither one of them can understand. This isn\u2019t quite the situation they\u2019d find themselves in, and to make matters worse, they\u2019ve both taken on the physical appearance of the denizens of this world... A world populated and dominated entirely by humans. They could probably use their natural advantages to gain a foothold in this backwards society, but therein lies another problem... This world has no magic, and while they haven\u2019t come completely impotent, their little remaining power is disappearing at a rapid rate with no known method of replenishing it. With no choice left but to play by the rules of this world in order to merely survive in it, Satan quickly finds himself living in a cheap studio apartment with Alciel, and working part time at a local McDonalds rip-off, where the idea of slowly climbing the corporate ladder has rekindled a fire in him that he\u2019d once lost... Will Satan be able to climb in social status and eventually conquer our world, or will a slowly growing collection of Entei Isla escapees... Including the Hero Amelia herself... Be able to put a stop to him?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read my Steins;Gate review, then you\u2019ve seen me talk about the production company White Fox before, although I\u2019ve still only seen the same three anime from them that I\u2019d seen back then. I said before that the animation in Steins;Gate was minimal, and while the same is mostly true for Devil, I\u2019m going to have to take back what I said about this being a low budget show. The budget is fine. It\u2019s not absurdly high, nor is it restrictive... It\u2019s a fine budget, and it clearly gave the animators some much needed leeway to create a visually pleasing series. Character motions are clean and fluid, and whenever it slows down, the cinematography is on point with just the right angle or visual effect to keep it from bothering the viewer. The movement of background people is limited, but the show rarely holds on them for long enough for their lack of movement to really become a bother. I\u2019ve seen tons of shows where extras and even named characters will freeze onscreen like statues and not blink for extended periods of time, so I\u2019m glad Devil was able to largely avoid this.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox\u2019s keen eye for visual quality pays off whenever there\u2019s an action scene, as the budget is no doubt at it\u2019s loosest whenever characters need to throw down, whether it\u2019s a one-on-one fight out on the street or a massive magical melee involving multiple Ente Isla citizens throwing spells at each other with rare CG effects. There are no broken or dropped frames, as no matter how much motion is required for a fight, the animation quality is smooth and consistent. There are classic tricks such as speed lines during close-ups, but these are done more for style and effect than for budget aid. The action is a lot of fun to watch, but where Devil really shines is in it\u2019s artwork, which is detailed to the point that you\u2019d almost think it was photo-realistic. Whether a scene takes place in a feudal style fantasy setting or a grungy modern day Japanese suburb, it almost feels like you\u2019re there, with every smudge on the wall and leaf on a tree lovingly and intricately represented. Lighting and shadow effects are not only physically consistent, but incredibly pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the kind of themes this show was aiming for, the character designs are extremely well thought out. At first glance, they may look like your standard harem or romantic comedy anime trope characters... You have the spikey black hair crowning the head of the male protagonist, you have the long red and partially braided hair and slender figure(my nice way of saying itty bitty titty committee) of the angry tsundere, the short hair and partial pigtails of the large breasted moe girl, the younger looking girl adorned in traditional attire, the effeminate looking guy, and of course, the long white hair hanging ever so tauntingly off of the eventual villain. I won\u2019t say anything yet about how off these assumptions actually are, but there was clearly a lot of effort that went into making the cast look as generic as possible, with a style just sharp enough to distinguish them from the garbage they\u2019re representing, and a vast collection of highly diverse and expressive countenances that help them to emote far beyond the typical blushing and blank stares of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to keep being nice, but if I\u2019m being honest, the music is a bit on the generic side. The best tracks happen in the first episode before Satan and Alciel leave Ente Isla for the gate, and I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t give some credit to the awesome The Beginning of the Battle, but aside from that, the ost for this series is fairly unremarkable. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s necessarily bad, it actually does it\u2019s job in the backgrounds very nicely, but there were only very rare instances where I was even consciously aware that the series even HAD music. I guess that speaks to the strength of the soundtrack on some level, as it was able to support the story without ever stealing the show, but a lack of standouts is still disappointing. I actually kind of hate the opening, both in terms of visuals and sound, and found myself skipping it more often than not. The song\u2019s not horrible, but it\u2019s a poor fit for the tone of the series, which may have been intentional, considering it\u2019s sarcastic attitude towards the Slice of Life genre. Visually, it takes kind of a \u2018throw everything at the wall and see what sticks\u2019 approach, and the ending\u2019s a lot calmer, but not much better.\\n\\n\r\nThe music may be forgettable, but do you know what isn\u2019t? The English dub, which is without competition the best Jamie Marchi dub I\u2019ve ever heard. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all of her trademarks are here, but they\u2019re used sparingly and with noticeable restraint. I guess having her be script-writer while the incomparable John Burgmeier worked as head writer, the two opposing standards must have canceled each other out? I\u2019ll be honest, there are a few lines that don\u2019t work... There\u2019s one scene where Emilia the hero asks a strange girl if she\u2019s \u2018going after\u2019 Satan(name changed to Sadou Maou), which could be interpreted as either an intent to kill or to conquer romantically, and in the Japanese, this is exactly what happens... But the slang-happy Jamie changed the term to \u201ccrushing on,\u201d which made the confusion between characters all the more confusing to the audience, but moments like those are thankfully few and far between. Other regrettable examples include a reference to \u201cSuper-size Me,\u201d because although I\u2019m perfectly willing to let a few movie references slide, there\u2019s no way two guys with no TV and limited access to the theater could have seen an American movie that was released in the mid-2000s.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, believe it or not, most of her trademarks actually work here. Totes and What the Crap are used a couple of times each, as they\u2019re apparently her favorite phrases, but the fact that they\u2019re coming from characters who speak English as a second language and had to learn about our idioms and expressions in a short period of time, neither phrase ever feels unbelievable from them. Turns out all Jamie needed to make her conventions work was a cast full of characters who are only pretending to be human. I jest, of course, but not as much as you may think. Actually, one of the best things you can do to Jamie Marchi is to challenge her with something new and innovative, which is exactly what this anime did when it tasked her with coming up with her own language for use in a select few of the Ente Isla scenes. Taking the challenge head-on, as she\u2019s known to do, she came up with her own method of reversing and distorting the English language, which she describes in very enthusiastic detail in a DVD special feature. It sounds breath-takingly authentic, as an Eastern European accent was chosen to fully capture and convey the unique music of it. I feel as though Monica Rial sounds the most natural speaking it, but in all fairness, the entire relevant cast knocked it out of the park when delivering the jibberish that was placed in front of them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of instances where the role of \u2018male protagonist\u2019 is an easy one, as the actor playing him must remain strong and likeable, and rarely anything else. The role of Maou is not one of them. Yes, there are scenes where the performance calls for good natured blandness, but there are other shades of his character, too... When at work, he must show what we in the retail business call \u201cAgressive Hospitality,\u201d smiling and being unflinchingly polite to the customers at MgRonalds(the ingeniously nicknamed Miggy \u2018Rs). When he\u2019s in Ente Isla, or even just talking about Ente Isla, he has to speak with much more power and authority, and the occasional hint of malice and mischief. Josh Grelle does this fantastically, and adds a practical edge to the character. The Hero Amelia, now known as Emi Yusa, is played by Felicia Angelle, who takes almost all of the cadences of Maou\u2019s... Power and authority, aggressive hospitality, and normal Tsundere tones to differentiate herself, and gives it back just as well, using a much lower register than I\u2019d previously thought her capable of using.\\n\\n\r\nTia Ballard plays Chiho, the youngest main character as well as Maou\u2019s closest coworker at MgRonalds, and while I\u2019m not the biggest fan of her high-pitched voice, it works really well here. While she goes through the moe tropes of being clumsy and obsessive, it also calls for a surprising amount of strength in several scenes, and if you\u2019ve heard Tia as the voice of Tifa Lockhart, you know strength is no issue for her. I can\u2019t tell you who Aaron Dismuke is playing, or why he fits into the cast so perfectly in the second half of the series, because both details would be major spoilers, but rest assured, this is one of the best roles he\u2019s done as an adult. I also can\u2019t tell you who plays the villains towards the end of the series, not only for similar reasons, but because this particular actor\u2019s become persona non grata at Funimation, and I agree with them completely. What I can tell you is that the star of this dub has to be Alex Moore, who plays Sadou\u2019s eventual next door neighbor Suzuno in what she refers to in the commentary track as her \u2018natural voice,\u2019 a strange and quirky girl with an adequately strange and quirky voice. Caitlin Glass and Alexis Tipton also feature in some memorable side roles.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier, I said that Devil is a Part timer had some goals in mind with it\u2019s characters. What I was referring to are the romantic comedy and harem tropes that it takes a lot of joy in subverting. Now, to be clear, it doesn\u2019t do quite as deep or thorough a job of it as Toradora, a show that walked right up to those tropes and said \u201cFuck you,\u201d it\u2019s more like it secretly pissed in their coffee and then told them \u2018good morning\u2019 right afterwards. It\u2019s a decent effort, is what I\u2019m saying. Starting with what should be a spineless yet perfect male protagonist, you have the literal devil, who proves to be more than a little capable and less than a little clueless. Then you have the Tsundere, who... At least in this season... Has no romantic feelings for him, and whose bipolar nature is perfectly explained by the conflict of her duties and desire for revenge vs. the fact that she can\u2019t justifiably kill a man who\u2019s just trying to live his life in a complacent manner. The klutzy moe girl, who you\u2019d expect to be some punchable infantile blob like Mayuri from Steins;Gate, is actually surprisingly bold, straight forward about her feelings, and proves more than once to have a hell of a backbone. Hell, instead of the moe girl being a childhood friend, the tsundere is a childhood enemy!\\n\\n\r\nAll of this reeks of the effort and intelligence that went into this series\u2019 writing. It\u2019s an action/comedy series, and on the comedic side, it has a great sense of humor. To be fair, humor is subjective, so I can only really speak for what works for me, and this anime utilizes the \u2018fish out of water\u2019 comedic set-up... Which happens to be one of my favorite kinds. I love seeing supernatural or otherworldly beings trying to live in our society, learning about us and trying to grasp all of the odd wonders of our culture that we take for granted. Seeing both the heroes and villains of another world settling down, getting jobs and trying to play by our rules while still battling each other as ferociously as they can without getting arrested is an absurdly funny set-up, and it\u2019s rich with potential jokes that the writers did not at any point ignore. They take every possible chance to either exploit the ignorance of our main cast, or even to make up weird conventions about Ente Isla culture, like the regional delicacy of lizard cuisine or the fact that demons have multiple hearts. Even putting aside the premise, there\u2019s no potential joke that doesn\u2019t get explored without the utmost effort and creativity, and yet it still remains more or less grounded.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the action side of things goes, I\u2019ve already said that the fight scenes are animated beautifully, but that sentiment alone doesn\u2019t do justice to how well the action is written. Not a single movement is wasted in these scenes, as they all tie in to the story in some important way. There are two major climactic battles in the series, each one representing a different half of it\u2019s 13 episode run, and every single scuffle or genuinely tense moment that we see is setting up one of the two climaxes in some way. Even episodes that you\u2019d think were filler, such as the obligatory swimsuit episode and the entire episode dedicated to MgRonalds competing with freshly opened neighboring restaurant(Named... I shit you not... Sentucky Fried Chicken), are crucial to the development of a heavily conflicted character who winds up playing an integral role in the ending. I\u2019m not going to pretend like every single joke is important to the plot... Although, most of them are... But it\u2019s rare that I find an anime that manages to rope in two different genres of anime as gracefully as this one does.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this tight focus on story and plot does lead to what many consider the show\u2019s biggest flaw... The fact that it\u2019s incomplete. Yes, for all that I love about it, Devil is a Part timer has yet another of those dreaded \u2018Read the Manga\u2019 type endings. There are a lot of questions the ending leaves unanswered, a lot of character\u2019s we\u2019ve yet to meet but were obviously meant to, and our main character, after 13 episodes, has gotten nowhere closer to either conquering our world or returning to his. This has drawn criticism from scores of other critics, but honestly? It doesn\u2019t really bother me. Okay, maybe I would have liked to see a certain character\u2019s love confession get a response, instead of just being completely forgotten about, but I have no problem with the idea of these characters just living their lives in our world. That\u2019s probably a testament to how good the characters\u2019 chemistry is, that I can\u2019t get enough of the show\u2019s status quo as it is. Of course, I still have to take away points for the lack of a solid conclusion, whether it bothers me or not, it\u2019s still just a matter of principle.\\n\\n\r\nWhat DOES bother me, and what I haven\u2019t seen anyone else complaining about, is the show\u2019s lack of depth. It\u2019s a very straightforward show with no real meanings or metaphors hiding in between the lines of the writing, and while I\u2019d normally like that sort of thing slide with most other shows, it\u2019s much more of a shame here because there was so much potential depth that it COULD have had. The very fact that the star of the show is a dictator and tyrant who was responsible for untold death and destruction, but was able to escape to a new land and live a clean and earnest life while people from his past toiled over whether or not to kill him should have made this a perfect opportunity to talk about criminal justice and whether or not someone should face the consequences of their actions if they\u2019ve already managed to turn their lives around. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s there, and the audience is free to take from it what they will, but the fact that the series itself never seized onto it drives me nuts. Yeah, Amelia does mention several times that Maou is responsible for the deaths of her parents, but she never acts on this fact, and the series never expounds upon it. I enjoyed this show, so is it weird that I wanted so much more from it?\\n\\n\r\nThe Devil is a Part Timer is available from Funimation in a nice, attractive little Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack. It can be viewed for free on Funimation.com and occasionally on Netflix. The light novel series that it was based on is available stateside from Yen Press, as is the translated manga by Satoshi Wagahara. A Spin-off manga called Devil is a Part-Timer! High School is available just the same. A second season, which would easily solve the lack of conclusion, has yet to be announced or confirmed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Devil is a Part timer is one of my favorite anime comedies of all time. The humor is sharp enough that I can watch it multiple times while still getting a laugh out of it, the action is more than solid enough to keep me engaged when the laughter fades. I hardly even have to say anything about it, as popular as it is and as explosively as it\u2019s taken off in both America and Japan. I wish it had taken itself more seriously in terms of thematic writing, but that\u2019s hardly the crux of a series that puts so much effort into showing off some of the best potential of it\u2019s genre, nor does it take away from it\u2019s impressive level of female representation. Crestia Bell alone is one of my favorite female characters in recent memory, although really, they\u2019re all stand-outs. The majority of it\u2019s problems could easily be saved by a second season, much like One Punch Man, but until it finally gets announced... This series came out the same year as Attack on Titan, for comparison\u2019s sake... I can\u2019t really over-look the areas where it\u2019s lacking. Maybe there\u2019s more development in the manga, maybe the story does all that it needs to there, but just judging by what it\u2019s shown us thus far, it is what it is. I give The Devil is a Part Timer an 8/10.",

All I can say is that after watching it, you'll definitely look for more!!! \r\nOh and btw, you can get more from the Light Novels and Manga.

            "content": "This is spoiler free, so if you\u2019re interested and don\u2019t want to be spoiled, read on.\r\nHataraku Maou-sama. AKA The Devil is a Part-timer, really had me from the get-go. \r\nWhether or not it really kept my interested throughout the remainder of the series, is another question. \r\nThe story-line itself sets up the anime perfectly for many hilarious jokes and characters. This was executed well, all up until the half-way mark of the season. From there, the story that unfolded really lost its charm. The characters began to become annoying, the plot became incredibly uninteresting, and all in all to put it bluntly: it became atrain wreck. I have absolutely no idea how they could stuff this up, but it happened alright. A show with such potential to really grow its characters made a plot hit a wall once it reached around episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.5 -ish\\n\r\nIt was very clever. The humour for the most part was funny enough too.\\n\r\nSo basically the Satan, the Demon Lord, flees his magical world to come to earth, where he needs to fit in in modern day Tokyo. In order to do this, he needs to firstly find a job, where he is made to work at McDonalds, (MgRonald, but who really cares). \\n\r\nThis sounds awesome, and it really was a clever concept from the beginning.  \\n\r\nThe humour throughout the series remained funny, which was a plus, and the morals that the anime tried to send across was also sort of done decently. With the bad stuff aside (I will get to that later), let's just talk about how promising the first half of the season was.\\n\r\nIt was really enjoyable to say the least. It really seemed like that this anime was headed in the right direction. It had all the right ingredients: legitimate backstories, polar opposite characters put in a hilarious situation, a little bit of action and humour. It really seemed to give you feels.\\n\r\nEverything seemed like it was setting up something quite epic by the end of the season, but I will warn you now: THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN. By the half way mark, this anime takes a turn for the worst. We are introduced by such uninspired characters and begin to follow a story line that seems completely unrelated to the fantastic concept they began with. Sure, Maou still works at Mcdonalds, but really, the intriguing part of the plot spiralled down. All that interesting backstory of the central characters were lost and instead replaced by other character relationships that \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 we don\u2019t give a flying hoot about.\\n\r\nAlas, I am still giving Hataraku Maou-sama an 7.5 in this department, as I really just loved the entire concept of the anime. It was unique, and definitely had it\u2019s funny moments. How it was executed on the other hand, really wasn't to my personal liking. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.5\\n\r\nMany of the characters at the beginning seemed to have much more depth than they showed by the end of the season, and this depth (especially for Emi and Sadao) was something that I was just disappointed to see not go any further. \\n\r\nBut what really frustrated me most was Shiro. \\n\r\nO.M.G this girl was annoying.\\n\r\nAt first I thought that she was funny and cute, but at the end of it, you will realise just how unnecessary she is as a character. \\n\r\nI really thought she was throw away at the beginning, but when she was constantly there, I realised just how useless she was. I have no idea why on earth she was kept on the show, as many other characters within this anime were so much more interesting. IT MADE NO SENSE. If the anime didn't put time into investigating her character (what was there to even investigate in?), the focus could have been shifted to more important, more interesting things, like: what happened to the magical world of Ente Isla? Who are the two other characters that seemed mystical? \\n\r\nUnfortunately, not only that, but the MC himself needed even more substance. I get that he is Satan the \u2018Demon Lord\u2019, but his change of character probably needed more explanation. There was a little bit, and it seemed to flow at the beginning, but by the end, IT WASN'T ENOUGH. And perhaps this is where you are meant to find humour in his 'surprising' personality, but in a sense, I felt as though this anime wanted to be taken somewhat seriously about moral values, to some extent. If it did why go about it in a way with hardly any explanation? Furthermore, there were a lot of useless characters too, not just Shiro. \\n\r\nIn saying all of this, I suppose there are good characters too, even if they may appear rather generic. I liked the MC and his sidekick, I liked Emi and he unforgiving nature. I liked Lucifer who was really just hilarious, and I even wouldn\u2019t mind Shiro if they didn\u2019t make her a central character, she could be added just for a few laughs. If the story was just based around those 4 characters (not including Shiro), I would be happy. The interaction between the characters played out well at least. Many of them seemed to bounce off each other in a realistic manner, and this had me laughing throughout. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nIt was never too flashy, and honestly it wasn't too memorable either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nOkay. So I really didn't like the OP or the ED. It was unmemorable and I skipped it every time. From memory, they had to change their OP within the first few episodes, as if they hadn't fully decided what to go with. Don't ask why, because I have absolutely no idea. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5\\n\r\nI did like The Devil is a Part-timer to some extent. It was funny at times, and the story (at the beginning) was really well thought out. If it wasn't for the annoying characters and the direction the anime headed down past episode 6, I would probably give it a different rating. But honestly, with such an original concept, I really expected more than how it was followed through. If you are looking for an anime just for the laughs, why not give Hataraku Maou-sama a shot? But if you really want to get invested into the characters and the story, perhaps not.\\n",

            "content": "Comedy is notoriously difficult to translate outside of its time period or place or origin, largely because it relies on the tastes of its target audience and typically assumes that they have a certain level of cultural knowledge. Shakespeare's comedies, for example, can be rather difficult even for native English speakers to find funny because you will have to cut through the archaic language and sometimes even understand the fine points of early 17th-century English pronunciation. If an undisputed world-class master of storytelling has trouble getting his humor to resonate even within his own culture just a few centuries later, how hard must it befor a comedy to translate between two radically different cultures that developed on opposite sides of the globe? \"The Devil Is A Part Timer\" actually succeeds in doing this... to a degree.\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\\n\r\nWhat would happen if Sauron, Dark Lord of Mordor, was dumped into the 21st century First World, had no magic or abilities beyond the average human, had to work a minimum-wage job to pay the rent, but still harbored delusions of grandeur? This series. 'Devil' works best when it has our main cast treating mundane everyday life like it's a colossal battle of good vs evil for the FATE OF THE WORLD (\"I'm on the front lines of a fast food war!\"). It's a good enough gag to at least get you through 13 episodes. The catch is the tone shifts where this show tries to weave in a serious fantasy story about events in magical world of Inte Isla- they don't work. Now having at least some basic semblance of a plot would be fine as an excuse to set up some comedic battles and give you an extra incentive to keep watching. And the first arc does follow this pattern, making it the better half of the show. However, the second half tries to significantly up the seriousness in a show that was running on 'Rule of Funny'- and it backfires. \"Steins;Gate\" also had a significant tone shift from comedic to serious halfway through its run, but it worked because the first episode had Makise Kurisu being murdered then mysteriously found alive and well, along with occasional hints and reminders that something deeper was going on until the second half started with a bang. The seriousness doesn't work here because at first Inte Isla is a completely generic fantasy world that could have come from any random D&D game- it's only mentioned in passing and only there to excuse why the main cast acts so abnormally. But then 'Devil' tries to make it far more important to the plot and even give it some development, all in far less time than was needed and all while still trying to regularly switch back and forth to comedic moments. In the second arc the comedy is diluted by too much serious material, and the serious material is undermined because it doesn't have enough time and development to actually be taken seriously. And the last episode is a filler. Ironically, the 'Story' score is hurt because this show tried to have a real plot.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice, it's colorful, production values are good. I don't really have much to say about it.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nGo English dub on this one, verbal comedy works best in situations where there are as few barriers between you and the comedian as possible. Tone and inflection can make the difference between a dull line and a hilarious one, even when the actual words spoken are identical. And fortunately, the dub is very good. There's nothing really memorable good or bad from the soundtrack, it does fine.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nThe cast has three strong comedic characters in Maou, Emi, and Shirou- all recent residents of Inte Isla who embody the show's main gag of taking everything FAR too seriously. It has three weak characters in Chiho, Lucifer, and Suzuno. The first is moe with a bosom rather sizable for her age and can't provide any great gags (with the exception of one golden line from Emi concerning her... chest). Lucifer doesn't show up until the end of the first arc, and then does nothing for the second but still gets significant screen time. Suzuno is symptomatic of the show's attempt to get more serious and doesn't have any jokes worth remembering (although she did make a 'Lone Wolf and Cub' reference- always a good thing). Nobody else really worth mentioning except for Maou and Shirou's landlady, who only has brief screen time but squeezes in a couple OK jokes. In short, the main cast works well, but has to drag around significant dead weight in the second half. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nStrong start, but my interest began to fade down the stretch. It never bottomed out, but the serious plot wasn't engaging and the comedy didn't have enough screen time or variety towards the end to make me think this show really needed to continue. Though overall I still liked this series.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nShould have stayed comedic, that's where the strength of 'The Devil Is A Part-Timer' lies. That being said, the jokes actually do translate pretty well and are rather relatable since they center on entry-level mundane jobs (we've all been there) rather than rehashing standard Japanese high school gags. Enjoyable, but also botched.",

Seriously, it is. It\u2019s a very original take on both the fantasy trope and the slice of life genre. And, honestly, the presentation ain\u2019t halfbad, either. The comedy is the show\u2019s main focus, and it\u2019s handled very well. The various arcs are entertaining to watch and try to dive into both the fantasy aspects and the normal life aspects. And they manage to do this better than I expected.\\n\\n\r\nThis does not mean it\u2019s perfect. Hell, far from it. Some arcs are rather forced, a lot of them don\u2019t make sense and throughout the show we never actually get to know why the characters stay in this world. Even after they get more than enough magic back to return, they never do. Why?\\n\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t even really know how they got there in the first place. Seriously. It looks like the wormhole was opened by Satan, but then they immediately state that nobody has any idea what\u2019s going on. Who opened it? Why?\\n\\n\r\nBut honestly? I never expected them to answer these questions. If you are going to watch this show, you do it for the comedy. You do not expect great plotlines, but mediocre ones, if at all. And for what I expected, they delivered more than enough.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are sometimes a bit difficult to get a hold of. And with \u2018characters\u2019 I mean \u2018Maou Sadao/Satan Jacob\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nHis character is something that\u2019s difficult to get a hold off because, for the majority of the series, he\u2019s a laid back, enthusiastic nice guy. He tries to do the right things, is passionate about his work and is has his wits to back him up. Which is all fine and dandy, until you realize that this is the freaking Devil.\\n\\n\r\nThe only information we are given of what he was like back in Ente Isla (the fantasy world) is by the Warriors of Light. Apparently, he was a ruthless monster that didn\u2019t think twice about killing innocents. Yeah. Stark contrast, huh?\\n\\n\r\nYou could say that this is because it\u2019s that Light giving the information; of course they\u2019re biased. But Maou never denies it, even acknowledges it, as does every other demon, and from the short moment we see him in Ente Isla, it seems like they are right. This leaves only two options:\\n\r\nA) He had, like, the fastest character flip in history.\\n\r\nB) He was never really that evil to begin with, but had a personal agenda for trying to conquer Ente Isla.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to say that his character is underdeveloped, but I would\u2019ve liked some backstory, you know? If the unconfirmed rumors are true however and there is a second season on the way, this is all forgiven, as the second season could potentionally fix this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, another character that\u2019s a bit... weird considering her stereotypical charactertropes is Emi Yusa. She\u2019s the \u2018warrior of Light\u2019, the \u2018Chosen One\u2019, the only one who can possibly defeat Satan.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s also a tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nA warrior of light as a tsundere is a bit strange, but hey, I\u2019ve seen stranger things, and if Satan can work at McDonalds, I guess the Chosen One can be a tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are like this, honestly. None of them are really threatening or evil in the long run, and often can be seen as pathetic. But that\u2019s part of the comedy in this show, and honestly, I love it. I do hope that they\u2019ll get more character development in the second season that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully \u2013 coming.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I have to mention one more thing, and if I don\u2019t do it now, I\u2019ll never get to it. So, I\u2019ll just say it outright: I. Like. The. Romantic. Subplot.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I just said that.\\n\\n\r\nI normally HATE the romantic subplots in series, but this time, I could not only bear it, but actually enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nThe subplot is between Maou and one of his employees, Chiho. She\u2019s the resident moe-and-fanservice character of the show, but surprisingly likeable. She\u2019s very honest and upbeat, which is why I liked the romance between her and Maou. See, one of the main reasons I dislike romantic subplots is because they always take ages to get past the \u2018I don\u2019t like you!/Well I don\u2019t like you!/ Fine! WE SO OBVIOUSLY DON\u2019T LIKE EACH OTHER!\u2019 state. This one does this fairly early on with Chiho confessing almost immediately. Sure, Maou doesn\u2019t respond, but it makes it so much easier to watch when everything is out in the open and there is no stupid dodging to be done.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, since Chiho is one of the only characters who didn\u2019t know Maou on Ente Isla, she\u2019s very refreshing. She just goes on what she sees, and she sees a nice, hard-working guy that looks great, too. Even after she learns that he is Satan, she still doesn\u2019t give a damn, because, well, he\u2019s just so nice. \\n\\n\r\n(Though I did hear rumors about Emi/Maou being the main couple, which just seems strange to me, because he killed her father and all, so I don\u2019t see how romance could blossom, but hey, this is anime. I just hope that they don\u2019t do it, since I enjoy this romance so much)\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION/SOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great, I like the colorful art style. Yeah... not much to say otherwise. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really like the opening or ending theme, but most people seem to like it okay, so I must be in the minority here. I do have to mention one thing: Chiho is seen in the opening shooting a bow. She never does in the show. So what\u2019s the point, then?\\n\\n\r\nEven though I didn\u2019t particulary like most of the soundtrack, I didn\u2019t hate anything, either, and since I dislike most comedy soundtracks, this was really the most I could hope for. \\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY:\\n\\n\r\nHatarakou Maou-Sama/The Devil is a Part Timer is a very enjoyable comedy anime that you should definitely check out. But really don\u2019t expect anything except comedy, since you\u2019re going to be disappointed then. There are enough serious moments here that a negative reaction is understandable, so don\u2019t be fooled. This is comedy, pure and simple.\\n",

            "content": "4 years has passed since 'Hataraku Maou-sama' aired, I have seen many different demons genres but if I had to rewrite some of the best of those, this series would be part of that. \r\nThere is something special, something will be in mind for a long time. Ideal? Yes. I like a reformed devil as a protagonist to get along with his \u2018nemesis\u2019 \u2013  a female hero in Emilia.  But if you are finding a series full of combats, I don\u2019t think this can achieve your purpose. Although there are some fighting scenes, 13 episodes focus on how our Maou manages to fitwith strange human system. Have you ever seen any powerful devil works hard day by day for a small fast-food restaurant to earn his salary? I don\u2019t think you can find anything like that in other demons.\\n\r\n But the ideals are not the best part. It\u2019s good and extraordinary but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m impressed most. I prefer comedy to ideals and it\u2019s the reason why this series attracted me when I saw it. \\n\r\nAs the Satan in Ente Isla, Maou Sadao is clearly a true bad guy: cruel, sinister, an unbeaten monster. He rules his world with violence and wars, makes innocent people experience despair, desolation; villages are deep in fire and blood. But when he was in modern-day Tokyo \u2013 a world without magic, as a normal person, Maou Sadao and Yusa Emi followed their rules, worked with them, learned everything from them. Thanks to that, they realized the right things they had to do and made their decisions. The way they act like dog versus cat all the time usually has my laugh, but when they have the same enemies to fight, the same people to protect, their cooperation and trusting each other are really fun to watch.\\n\r\nNothing too much to say about the characters and drawing. Well, they were designed perfectly that I can understand their characteristics and emotions. Although the protagonists have been focused on, I want to find out more about other characters, but I think waiting for 2nd season or reading light novel is a great experience. \\n\r\nOverall, this is a great series. I can watch it daily without any discomfort or despondency. This is truly an anime to enjoy at your free-time.  \\n",

            "content": "The Devil is a Part-Timer! A series like this grabs your attention right out the gates. The introductory action montage clues the audience into what kind of grandeur we could be seeing later. The premise is brimming with potential for comedy, romance, drama, and action. But how does it follow up on this promise? The series does an alright job. Never that bad, usually not great either. The romance and drama fall flat and the action is rare, but that's OK. The series generally performs as a comedy, and that is really what matters. It is survived by its comedy, voice-acting, occasional artistic triumphs, andjust how relatable the premise and characters can be. It is an interesting series that really does have so much potential, though it can't quite reach these lofty goals, and is begging for a second season. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 4]\\n\\n\r\nThe story is obviously one of the series' sensitive spots. The premise is engaging and there is potential for all sorts of struggles between characters and their worlds, but it feels like it is lacking guidance. I call these types of shows 'gauntlet' shows, where the protagonist is just fed a series of challenges that they 'pass' in order to develop and push the plot forward. The problem with many of these gauntlet shows is that the challenges presented don't have any significance to the cast, and thus also lack significance for the audience. There are a few villains in this show and they just kind of show up. They have no place in the world before the audience meets them. They are just cast to act as another challenge for Maou to pass.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from this, it is difficult for the audience to get a good idea of what is going on in Ente Isla. There is some kind of church that is scheming to come to power, but the heroes friends are still around so presumably nothing is happening. The audience does not even have a sense of what the church figureheads are and why they really need to eliminate the hero and the devil. How did Maou lead Ente Isla? Obviously he was cruel at some point, but he even mentions that he did not really understand humans back then. It is just hard to get a sense of what is actually happening in the world.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these criticisms, the show mostly functions as a comedy. So we should judge the story primarily by how it acts as a vehicle for a comedy. For most comedies, it just doesn't matter too much beyond the premise -- a good writer can create comedic scenarios in any situation. This series is the same. The story is pretty average, losing points for sloppy construction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6]\\n\\n\r\nAt some points -- specifically that intro sequence -- the art looks amazing. That being said, it flubs pretty frequently.  The design is pretty average, nothing noteworthy. The action is generally good, we get some dynamic shot angles, and the characters can be quite expressive. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 6]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting by certain characters, Maou and Ashiya, stands out in a great way. These guys are the life of the party. Just listening to Ashiya react to something is fun. Beyond that, the voice acting is fine, sometimes Chi is annoying. The design is just totally average and doesn't shoot for too much, but does what it needs to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 4]\\n\\n\r\nAshiya is a god. Maou is usually pretty funny. The rest of the cast usually does not do the series any favors, comedically or dramatically. It is tough to rate characters well for a series that tries to go for dramatic moments but fails by virtue of the unrelatable characters. I could dedicate a whole essay on the concoction that is Chiho --  the character defined by her affection for Maou and a chest big enough to have the series brand her as best girl --  but nobody wants to read that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe series is pretty funny! Any series that can make me laugh is enjoyable enough for me. It's not a great show and even a lot of the humor falls flat since it is the same gag over and over again. But what shines again and again is a combination of the strong premise, the voice acting, and the relatability, not of the characters, but of the situations that we can find them in. Anybody, even the devil or a legendary hero, can find themselves falling into the struggles that we do. The show does a great job of mixing those moments with the moments that emblemize what devils and heroes are all about. The juxtaposition is the crux of the series' success. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 6]\\n\\n\r\nPretty decent show with loads of potential. It really only comes to fruition comedically, which is fine, but leaves the audience longing for more. There are lovely moments like (usually with Ashiya, Maou, or a little sakuga), but beyond that, the show is decidedly average. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Overrrated and misleading. Those words describe this anime perfectly. Okay so lets break it down shall we?\r\nThe story is this devil king guy who enters this gate and ends up in modern tokyo. Yeah like we haven't heard stories about people from fantasy worlds coming to our world before. Lets face it its cliche as fuck, however cliche doesn't necessarily mean bad.\r\nOkay so when you read the description and look at the cover of this show then you are probably assuming that this is a silly, but nonetheless good comedy. However go into this show with the mindset that you will be laughing your assoff all the time and you will be dissapointed. I am not gonna lie this anime does have some pretty funny moments, but honestly it felt alot more like a fantasy drama than a comedy. Infact sometimes it was so serious that i was unsure of what kind of show it was. Now please dont get me wrong i don't dislike drama or anything (infact i love it more than comedy). However, when i read the reviews of this anime and looked at the cover i was expecting an anime that was funny all around, but that was not the case.\\n\\n\r\nAlright lets move on to the characters. You have the MC Sadao Maou AKA the devil king, Shirou Ashiya or \"Alsiel\" as he is sometimes called. He is Maou loyal servant and was a general in the demon army. Then there is Emilia Justina who is known better as Emi or Yusa. She was a Hero in the fantasy world place and fought against the devil king and his armies. Lastly there is Chiho Sasaki or simply \"Chi-chan\" She is a normal high school girl who works with him at McRonalds.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are a shitload of other characters in this show but i am not gonna bother mentioning them since that would take too long. So is there anything special about this characters? Well no not really, Maou is your typical i will dominate the world kind of guy, but i will say though that he seems to have grown more soft after coming the human world. His servant and roommate Alsiel is the kind of guy who is obsessed with pleasing his lord, though he does scold Maou when he wastes money on unnecessary things.\\n\\n\r\nNext there is Emi who again is your typical \" I will avenge my friends/family and punish evil people\" kind of person. There is nothing unique about here. Finally there is the annoying, but cute Chi-chan who obviously has a crush on Maou though he is oblivious to her feelings. Again she is just the jelous, but cute high school girl character, nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nNow its not that every character in this anime is boring, but then again there is nothing that makes them stand out either.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack i have to say that this was one of the anime's strong points. The opening Song is really cool and i got goosebumps every time i listened to it. It kind of reminded me of the opening of SAO. The ending theme is also really good and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is the conclusion? Well the show itself isn't bad, its just that it makes you believe that its a silly comedy that will make you laugh all the time when it isn't. Like i said before though that doesn't mean that the show is serious all the time and boring, but it means that its not exactly what you would expect. If you are expecting a show like \"daily life of high school boys\" or My Bride is a Mermaid\" then you will be dissapointed. However if you go into show with a different mindset then you may very well like it. Think of this anime as a fantasy/drama with some action and comedy here and there. If you do that you probably won't be dissapointed like i was.",

            "content": "I know I\u2019m late to the show but,\r\nHataraku Maou Sama was recommended by many of my friends and seemed to be an anime that many of them enjoyed.\r\nI was quite pleased after watching 5 episodes but by the sixth episode I was left with nothing but dreaded disappointment. I had high expectations for the anime but I guess I expected way too much of it.\r\nThe story talks about an Overpowered Demon Lord from another world called Ente Isla getting transported to our world.\r\nThis was because a hero from the other world defeated him to stop him from taking over Ente Isla and hence the DemonLord and his Demon General escaped to our world.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes features him and his general adapting to the cultures of the real world, taking the form of a regular human and taking on a regular job like working at MgRonald\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nThe hero, worried he might destroy the \u2018real world\u2019 chased him down to attempt to kill him and return back to Ente Isla however, she realised that the Demon Lord wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong or evil in the \u2018real world\u2019 and therefore had no reason to catch him.\\n\\n\r\nShe then decides to stay in the \u2018real world\u2019 longer to hopefully catch the Demon Lord red handed and annihilate him. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime resonates between a \u2018Slice of Life and a desperate attempt at comedy\u2019 because though the first few episodes were pretty funny, it soon got dull, dry and boring as subsequent episodes seem to be a complete repetition with little progress from the previous one.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode just talks about or rather, shows the Demon Lord living like a regular person while the Hero always keeping an eye on him to catch him in action doing something evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe difference from this anime and typical slice of Life anime is that they try to bring in some form of suspense by introducing new characters from Ente Isla either to kill the Demon Lord or bring the hero back. And yes, that too got boring. It was a lazy way to introduce new characters to the anime with the same reason all the time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was decent, it kind of fits the different characteristics of the characters but doesn\u2019t really stand out whatsoever \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters however, were dull and boring. None of them actually has a goal at all and are just passing each day normally with the occasional problems brought about by Ente Isla or occasional quarrels between Hero and Demon Lord because after all they are sworn enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThe Hero, might appeal to many for whatever reason but to me she just feels like a typical Tsundere character that looks down on the MC because he\u2019s a demon. Isn\u2019t that just plain childish... and here I thought she was going to be an accepting individual or at least bare hatred to the Demon Lord and kill him or something... but instead she visits his house and talks to him casually as though they were a couple or friends...\\n\\n\r\nThe MC, a demon lord that lost his powers like every other character when they visit the \u2018real world\u2019 works at MgRonald\u2019s and got a loli/imouto character to fall for him like typical high school crushes. The MC just lives each day like a normal person, eat normal meals and struggles to make money to put food on the table like any other human... I don\u2019t even understand how all their personalities change so drastically in just a few days...\\n\\n\r\nThe MC\u2019s lover seems like just another basic imouto/loli character that fell for the MC... Except that they decided to take it to the next level by getting her to accidentally find out what the MC truly is.\\n\r\nThey could\u2019ve developed on the romance using that opportunity but instead decided to throw in crappy cliches like \u2018I don\u2019t mind you being a Demon Lord or all the evil things you have done because I already fell for you\u2019 what the actual f***\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn\u2019t anywhere particularly special either... with no suspense building momentum or hype whatsoever...\\n\\n\r\nJust one big disappointment after another, I think there might probably be some desperate attempt to recover the glory it could have been at the later episodes but I doubt it. The inevitable cliches this anime has thrown itself into would make it impossible or extremely difficult to redeem itself.\\n\\n\r\nI probably won\u2019t bother updating the review unless the last few episodes which I plan to watch soon are actually extremely good.",

(See, what I did there? :P) \r\nEnamoured by the premise of the show, I decided to give it a try and trust me, this show didn\u2019t disappoint. \r\nThe story starts relatively straightforward with a standard fantasy world, a darklord scheming for world domination with a demon army and a hero who is the last hope for humanity. After this depressingly clich\u00e9d start, the hero and the Devil arrive on Earth, where their magic fails to work and they are forced to take up low-level jobs to survive. Their adventures (or should I say misadventures) are quite comical and the show is a laugh-riot through and through. That said, the second half felt a bit rushed and the ending was quite mediocre and left quite a few loose ends. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, all of them are pretty darn funny. The villain of the story is the dark lord Saturn (Mao-sama) who leaves the path of evil and tries to live life as a normal human. His roommate is the demon general Ashiya who now chops vegetables instead of human heads and works as a homemaker to assist his lord. \\n\\n\r\nThe hero of the story is Emilia who works as a call centre employee. She is flummoxed by the change in the dark lord\u2019s behaviour and stalks him to find out his real intentions (she assumes that he plans world domination). The encounters between her and the dark lord are quite humorous. \\n\\n\r\nOther funny characters include Lucifer (yes, that Lucifer) who lives as a freeloader on his master\u2019s money and Chiho-chan who has a crush on the dark lord (What a clich\u00e9: girls always fall for the bad guys). All in all, the characters are top-notch. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering its short size (13 episodes), humorous characters and wacky storyline, \u2018The devil is a part timer\u2019, is the perfect remedy to drive away melancholia. \\n",

            "content": "Then, he was Lord Satan, Demon King, Devil, who, with the combined might of his monstrous hordes, almost wrested the realm of Ente Isla under his grip. Now, he is simply Sadao Ma\u014d, an ambitious employee of a burger joint eerily similar to a certain existing restaurant chain in a plane called Earth. From the most feared of occupations to the most menial... quite a fall, but he's carrying himself. With a lot of enthusiasm, oddly enough. So, will he somehow make it back to his own dimension with the money he'll save up? Or will he become the overlord of this brave new world,one beef patty, potato fry, and rung up order at a time?\\n\\n\r\nBased off a light novel franchise by Satoshi Wagahara, the Devil is a Part-Timer! was produced by White Fox, responsible for such works as Jormungund, Katanagatari, and Steins;Gate, with direction by Naoto Hosoda, scripting by Touko Machida, and anime character design by Atsushi Ikariya. Original character design is attributed to 029. With the title aforementioned, one could hazard a guess that the show is a comedy. Part of it is. As far as success in any comedy goes, is it funny? I would say the majority of it, comprising comedy gold scenarios, including, but not limited to: Ma\u014d adjusting awkwardly to his new situation, Ma\u014d taking to his work with an awkward amount of seriousness, and Ma\u014d awkwardly interacting with the Hero that vanquished his armies and forced him into exile. Unfortunately Emilia Justina, now known as Emi Yusa, discovers that the magic required to fulfill her mission of finishing him off is absent from this dimension. Ma\u014d is in a similar predicament, and so the two, after an awkward standoff, later perceived by the police as a lovers' spat, to Yusa's dismay, are left at a momentary armistice. The Hero has contented herself to to what essentially predicates as \u201cstalking\u201d his movements in the meantime, though she'd consider \u201cmonitoring\u201d the more apt term. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a shaky truce that turns into a begrudging friendship and perhaps even a romance. It's a symptom of what caught my eye as I studied the two: the breaking of stereotypes. It starts to become evident to Yusa that the Devil is more than his formerly demonic skin. Likewise, Ma\u014d found the Hero to be less than her formerly paladin exterior. In truth, it was the drama, shone at its best with Yusa's breakdown and subsequent backstory in front of Ma\u014d that could result from this premise that made me interested, since I don't normally frequent comedies by themselves, however much they may play into relationship development. For a first arc, despite the rather quick pacing, I liked what I saw. I liked the visuals too, bright and vibrant as well the opposite when it needs to. The animation is smooth, and the facial expressions are appropriately amusing at the right timing.\\n\\n\r\nBut then it turned hypocritical and devoted itself into the making of stereotypes. By far the most baffling and irritating of them is the show's later focus on one of Ma\u014d's female coworkers, Chiho Sasaki, whose being thereupon can be summed up in three words: cute, kind, and well-proportioned. Tolerable early on as something for Ma\u014d's and Yusa's characterization to play off on, but as a character herself, she's not much else save her charm, and being moe and busty are weak charms at that, or at least on me. The rest of the significant cast also unfortunately falls into generalized conveniences, most of whom for me became a chore to see after their first few appearances. They don't do much to play off out main leads, relegated to becoming gag material that becomes old. This is not to mention all the filler that doesn't accomplish much save reiterate what was already known and generate laughs, the material of which soon devolved from lively to insipid, clever to dull, the adaptation of tales independent of the plot that don't really add anything to the narrative. Then there is that pool episode. Correction: I don't have a problem with pool episodes and related beach and swimsuit offerings per say. I don't even mind fan service, but when fan service in whatever form is the only appreciable thing going for an airing, I'd rather they finish the show an episode less than the norm. After all, the show isn't supposed to be an ecchi. It isn't supposed to be a comedy either, at least, not on its own. It has revealed its hand as a drama as well, and yet, at times, the show forgets the identity it worked so hard early on to establish. The fight scenes, however captivating they may be at times which, to me, wasn't many, aren't enough to ratchet the tension by themselves. Even if the comedy was humorous throughout, without the right balance of comedy and drama, especially with drama this seriously wound up, then the end result would be something mediocre. The show didn't quite conclude on that note, but the extent it allowed fester still left a bad taste.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP \u201cZERO!!\u201d and the ED \u201cTsuki Hana\u201d or \u201cMoon Flower,\u201d by Minami Kuribayashi and Nano.RIPE respectively, are standard J-Pop fare who only get their own separate animations by Episode 6, beforehand comprising of collections of past scenes throughout previous episodes, slide show sequences of cast members, and a picture of Sasaki in suggestive beach garb and a straw hat. The songs themselves aren't much to my taste, the former somewhat corny half-way through with the techno addendum, nonsensical synthetic chanting, and trying-to-be-epic-but-coming-off-cheesy-and-unnatural-instead electric guitar, the latter, dominated by this trying-to-be-cute-but-coming-off-nasal-and-unnatural-instead croon from the vocalist. They're both not really to my tastes. The OP sequence opens with Ma\u014d and Yusa in a quick the then-and-now, the transition from commanding to amusing well. Other transitions of that nature are fun to watch, but the highlights on the other characters aren't as enjoyable. Some aren't even understandable, a thowback to a couple of which hardly appear at all throughout the show's length and a highlight to Sasaki, who, for some reason, is presented as more impressive than she actually is. The ED, on the other hand, illustrates almost nothing but her. Guess where my opinion stands. Two other EDs take the place for the conclusions of Episode 5, \u201cStar Chart\u201d stands for the other on Episode 13 entitled \u201cTsumabiku Hitori,\u201d also by Nano.RIPE. The same issues I had with the previous ED are the same for these two.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there's facets of the show that have been more thought out as the show progressed, considering how promising the show was at the beginning. Nonetheless, I'm definitely on board for a sequel if the producers decide the show, or rather, the popularity of said show warrants that. I've heard that the filler may be due to efforts to hold out for that extra season to give the source material time to shine on screen, so I have hope. If hope fails, well... there's always fast food and cashier smiles courtesy of employee protocol to satiate me.\\n\\n\r\nI give The Devil is a Part-Timer! a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "The Demon king is an idea that has come up in a few anime, and can be interpreted in many ways.  It has been interpreted as a future job, or the role of a female person rather then a male regardless of the title.  And then, we have this.  \r\nStory (8/10): The story of Hataraku Maou-sama revolves around the lives of a select few individuals who come from a place called Ente Isla.  Whisked away to modern day japan, the individuals, ranging from heroes to demons, must figure out a way back to their world again, while making sure that theycan survive the world that they are put in.  To sum it up, it's about a demon king who works at a Mcdonald's rip-off.  The premise of this anime is definitely strange beyond meaning.  This has to be, one of the most random premises to exist in anime, ever, and I love it!  This show could arguably be considered as a slice of life anime due to its heavy involvement in the daily lives of these beings.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10): First we have the main character, Sadao Maou.  As basically a character based off of Satan, Maou shows to have a very evil outlook in life as the demon king.  WHEN he is the demon king.  While in Japan however, he is shown to be more considerate to people, essentially showing how much a person can change in a matter of 2 episodes or so.  He shows a very drastic change in terms of the first episode, and every episode onwards, and becomes rather kind.  Not something that can be expected from someone who has killed hundreds upon thousands of people.  He also has a unique \"motivation\" when it comes to working in his job.  Next is Shirou Ashiya.  As Maou's right hand man, Shirou shows an incredible amount of loyalty to his lord, even to the extent of showing respect in straight up public.  He always aims to please his lord and always tries to do his best in terms of taking care of the home.  (He's basically the wife of the series.) However, it should be mentioned as how much attention he puts into his work.  Like, a LOT of attention.  Next is Emilia the hero.  As the tsundere of the series... (I'm sure you can all guess.) As a hero, she is sworn to kill Maou under any circumstances because of the fact that he is the demon king, and has caused much terror throughout the land.  And finally, Chiho Sasaki.  As Maou's coworker, Chiho is the \"normal\" one in the series as she pretty much possesses no speciality to herself other then some weird inherited power that I won't get in much detail.  (Even the anime doesn't.) Having a HUGE crush on Maou, she constantly tries to get him to notice her albeit subtle to the point that no dense male character will ever understand.  She's also the fanservice character as noted by several episodes.  Beyond them, there is a plethora of supporting characters and a new main character that appears later in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10) Art (8/10): For sound, it's...pretty generic sounding.  To me, it sounds good, it really does.  But, it's not to the point that I would just listen to it on my spare time like I do with various other tracks from various other animes.  For art, the colors are very bright.  The art style is fairly good with fluid action scenes that appear out of nowhere, as well as extremely detailed magic circles that seem to be in any anime that deal with that sort of crap.  The demons themselves are really detailed and look very good.  Although, one complaint I have is the changing eye gag that happens somewhat often in the second half.  The characters basically change their design to a more basic looking thing, and it just looks bad.  To me, this was a mistake in the anime's development.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9/10): Upon reading the premise itself, I was just intrigued.  Seriously, a demon king working at a frikin' Mcdonalds.  How funny is that?!  Right away I knew that I would like this.  Upon watching more, I found myself laughing many a time due to the constant comedy that they would use, as well as how serious the characters can get in certain situations.  One of my favorites is when they realize how close to poverty their reactions are just too funny.  I also like the fact that the creators tried to implement comedy in action scenes, which turned out really well due to how hard of a task that actually can be.  It's also funny to mention how fast and easy it is for the characters later in the series to change because they don't even seem like the same person anymore.  Personally, I enjoyed it and I wouldn't mind to rewatch this because this series is just awesome.  While it falls on the implementation of somewhat useless characters and the mediocre sounding music, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fun and pointless comedy, and to anyone who needs just pure entertainment.  I really hope they do a season 2.  This shit was just too good.",

            "content": "Well, shows around this time seem to have the same style of sound and graphics then all the other anime out there. Same sort of design of characters, same sort of moe fan based humor, same this and that. It\u2019s only the true anime, the ones with a lot of heart put into it that stand out from the rest and make them high on the list. Does this anime rise higher then all the others? No\u2026 It\u2019s just like all the rest. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way but it just doesn\u2019t do anything that any of the other shows do in this time.\r\nThestory line is a basic storyline, guy meets girl and laughable misunderstanding happens all around them with people think they are going out. Throw in one being the Demon Lord and the other being a Holy Knight, add a human girl to be the love triangle and we have a match. It\u2019s not that different from Demon King Daimao except that Demon Lord Satan (They couldn\u2019t come up with another name so picked a religious name, why not?) was a demon lord before the show started. There are also some other things that tie the show with Demon King but if I said anything more on that, it would be a spoiler as sadly there are not many episodes to this anime. I would like there to be more, I would because it was enjoyable but just not innovative and new. I felt like I was watching any other show from the 21st century in the writing style.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork like any other show is really nice. Bright colors, comical expressions, slap stick, face distortion\u2026 ya, like I said, not very innovative. It just feels like every other like I could be watching High School of the Dead and this at the same time and sometimes ask where the zombies are in this. They blend in well and just don\u2019t stand out in the mountain of anime that came out in its time frame.\\n\\n\r\nThe English voices are perfect for the characters but again, since it\u2019s made by Funimation, there is Funimation\u2019s voice acting all over it. I just give them props for not going with a lot of names that have been said way to many times. Josh Grelle and Felecia Angelle, Tia Ballard and Anthony Bowling\u2026 These are names that I haven\u2019t heard very often in the main character list. I might be wrong to say this and people can correct me but normally I hear Monica Rial, Caitlin Glass, or even Vic as main voices. I was surprised to not hear Vic\u2019s voice for Satan and though I do love Vic, it was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this show even if it was similar to many other shows, and I wouldn\u2019t mind watching it again. If your looking for new and exciting, this isn\u2019t the one, if your looking for one that plays it safe, this might be your show. Now if only they would come out with season two so I can get a actual ending like the manga, that would really be nice.",

            "content": "I just finished all 13 episodes and I have to say, I was very impressed with this show. I think most people assumed this show was going to be another bland and unfunny anime, and I think we were all taken by surprise after the first episode. The best part? The show stays just as good and funny throughout most of the season. \r\nThis show is funny. Like really funny. This was easily the best comedy this season, and I'll bet it'll end up as the funniest anime this year. There really isn't anything to say about the comedy in this show, besides that itwas more clever than I had thought, and that it wasn't just spouting off random jokes 24/7 just to get a good laugh 1 or 2 times. That, along with the fact that the jokes in the show were more \"universal\" is what puts this show above most comedies like it. Shows like Gintama and Lucky Star can be funny, but only if you are an otaku. This show manages to be funny without every joke feeling like an inside joke and possibly going over your head. In that regard, it felt more like a sitcom (well, one with an actual plot)instead of your usual comedy anime. But probably the most surprising thing about the show was how good the story was. \\n\\n\r\nThe story on its own won't be winning any awards or anything, but for a comedy anime I was pleasantly surprised with how good the story was. The best part and probably the icing on the cake for why I liked this show so much is because it made me laugh, had a good story, but didn't get overly dramatic like many comedies tend to do and it didn't go overboard with the romance. It is a rare gem indeed to find a show that doesn't fall into that, which is why I like this show so much.\\n\\n\r\n But it isn't all gumdrops and ice cream for this show.If I had to point out its flaws, I'd say that the story could get a little side tracked at times, and some episodes just weren't as funny as others. There was an episode or 2 between the two arcs, which weren't as good as the rest of the show, and there was a generic beach episode that wasn't very good either (the beach episode was funny though). I also find it weird that the show never mentions why the Satan himself became such a good person. Honestly, after watching the show I completely forgot he was evil. I suppose it's because he is smart, and acting evil at his job would cause him to get fired, but it doesn't explain all his actions in the show. It isn't the most consistent comedy you'll ever see, but it is one of the few that could make you laugh dozens of times an episode while still having an interesting plot. I should also point out that it had a good ending, and since the last \"arc\" ended the previous episode, nothing felt rushed or anything and it felt like a normal day.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I liked them all, so I don't have any complaints here. Most of the cast didn't get any real development or anything, but I think it is better off like that otherwise it could have gotten too serious for my liking. Besides, these characters will make you laugh every episode, do you really need to know their life story? Admittedly some characters were better than others (Alciel was the funniest character IMO), but they all have their moments and none of them hinder the show in any way. \\n\\n\r\nThe production values on this show were also good, but nothing out of his world. The score in the show was pretty good, and I liked how it sounded very exotic at times (it felt like music you would hear on Ente Isla). The animation was very smooth, so I have no complaints there either. I would like to mention the faces the characters make throughout the show, as they are some of the funniest expressions I have seen in an anime. Honestly I haven't seen expressions that funny since GTO. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked this show a lot, as it was one of the more clever comedies I have seen (hell at times it was even too clever for me). But what really makes it stand out is how it doesn't fall into the traps that other comedy anime tend to fall into like melodrama and cheesy romance. It's a show that stayed true to it's roots, and thats why I'm giving it such a good score. It deserved it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict (86/100) - Watch it if you want something very funny, that doesn't go overboard with the drama and romance. It's also a good start for someone who hasn't watched much anime and wouldn't get the otaku jokes in other comedy series.",

            "content": "In a distant fantasy world far far away, a malevolent demon Overlord is about to conquer all of humanity. His armies butcher humans and burn the countryside, sparing no one and spreading fear and horror across the land. Humanity's last hope comes in the form of a Hero of no equal, raised in virtual secrecy. After countless struggles the righteous human armies, led by said Hero, push back at the demon armies and eventually corner the Overlord in his own castle, forcing him to flee the battle along with his chief strategist. The Overlord gives a foreboding warning that they will return before jumping througha portal to... modern day Japan. There, the former villains find themselves faced with even greater challenges- chariots that move by themselves, a culture filled with abstruse rules, mana that can no longer be replenished, and endless burgers to cook and serve. Just as the pair seems to have established a small beachhead in this foreign land, they find that they are not alone. Others from Ente Isla have followed in their wake, and among them is the very Hero that drove them out.\\n\\n\r\nMaou Sama is a hilarious twist to the fantasy world portal genre. This somewhat action-oriented show is like a cross between the cultural humor in Outbreak Company, the too-lazy-to-be-a-hero fantasy elements from Yusibu, and some plot elements and protagonist traits from Blood Lad. The story is very straightforward and falls into the tasteful shonen category, and surprising stays mostly out of harem territory. If you're looking for a solid watch with a bit of fantasy and magic, this is a pretty good one- for veterans and newcomers alike.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation quality is pretty good overall. The show has a fairly saturated color palette with softly drawn lines and fair backgrounds. The overall treatment is a bit uneven as certain scenes have great lighting and detail while others appear more plain. You get a good mix of flashback scenes in Ente Isla so I'd say the setting is 2/3 mega city and 1/3 fantasy land. Character designs are pretty decent, starting with the hilarious demon capes that the Japanese police immediately dismiss as cosplay. They do a good job at some of the finer details as well, the former Overlord and our protagonist Maou Sadao has demonic red eyes and snake-like pupils, which surprisingly don't look all that menacing when attached to a dude in a burger joint uniform. Hilariously, the buff, miasma-emitting bodies of the demons are reduced to those of ordinary humans when stripped of their mysterious mana source, thus our protagonist (aside from his eyes) ends up looking like any other harem male lead.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a fair number of fights as well as accidents (most of them involving slippery stairs). While not choreographed to the level of a full on action thriller, expect some nice effects and decent intensity (and massive collateral damage). This series surprisingly didn't go the harem route so don't expect too much ecchi aside from the now mandatory comparison between girls' bust sizes and swimsuit episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with a fitting light-action OP that reminds me a bit of Infinite Stratos. The melody isn't that great but it works nonetheless. The main ED is much slower and has a chorus that brings up vibes from Sankarea's ED; this is probably one of Nano Ripe's less annoying songs. The BGM is passable but nothing special and likewise for sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is pretty experienced with both heroine VAs doing a pretty good job in their respective roles. I also found Ente Isla's language particularly humorous, and there are surprisingly a lot of tongue-twisted lines in that fantasy language (though conveniently enough the Hero's flashbacks are in Japanese). The antagonists are a bit too obviously voiced though; you practically can guess deceit just from the voice. Overall a pretty run of the mill sound effort.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is where I was a bit surprised, pleasantly. Maou, for whatever reason, decides that this new world called Earth is pretty interesting and sets his ambitions to conquer it along with Ente Isla. However, in an un-demonic fashion he decides to do so playing by the rules of the land, by working his way up the corporate ladder of a Mc Donald's clone chain. Thus, the most feared being in one world is turned into the employee of the month at your local fast food stop. The degradation in stature doesn't end there, as we soon find that the Hero is likewise reduced to working at a call center. It was quite unique seeing the two clash while trying to maintain their professional lives and barely scrounge by with an impoverished lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows a central plot line with occasional introductions of new characters and antagonists. The actual battles and events are fairly predictable (it is shonen after all) but still enjoyable nonetheless. The story grows to an eventual climax, which actually feels unnaturally forced in my opinion, and finishes with a touching deja vu of an earlier sequence in the show. It's fairly open ended but still satisfying enough. Best of all, the show does a pretty good job of tidying up corners, explaining most of the would-be plot questions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMaou may resemble your typical harem lead, but he acts nothing like it. He's a surprisingly reliable and hard-working individual who puts the success of his workplace and coworkers before himself. Likewise, the Hero, is not what you expect either. She is clumsy, quick to anger, and surprisingly spiteful. Thus, the show does a good job of separating the protagonists from the usual stereotypes. There is also comic and playfully romantic relief in the form of Chiho, Maou's coworker. There is a decent amount of development with all the above characters but viewers hoping for a Maou-Yuusha route will be stymied (sadly).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the other supporting characters are more of your standard fare business. In particular, I don't think Lucifer and Suzuno were developed to their full potential, especially considering how prominent their roles were at various plot points. And Olba... there's no way you could get a more stereotypical antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThough the show comes across as predictable, it is a solid work for its genre nonetheless and a very easy watch. It doesn't have much in rewatch value due to its simplicity but it is thoroughly enjoyable for both plot involvement and character interactions. If you're looking for a relatively light action/comedy, this is a good choice. Grab a seat and maybe a burger and enjoy!",

            "content": "Do you ever wonder what it'd be like if a dark lord or SATAN HIMSELF came into our world and worked part-time at a fast food restaurant that totally isn't based off McDonalds? Well this anime shows what it''d be like. Hataraku Maou-sama (The Devil is a Part-timer in English) is a spring 2013 anime and if you like slice of life, comedy anime then this anime is for you. Anyway, let's get into the review.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThis anime is a slice of life anime, so there isn't really much of a story to it. However, there is some kind of story as in it givesa bit of detail about the devil, what he does and where he lives. However, while it does talk about the stuff that happens in the world the devil and the other characters (except Chiho, who lives on Earth) live in, I feel that it doesn't go into depth enough. It was certainly interesting, but i feel that it could've given more of a background story of the characters and their lives in the crazy world they live in. While does give a bit of a background story about Emilia \"The Hero) when it shows her as a child, her being recruited and then her village being burnt down by the devil's army, I would've liked to see more of what it was like for her growing up. Did she find training hard at first? Did she ever lose any battles she regrets losing? You know, that kind of stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the other characters too, we're given no information about their lives in this crazy world. While i did enjoy watching it and I know it's just a slice of life anime, in this situation it would've been nice to give a good backstory for all the characters. Heck, maybe even tell us more about Chiho. I'm interested in the Church, who in a way are made out to be the bad guys and crazy. I'm also interested in the different islands and the people on them. Do they get along? Is there any tension? Maybe I'm looking too much into this but when it's a fantasy world similar to those of KonoSuba or Re:Zero, then I want to see a good backstory explaining things. i want to get to know the characters more. I did enjoy what the anime gave us though, I just feel it could've been added to.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime was animated by the studio called White Fox, who have also animated Re:Zero. While I do like Re:Zero's animation better and I've seen shows animated better that this one, I still think the animation was good, especially in some bits where it's really good, such as Chiho's jealousy causing her to get angry at Satan. The characters are cute (particularly Chiho) and look nice. Everything else is done nicely too. It's just nice, simple animation and I'm happy with what I saw. Not amazing but certainly not bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI found this anime very pleasant to listen to, whether that be the background music, the opening and ending or just general things like the characters talking. Non of them had some overly \"cute\", squeaky voice (looking at you English dubs for anime!) and the opening and ending songs, while forgettable, were good, although they're not something I'd listen to over and over again like the opening and endings for New Game or Nichijou. The background music was pretty good and nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nLike i said before, the characters were cute and I found them all hilarious. Each character has their own backstory and is unique in a way, although like i said before, i feel their backstory wasn't explored enough. They were still interesting and funny characters though. Some people might say Chiho was just fan service because of her large boobs but I disagree. Yes, she has large boobs and she's cute but there's more to her than that. She was still an important part of the show. It's a slice of life anime though, so fan service is acceptable as long as the character still has good things about them and reasons to like them other than \"they're sexy\", like Rem from Re:Zero or Mikasa from Attack on Titan. Like I mentioned before, the characters are all unique, funny and likeable. It's a shame that this show doesn't have a 2nd season and that not much of a backstory was given for these undoubtedly interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much and there weren't any moments were I started feeling bored or annoyed. It made me laugh every episode (especially the funny language that is spoken in Satan's world) and I'd definitely watch a season 2. It's a nice slice of life, comedy anime and I got what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI give this anime an 8/10 rating. While it does have some flaws, they are minor and luckily did not effect the humour or quality of this very good anime. Like I said before, I enjoyed it very much and I think you'll probably enjoy it too if you like slice of life, comedy anime. If you're new to this genre or even new to anime, then I don't think this anime is a bad place to start.",

I think it's one of the few harem anime that doesn't involve school. The story talks about the demon lord destroying the human world, then came the hero. They fought and she wounded him because she was a little bit stronger that what he expected. In order not to loose,he had to flee so him and one of his right hand man fled to our realm. But one thing was miscalculated they really use magic on our realm so even the great demon lord and the hero that followed we're just ordinary people here....... In a place where you have to work before you can eat. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good my precise remark would  be (8.5/10). Even if you wouldn't like any thing in this anime, I assure you would like the art. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty normal to me, nothing outstanding and because the story\\n\r\n wasn't really outstanding, it didn't affect the bad it had. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were likeable they made sure of that because you wouldn't know the side you want to be on... The hero or the demon lord. They were always dragging you to the next scene and since you like the characters, you wouldn't want to miss it. Making you to almost never get bored of watching the anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to say because I enjoyed it so will you.... That's highly unlikely it's just that I enjoyed it and I'm pretty sure you will too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for my overall, it's (8/10). There was really nothing flashy about the anime the story was good but apart from that nothing to make it stand out from others...... Everything was just normal.",

It was truly enjoyable with great humour mixed in with an interesting storyline. \r\nStory: 9\r\nI loved the story for Hataraku. The basic premise was interesting enough for somebody to try out the show. As the story progresses, there are enough mysteries for the viewer to continue watching till the end. The comedic aspect of the show was amazing. This show finds a way to brighten up almost any moment.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe art for Hataraku was done quite well. The visuals were quite colourful, and a joy to watch. I particularly liked the design of Maouand Ashiya in their respective demon forms. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a brilliant job portraying their characters. The opening  and ending songs were both quite nice to listen to. It's always a joy to find good anime opening and endings. The only problem I had was the soundtrack. It was nothing spectacular and really not something I would remember. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters were amazing! All of the characters were a joy to watch, and all had their amazing comedic moments. Ashiya was my favourite character, as his dedication to Maou was truly enjoyable. It would also be funny to see how Ashiya would react whenever he was unable to help Maou. Every single character was extremely interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI had a really fun time watching this anime, and truly enjoyed it. It was entertaining from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5\\n\r\nThis was one fun anime. It was quite funny with a very interesting story. Something different from many of the other anime's I've seen. The characters were amazing and this is truly worth a watch.",

            "content": "Story\r\nWhen it comes down to it, The Devil is a Part Timer manages to present some good ideas and scenarios, but is so caught up in its fictional world of Ente Isla that it falls apart and becomes less of the slice-of-life/comedy it should have been and more of an uninteresting action show. In fact, by the end it almost feels like it\u2019s become a harem anime. The Devil is a Part Timer doesn\u2019t know what it wants to be and suffers because of it.\r\nThe plot starts in Ente Isla where the Dark Lord Satan and his army is ravaging the lands and mercilessly killingpeople. There is a church and an inquisition and God and all kinds of other fun religious stuff, though none of it is fleshed out much because before you can get a feel for this fantasy world, you\u2019re in Tokyo where Satan\u2014calling himself Maou\u2014has become an employee at a McDonalds. These slice-of-life portions in which Satan is acting like a normal human are entertaining and rife with good comedic moments. The romance between a high school girl working at the McDonalds and Satan is a good thread for the series to run with, which you\u2019d hope would develop characters and push the story, but the romance, sadly, is put on the backburner.\\n\\n\r\nInstead the series focuses more on various characters from Ente Isla coming to Tokyo to cause problems. This should have been expected from the beginning, but there is no build-up to this happening. By the time Lucifer shows up, you\u2019re expecting the series to be centered on Satan, his loyal servant Ashiya, and Emi the Hero. The series falls apart at this point and never truly recovers. It goes back to slice-of-life, goes to action portions, cuts back to Ente Isla for some reason. It\u2019s such a mish-mash that it\u2019s hard to find one aspect truly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing the series does do right and I could pick out of the mess of ideas was the comedy. The series remained pretty funny throughout, though much of the comedy came from one specific character. And I guess the idea of angels and devils working for fast food chains is pretty hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not enough going on in the story and writing to truly give the series much credit.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nGood animation throughout with pretty good character models and richly detailed backgrounds. The fight scenes are pretty fluid as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening song is really catchy and all the other music certainly wasn\u2019t bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nDespite the large cast, none truly stand out from their respective counterparts. Emi is a good tsundere character and I enjoyed her development as she slowly grows to like Maou. She still calls him her rival and treats him like garbage much of the time, but there\u2019s steady development that I would love to see more of. The other romance, between Maou and Chiho, is cute, though one sided and ultimately not satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nAshiya is the only other character really worth mentioning because he\u2019s the character who makes the series funny. His constant frugality and going home to get his cloak before appearing at a big battle is hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are forgettable and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe Devil is a Part Timer contains a lot of good ideas and scenarios but fails to create a cohesive bond between many of them and, because of that, fails to deliver anything solid. The comedy is worthwhile and a few of the characters are interesting, but everything else is flat, generic, and ultimately unmemorable. I can\u2019t even write a real in-depth review because the show itself doesn\u2019t have much depth. I enjoyed some of it, but the rest is easily forgotten.",

            "content": "I went into Hataraku Maou-Sama with some pretty low expectations, because in hindsight it\u2019s the basic tried and done fish-out-of-the-water formula filled with clich\u00e9s and try-hard humor. Instead, when I started, I was pleasantly surprised by colorful characters energetically bouncing off of each other, witty dialogue and fantastic comedic timing. At the same time Hataraku told a strong story that progressed quite well and perfectly kept its balance with the comedic aspects.\r\nSo it\u2019s unfortunate for me to say that after episode five, Maou-Sama failed to hold up with its preceding episodes.\r\nNot that it was downright awful, but episodes started ranging from really clever to reallynot-so clever. It lost its consistent quality and it lost a lot of its charm. Characters, while given strong characterization, were never given any real development and eventually became a mixed bag of like and dislike. Maou, Ashiya and Lucifer remained quite entertaining to watch, but Emi\u2019s animosity and irrational anger grew old, Chiho\u2019s infatuation with Maou grew annoying and Suzuno\u2026 well, she was quite generic and stale from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot progression was thrown under the bus, and while the climax itself was incredibly well executed, the lead up itself was awful. The perfect balance between comedy and serious story telling was immediately tilted over to comedic side and it was almost as if the writers lost interest in trying to tell a genuine story. By the end, it was almost as if the writers forgot that the show needed a conclusion and so they just tossed in a climax.\\n\\n\r\nNo build up, no nothing and instead I had to endure some pretty bland filler episodes. Yeah, the McRonald/Sentucky rivalry was actually quite hilarious, but every other filler played out generically and it completely went against what made Maou-Sama a fun show in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things I admire that Maou-Sama keeps consistent throughout the whole series. The first one is the fact that Maou-Sama actually makes use of its characters and setting its joke. Too many comedies fail simply because they don\u2019t see the creative elements eagerly waving their arms right in front of their eyes. Instead they pull their jokes out of thin air and I appreciate that Maou-Sama avoids this mistake.\\n\\n\r\nThe second one is the fact that Maou-Sama always has a great sense of comedic timing, no matter how stupid the jokes, and I also applaud that.\\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize, the show starts and ends really, really well, but it\u2019s plagued by a lackluster middle. Overall, I\u2019d still have to say that I did enjoy the show. There were more high highs than low lows and if you can tolerate those low lows, then I would recommend this as a comedy.",

            "content": "Before I even talk about the specifics, I would like to say one thing. All of these are my own beliefs and I do not expect anyone to completely agree with them or agree with them at all. But as a person who have watched almost all genre of anime, and countless number of shows (I do not really feel like adding all to my profile), I believe my opinion may help someone who has trouble deciding Hataraku Maou-snama! is worth their time or not. \r\nStory:\r\nThe show does not try to stay comical or try to stay serious the whole time.It tries to maintain thebalance of comedy and drama but it doesn't work out. By not focusing on either one, it dilutes the drama and the comedy when it happens. Because of this factor, it was not able to create a solid story line, but gave general ideas each time something happened. In the end, the story line was not satisfactory, and the viewers are left with feeling as if something is missing. But this does NOT necessarily mean that the show is bad. There are other shows that doesn't have an overarching story that ends up good. Even though the end product was dis satisfactory, I do not believe the producers went for a show too serious, which makes the lack of story a little understandable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters are absolutely confusing at times.\\n\\n\r\n(There will be some spoilers for this part. But the most if not all of them are revealed in the first two or three episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a few main characters that just blows my mind. The Overlord, a.k.a. Satan, is projected as the evil being that slaughtered and destroyed anything that lay before him if it got in his way. Well he is for the first one minute anyways. As soon as he enters the human realm, he becomes the ultimate good guy. THERE IS NO LOGIC. Even his ruthless right wing general turns into a good guy. The show tries to pin this on the fact that they have lost their powers, but i'll go out on a limb and say SATAN, who was responsible for the death of millions, will just bow down and serve the humans he despised. Not only serving them, but going out of his way to save them. The show does occasionally reminds the viewers that he is Satan, but it doesn't matter because he is still acting like the HERO of the show. But lets say I can accept the fact that Satan turned into a good guy. How about the fact that servants of Gods (Priests, believers, and ANGELS) suddenly decided to commit sin for glory and profit? Some might argue it shows the corruption behind modern religion. But the general image of God and his followers are GOOD. The show throws that concept right out the window and makes them the bad guys. Honestly, the weird character personalities would have been acceptable if they didn't start out with Satan's army killing everything.\\n\\n\r\n(end of spoiler)\\n\\n\r\nThe problems do not end here. The characters are flat. There is little to no character development making some situations far too predictable. Most characters feel like copies from other shows. One positive thing I have to say is the fact that their lack of depth made it easier to fit in with random episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe review makes it sound like you cannot enjoy the show. But in reality, it can be. Someone who only enjoys heavy story lines might not, but for someone who want entertainment by watching only one or two episodes, its great. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nPersonally, I would. Though it lacks in story and character, it can be easily accessible to any type of viewers. Hardcore or not, you will get some kind of a kick out of it. But looking at the show with hard,cold facts, I wouldn't recommend it if you want something serious.",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-Sama is a good choice for you if you enjoy generic modern anime releases, basically the same exact characters plastered over with a different concept for the story. The concept of the show is an interesting one, which is basically the opposite of the traditional \"humans get sent into a magic world where they involve themselves in it out of a sense of duty and out of a thirst of adventure\". Basically, a bunch of demons escape to the human world where they start living as humans, and grow out of magic and terrorizing and start enjoying the comfortable life Earth has to offer.(Except they weren't even that demonic to begin with)\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept me interested in the anime was the concept and nothing else. But while it had an interesting concept, sure, it didn't explore it as much as they could through more depth to its characters and rather went with generic personalities for the characters in the show. Basically the types of characters you encounter in most new anime releases nowadays, some token average guy that looks like Kirito from Sword Art Online as the MC, but I have to give them some credit that at the very least the averageness of this guy makes sense because being average is part of a comfortable life so it makes sense they would use this type of character for this concept. What doesn't make sense is why the fuck didn't they develop on why the Demon Lord would have this personality, why he would act this way. Next up, some token tsundere who is comedically mistaken to be in a relationship with her archrival which is, really funny, we're all laughing. She calls herself hero because, yeah. Also make her a redhead, because yeah, exactly. Some girl who's whole personally is that she has a crush on the main character, she's a klutz and she has huge tits, because plot. Some overly loyal underling to the MC who's personality is \"#CutForMC\". And some villains that after they get defeated they're around and they're completely inoffensive and they simply, just change because, they were defeated so them being villains doesn't serve the story any purpose, so might as well make them gag characters.  Basically, the cast of every anime ever. Hell, the series is so generic that you'll encounter the generic \"beach\" episode, but in this situation the \"beach\" is an amusement park I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I can tell you about the story is that it does delve in the backstory of some characters but for some it doesn't at all. You don't have enough details about any of the demons and what exactly they've done and why they've done it and you're only left to wonder. There's no real clear villain, I mean, maybe the church but there's so little focus on the church they feel like total scrubs and nobody will really care much about them.  Any conflict is there just to be there. And once it gets solved it's like it never happened. The only result of the conflict itself is new characters and that's about it. If that doesn't generic I don't know what does. So due to the fact that some characters have backstory while others have none of theirs revealed it will leave you wonder exactly what happened and why they're holding back to the extent they are now and stuff like that. Like, motherfucker, he is the demon lord, he is supposed to have killed plenty of people and be treacherous. And you see him flipping burgers and you're like, he must be a kindhearted soul after some episodes? In the end, the story is basically, a guy works at McDonalds and generic characters happen. There's not much depth about anything there and every conflict falls lackluster and the character's motivations and actions are questionable. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is also generic, it's basically what you'd expect from any new anime release and looks like basically every new anime ever. I'll give them some credit in the design that they have the characters talk in a different language from every language but, it sounds... as far from a language as possible. It sounds like reversed japanese if anything with weird accentuation. It goes all over the place. Otherwise the show sounds as you'd expect any other anime to sound, but that custom language will pop out sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, if you like to watch generic anime which were made with the mindset of \"it sells\", then you will probably enjoy this anime since at the very least its very idea is I suppose original. But otherwise, there's not much else to see. If you don't like the \"if it sells it's good\" type of anime, by all means, avoid this. I'd say there was some potential to the show, but, its execution falls short so it can sell off.",

In addition, its a hilarious anime and NEVER gets boring. The characters could not be more likeable considering that they are all differently portrayed and develop very strongly throughout the series.\r\nThe most interesting aspect of the show is how all of the main characters have a unique relationship to the main character Sadao Maou (Satan), whether it be love (Chiho), hatred (Emilia), or anything between. The plot always goes in a natural direction as well, with every episode keeping the viewerinterested in what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for humorous, but also inspiring show. I\u2019d call Hataraku Maou-sama not only one the best of 2013 animes so far, but darn-right one of the most flawless animes of all time!",

            "content": "solid comedy with an amazing level of back story and good steady character development. This show balanced comedy with serious moral questions and a little drama in a very smooth way, not many shows do that well, most stick to being primarily one thing or another, like a comedy where they might have a serious episode or story arc over a couple episodes but sticks to comedy the rest of the time, very few writers have the skill to mix and balance a serious overall plot with a show that has episodic short sub plots and a gag comedy front. The devil is a parttimer pulls this off though. You get the best of both worlds, each episode has a feeling of conclusion for that days antics, but you advance the main plot a little and want to see more, and the jokes keep a light tone to balance against the honestly morbid history and background of the characters involved. Overall, a very enjoyable series.\\n\r\nNow, on to specifics:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nWhile not fresh or terribly unique, it's solid and well written.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6.5\\n\r\nThe quality is on par with the majority of titles released at that time, it's decent, not outstanding, but not lacking in any way. Overall I rate it fair to good, but nothing stands out to give it more than that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nWhile nothing stood out as being badly done, the music and sound effects felt generic, nothing in the way of memorable\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nOf course, as with many anime, the characters all fall into one of the many steryotypical architectures. They have a little unique flare here and there, but their personality types have all been seen before. The real treat here is the way they play off each other, and how the types are grouped up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI nearly put this at an 8, this show was very enjoyable as far as it went, but the way it just cuts off and ends with nothing in the way of a conclusion leaves you hanging.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5\\n\r\nThis needed one more season, it really did, the last episode wasn't even a proper ending, it just felt like another mid season episode. There was plenty of plot left, character development to go through, and history to explore, but none of that happened. It's obvious this was written intending far more, at a minimum another 12 to 13 episodes, but it didn't get there. A continuation would bump the first seasons score up to a solid 7 or better, but the way were left with a completely unsatisfying lack of resolution hurts the score pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nReally, it was a good show, and I had hoped for more, but as it stands, I am left somewhat conflicted. I enjoyed watching, I wanted to come away maintaining that feeling of enjoyment, but it was half done, so that enjoyment has been overshadowed by disappointment since a second season is clearly not happening. Still worth watching, but know up front that if you do like it, you will not find satisfaction in the end.\\n",

Going from laughing, to crying, to awesome fight scenes...what more can you ask for? I thought at first that the breathtaking art in the initial episode was an anomaly for a slice of life anime but oh boy, it's only a portent of things to come. If people want to ask me why I watch anime, THIS is what I'll show them. It's hard to imagine this story coming together in any other format besides anime. \r\nThe character development and pacing are especially crispin this. They cut out all the crap that makes a series drag on, such as awkward getting to learn new surroundings episodes that you can already guess what's gonna happen. It seriously never drags, and the story moves along at a brisk space. The team did a really good job of picking out the best scenes to make you invested in characters. I felt interested in most of the characters even though they've only been in the series for two episodes. Sure, there are plot elements that, looking back on it now, seem a bit deus ex machina-ish, but really didn't seem that way in the flow of things because they helped expedite development within and between the characters. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is mostly so-so. It's your typical anime OST stuff...it really doesn't belie how awesome its accompanying show is. But you really don't notice because everything else catches your attention enough. \\n\\n\r\nThey also end it in absolutely the most perfect way it could have. That's not something I can say for even some of my favorite shows in the past.\\n\\n",

The notion of fantastical characters forced to endure mundane lives.

The work of a man reveling in work rather than suffering from it. There are core weaknesses however, which prevent it becoming the all time hit it could have been. Story structure being number one, pacing number two. \r\nYet more often thannot, the sheer joyousness of the occasion is what counts. Hence this time at least, youth wins out over experience.

This anime makes me nostalgic for things I've never experienced.\r\nThe story moves at a perfect speed. Every episode is full of perfectly timed jokes that you might see in a top notch comedy series.\r\nThe whole anime is we designed, but the character art is stunning. There actually isn't anything remarkable about the art except for the character colors. Something about it didn't let me pull my eyes away.\r\nThere is nothing remarkable about the sound engineering.\r\nEverycharacter was designed and portrayed perfectly. Loved the voices, loved the character development, loved everything.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a cross between a slice of life anime and an action anime with a comedic foundation. I want to relate this to Noragami, but Noragami has emotional weight that likens to the size of ... something huge. You know the part before the opening on Noragami? That part with the little joke? That's this series.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best comedy anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "This review includes some minor spoilers pertaining to whether some characters get together. I have labeled some sections in this review if you wish to jump to certain points.\r\n\u2022 Summary\r\nI enjoyed Hataraku as a whole, however it didn't hold up as much as I was hoping, earning the five I've given it. It was lacking plot-wise, but had some good backstory and moments in the show. It starts off promising, with the start setting up the premise well, keeping me amused while containing lots of interesting lore and backstory. It did not keep that up, to my disappointment. If you are going into this showhoping for anything past some funny jokes and scenarios, don't. Hataraku is a bunch of fluff with some interesting lore, along with amusing moments and drip-fed hints of plot sprinkled throughout that just barely get you to the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Story/Plot\\n\\n\r\nPlot is very lacking from this show. The first half or so of the season was a good time, containing many amusing moments and drawing me in with interesting backstory and good characters. It's rather a shame, because it goes through a bit of a dry spell story-wise in the middle of the show, and I had to take a short break due to boredom, before coming back refreshed. Once I had slogged through the dry spell, I was hoping Hataraku would pull me back in with some good character development or story continuation. But the end of the show completely lacks any resolutions at all. The final episode was basically just yet another fluff piece for ninety-percent of it, with a very slight bit of story in there. In the end, the antagonists were kind of defeated but not really, and even if we consider them properly defeated, Ente Isla still had plenty of other enemies that could come through a gate easily. \\n\\n\r\nThis is listed as a romance, but no relationships are ever formed. The primary possible romantic partner, Chiho, clearly likes the main character, Maou. That's all fine and dandy, except he acts completely oblivious and the relationship goes nowhere. There is a vague implication that Maou and Emi, the Hero, could become closer in some way, but this also goes nowhere. By the end of the show no relationships have been formed what-so-ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo after watching thirteen episodes, what has changed? Well, some characters were added to the cast, but that's basically it. Maou is still in the same apartment working the same job, doing the same stuff, Emi is still in the same apartment, working the same job, doing the same stuff, Chi is still at her parents, working the same job... look, you get it. Nothing was accomplished in the entirety of the thirteen episodes. I get this is a comedy, but it gets a little old watching an entire season of nothing, as the good jokes were all used up in the first half of the show.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Characters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had some good depth overall, but they suffer from the plot never moving. The show kept teasing me with signs of Emi trying to compare the human, Maou, to the demon, Satan, and this was explored a little. But even though we had the start of this plotline it was randomly cut off by someone barging in and it never continued. So by the end, while Emi has realised that Maou is a decent person and not the evil dark lord, it was never explained why he isn't evil or if he was evil before but had an ulterior motive. This was one of the most intriuging parts of the show for me, and it even dangles it in front of me but then never continues! I am so frustrated by this fact. If it weren't for the crutch of the plot, I think these characters would really be able to shine. That never happened, however.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Other Thoughts & Wrap Up\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound were good, I never had anything to complain about, though nothing stuck out to me to make them exceptional. I doubt you will be disappointed by anything on the technical side while watching this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a bit of fun seeing a lord of demons living in modern-day Japan with no real story to speak of, this is the show for you. It wasn't bad, and it was one of the funnier shows I've seen in a while. But for me, the lack of story was just too much to properly recommend this show. I was disappointed by how the potential shown at first was squandered so thoroughly, and it was not the experience that I was hoping for after seeing the first episode. Ultimately, an average show. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Just... average.",

            "content": "The first time watching this show, I dropped it after a few episodes because I couldn\u2019t really get past the initial scenario. The distinct personality of a ruler of a world and his general was so quickly transformed into two bland mid 20s living together and adopting mundane mannerisms like being extremely frugal, or worrying about the budget or advancing his part-time job as a McDonald's worker. It was pretty jarring and the transition felt so lazily done, like the show was expecting me to just forget it or to make up something to somehow seem like this was plausible. The second time I watchedit, I ignored this detail and found that at times it could be funny, but more in \u201cWorking!!\u201d type scenarios in the workplace rather than anything to do with the main premise or quirk of the show. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the show had to go back to the initial premise of the demon lord and general being sent to the human world, it fell flat on its back. The action and drama like when he faced this demon that was sort of disrupting the human world was very b-movie like with shitty one-liners after the demon lord finally releases his power like \u201cC\u2019mon I\u2019ll be late to work.\u201d They try to fit in some drama or persecution to make the demon lord seem like a good guy and that people are just judging him because he\u2019s the demon lord but the main MC is so blase about everything and what the show is doing is so obvious that I ended up just being annoyed. Plot is just thrown around like nothing, like just something to fill up space. For example they try to go through the back story of Emilia, the hero, and it sort of gets resolved(?) with the demon lord making some sort of half-baked apology (like I think it was a few words) after hearing her pour her heart out in front of him. \\n\\n\r\n I really couldn\u2019t take it and I think the show would\u2019ve been better if they already had the demon lord in the world from a young age or maybe had him fuse with a college student during the transfer to the human world. Or maybe simply focus on the humor and working part instead of \\n\r\ntrying to do too much by also having a story. As the show is, it wasn\u2019t enjoyable and at time infuriating. \\n",

How does Lucifer a merciless general that thinks nothing of death just become a NEET with absolutely zero intention to go back to heaven? I know I'm kinda nitpicking the show, and I didn't really notice these problems while i was watching the show and I don't think that should stop you from watching it.\r\nAlsoif you watch this show, I think it's a lot better if you imagine this as the backstory of the demon king in beelzebub xD",

Sure, there were funny moments, but it felt more like a weird shounen fantasy action/romantic slice of life hybrid. \r\nWhat I expected was for the plot to revolve around the Devil working in a McDonalds. With emphasis on the workplace as the main setting and the daily shenanigans or acclimation process to be the comedy. \r\nThe dynamic between the Devil and the other characters is endearing and comedic at times, but overall The Devil is a Part Timer! is nothing to write home about. Inmy opinion it would have been more worthwhile to hone either the comedy or shounen elements to this story because I think trying to do both was a miss.",

            "content": "I'd really love to give this show an 8+... but I can't. Here's why (I'll keep it short and simple):\r\n- Comedy: very good premise and a fertile ground to have hilarious scenes. There are some which I was so excited about, but they were never exploited enough.\r\n- Characters: all so interesting in their own way, but so underdeveloped! Maou would be one of my favourite male MC if they had put more flavour into it. Maybe show us more colours, he seems so black and white! No progression from Evil to Hero - it seems like it happened overnight. The characters need more depth sowe can empathize with them.\\n\\n\r\n- Story: again, such a good premise and so underdeveloped. Even the whole Orba and Sariel plot was so... insipid. No actual build up, little context... \\n\\n\r\n- Soundtrack: I liked the soundtrack, no brilliant, but fits the story well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes one come back for the next episode? Interest, wanting to know more, wanting to enjoy the next good laugh. I finished this because I gave it one chance after another and the premise was interesting. But I was not particularly caught on it.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a 7 if 7 was \"Slight above average\". The plot is interesting, it was a nice pilot episode, I laughed a lot, but we need more scenes either developing the romance, with more comedy into them, or that develop characters and the actual story.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be waiting for the second season in hopes it will get better...",

I wasn't expecting much of the story line, but it surprisingly turned up to be something.\r\nI was intrigued that the main character was supposedly this evil guy - the devil. But he was such an ordinary man living in the modern world. Of course that is all thanks to the modern world not having much magic that the devil needed to get back to his realm. As other characters come into play throughout the episodes and more situations happen, it's really ironic how it ended up to be more of a \"life lesson-type thing\" because it's moralswith the devil? Haha.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't much else to it - just something simple and to the point most of the time. But it was definitely enough to make a pretty good anime. It was just a fun one.",

            "content": "If Dante from Devil May Cry has a child, or let's just imagine if Satan was in fact a cool guy in person, then meet Maou Sadao.\r\nHataraku Maou-Sama! or The Devil is a Part Timer, is a 90% Slice-of-Life, 10% Action anime that focuses about the daily life of the Demon King, Satan, who forces to give up the battle against Emilia the Hero and went to the present day, Japan. At first, he wanted to rule the world starting in Japan, but his evil plan suddenly came to stop as Satan... or Maou Sadao in Japanese Name, changes his life as he started towork at MgRonalds, and met so many friends in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe title says it all, The Devil is a Part Timer, was at first, a dark story about the devils against the group of good guys and angels and the churches and the priests to stop the devil's primary objective... To rule the whole Ente Isla. But, thanks to a woman's bravery named, Emilia the Hero, the Devil named Satan and his sidekick, Alsiel, left Ente Isla to take a little breathing.\\n\\n\r\nBut, when the portal lead to the present day, Tokyo, Japan, the two then started to plan something evil against the whole country and even the whole world. And their first plan, Satan... or Maou Sadao, started to work in MgRonalds as he believed that he's going to conquer the world as a part-timer. While Alsiel, or Shirou Ashiya on the other hand, is still serving the Demon King as a house... uh... househusband? That's sounds ugly to hear... Oh... let's just say he's just a Servant.... Pardon my English.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story in Hataraku Maou-sama is quite a great story though, with a lot of comedy and keeping the Slice-of-life genre a little less boring thanks to Maou Sadao's comedic approach and jokes. He somehow reminds me of Dante from Devil May Cry due to his comedy though. But as for the battle sequences here, it's not really that important here though. I mean, it's best that if they stay in the Slice-of-life rather than the short battles. Because the battles were not to memorable and they just make the battle sequences became a bit more hilarious and fun because of Maou's coolness and punchlines.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's some fan service here in other episodes as well. I'm not into those kinds of things though, because that could mess my reputation as I watch this anime. I mean, yeah, I get it, Chiho's boobs are big, and I also saw Emilia's bra on her see-through clothes thanks to her sweat. I GET IT! SHE'S FLAT WHILE CHIHO'S BOOBS IS AS THE SIZE OF A FUCKING MELONS... I GET IT!!! JUST DON'T POINT WHERE ARE THOSE CHESTS LOCATED YOU CAMERAMAN HENTAI-DESU!! (ehem)pardon my weeaboo...\\n\\n\r\nThe character development seems it's very well written here. I really do like how they changed when every episode came along. Including some of the Ente Isla heroes and villain who came to Earth and how they were drastically changed thanks to the present setting of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the language when they were on Ente Isla is the very first anime that I've seen so far to use a unique language. It kinda sounds like it came from Germany or somewhere in Europe. Also, I don't know how they could handle that, despite that they are Japanese and they are having some trouble to say it. Kudos for them.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap my review, I'd definitely recommend you guys to watch this anime. If you're not a fan of some \"Fairy Tail\" cliches, then go watch this anime. It's a very funny anime for you to watch. I guarantee it!!",

            "content": "My reviews are based on 5 major distinctions: Art, Plot, Characters, Music, and Flow.  I rate each category with a simple 3 point scale.  \r\n0 = Doesn't meet expectations\r\n1 = Meets expectations\r\n2 = Clearly exceeds Expectations\r\nIntro: Hataraku Maou-Sama! is a different style of anime that isn't based in a school format.  The story is conveyed between two separate universes interacting with each other through a portal.  A world consisting of magic in a medieval setting on one side, and modern day Japan on the other.  The anime tries to mix drama with comedy and romance.  It is difficult toachieve a balance between the three and actually achieving it would propel this show out of obscurity if done properly.  The review will now begin.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2.\\n\r\nThe drawings are well done in the background as well as the many characters that appear.  The main characters such as Maou and Emi are both drawn with great detail in their civilian clothing as well as work attire.  I enjoyed the facial expressions throughout the series since they gave the audience a sense of the atmosphere be it light hearted and comedic, or dark and full of drama.  Reading dialogue only gives us basic information.  The characters have to also show us the situation through their expressions.  The artists perfected this craft.  That is why I gave the art a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 1.\\n\r\nThe plot wasn't too interesting after reading the synopsis because it was made to look like a fantasy, action series when it actually wasn't.  I am not complaining about it now since I watched the series.  From a bystander's point of view, the story doesn't seem like it would work at being an action or drama.  The comedy doesn't come until a little later in the story and the first episode doesn't convey a light hearted atmosphere until much later.  People who would watch the series for the action or drama would get turned off after the first episode when it's almost dropped.  The comedy doesn't come until later and by then, the people watching the series for that would be almost turned off by the middle of the first episode.  I am not saying the plot is bad or anything; I am just implying that the sudden change from an action, drama to a comedy might turn some people off at first glance.  I would like to say that the rest of the series plays out very well with the jokes, and conversations through the rest of the episodes.  There are some problems that pertain to the overall plot including the portals that keep allowing people to transfer between worlds later on in the series.  There is also an issue with the goal of the story near the end when nothing happens during a few of the episodes.  With a certain goal being implied in the beginning, I wouldn't enjoy it stagnating near the end when it was almost over.  Overall, the plot is good but not great.  There could be some things that could make it better but I still enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2.\\n\r\nThe characters are the greatest aspect of this anime.  There is a wide range of personalities involved here and their conversations between one another bring out the positives as well as negatives in each one of them.  Maou's carefree attitude in one scene transitions beautifully to a hard working member of society in the next.  I consider Chiho to be comedy relief because of her boring personality.  The story uses her mainly as a love interest for our true main character.  There is nothing wrong with that since the story itself is considered a comedy, but she could have more emotions to her personality other than love.  Ashiya is another character that is used for comedy relief.  I personally love every phrase he says on the show because his jokes aren't stupid or juvenile.  Emi, our main heroine has a wide range of emotions that work pretty well for a main heroine.  She changes from a nice person to a rabid dog and back instantly as the scene requires from her and she does it flawlessly.  I enjoyed all of the conversations between her and Maou because they seemed so real.  That is the greatest thing about the characters here.  They are real and full. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 2.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both nice but not too memorable.  Most of the music during the episodes were light hearted and very Seinfeld-like.  Since the story was mainly a comedy, the songs definitely achieved their purpose.  I download the OST and listened to the songs mainly to try and examine all of them directly.  There were a couple songs that stood out but they were only played during the action scenes.  Overall, the music was nice and fitting for most of the scenes that they played over.\\n\\n\r\nFlow: 1.\\n\r\nThe story has a problem with its flow.  It transcends between light hearted to drama filled with each episode.  Most of the episodes start with a nice happy tone and beautifully end with some sort of drama.  I didn't mind that in the beginning but it began to bore me near the end of the series.  Some of the episodes didn't progress the plot at all and felt like a filler.  The entire story seemed to change from one episode to another and that could be considered off putting by some people. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed this anime even with some of the faults that I found with it.  The jokes and conversations between the characters were brilliantly written and spoken through the entire series.  The plot left something to be desired but still kept it's importance on one major aspect, comedy.  The drama interchanged with the comedy quickly and beautifully.  The art was done perfectly as well with each character drawn well enough to not notice any discrepancies.  The music gave us the atmosphere for each scene whether it was supposed to be light hearted or filled with drama.  The flow had some issues towards the end but ended on a perfect note.  I enjoyed this anime a lot and will re-watch it again when it comes out on DVD.\\n",

            "content": "HAHAHA Now this is a new idea i never thought i would see a Demon King working at a local McRonalds. Well let start the review.\r\nStory: Now this is always the big one for me in every anime, so the Story is about SPOILER!! \r\nA Demon King that is trying to rule the whole world and the hero (emila) tries to stop she does and he retreats to modern day Japan and live a normal life there till the hero finds him again. Yep never seen a story like that. So back to the topic the Story was funny there was a little romance formingbetween the hero and the Demon King what else...oh a love triangle and all that stuff we love, all i can say it was a good plot not too rushed like (SAO) but it was a short ride rating for story is 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: OUTSTANDING!! I say that with a posed look ;) the art was nice and colorful with no white paper girls and no oops the eyes are uneven no this was great so artist and manga makers look at this and say in aw \" This is what it means to draw\" rating 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to talk about with so all i can say the soundtrack was nice made me want to dance for once you know? rating 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now every anime always has an annoying character but this anime makes you love those annoying ones cause you cant have the story without and annoying character. There development there pasts were all used to help us know how they feel now why they are what they are and how they developed after moving to an unknown world so rating 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I say anyone who like laughs romance and some action must watch this it keep you wanting more you can not go a night without finding out what happened next. So with that i say i found it enjoyable that i can sit down and wait for season 2.rating of 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: With that said this series is in my top 10 of favorites that came out of 2013 can't wait until a second season is confirmed. Rating 9/10",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama!, a pretty good comedy anime, probably one of the tops for the spring season of 2013. I first watched this anime when my friend said that the main female character wants the main male character's D. I was hyped in a matter of seconds. As a result, I decided to dedicate my god-like, ethereal, divine, holistic, precious time to watch this thing. If you want to pursue McDonalds as your career, i suggest you watCH this. \r\nGenres:\r\n1) Comedy: The comedy in this anime is marvelous, you cannot not laugh at least once in an episode unless you fell asleep at the first minute(not likely). The transition of being compelled to accommodate in an unknown realm from yours and different world means that it is almost definite that struggling to cope with the current modality and being transferred into a new world is what makes Hataraku enjoyable and most fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\n2) Romance: The romance in this anime is not on par to the comedy however, there are signs of some decent potential romance but sadly sometimes ruined by the frequent added comedy throughout an episode which denies any possible further romance, to the point Emi wants Maou's D. Hard to achieve, but worth achieving and living for. There are many bonds and relationships evident in Hataraku and so no relationships or ships are predictable. The relationships of Ashiya, Maou, Chiho, Emi, Urushihara and Suzuno all develop and interlink, to the point where we cry when Emi does not get the D off of Maou. \\n\\n\r\n3) Action/Fantasy: The action is quite superb and the animation of the fight scenes are so good it makes you suck 17 Ds in one second, i mean so good it makes you feel like you are watching some 3D thing. Also, the world of this anime is really unique, demons and the demonic world coexist with  humans and Earth. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: A very good anime for its comedy and just by looking at this review, i assume you have shted bricks already. The hype!",

Every episode left me wanting for more. By the time I finished, I just realized how much time I used up haha.\r\nStory (9/10)/ Enjoyment (10/10)\r\nJust a few episodes in just got me hooked in. Every episode left me curious (heh hyouka reference) that I would just simply keep watching. Hataraku's comedic sense just amazed me. I found myself laughing in every episode. However, there are those cliche parts, but not every anime is perfect. \r\nArt/Sound (9/10)\r\nThe artwork andsound are perfectly fine. Nothing that I know of annoyed me when I was watching it. The sound is placed correctly to the point that I was able to foreshadow something funny, epic, etc. The artwork is pretty cute and hilarious at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nIt's hard for me to not spoil this part xD. Anyways, a demon king turns into an ordinary human. Think about it, how would he react? Well watch it lol. The character development is so.. sudden, and that is not a bad thing. It provides comedic sense and just fits in with the amusing storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Hataraku. It contains a great storyline which fits in the character development. The Art and Sound are created nicely with the story. These aspects makes Hataraku a wonderful anime to watch as I watched all the episodes in one sitting xD.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading~\\n\\n",

This anime is full of comedy and surprises such as how someone who gets what he wants by force is now working to pay taxes! Even though he is a demon king.  it shows how being a human being can change someones heart. It represents our hard work and humanity, that we must all take responsibility of ourselves and our actions, and how one must notjudge a book by it's cover. Later on in the anime, the most reliable people and people who didn't need help at all now start to realize that you really can't do everything on your own, no matter who you are, how you were born, what particular raise or bloodline you are, it's never enough to be alone and self-relying. the anime shows how an old rivalry now becomes a comedic love-hate of friendship, but now the demon king realizes that everything he does it's now his responsibility to take care of it, and how being human can mold your heart. If you like  magic and partially romance, comedy and inspiring anime, this is truly one for you. - RxR",

            "content": "This series caught me by surprise, and within the first episode I was caught up in a world of comedy, demons, and the struggles of the real world.\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! Is about a world known as Ente Isle, where to us humans, exist all what we see as fiction, this includes demons,angels, and magic. The Demon Lord known as The Overlord Satan seeks to widen his empire, but is soon pushed back by a hero, Emilia who is half human and angel. Using her sacred powers, and her sword, The Better-Half, Maou (The Overlord Satan) is forced to retreat with his subordinate Ashiya. Together they landin Japan to find themselves stranded, broke,and powerless. Maou must now learn to live in the human world as a model citizen to survive. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story IMO completely depends on the characters, it isn't an anime with a major overbearing plot that everything revolves around, but one that revolves around the characters, and their actions. So including the characters, I'll have to say that the story progressed quite nicely, this anime wasn't entirely a shounen, romance based, yet, in another point of view, a comedy based on Maou's struggles in Japan. The characters were all introduced quite nicely and each were provided with their own background information, none at all were too overbearing. The main reason this anime thrives is the interactions the characters have with each other. Starting from Maou, the ex-ruler of Ente Isle, but still the Overlord known as Satan, is a slightly oblivious, yet cunning, and powerful character. As the main character, he fills his role quite well in this slice of life themed anime. The comedy that ensues around Maou because of his peculiar personality that I cannot relate to many other anime allows for laughs to occur. Along with Maou, his trusty subordinate, Ashiya, his loyalty to Maou,and concern for their financial affairs in the human world also allow for good plot development in their social standings, and also supports Maou, which in turn affects the character development that happens to both of them. A standard character development of dramatic characters is seen, which is, \"the evil bad boy gets soft and kind\" sort of thing, but it is done in a unique way. Character conflict is also a major part of the story, either with the fabled fallen angel Lucifer, or the hero Emilia, comedy seems to be the main focus of this anime, and I'll have to say FUNmation did a fantastic job.The aspect of real world troubles are also very good additions in the anime, that also contribute to more comedy that I found in Hatakaru Maou-sama! The financial troubles of holding down a job produces a unique type of style of comedy that I have yet to see. Keep in mind that anything above a score of 5 on MAL is considered fine or good. Hataraku Maou-sama! certainly deserves this high score. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: I've never had to complain about the art of an anime, (unless it's from like... the 1990's, then I just can't watch it), nonetheless being from the most recent season of completion, the art wasn't too sharp to enhance every detail but did a fine job of balancing the smooth aspects of a slice of life genre, and action that occurs from character conflict. The sound complimented the story quite well,the OP and ED were enjoyable, yet during the anime, the music IMO failed to stand out and say \"download me\". However that failure of attraction didn't detract from the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and while keeping this review short (I hope I didn't spoil too much, feel free to comment complain if I did XD.) This anime definitely deserves a look if you are looking for some major laughs and some romantic comedy. While including those soft slice of life aspects, it also provides that shouneny action stuff for the other type of anime lovers out there. Be sure to check Hataraku Maou-Sama! out if you also enjoyed similar anime such as Blood Lad, Date a Live, Oreigaru, and Beelzebub. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading,\\n\r\n-Nebarto",

            "content": "\u201cHataraku Maou-sama!\u201d is a generic shounen comedy with a hint of romance that has a very interesting premise and breaks away from common stereotypes in terms of plot. However, the executions was lackluster as evident from glaringly obvious plot holes and weak characters.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nAs I said before, \u201cHataraku Maou-sama!\u201d definitely has one of the more unique premises among most shounen animes. I\u2019ll try not to spoil too much. It is set in a fantasy world where supposedly a huge war is taking place between the humans and the demons, and like in any typical RPG game, a hero blessed with divine powers journeys to thedemon king\u2019s domicile to engage in the final boss battle. However, in the final seconds before the demon king\u2019s defeat, he creates a portal to take him and his chief general to another world in order to regroup\u2026modern day Tokyo. He then discovers he is powerless and then decides to attempt to return to his original world while working part-time at McDonalds. It then plays the expected card of having the demon king amazed by how modern people live. This interesting premise however is one of the show\u2019s only redeeming qualities, as while the first few episodes honestly had me laughing, it only goes downhill from there.\\n\r\nWhile working at McDonalds, the \u201cdemon king\u201d lives an honest life, does community service, and is a model citizen. The biggest plot hole slowly, but surely surfaces. How on earth does the power-hungry conqueror of lands, the very incarnation of evil, suddenly become a shounen protagonist in the course of one episode!? Not once does this anime care to explain this, as upon his arrival in Tokyo he automatically transforms from a dark lord to a caring and honest young man. No proper explanation is given, and throughout the anime they expect us to simply accept this. In the beginning, they spoke a strange made-up language (from their old world) but suddenly become fluent in Japanese. This plot hole alone\u2026isn\u2019t really a big deal but what really bugged me is how they alternated between it at time for no apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Animation and Sound 7/10\\n\r\nNothing very memorable, but nothing very bad either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThe term \u201cgeneric\u201d can be used to aptly describe the entire cast. We have the red-haired tsundere, the orange-haired genki girl, a loyal servant who is constantly amazed by his master\u2019s kindness and of course, the protagonist with barely any personality. The girls are quite annoying, and the servant is forgotten in the second half of the anime for REALLY stupid reasons. There is some character development though. For instance, the demon king, the main protagonist ends up developing from a genuinely interesting character into a boring male lead reminiscent of most male harem protagonists. There are also 2 characters that are introduced in one episode and even appear in the intro, but barely appear at all throughout the entire anime, with one of them only appearing in like one episode. By the end of the series, I didn\u2019t like most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI have to admit though, despite the show\u2019s many flaws, and the fact that I have been quite critical about it, it was quite enjoyable to watch. The first few episodes were really funny, as they focused mainly on the better characters, the demon king and his servant. Their initial reactions to Japanese culture and their various attempts to save money were hilarious. It was also great to see the demon king grow some balls every few episodes and beat someone up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\n\u201cHataraku Maou-sama!\u201d is definitely one of the more creative shounen animes out there, which I liked, but is really nothing more than average. If you like stupid humor there are better alternatives (baka to test), and if you like decent plots and character development in addition to the slice of life aspect there are many better animes to choose from as well. However, this is definitely a refreshing take on the genre is quite enjoyable as well. Just don\u2019t watch it with high expectations.",

            "content": "kxReview: Hataraku Maou-sama\r\nHataraku started very well with tons of action and fairly good comedy but it just doesn't have a focus in my opinion. The comedy here is well done and you'll find yourself chuckling here and there. What really really disappointed me however,is just how the story tries to fit so much and ends up not fitting anything. Example, they introduce 2 characters and just never used them for anything but a small dialog partly in the end.Another example, the introduce a bad guy but they didn't explain his motivations that well, like the writers just needed a bad guy to exist for noapparent reason. They also underdeveloped the main cast by introducing new characters before the development occurs. It was like getting cake then being served another cake before I could taste the first cake.And then another cake is given, and now I have 3 cakes and another cake comes and I just don't know whats happening and I can't pay for any of these cakes and *cough cough...(Lets get back on track) That kinda pissed me off since most of the characters would have been interesting because they aren't one dimensional. Maou is a Dark Lord but hes not as evil as the people in his old world think he is, but we never got to know why he was like that in the first place. Or why and for what the end-game bad guy wanted to do what he did to Emilia. It just felt lacking. Don't get me wrong however. Hataraku isn't a bad anime. I just wished it was better executed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending, i thought it would go for a what I call, sizzle ending. Sizzle ending is when they end the fight scenes and main plots the episode before, and then try to cover some loose holes and end some of the minor plot points on the final episodes. Like cutting of the loose ends and showing what the characters are going to do now that the main conflict is over. Hataraku's ending was kinda what I call filler. I didn't cover anything and I just wasn't what I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Hataraku Mauo-sama if your looking for a good comedy with fun characters. Just don't expect to much for what it seems to go for in the first episode.",

Exciting fights, rich background story, interesting characters, great animation,\r\nand that's not even the best part; pure comedy, it had me laughing all the way through it.  it definitely reminded me of toaru majutsu no index series, in terms of the overall vibes it gives off, but its much more hilarious.\r\nif itson your Plan to Watch list, or you're sitting on the fence wondering if you dip your toe in,\\n\\n\r\nThen my suggestion is to just dive in head first.  This show has a bit of everything for everyone, but it ties it all together with a fantastic pace and humor that you can't resist.  \\n\\n\r\nEven though it did everything well, i would point out its greatest strength is in the enjoyment department.  It's just one of those shows that makes life good.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nThe Devil is a Part Timer is probably one of the funniest anime's I've seen, mainly because it sounds like an interesting concept while also having a fantastic mixture of characters to keep you entertained plus you'll never look at a McDonald's or a KFC the same again once you've finished watching this.\r\nThe story begins in Ente Isla where the Demon Lord Saturn has been vanquished by humanity so he along with one of his generals escape to Earth to rebuild their empire, but with the interruption of Emilia the hero and earning very poor salaries their conquest of Earth isn't going tobe that easy.\\n\r\nHonestly it surprised the hell out of me that Saturn working at a discount McDonald's called MgRonald's would actually be a fun and enjoyable story, it was really entertaining seeing the characters that came from Ente Isla trying to get used to living in normal human society and it makes me think this is how well aliens would do in our society if they ever appear, but nonetheless the interactions and situations between the characters during their day to day lives was just absolutely funny because Saturn or Sadao Maou and Emilia or Emi Yusa completely hate each others guts yet seeing them along with the other Ente Isla characters and the human characters their relationship did start to get more comfortable because they had learned more about each other and what they are really like, hell they even worked together sometimes to take down bad guys.\\n\r\nI think whats also pretty funny is how serious this show can be sometimes because even though he works at MgRonalds Saturn takes his job very seriously so seeing him taking to out other fast food places for customers was weirdly inspiring because you would never see a McDonald's employee doing this kind of stuff because their usually just Zombies trying to make some money, plus it's anime which can turn even the stupidest and boring of things into something awesome that is if it is done right like this.\\n\r\nI also have to give props to the developers for creating another language just for Ente Isla which is something you very rarely see down in anime's even if they are set in fantasy worlds they always use Japanese or English yet this decides to go and create another language which really reminded me of Lord of the Rings since that has it's own languages too along with any other fantasy type thing.\\n\\n\r\nNow even though the characters constantly bicker with each other their chemistry is fantastic and always makes for some great entertainment.\\n\r\nSaturn/Sadao Maou is the male MC, he was the recent Demon King of Ente Isla until Emilia forced him to retreat to Earth though you wouldn't expect such a cool guy to be the Demon King because Sadao is such a good character true he does say from time to time he is going to conquer this world, but I feel like he does that to piss off Emilia he is actually a thoughtful person and makes sure that everyone is ok especially when it comes to his co-worker Chiho, although he can be a bit oblivious and a douchebag sometimes, but that douchebagness is mainly towards Emilia because obviously their enemies.\\n\r\nEmilia/Emi Yusa is the female MC who is half human and half angel which gives her the power to defeat Saturn, Emi is also a Tsundere which is actually understandable since she is having to live close to her enemy that she wants to destroy because he pretty destroyed everything she cared for back in Ente Isla, but the constant bickering that she and Maou have makes most people think they used to be in a romantic relationship and are just trying to make each other's lives hell, Emi is actually a very funny character since she has to get involved with things that concern Sadou that she really doesn't want to get involved, but has to in case he tries anything evil however despite being his enemy Emi does have a kind heart and slowly starts to get on better terms with him by the end of the series.\\n\r\nChiho Sasaki or Chi for short is the only human from Earth that is a main character and she is such a fun, cheerful and adorable character, she works alongside Sadou at the MgRonald's and does develop feelings for him and those feelings get stronger even after she finds out he is the Devil and the things he has done, but because of this connection she does get caught up in dangerous situations and having the others rescue then again she doesn't have powers so you can't really blame her plus her strong feelings for Sadou do make her jealous of the other girls when they do something with Sadou that she doesn't like which does lead to some temper tantrum's though this didn't annoy and sometimes seemed pretty cute.\\n\r\nAzazel/Shirou Ashiya is one of Saturn's general's and Roommate on Earth though from the way he acts you'd think he's more of a strict mother than a Demon general, he ends up being the cook of the house and makes sure that him and Saturn have the balanced diet they need and also makes sure they don't waste money on pointless things, however as funny as his tantrum's are when the others don't listen to him he does end up being in a sickened state for almost half of the series making him not seem for a good amount of time which did suck since he was a funny and entertaining character.\\n\r\nLucifer/Hanzou Urushihara who used to be one of Saturn's demon generals until he was supposedly killed by Emi that is until he showed up on Earth to cause havoc until Sadou and the others stopped him then he became an addition to Sadou's household which seems oddly weird keeping a guy who tried to kill you as a roommate, he is very lazy and becomes a NEET playing video games and wasting the others money for pointless stuff, but he is clever and did manage to help save the day by planting trackers on some of the characters to know their whereabouts which helped Sadou in a battle, plus he is always looked down upon by the others and his reaction are just priceless because he hates being used by them as a joke then again he did try to kill them and does waste their money on pointless stuff.\\n\r\nCrestia Bel/Suzuno Kamazuki is an executioner for the Church Investigation Commission in Ente Isla and came to Earth to see why Emi and Sadou were in a kind of alliance, she starts out as a kind and caring neighbour to the demon boys often cooking them food and helping them out with daily chores when Shirou was out of action which she only does so she can eliminate Sadou, when she began living on Earth she didn't understand how anything worked until Emi helped her out and despite being an assassin she is actually a good person at heart and never really wanted to kill people which she only did because the church ordered her too.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was actually pretty good and I liked the character designs because there felt like a difference between the characters from Ente Isla and Earth with their appearance's true the Demon boys were in human form, but they didn't seem human and when Sadou did turn into his demon form he looked friggin badass certainly the form you would expect the Demon King to look like and from the way Ente Isla looked I kinda wanted to see more of it because it would seem like an interesting place to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is definitely what makes this a great anime and the comedy works incredibly well because of the characters which I have said before from their interactions with each other, most anime's decide to use random situations or accidental mishaps to make funny comedy, but The Devil is a Part Timer use's the characters as the source of comedy and their arguments are so funny, usually you'd arguments between the main characters would be annoying, but they used these arguments to great effect and pulled off some really funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nHowever this anime can actually be pretty serious because along with the bits of action there are some instances with the characters that gives you a very serious tone like when Emi shouts at Sadou about the things he did in Ente Isla and how it affected her and the humans of Ente Isla, the action sequences themselves are actually pretty good and aren't really flashy which is mainly due to the Ente Isla characters not being able to use a lot of magic since there isn't a concentration of it on Earth so don't expect the fights to be amazingly epic, their pretty short, but are still sweet to watch especially when Sadou goes all Demon mode.\\n\\n\r\nDespite there being Romance in the genre tags there isn't really a whole lot of it because the only character who has romantic feelings for Sadou is Chi, but whenever she tries to flirt with him or even when she reveals her feelings to him Sadou doesn't really return those feelings to her since he respects her as a co-worker and friend while with Emi it's more of a building trust relationship since they are sworn enemies, but by the end they have kinda started to trust each other.\\n\r\nWhat also surprise's me is the Ecchi or fanservice in this anime because I originally thought it had quite a lot, but aside from a pool episode and a few bath and undressing scene's there really wasn't that much and yes I know Chi has a pretty big oppai, but it doesn't really ruin her character or any of the scene's unless it's being used for fanservice, but I was surprised how controlled the fanservice was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a incredibly fun anime and I would definitely recommend this to anyone if they are looking for a good laugh just don't expect the next time you walk into McDonald's seeing Saturn or a sexy Loli.",

But this happens very little in the show.\r\nThe show doesn't answer some things that i would expect in some situations but it isn't so much as the show's fault as it is the amount of episodes the season had. If there was even maybe 3 or 4 more episodes i think they couldhave fixed that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso i really love Emi character and like the relationship between her and the Overlord. Kind of wish the show showed her being more of a badass sense we are told all through out how powerful she is. But there isn't many times when we see how powerful she is.\\n\\n",

The development rate is amazing. 13 Eps can be categorized as following: 2 small stories withing a main story where the set of events happen and end quickly, the second one ending at the ep. 12. \\n\r\nOverall, it's a very good story for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nComedy - 8.\\n\r\nI put comedy as a separate category because that's of the main assets of the show. I laughed pretty hard to some scenes, giggled to others. Overall the comedy served its purpose, not to the fullest though\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nAbove average because there were unique OST fitting perfectly to a scene. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nThe only reason I can't give 10 to the enjoyment it gave me, is that I can't help but compare this nomination to other animes which kept me hours and hours stuck to the monitor wondering what'd happen next. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, fast paced development of events, good comedy (noticeably attractive face expressions being part of it), awesome fighting scenes (although few) make the anime well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nWhich makes me happy thinking its public score is well deserved. If I were to describe this anime in one line, I'd say:\\n\\n\r\n\"A balanced fun show for its story and characters with some pretty fights here and there\"",

            "content": "As an amateur film critic, and not so much anime critic, I found it terrifically difficult to find a comedy anime that truly fit in my comedic standards without being unwatchable at times; an anime that I could genuinely, and at that hysterically, laugh at. \"Hataraku Maou-sama!\" is the first that lands in that category.\r\nFrom the onset, the show presents itself with a not too serious plot with colorful characters and bouncy dialogue that meshes well with each character. The story is not complicated, however diverges from its origin quickly to focus on the characters and the real value of the show which serves themood of it better than anything. As a comedy, the show does not have to create a hyper-intensive plot that engrosses the audience. However, what it does do with its plot is much more detailed than any comedic anime I've seen and adds a touch to an already colorful show. Even with a plot not too focused on the grand stage, the comedic plot between characters never goes anywhere and never seems to progress; ideas such as the bonding of Maou and Emi could have been enhanced to create a more emotional feeling from the viewer. Just because it does not have to be intensive, that does not mean that subplots cannot be slightly more honed. \\n\\n\r\nThe style of the anime is just as simple as its plot which added little to the feeling of the show. However, where there are some small bland spots in the animation, in very specific episodes it ramps up to a level most anime of this caliber do not attempt. Demonic fight scenes were a nice touch as it let the animators show-off for an episode or two. While brief parts were beautiful, the art does not do much in the way of generating a feeling or striking the audience; leave the writing to do that. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing special in my opinion. I've never been one to seek out a specific track in a show unless it REALLY reaches out to me which puts me in a 'meh' state for the OST of the show. The voice work, however is what is nice about the sound of the show. Both Japanese and English in my opinion have great performances, specifically Chi in the Japanese dub (SO F#!@N' CUTE) and Ashiya and Urushihara from the English dub (They both capture their characters so well). With an unknown OST but pretty good overall Voice acting, the sound is one that does not quite jump out to myself. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where it gets exciting. These characters portray some incredible writing work. The comedy from each individual is pure and displays the variety of characters that is in the show. The characters showcase real emotion (a debt to the voice actors/actresses), and they mesh with each other so well. The designs may not be the most original, with many archetypes being used to embody a singular character, however they still connect to the audience and get laughs out of them. Favorite characters include Urushihara, Chi, and Sariel. The characters are so well written to bounce off each other that they create a connection to each other and the viewer which is paramount in a comedic show with a short run-time. \\n\\n\r\nThis hit me at just the right time and is perfect for a palette-cleanser after a thoughtful show. The comedy is funny, enjoyable and relatable as are the characters. The simplicity of the show holds it back from being incredible and the length hinders its advancements too. As a comedy, this show is an immediate recommendation, however rudimentary and/or immature. You don't watch this to analyze it as it achieves its purpose with flying colors.\\n\\n\r\nAverage Score- 8.2/10\\n\r\nOverall Score- 3/4 Stars | WATCH IT!\\n\r\n-winger61\\n",

            "content": "I don't even want to start this off with a quote or something to grab anyone's attention because this show didn't really grab mine, so let's just hop to it.\r\nStoryline: The storyline was unique. The demon lord, Satan himself, goes head-to-head with the hero, Emilia, and ends up escaping into another \"world\" (Japan). He and his right-hand man, Alciel, decide to adapt to the culture, move in together, get jobs, blend into society, etc. But Satan's buddy can't hold down a job, so it's up to him to be the bread winner. He gets a job at a fast food joint and totally kicks ass.He's the best of the best and is able to charm his coworkers. Kind of a weird quirk for a fricking demon, but whatever? He eventually runs into Emilia who now goes by \"Emi\" and she still vows to kill him at all costs. Meanwhile, people from their world (Ente Isla) keep appearing and somehow have lots of power all the time, but Satan and Emilia can't seem to muster up their strength. I get that Satan gets stronger from feeding off fear, but come on. I mean, he's SATAN. But okay. They beat the baddies and then befriend them. Makes sense. Because the anime only has one season, it fell short. There were no clear goals or resolutions. The only thing that made this somewhat entertaining was the mediocre comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As far as art goes, it was basic. Nothing was amazing. No jaw-dropping fight scenes or anything. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The characters' voices were fine, I guess? And the music... I don't really remember it. I guess it didn't really stick out much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Satan has zero character development whatsoever. He was supposed to be almighty before and now he's content with living a normal life without being bad? Why? No clear answer. It's basically \"just because\". Emilia is fricking annoying. She's a stalker and has to remind you every five miliseconds that she's \"the hero\", but also vows to kill all the bad guys. Now how does that work out? As for the side characters, they're all rats. They all kind of suck, every girl is obsessed with Satan, and the men are dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I gave this show a 6. I should rate it lower, but whatever. I find this fair. I made it through all 13 episodes. Anything is possible, I suppose. I wouldn't recommend this show, but I didn't hate it.",

However, this show will completely throw your perspective around and make you long for a delicious burger.\r\nWhile the art of Hataraku Maou-sama! isn't anything special compared to most shows out there, it does have some pretty vivid colors to mess around even more with the aspect of the devil himself being the protagonist of the story.\r\nThe OST isn't one ofthe best I've heard in anime, but it matches the show pretty well and while it does not stand out a lot, it blends in with the art of the show, making it easy to watch. \\n\r\nWhat truly makes this anime so great is the story and the character design.

Comedy being one of the main parts of the show, you'll probably notice how even the smallest things will make you laugh due to the context they're showed in. \\n\\n\r\nAnother part which I really loved of this anime is the clever details they added, such as the wordplay with the character names. (Urushihara being Lucifer. Try pronouncing them, trust me.) \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is basically a hilarious show you could easily watch in one go if you've got the time. The comedy combined with the totally out-of-place slice of life aspect and a little bit of action delivers you a great show which is definitely worth an 8/10 in my opinion.",

At the end you even don't laugh anymore as it is so repetitive...\r\nConcerning the action, I was also disappointed because it does not occupy a lot of time on screen. And the supernatural is not very present neither as the protagonists are mainly in their human form. \r\nOther negative points include the quickly forgotten soundtrack and the poor character development. Instead of adding newcharacters every two episodes, they should have more explained the background of all the existing characters. Emi Yusa does not understand the transition of Sadao. We spectators neither. And what about the other demons? It is maybe done on purpose but in my opinion it does not make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nFinally this anime is more a slice of life with easy comedy elements. Although I can't say I didn't enjoy it at all, it will be quickly forgotten. Watch it at 11 pm when you have nothing else to do. \\n\\n",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nAnime has recently been on a trend of light hearted comedy shows with a heavy emphasis on \u201cmoe\u201d. While Hataraku Maou-sama embodies many of these elements, it is surprisingly enjoyable to watch. It also redeems this season by turning this great light novel into a non-mediocre anime (*cough* Date A Live *cough*). \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe plot in Hataraku Maou-sama flows surprisingly well from the beginning all the way towards to the ending. The main focus of the show is on the Demon King Sadao who after losing a battle with the humans flees to Earth through a portal. Not wanting theDemon King to get away, The Hero Emi follows the Demon King to the human earth. The first couple episodes really made me interested in the direction the show wanted to go because the plot introduced my favorite type of character; the fish out of water character. When you have a character dropped into a situation with absolutely no understanding of what is going on around him, you (the audience) has the perfect opportunity to learn with the main character. Since everything has to be spelled out for him, you in turn get to learn everything along with him thus making the experience much more fluid. Granted Sadao does get on his feet rather quickly finding a job and a place to live early on, the first episode was very funny as he and his minion Shirou had to deal with the Japanese culture and police. The only issue with the pacing of the show was that the ending was not really an ending at all and that the one sided love that Chiho expresses feels a little forced. The show did not go out of its way to give us a huge, thought provoking experience but it did not cause me to fall asleep watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated in the opening sentence of this review, this show is a comedy. To be more specific this show is a gag comedy meaning that a lot of people will not like the short jab of jokes. Also a lot of the jokes are centered on Japanese common knowledge things such as their healthcare system. There is also a huge emphases on \u201cmoe\u201d or super cute girls that you just want to hug the ever living s#!t out of. There is a moderate amount of fan service in the show but it really did not overly distract me from what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for me was pretty excellent. There are some truly awesome quality shots in this anime such as the scene in daylight under the trees in the park in the last episode or the final fight scene in episode twelve. The character models are also very well done and seeing how this is a very \u201ccute girl\u201d anime, the females all have their unique charm. I think it is safe to say that Chiho is now the most adorable anime girl with huge boobs. I just want to give them\u2026err her a big ol\u2019 hug.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only noteworthy awesome thing about the sound in this anime was the performance of the voice actors. I absolutely loved the voice of each character in the anime regardless if they had a major or minor role. Other than that though I felt like the show\u2019s sound was average. The music choices for the show felt bland and didn\u2019t really help make the show any better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEmi, Sadao, Lucifer, and Shirou all made this show extremely fun to watch. Their back and forth bantering brought many funny and enjoying moments throughout the show\u2019s first season. We also had our fill of super cute\u2026err female leads! Each of the three main females in the show has varying personalities. Emi is the really cold and ruthless one, Chiho has a really cheerful attitude (and huge boobs), and the other female lead Suzuno I won\u2019t talk about so I do not spoil anything but she turned out to be my favorite. I mean even Emi's friend Rika is just oozing cuteness on an unfathomable level. This show does have a lot of \u201cmoe\u201d elements but it is not putting all of its eggs into this basket. The plot flows so well because of the character interactions; the cuteness is just a super sweet add-on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was truly a surprise gift (for me at least) in this anime season. After seeing how much high school/slice of life stuff was coming, I thought that this was just going to be another one of those forgettable ones. This show had an interesting premise with the characters and animation to back it up. Even though the sound sort of took a back seat role, this anime really has everything it needs to keep pretty much everyone interested. If fanservice is an issue for you there really is only two or three scenes where they just throw it in your face so it should not be a huge issue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.8/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

However, the ending was incredibly awful in my opinion. I was completely outraged over how poorly this anime ended. I was expecting something so much better than what happened and I'm pretty disappointed. I really wish they would have fixed it somehow (a movie, second season, more episodes). The ending just felt so rushed and the last episode felt more like a filler episode than a final conclusion. Maybe it ended differently in the manga, but I haven't read it.\\n\r\nOverall, I give it an 8/10 because of episode 13. The anime has amazing characters and plot development. It seemed like there was a lot put into the idea of it but the last episode just made me feel like maybe the anime was cancelled in the middle of production...",

            "content": "Some things do not mix. Oil and water. Love and logic. Oranges and toothpaste. And as far as entertainment goes, action and comedy. Not to say they are binary, no. Comic relief to break the pace of seriousness and action to sober up the silly work well together as long as they do not deviate from the tone of the show. The tone has to be dominant. When you try to mix equal parts comedy and action, it says to me, \"If you're not taking this seriously, why should I?\" And \"The Devil is a Part-Timer!\" from the renowned studio White Fox got me askingthat question more than once.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is something out of a network sitcom. The Devil and one of his Generals are forced to leave their world and make a living in the hustle and bustle that is the big city. A fish out of water story is nothing new, but the idea that the most evil being in existence suddenly adapts modern sensibilities in the span of a single episode already has me doubting the premise. Was he THAT bad? The backstory speaks of genocide and destruction caused that hands of Satan and his generals, so he clearly was living up to the mythos- but now I'm supposed to like him because he's taking his job at MgRonald's with the same seriousness as he does conquering the lands of his home world? Okay, fine. There are some genuinely funny moments early on, but then to see the Hero show up and forgive all his evil deeds, too? Makes me feel they set the stakes way too high early on.\\n\\n\r\nThe show then slips into a slice of life type motif. The Devil reduced to a shift manager at a burger joint. His mighty General reduced to essentially a housewife. The Hero now a telephone operator. Dealing with things like rent, a creepy landlady, and the giggles that come when they're super serious in public over things that aren't serious at all. It was funny the first few times. I had a sense of relief when the backstory elements would creep back in, but then the conflicts there were resolved so quickly, it made me wonder why I was worried in the first place. The positives here are some nifty fight scenes and some good art and effects to go with them. I did enjoy the handful of battles here. The in show music along with the opening and ending themes are nothing special, but hardly awful. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was rushed, but the characters still got enough of a chance to grow on you. Enough to warrant concern when the final battle takes place, but the show ends on a note that makes it feel like it just stops rather than actually having an ending. This was rather awkward and frustrating. I had a few laughs with this show and as far as the Sub vs. Dub battle goes, it's a win for the Sub with a performance that stood a cut above the English dubbers. The show felt rushed, repetitive, and confused in content and tone. There was so much going on in the world the Devil and Hero came from, I wanted the show to go over there! That seemed much more interesting than watching Satan's General being sick all the time. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the goofiness itself does make the show decent enough and enjoyable in some spots, but operating on the premise of our main character being the evilest of evil and letting all the go because he's human now and somewhat likeable makes unpleasant contrast in my opinion, had they gone less dark and serious in his background, I may have enjoyed it more. But the contrast is too sharp for me to ignore and asks too much of me as a viewer to accept. Overall, I give this show a strong 5/10. If you have nothing better to watch, check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "There are very few animes that I enjoyed as much as I have this series, maybe because for such an unusual fantasy premise it feels so grounded at the same time. \r\nStory: In another world where every fantasy cliche takes place, the Demon king Satan is at war with the great hero and slowly starts to lose so as a last resort him and his right hand demon Alciel flee through a portal where they end up in our world in Japan and have the fish out of water moment to begin with but quickly transitions to them adapting to our world from renting anapartment and working part time at a Mc Donalds parody and doing a good job at it. While more characters are introduced and there are fantasy elements the main plot is just life and how we can relate to his situation of being on your own and working to make a living and that's one of the reasons why I love the story\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art and animation is very nice standard and doesn't really do anything too out there, so there isn't much to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: first off major kudos to the dub for really getting the characters voices down and extra points to Felecia Angelle who voices Emi for really getting that angry tone, the opening is nice to listen to and of course the japanese voice acting is done really well, I would give both a listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the main reason why I love this anime, every character is unique and the interaction between them is amazing, from the hero who comes off as a villain, Chiyo didn't irritate me as much as I thought she would, my favourite character is definitely Lucifer because I can relate to him a lot, as a matter of fact a lot of the characters I can relate to because they are written so well and are really funny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I could not stop watching this anime and I was extremely sad once it ended, I tried reading the manga but it hasn't gone that far yet but I still hope for a second season, I know a lot of people might not have enjoyed this series as much as I have but I can guarantee it doesn't feel like a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a fantasy anime that has a very slice of life element to it that merges the two complete opposite genre's together so well that it can appeal to both fans. 10/10 would watch",

With the exception of Episode 13 (Which feels like a episode from an early 2nd season that might never be made.), all the episodes are on-point. I'm laughed my ass off throughout most the jokes. \r\nThere's really not much to say about the art or sound. It's neatly executed.\r\nIt's the characters that make this show shine.\r\nSatan, ruler of darkness, is ... a dork. \r\nEmilia, the all-powerful hero, is ... a dork.\r\nAlciel, the most capable general the Devil has, is ... a dork.\r\nLucifer, the embodiment of chaos, is... a dork with a NEET streak.\\n\r\nSuzuno, the Devil's neighbor with her own mysterious backstory... is a dork. \\n\r\nChiyo, the most adorable coworker you could possibly have, is ... not a dork, but still very endearing. And most of the comedy comes from her being the Devil's Underling (with a crush on him) in MgRonalds as they take on Sentucky Fried Chicken in sales. If you aren't cracking a grin from reading that sentence, you have no soul.\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness, you just sit back, cheer these characters on, and have yourself a viewing party of one because it is that good. The English Dub is available on iTunes. For about 26.99 plus tax, you can own all 13 episodes. Definitely the way to go. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this falls in the same category  as Unbreakable Machine Doll and D-Frag, as a one-season hit full of strong, and endearing characters, that will PROBABLY NEVER GET A SECOND SEASON because the studios don't know when they have a hit. If Haganai and Chuunibyou could get second seasons, why can't these?\\n",

            "content": "I recently re-watched this anime and I must say that it fills the hole in my heart when I am looking for something to watch. The anime is similar to the slice of life genre with an underlying story that moves the plot at a good pace. The characters provide great comedy and really question the morality of what is to be considered good and evil. The scenes with action are nicely animated and really shows the raw powers of the main character. If you like the anime Working! then this is an anime that you might also like, because of its focus on theworkplace and bits of romance between the characters. If you have not seen this anime, then I highly recommend that you watch it and if you have already seen it, then watch it again because the anime is something that I cannot forget.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 - The anime ended on a good note but if it were possible, I really wish it were longer or had a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10- The action scenes are well animated and characters really show good emotion in the faces\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10- Each character in the anime has interesting interactions and portray funny anime archetypes",

Lucifer was a great Relatable character as well. My only problem with the series is....WHERES SEASON 2!!!

I would also like Ente Isla to be more expansive and add to the story more than it did. However, it was a super funny show and a great slice of life, but the action/different world/devil part was a little lacking. The last episode did not even end on a cliffhanger for the following season (which may not even happen). More plot twists and more things happening would have been good for thestory to meet its full potential. The art was good but nothing special, while the soundtrack added intensity and emotion. Despite the slightly lacking story, I really enjoyed this anime and it was funny and I would recommend it IF a second season would come. Or just read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nmagegay out",

It was lightweight, easy, and funny to watch. It may have walked on thin ice by injecting a little bit of action and a little bit of drama here and there. Part of the anime's appeal was that it stayed faithful to comedy: It would build up fluff between characters with emotions are never too heavy to carry. It would insert a well drawn action scene and pull back just in time for another gag.\r\nAt the heart of Hataraku Maou-sama! were thesilly slice-of-life moments stringed together to make a funny story. It makes fun of the mundane things, and pokes at an ordinary person's daily worries (and expenses). The good thing about it is how all the complicated things took a backseat to comedy. Hataraku Maou-sama! is best appreciated in its simplicity. A plot any deeper would have taken away the humor from the show.\"",

            "content": "Hataraku Maou-sama\r\nI thought I wouldn't enjoy this series, but watching it proved me very wrong. At first look, its not that very appealing for me, so I was thinking twice on watching it since I thought it was going to be your average romcom harem ecchi fanservice series. But what do you know, you can never judge a book by its cover. \r\nStory : 7\r\nNot very original if you ask me. In a separate world, there was a demon king who conquered every village on it, and of course! If there's a demon king, there's a hero. The hero and her allies then defeats threeof the four generals who assists the demon king himself, and reclaims the villages. And then she gets to the demon king's castle to finally defeat the demon king, which she successfully did. The demon king one of his general were forced to retreat, used some kind of a portal which leads them to earth. There they lost most of their power, unable to retain their demon forms and unable to go back to their world because of they're wounds and not having enough magic power, they were forced to stay on earth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThe art is reaaaaaaaaaally good. We rarely see ugly art in this modern day and age, so almost everything now is pretty well made. Backgrounds were perfectly drawn. Detailed background characters. Its really good. Period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nCharacters on hataraku maou-sama. They're good, easily recognizable, names that doesn't have much of a problem to remember, cute, and very detailed. So you'll remember them very easily. They're personalities match well with their looks, and perfectly works with their co-characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 8\\n\r\nMusic is good. Cute ending, I didint quite like the opening though, but the ending is quite good. You should listen to it when you start watching it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it. Since I gave it a 9, its kind of refreshing to watch this kind series. No deep or complicated plots. It just gives you the \"this carefree feel\" when you watch it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nIts a good series, pretty decent, not that ecchi. Its really worth watching, it has the potential of having a great action packed series if the makers pursue that path, but the rom com feel to it is not that bad either, its not entirely harem though, since unlike other series, this one doesn't have that much of girls frolicking over the protag, in fact others really resent him. Plus the light jokes are really good, they'll put a little laugh on your tummy. And they're really easy to catch, you don't need to understand japanese to get the jokes, unlike other series, which relies on puns on making jokes. This series is a good watch, not really a must-watch series though. But it probably won't waste your time, so that covers my review on this one! Have fun watching hataraku maou-sama!\\n",

I give this anime a 5.6.\r\nFor those looking for a brief summary, skip to the \u201cOverall\u201d at the bottom of this review. \r\nStory: 6\r\nThis anime took the classic story of someone trying for world domination and made it into a comedy. It definitely had potential but after the first few episodes it became literally just another harem anime. By the 7th episode I wanted to drop the anime but held out until the end and regret it.\r\nCharacters: 4\r\nWhat threw me off about this anime were the implausible characters. The only person who got a backstory throughout thisentire anime was Yusa, and an excellent one at that. Unfortunately, they took any hint of drama that would have given the show substance and ruined it with poor comedy. I had a few laughs, but the 1-dimensional characters and poor execution of the plot made this anime feel like the creators of One Punch Man tried too hard to make a serious anime and fell into their satirical ways halfway through each dramatic scene.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent. Nothing amazing, but at least not as terrible as the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe sound didn\u2019t stand out to me either. I\u2019m just giving it less than a 7 because of my sheer disappointment with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.6\\n\\n\r\nThe story was world domination with a nice twist. Unfortunately, the 1-dimensional characters ruined any chance this story had of succeeding and the poor comedy took out any morsel of substance this show had. It felt like the creators of One Punch Man tried too hard to make a serious anime and fell into their satirical ways halfway through each dramatic scene. Art and sound were decent but nothing to brag about. Even if there is a season 2, I will not be watching it. Huge disappointment.   \\n",

I found this aspect to the show rather rewarding to watch and kept the meaning of the series rather being just another Slice Of Life focusing on Characters ONLY. The balance is nice and adds elements and story twists that worked forthe series.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\\n\r\n* Backdrops are really stunning at points\\n\r\n* Characters are very diverse stylistically \\n\r\n* Characters also easily show slight emotions which was nice to see\\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\\n\r\n* OP - Was decent enough and catchy with the opening part of \"Get out of gate\"\\n\r\n* ED - Was nice nothing to complain about, Her voice is really good. \\n\r\n* Characters - All suited themselves for example Chiho's sounded Vulnerable yet feisty and Maou sounds nice when Normal, but you can tell he has a deeper/dark side to his voice which suited both of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters drove the story forward and each different from one another, The slight issue is many characters are left rather one dimensional, Hardly focus on any bits in the past apart from some people from the \"Other World\" which for some hardly give any information, Just a simple instruction or goal. \\n\r\nI felt they needed to explore these further to give some depth to the characters, And they simply played on the little we know way too many times, For example knowing why Emi putting up a tough and uncompromising front when talking to/about  Maou is something that got overused far too many times.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, I liked the characters i just wanted a bit more to round them off and give them needed depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\\n\r\nHataraku Maou-sama! is a really enjoyable series for me, Has decent characters and interesting and unique story and is pulled off rather well, Would defiantly recommend this series to you if you have watched Maoyuu Maou Yuusha (Maou Sama is better) or Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou etc.",

After the 1st episode, it just got better and better.\r\nA little bit of spoilers ahead:\r\nStory = 8 - The story was quite new for me. Basically, it's about a Demon Lord who was at verge of defeat in his world and escaped with his remaining General to earth. Upon arriving, they noticed they can't use magic and conquering that world would be pointless, so they decided to live like humans.\r\nArt = 8 - Everything was animated excellently, be it a normal day in theirlives or battle scenes, the art is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 8 - I have nothing against the OP, because it's very good. As for BGM, I have no qualms about it because, it fits in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 9 - This shows has a cast of great seiyuus w/c helped with how popular it got.\\n\\n\r\nMaou Sadao/ Demon Lord Satan Jacob - The MC, when he arrived at Earth, he became a caring and big-brother figure to Chi-chan. He is a very powerful Demon, because he is the King of all Demons, so he is very OP and draws his power from fear, despair, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAshiya Shirou/Alciel - His like the Housekeeper whenever Maou is working, he is in-charge of budgeting and groceries, a  polite Demon, he fled to Earth after he and Maou were defeated in Ente Isla. He seems to have a thing for his mantle.\\n\\n\r\nEmi Yusa/ Emillia the Hero - Was pursuing the fleeing Demon Lord, when she arrived at Earth, she lost her powers as well, she works as a call-center agent. I think she likes Maou. She gets a power up from \"hope\", but she doesn't know. She has a complex about her boobs.\\n\\n\r\nHanzou Urushihara/Lucifer - The first Antagonist of the show but, becomes an ally after Maou defeats him in battle. He becomes a NEET, and will only help out if Maou asks him too or if he feels like it.\\n\\n\r\nChiho Sasaki - Maou's cute and loud co-worker. She didn't mind Maou and the others not being human. Even knowing about Maou's true self, she still likes him. Currently in the kouhai zone.\\n\\n\r\nSuzuno Kamazuki - an assassin sent by Ente Isla to kill Maou and take the other-half, after realizing her mistakes, she joins Maou and his underlings.\\n\\n\r\nOlba Meyer - the \"priest\" in Emi's party. Had an ulterior motive.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuki Sarue/ Arch-angel Sariel - Go home James, this isn't pokemon. He tried to take the other-half from Emilia only to be thwarted by Maou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9 - The action isn't over the top... sometimes. Whenever there is a serious scene they can squeeze in some comedy to lessen the tension and that makes this show a little unique than the other Maou-Yuusha type animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 9 - If anything in this world deserves a Season 2, it's this one. Fights are well animated, dialogue is superb, the timing of jokes is greatly executed, and the whole angel bad-guy/devil good-guy thing will make Catholics go wild but, it just depends on your perspective.\\n",

(the devil is a part timer), takes a step back the recently popular insane violence and gore, by cutting out the all the unnecessary fights which ultimately don't affect the plot, whilst still retaining the quirky and often ingenious outbursts making a downright hilarious show.\r\nStory 8\r\nI reckon there's about 8 people for each anime that introduces a supernatural element to it along the way ( i.e. there's a lot). However Hataraku Maou-sama! open withthe main character of Satan... that's right... Satan, the physical manifestation of all things dark and evil (\u300d\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb)\u300d As his expanding empire is crippled and he is forced to leave the dimension. And where does he arrive? Our world of course, a world devoid of all magic and demonic beings (depending on your faith). So as he attempts to replenish his magic and return to his world he faces the greatest challenge ever to the dark overlord: working in... the service industry. With a couple other spanners thrown in the works along the way.\\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise that such an outsider takes a little while to acclimatise into our world making for plenty of situations or just little phrases that can have you doubling over, laughing at the screen like a madman.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9\\n\\n\r\nThis has one of the best art styles, I've seen in a long time, ranging from semi-opaque darkness to vibrant, in your face lighting darting around.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the dub had not yet been released when I saw this anime, I cannot judge the voice acting so this is based purely upon sound effects and music, unfortunately both of these seemed quite rare or simply went unnoticed; evident as I can hardly remember the theme tune, the exception to this for me though was the ending theme, which sadly I didn't bother to watch until about halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8\\n\\n\r\nWith the story of Satan, you would expect a harsh, manipulative person with little concern for others, however this anime goes out of it's way that he is anything but that, helping humans whenever possible, the stereotype defying    not stopping there, as most of the main characters are revealed to be almost the reverse of their reputation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\\n\r\nThis was a brilliant anime which I would recommend to anyone with the remotest of interests with fantasy, comedy, slice of life or even romance - none of which interfere with each other at any point, somehow - and you won't regret watching even if that doesn't include you.\\n\r\np.s\\n\r\nIf the dub sucks (as always) try it on subs, don't just give up on it.",

            "content": "\u201cI don\u2019t expect a mere human to understand my lofty goals.\u201d\r\nI was told this show was absolutely hilarious, and \u201cprobably best of the season\u201d, and while I may not know about the latter, I can honestly say that this is one of the funniest shows I have seen.\r\nStory: (8 / 10)\r\nTo be honest, this show would\u2019ve probably worked just as well as a regular SOL-show, without any of the demon stuff. Each episode we get to follow the daily lives of the dark lord Maou Sadao and other characters involved in his life, as he works his way up in the fast-food business. \r\nTo spicethings up even more, we have the occasional being from another dimension show up, to cause trouble for our hardworking lord. \\n\\n\r\nNew characters are introduced now and then throughout the series, some more permanent than others, and this makes for a nice change of pace, as the characters will always have someone new to interact with. \\n\\n\r\nI personally never had any problems with the pacing of the show. Not once did I feel like an episode was moving too slow or too fast, however the final episode will really leave you wanting for a second season...\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nWhile the art may not be the best of the season, it\u2019s certainly nowhere near bad, either. The backgrounds were beautiful most of the time, and I especially loved the character designs. The demons weren\u2019t too over-the-top, but still got the point across, while every human character looked unique and very much had their own \u201cstyle\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe art helped in bringing out the humor a lot of the times as well, mostly through certain facial expressions which served to really enhance a characters reaction.\\n\r\nThe animation and effects were nicely done, and there\u2019s really nothing to complain about at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nThe OP, \u201cZERO!!\u201d by Minami Kuribayashi, is a pretty upbeat song, which perfectly fits the lighthearted tone of the show. The three ED\u2019s used, \u201cTsuki Hana\u201d, \u201cStar Chart\u201d, and \u201cTsumabiku Hitori\u201d are all performed by nano.RIPE and have a slightly less upbeat tone. I thought they worked very well in contrast to the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have fitting voices, and there was no character whose voice I really had a problem with. The voice actors did an overall great job in delivering their lines, and the expressions of the characters, which only served to make it all even funnier. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nCharacters is a big one for this show. On one hand we have Maou Sadao, the dark lord from another world, who\u2019s now working at MgRonalds and will do anything to help his crew out. Then we have Yusa Emi, the supposed hero of another world, who spend her days stalking Maou & friends. It makes for a weird change when the dark lord is the one constantly helping out, as opposed to the hero of the story, but in this case it definitely works. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters introduced all have rather unique personalities, and this large, varying cast of characters really help keep everything fresh as the show goes on. Almost all of the characters introduce serve an important purpose in the story, and are not just there as filler characters for a single episode, and then never seen again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10 / 10)\\n\r\n\u201cHataraku Maou-sama!\u201d is a genuinely funny show. Not once was I bored during an episode, and even during what might appear to be more serious parts of an episode (like a fight scene) there were some hilarious things going on. There are some recurring jokes, but they never felt overused, and it\u2019s nothing that will stay on your mind with all the other jokes happening throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Absolutely hilarious\\n\r\n+ Art is good\\n\r\n+ High rewatch value\\n\r\n+ Unique, varying characters\\n\r\n+ Suzuno \\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- It will leave you wanting for more...\\n\r\n- Not enough screentime for Suzuno...",

            "content": "Part-timer is just another light novel adaptation that grazed the anime landscape like many that have come before and after it. A work that pulls its viewers/readers in not through its excellent storytelling and characterization, but rather through it\u2019s atypical premise and how its able to pull the former around for a ride. Nonetheless the show still manages to be entertaining through its bits of comedy, production value, and more than normal characters.\r\nPart-timer starts itself of in a generic fantasy world where good and evil are in a state of conflict. Good is able to prevail over the evil and our protagonist, the demon lord,makes an escape through the portal with one of his generals. This of course leads him to the human world because plot demands so. Not only are they in the human world, but they also have no magic except for the times they do but not enough to go back to their world. Now that they are stuck in the human world, they try their best to get a job and make a decent living in their new environment. Over the course of the series other characters from their previous world also start to pop-up, some of the good and others not so much. Despite their being being antagonists as well as some backdrop of a war in the fantasy world, there's very little action in the show. For the moments there are, they are fine but it's mostly in the protagonists favor as the plot demands that he regain an unknown amount of power to overpower everyone. The comedy of the show is fine as well although the use of pop culture/statistics is very unnecessary. For the most part the comedy comes from the subversion of expectations, but that gets over done early on in the show. It also doesn\u2019t help that comedy supersedes everything from drama to tension leading to a lot of tonal whiplash.the show, like most LN adaptations, has a short run-time leaving the story incomplete, and ends on a rather boring note. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of characters are rather 2-dimensional at best for the most. They each have some sort of characterization and development that doesn\u2019t make them flat, but not enough that makes them well rounded individuals. They are mostly there for the service of the premise with the heroes and villains being the inverse of what they usually should be. The demons for the most part being nice and law abiding, and the heroes being more antagonistic. There\u2019s not much more to it than the fact that being the inverse is in some way suppose to be funny since it\u2019s a subversion of expectation. The interactions that the characters have with each other is entertaining and funny, but that as well starts to feel repetitive by the end of the show. They\u2019re just funny caricatures that are in service of the premise. \\n\\n\r\nThe production value of this show fluctuates between being pretty good to just painfully average.the character designs are very generic, but are also very appropriate and appealing for this kind of show. The background designs are fine as well from contemporary japan, and the small bits of the fantasy world that are given a glimpse of. The animation for the show is also good at times not just the action scenes, but also just in movement in general. However there are also dips in graphic fidelity even in scenes where not much is happening. Still the best part of the show is the facial expressions of the characters and how they react to certain situation, although even that can come of as average with chio being the main example. The voice acting for the show is fine, most of it is average but they work well with the characters. The soundtrack is a mix of light poppy songs and fantasy orchestrals. Both are fine for the most part, but mostly unmemorable and usually undercut from the characters talking.\\n\\n\r\nPart-time is just an ok show to sit down, watch, laugh a bit, and throw aside. It\u2019s a show just made for entertainment and hopes that the viewers can be entertained from it.... And to buy the light novels.",

            "content": "[EDIT: I NO LONGER AGREE WITH THIS REVIEW]\r\nI'd say this is easily one of the funniest anime I've ever seen. This is due to fact that they not just make jokes, but they also poke fun at modern things. I still remember the line where they subtly mocked the script of the Bee Movie. The idea of Satan using his leadership abilities to work at ripoff McDonald's and his servant basically turning into his mother was a great set up for comedy. What I love most is that the main characters' story episodes show a serious backstory and then the next episode you'll see themeating noodles with their enemy. I personally didn't like Emilia but she was a reminder that these people do have supernatural abilities, and with that constant reminder,the overall premise doesn't get boring. The comedy was solid, the premise was unique and hilarious, the characters for the most part were nice, the art animation were a okay, and I enjoyed this very much. Everyone should watch it if they want a good laugh. However, towards the end, there are some serious parts. This part of the story isn't really at memorable. If you were to ask people what they thought of the show, they probably wouldn't even bring those points up and just talk about the comedy.",

Also there are battles which change the pace of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i love about the show is how these demonic duo in human forms struggle with their daily lives and are able to show so much innocence and pure heartness but that is also the weak point as in why they show such innocence when they were supposed to be bad enough to be overthrowed. This change sure seems forced but the story does not go deep into it.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist acquires a simple day job at mcronalds (ripped from MCdonalds)which seems to be fun almost me wanting to work there(that wont happen).\\n\\n\r\nFinally i would like to say that those who like comedy and even those who dont must watch this show and i am sure you will have laughs all way long.",

Oh what a pleasant surprise I had when our MC had to escape his world.\r\nOur MC's old world, he ruled it, he conquered it, till that day when the world fought back. He manages to escape, but not without sticking out like a sore thumb. Lacking the knowledge of the land, the locals, and the language, our MC struggles to get by.\r\nThe hilarity of our casts' adjustment to the world was a blast to watch. Their interactions with other humans and how they mentally processhow and what things are is one fun journey to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest shining parts is the characters. One in particular for me was the right hand man of our MC, who has amazing loyalty to a fault and the lines of perfection. The English voice actors had a great time and so did I.\\n\\n\r\nI ended up getting McGronalds...uh I mean, McDonalds, twice because of this show. Man, I still have a stupid grin whenever I think of this show.\\n\\n\r\nI direly recommend it to be watched dubbed. We all have fun here in McGronalds.",

Lucifer and Ashiya really are excellent supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, in my opinion this should be treated as a comedy anime more than any other genre, I recommend watching this anime after watching some heartbreaking anime or just you are in the mood for some laughs. The story would keep you entertained while the comedy would make you finish it in one sitting, the characters are really enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nIf we get a second season of this anime with a more in depth story, more romance and more fighting scenes, we may be looking for a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nBest Aspects for the Show\\n\r\n+Really good characters\\n\r\n+Boredom Killer\\n\r\n+Intersting Story\\n\r\n+Amazing Comedy\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didnt like\\n\r\n-MC is dense af\\n\r\n-Not much Story Development\\n\r\n- It lacks Romance\\n\r\n- Needs more fighting scenes",

Just the whole plot itself is funny. Satan comes to Earth and works at McDonalds??? That has to be funny. What sets this anime apart from most others is that some comedy anime nowadays rely heavily on fan service to be funny. Like generic girl with big boobs falls on pervert guy. I thought it was going to be like that, but NONE of that in this anime. I meanthis anime created hilarious situations and it paid off. The jokes, the situations, the characters, the interactions, all just so funny and well done.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime and all, but there were minor things that I would like to bring up. Although the main character gave his reasoning for his change in attitude on Earth, I just don't buy it. He goes from being a world conqueror, to what he is in the anime? I can overlook that because I like he grows as a character and I respect and root for him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime had me dying of laughter. Good clean humor. I wish that there could be more anime like this instead of the anime adding fan service which sometimes makes the anime uncomfortable to watch and takes away from the humor if used wrong. I don't want you guys to think that I hate fan service , but when it takes away from the anime, that's when I don't like it. That's beside the point though, this anime was hilarious and I like each of the characters and I liked how everyone developed over the episodes.",

Now that you're aware of this, let's continue. \r\nI enjoyed watching this anime for several reasons. First, I really liked the character of Maou-Sama, even though I was expecting him to be more profound with time but not really (we don't really learn much about him actually). Secondly, I really enjoyed the jokes. This anime is a com, and it made me laugh a lot, so I would say it reached its achievements about that. What I liked is that there is humour even inthe most inappropriate scenes. You don't see it coming, you are worried and everything then BAM you laugh hysterically. That's what Hataraku Maou-Sama did to me. \\n\r\nBut there is a big lack of story, sadly. No real progress and the end is... Im not ready to talk about the end. Im not sure I will get over this disappointment haha. \\n\r\nAnyway, a good serie to laugh, easy to watch, with some great characters (I really enjoyed Maou and Alciel), but don't expect too much.",

            "content": "As the main info I can tell you is released in April 2013 anime, consisting only 1 season (currently) of 13 episodes. Genres we can highlight: fantasy & comedy.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story takes us into a world where magic, Ente Island. There we meet our protagonist, King Demon (Maou in Japanese) Satan, who with the help of his 4 general demons and an army conquered almost the entire worldwide .\r\nBut the \"forces of bien'' territories begin to overcome the demons with the help of a strong heroine, so much so that just corralling the demon king in his castle and has no choice but to create aninterdimensional portal and run along with Alsiel (the last general that remains).\\n\\n\r\nWhat is not expected is that it ended up in the human world, a world without magic where they have to find a way to return to their world as they have lost most powers ....\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's not all as the heroine, Emilia, follow them into that portal to find them in the human world.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here begins the fun story, because until Maou regain his powers  will have to live as a human, and that's what you do: starting work on the Mc Donalds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLet's move on to paragraph design of the characters, here I can say it is a fairly regular anime regarding design. It does not have a design that greatly highlight but it is bad, that is, it is an anime with a normal design, no more, no menos.hataraku-maou-sama-wallpaper-Sasaki-chiho-emi-yusa-bikini\\n\\n\r\nTurning now to what you were expecting ... ..if I know ... ..the OPPAIS. Well, well, relax commented that now, in terms tits girls all we can highlight is the front of Chiho (Maou coworker), which is not bad the truth. The other girls anime have nothing to startle (literally lol).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the personality we can highlight that of Maou, which is a very nice guy despite being the demon king, although not well understood the girls the truth, but good is forgiven because it's the fucker. We also have the personality of Alsiel, which I love because it often acts as a mother and others as a servant, is very funny truth, and also good we Emilia but the truth is that I did not just convince her personality, is Tsundere\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIn animation we can highlight very well animated moments, which are the fights with magic, are fine, but since you are quite a few fights I think they have not had much work the animation.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it is a more than good throughout the anime animation and that's good\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for the music not much to highlight because as primarily a comedy anime music would not be a key paragraph in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, at moments of action and fights has a pretty good background music, although it is normal to have (like all animes) continues to be a positive.\\n\\n\r\nSo in music it would be a point where they could have done the best.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\nMy personal opinion of this anime is very favorable. I have to say that is a very original anime that combines moments of comedy with moments of demonic action, not to mention that the protagonist has some moments. the truth is that it has an innovative story that combines the typical anime demon with a quite original comedy achieving this great piece.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way I would like to stress that in this anime put many major brands of real life but changing some names (copyright) which is quite funny, for example, instead of Mc Donalds is Mc Ronalds, and instead of KFC is SFC.\\n\\n",

I honestly didn't really know what to expect and I think that's what this show excels at.  On the cover it really doesn't seem like much.  I have seen a bunch of \"demon king no yadadadadas\" popping up recently and they haven't really gotten a good rep.  I can say for sure though this is worth the watch.  The humor is the best amount of simple (not entirely too stupid, but still has those classic anime gags you see).  The actionis good; there's nothing entirely groundbreaking or special about it, but it still looks nice.  The characters are great and watching them interact is why the show is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI do have some more critical points I want to make.  I personally didn't understand the reason for the school episode (Episode ).  It seemed like a filler if anything ad they probably could have thought of something more creative and original.  But I guess that's fiction for you.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that though I have nothing really terrible to say about the show.  I wouldn't say it's one of the bests, but it's great and worth the watch for 13 episodes.  This is originally a series of light novels, so be on the look out for a possible season 2 if you're a fan.",

I just like eating there. \r\n  By the way, I've been meaning to ask you this, but, are you and  Chiho Sasaki dating? I mean, you guys are surprisingly close and I even saw you two together at one point. Another thing, there's someone with pink hair following you around everywhere. I think her name was Emi Yusa. Is she any good for you?\r\n  Oh, yes!There's another topic I'd like to bring up. What is your opinion on boys' love? A friend of mine visited your house and told me all about it. Her name is Suzuno Kamazuki. She told me that there's another boy in your house by the name of Shirou Ashiya and that he was acting like a wife. So, I was just wondering if you were okay with that.\\n\\n\r\n  Now that I've got the important topics out of the way, I'd like to talk about the whole magic and Ente Isla thing that Chiho and Suzune always talk about. It must be so cool to be some sort of demon king from another world! You have to demonstrate some of that magic stuff to me at some point. Seeing as your here now, you must have some sort of space-dimensional powers. Can I go there sometime, please?\\n\\n\r\n On to the question , why are you here in the first place? Did you lose or something because that's what every demon king I know of in games and manga do when they lose.  But, if that were the case, then, wouldn't the pink-haired chick be the hero that whooped your butt? Or is she in love with you? Then again, that'd make her a stalker either way. Creepy.\\n\\n\r\n  Anyway, I would like a response to this letter as soon as possible. I want to hear from you outside the register.

Hataraku maou-soma is about a demon king who works at wcdonalds aka mcdonalds! But he didnt get transported alone with a companion and emilia. Emilai is the hero. I seriously think she likes him because of the way she acts when shes around, though this is not a romance anime its comedy! Of course when a new restraunt for chicken comes it all changes. You know somethins up when the owner is some creepy weirdo. The best conseptbut it could be funnier in some areas though, other than that its really good. And i founfd that a demon working at mcdonals was a great idea and adding the chracter who happenes to be practically obssesed with the main man\\n\\n\r\nFull of laughter and suspense(well a little)",

            "content": "Story: I know exactly what you're thinking. When a devil is working in a fast food joint, you'd think this is stupid as hell, am I right? Well, it's a comedy, so what would you expect? Actually, it goes a lot deeper than just the King of Devils being trapped in the mortal world, trying to get along by working at a Japanese parody of McDonald's. There are emotional moments. There are painful battles to watch. There are friendships being made here. It does more than just tell jokes about the devil working as a part-timer. I will tell you that the manga explains alot more since this show is only 13 or less episodes with no season 2 in the works as of now. It made me want more, and I guess because it was harping on the fact that I should read the original source material, that's why it's the way it is. Is it bad? No, but don't be shocked that it has a cliffhanger. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is pretty clean, but I expected a lot more out of it. I mean, the designs that come down the road later are creepy to the bone, and they work, but I expected a lot good fighting scenes and I didn't get that. I guess I'm being spoiled because I expected it to be like Stigma of the Wind, but it's not. But still, I would've appreciated a little more dedication into it. So I would say 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening is very catchy. It also tells you immediately what the story is about. But seriously, the catchiness is so fun because the show is meant to be fun. It starts going to downhill in the endings. They were pretty boring, so when I watched them on Netflix, I just skipped to the next episode. It's not all bad though, so I would rate this an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are a pretty interesting bunch. However, you know how much I hate the bitchy female lead. Kinda like Maka from Soul Eater, her only personality is to be the hero of Heaven and to destroy all evil at all costs even when Maou is not doing anything wrong. Sure, she has redeeming qualities around her friends, but her only emotion towards Maou is hatred, and I can't stand it! Maybe the manga shows more personality out of her, but this bitch is annoying in the anime. Just warning you now. Speaking of Maou, though he may be single-minded at times, he does care about the people close to him. I think the joke is for him to say that his job is important to him, but he's more than that entirely. Even his assistant is hilarious. Oh, when you meet Lucifer, that's when it gets good. However, I think the best girl character is Chiho. She plays the innocent, and she's absolutely smart, and she does have a life of her own. It's not like her whole purpose is dedicated to Maou. However, she does have her funniest moments, and I feel bad that she tries to get Maou to like her, but he doesn't notice at all. I can easily say that characters are an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thought this show was funny, but it's not Assassination Classroom. I don't know if it's because I watched the dub over the sub, but I don't think that matters. I still found it fun to watch. I've seen better, but it's still good, so 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Do I recommend this show? Uh, sure, but as soon as you finish this show and you haven't already, read the manga. If you read the manga first, you'll be pretty disappointed. That's why the finished product rating is 7/10.",

            "content": "So, to start this off I\u2019m going to share my complaints on an anime with a similar goal as The Devil Is a Part-Timer, Konosuba season 1. It was supposed to be like an adventure comedy, however, it completely abandoned any kind of plot for the sake of comedy. In all honesty, I expected the same to happen for this show. Thankfully I was wrong. Not only does it have an interesting plot but it perfectly balances the comedy with the serious moments, so the audience can actually really get into the serious scenes yet be able to laugh and smile at the lighter moments.The show also has an interesting and colorful cast to match. The characters really do bounce off of each other in very interesting and entertaining ways.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, I can\u2019t really say I had any problems with this anime and this so happens to be one of the very few I wouldn\u2019t mind a sequel to. I usually do not put my time and energy into sequels as most of the time the first season has given me enough of the story or it seems unnecessary. However, for this one, I wouldn\u2019t mind more. It seems like the characters still have a long way to go with each other. Some of the characters\u2019 interactions/thoughts/feelings in the last episode defiantly proves this point.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it has a rather prevalent plot with a few twist and light moments. The balance between comedy and actual serious moments was rather impressive as shows often tend to mess up that mix by either trying too hard, or, not having it at all when it\u2019s needed. Heck, a lack of some serious moments can make even a comedy seem tedious after a while, so I\u2019m glad it had some serious, darker fantasy elements while still being a fun and light show overall.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I defiantly suggest you at least give this anime a try. It\u2019s a rather fun experience and overall is a great comedy.",

            "content": "Well, now I want some KFC. Thanks Satan.\r\nOh yeah, my review. Well, I was really bored and was looking for some anime to watch, and I found this. It was pretty strange, and had a Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid feeling, but I enjoyed it.\r\nStory: The story of The Devil is a Part Timer is pretty simple. You're greeted by 2 people who don't fit in the world, and you watch how they adapt to their environment. Except, what if these two people are demons from a magical world? That's exactly what happened in this anime. Two demons without magic trying to survive. Oh, and otherpeople went through the gate, only to stay just cause'.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this is normal for a Slice of Life anime, but then it goes into the fight scenes. The fight scenes are drawn very well, with grayscale even being used when they put up magical barriers. Did I mention that there's effects used for people's auras?\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in this anime was pretty good. I liked how there were the songs that played when someone was being stupid, or during the super-intense fight scenes. But the real star was the voice acting. Ashiya, one of Maou's generals, caught my attention in particular. The voice actor contrasts between emotions subtly, and the change in mood from him being annoyed at Emilia to him telling a fake story was great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development in this anime takes the form of the characters learning how to survive in a world without magic. While doing this, the other characters talk about how the other characters were, and how different they were before. For instance, Maou, A.K.A Satan, doesn't care about conquering the world, since he found that human life seems pretty fun.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed The Devil is a Part Timer a good amount. I love the scenes of random comedy, like all of Lucifer's antics while being a shut-in NEET. But most importantly, this anime taught me that the Cool Down rule was a real thing that I could use for actual scams. I'd recommend this anime to you if you enjoy Slice of Life animes that also have a bit of randomness and fantasy elements. \\n\\n\r\nnote: This is my third anime review of the day, so I'm burned out. Sorry if I say things over again.",

            "content": "Hilarious, complete and original comedy in this anime. Hataraku Maou sama is a very hilarious outlook on what seemed to be an anime industry that relies on tropes and repeated gags. Maou sama goes the different way, it took a different path in it's portrayal of comedy and action mixed with a little bit of Romance.\r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nThe story is very much original (not many anime with a Devil who works at a fast food restaurant don't you think?). It's very hilarious with original and new jokes time and time again and the way it handles this is absolutely brilliant. Especially when Maou and Emijab at each other. Towards the end too, the anime didn't lose it's footing and still delivered extraordinarily. The story was pretty fresh albeit with one or two usual tropes roped in but otherwise was very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful. I would like to give a special focus on the eyes. The eyes were beautifully designed as well as the backgrounds during the show. It could have been a little bit better during the fights though, otherwise it was great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was really catchy and immersive to hear. The OP in particular is a hilarious intake as well as the voices matching perfectly with the personality. The Seiyuus did a wonderful job especially Maou's VA perfectly matched his voice with his character. Another shout-out would go to Chi-chan's VA who also amazingly mirrored the Moe persona of her character too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there was very less character development it might be excused due to the fact that the characters had pretty unique personalities themselves and grew little over the series, if that's good or bad is up to you. I would really give a shout-out to Emi and Suzuno for their marvelous character development as they matured a lot during the series. Suzuno had matured a lot towards the end, but this is a spoiler free review so see for yourself how she did so.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I really enjoyed this anime, I got a lot of laughs through this and although the romance was not too deeply explored (which is a shame because it would have come out really good) it was worthwhile watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall with a strong story and set of characters (not to mention the excellent slapstick comedy) this is really the go to anime if you're interested in the genre. A must watch for all Comedy fans! In terms of Sub and Dub I prefer the Sub more as the Dub gets a bit cheesy so with that out of the way I would like to conclude by saying it's a must watch as it goes out of the way than other anime. Go McRonald's!!!",

            "content": "This review may be shorter than the one I normally do but, I will try to give as much info as I can without spoiling the story for you.\r\nThe story revolves around Maou a former devil king from another world Ente Isla after a failed campaign of conquest in that world he retreats to Earth where he discovers he doesn't have enough magical power to return, so both he and Alsiel try to live everyday normal human lives as they try to find a way back whilst finding themselves in various predicaments. As you can tell the story doesn't go out of its way totell something like Highschool DXD does, in fact most of the story just revolves around the funny and ridiculous situations that Maou and his friends get themselves into. The series is more a less Demon/Angels with more slice of life thrown compared to other shows like it. There are many moments where you'll find yourself laughing at what happens, and thankfully the series goes out of its way to put it characters into as many enjoyable funny situation but, rightful ones at that. Many shows out there try to throw to many comedic moments into their shows to the point where they just aren't funny to laugh at, thankfully Hataraku Maou-sama does it right by mixing in a nice blend of comedic value with a serious story to it. On the note of the 'serious' story sometimes it can be lacklustre to see scenes featuring Ente Isla or situations on Earth that revolve around the decisions of the other world however, these scenes far and few between, and most of them are enjoyable to watch because of the comments and actions of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good it follows your typical anime art style which holds up well, in the fight scenes the blend magical powers are nice to see but, those scenes are either too short or too few to really bring out the splendour in the art. On the other hand when scenes of Ente Isla are shown that is where the art truly shines, the sceneries may be simple most of the time but, they're brought out by a great mix of colours in the background to make it pop on your scene. And the auras that surround both demon and angels make for a nice hazy but clear design that makes it a bit quirky to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound there's not much to say about it really the sound effects for magical powers aren't new they're much the same as most shows that have magical powers. The soundtrack isn't mind blowing to behold but, it's not bad it gives many scenes that nice little touch to make them a bit more lively. The voice acting was good except maybe a few scenes could of had a bit more meaningfulness to them to bring out more scenes more effectively. Where the soundtrack truly scenes is it's opening song which is a great track to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are enjoyable to watch however, don't expect the show to break any stereotypes here it just does a great job at bringing out the best for its characters. Maou is a likable character for once he's a devil king with intelligence not like some who have no idea or just go with the flow so it makes for a nice change of pace. Emilia is likable too, to be honest I'm not a fan of tsundere's in general as I stated my dislike for one somewhat similar stereotype in Gundam Unicorn however, when it comes to tsundere's in comedies that a direction thing and thankfully Emilia is one that I like. Chiho is another likable character as she's a cute character and makes scenes more lively as she does have that feature about her, she does have somewhat of a tsundere nature towards girls that like Maou but it's a really miniscule level. Suzano I don't know I couldn't really bring myself to like she's not a bad character she just doesn't really bring much to the table for me, she's relatively talkative in a tedious sense most of the time, but that's just personal opinion. Finally Alsiel and Lucifer are basically to me the funniest of the main cast, seeing that in my opinion they have the best scenes (that doesn't mean the other characters aren't funny though). Alsiel adores Maou a lot as his king respecting him with the utmost sometimes it leading to some amusing encounters between him and those that bad mouth Maou. As for Lucifer he did start off as a villain but, he eventually turns into the typical offish laid back teenager of today getting up to mischief over the web. There are a few other characters in my opinion I don't think they're important enough warrant going into detail about.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment throughout the show was pretty high I don't remember having any low points whilst watching it just wish there was another season, if so I'd be happy to watch it. On the other hand though it's reached the four year mark when this show stopped airing so they'll be a continuation is debateable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is fun to enjoy and well worth spending a few hours to go through whilst passing some time, don't expect any grand story line like similar shows try to do. As long as you look at it like a slice of life of a devil king you'll be fine. I hope you enjoyed this review and thanks for putting in some time to read it!",

            "content": "What do you think the leader of a demon army would do if stuck in our world with no magic. World conquest or chaos? How about casual employment? The Devil is a Part Timer (also known as Hataraku Maou-sama) shows the lifestyle of the demon leader trying to scrape out a living in modern Japan when he ends up stranded there.\r\nThis show is a great blend of three of my favourite genres; fantasy, comedy, and slice-of-life. It turns out that Satan (or Maou Sadao as he decides to call himself in Japan), has a very driven, responsible streak and on realising that there\u2019s currently noway to return to his home world of Ente Isla where he was conducting a campaign of world domination, settles down to aiming to be the best possible employee of *definitely not McDonalds* MgRonalds. Unfortunately, what with a hero trying to chase him down and other visitors from Ente Isla, a peaceful life isn\u2019t on the cards.\\n\\n\r\nWe don\u2019t see a lot of the world of Ente Isla, it\u2019s mainly featured just in the first episode, but it seems to be a fairly standard fantasy world with a theocracy. There is enough in the sequences that we\u2019re shown to get a bit of a taste of life in Ente Isla and its contrast to life in Japan. Both visually, and in terms of the events, it feels that Japan is a much lighter and more open world.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is mostly based around treating everyday situations with excessive gravitas. While we would take running a household or part time work for granted, for Demons and Heroes from another world, all of this is new and different, and at times difficult. It\u2019s funny to see how earnest the characters are as they attempt to go about their daily lives.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a good dose of action, and the fights while not spectacular are quite fun to watch. The comedy and action elements are separate, but they blend well in the story and it doesn\u2019t feel jarring to jump from one to the other.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m normally someone who is quite content for series to end where they are, even if there are some loose ends or there\u2019s still source material to be adapted, but I must say that I\u2019d love to see another season of this show. The ending felt satisfying (although the final episode was an anime original and a bit different in tone to the rest of the series), but it felt like we could have seen more! The interaction of the characters was very enjoyable and I think that it would be great to see them in some new situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe show, while I don\u2019t think it has any strong themes or message and is primarily light-hearted fun, does showcase some of the beauty and light-heartedness of the everyday. Watching the demon leader Alciel carefully plan a household budget, or Satan worry about damage to his bicycle shows that even the drudgery of every day life can be fun and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe Devil is a Part Timer was very much an enjoyable viewing experience, and a show I feel that I could happily watch again. I\u2019d recommend it to people who enjoy comedy series.",

            "content": "This anime has one of the most off-the-wall premises I've seen since Girls und Panzer and executes the comedy beautifully but only in the beginning. Being stranded in Japan from their original world of demons versus anime made for some of the funniest moments. In fact, I'd say the characters were outstanding and made this anime as enjoyable as it was and potentially even more enjoyable if the story hadn't fell through. The pacing and timing of going from high ranking top officials of the other world and regulating them to two single men struggling to make it by in an single room apartment madefor some hilarious themes consistently throughout the entire series. Their penny pinching and struggle to adapt to their new home and assimilate into life in Japan was very amusing. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the only thing  I was disappointed with was the lack of resolution for all the bad guys and the conflict between the main characters. I hate when stories don't resolve anything, more so than crappy endings, which is why I'm giving the story a rating of 5. All of the elements they introduced in the story, like the motivations of each character, the conflict between the characters and the church, and conflict with each other and their previous rivalries- none of it gets touched on or resolved. Only introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe last couple of episodes somewhat lost it's direction on what made this anime such a great series. What made this anime great was the characters awkwardness adapting and fitting into normal lives when they clearly are not normal. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is definitely a great anime to check out for it's laugh and minor romance but for its lack of follow-through to the end, even great ingredients can't make up for a lack of a good story.",

It balanced the genres properly and very understandable dialogue. Sweeteness and Punchlines in its ROM-COM are present and the back story of each character was classified in an appropriate manner.\r\nArt = 8 \r\n     Art is also great, I especially liked its detail and I think it suites well in the anime.\r\nSound = 7It is good nothing to add about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 9\\n\r\n     Interaction between characters are clear but I want more Maou X Emi scenes it felt like a huge cliffhanger. Supporting characters are also adding up to the comedy part mostly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 9\\n\r\n     If your a fan of ROM-COM then you would certainly love this one, very enjoyable I assure you...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, It was a great ride... Hoping for season 2 (quickly)...\\n\\n\\n",
