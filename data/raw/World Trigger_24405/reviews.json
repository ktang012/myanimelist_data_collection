            "content": "People are too quick to call a series a \u201cunderrated\u201d. This is because it\u2019s not easy to gauge the popularity of a series in relation to the following you think it \"should\" have. If I were to make a list of underrated series, that list would be incredibly short. It would also include World Trigger which isn't a label typically attached to a Weekly Shonen Jump series. An up and comer in WSJ that drew interest in the when it began to air from the mere fact the it ran in that magazine, that interest almost immediately dissipated in the first couple of episodes. Suddenly,everyone remembered that it's Toei animating the series, and being surprised that a bad animation studio badly animates TV shows, they dropped the series. This is a reminder of how heavily influential the actual animation of an anime is for viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs per most WSJ series, World Trigger starts off slow introducing its world, concept, and characters, before kicking off into the actual conflict. Enemies come from another dimension, people set up an organization to stop them, right, yes, whatever. Fairly straightforward Jump exposition dumping. Mainly bizarre is the anime\u2019s weird name sense, though does get better later. The series starts out as main character Mikumo Osamu finds out a neighbor, Kuga Yuma, transferred into his school. Things gets more interesting around 10 episodes in when Border finds out what he is and attempt to deal with him, and even more so later when Border comes into conflict with other Neighbor worlds.\\n\\n\r\nOsamu is extremely weak but he\u2019s well worked as a character. Initially introduced as a morally righteous individual, it was shown in initial scenes that simply being righteous was useless when he gets his ass kicked pathetically by his classmates while Kuga watches. He never gains anything undeserved and doesn't win just because he's more virtuous or emotional than his opponent. He struggles with his lack of strength and his goals in the story, often fearing inadequacy and failure. This is really one of the big things that Jump has traded away over the past few years. I certainly do not expect some inner turmoil on par with shows like Evangelion and others, but seeing protagonists struggle with themselves and make mistakes is always welcome. This combines with Osamu's efforts to improve which are well thought out and interesting to watch. Though somewhat smart his honesty, despite the potential self damage it incurs, is appealing. It creates a good underdog character. And most of the characters run along similar lines of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nShonen Jump has a tendency to constantly have the MC in the spotlight before all else as the recognizable face of the series. Whenever there\u2019s a big fight, the MC is always in the lead, even if the fight has little to do with him. He may or may not give a big speech rebuking his opponent, often with little actual relevance to that conflict. Osamu is the antithesis of this. The MC doesn\u2019t preach to the opposition, or the viewership, which gets highly annoying and silly if not meaningful. Characters are no longer shoved into some the unnecessary \u201cgood guy\u201d and \u201cbad guy\u201d categories. \\n\\n\r\nThis means that characters have to more be defined by their thoughts and actions as people, not just as a hero or villain. This helps the author bring attention to the vast cast without having the audience first watch a huge amount of content. It\u2019s frequent that a huge cast is introduced and only really make a small amount of that huge cast is interesting, or they all end up boring even if a huge amount of time is spent on the characters. They're all just there to make up numbers, but it doesn't feel that way with World Trigger. This is because they don't take up huge amounts of screen time or hold big 1v1 battles involving irrelevant characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe power system is actually quite interesting for the series. Fighting series are defined and remembered by their power systems. World Trigger is no different. Jojo, One Piece, DBZ, Hakusho are all examples of this done positively. Usually most shonen series which involve abilities usually center around everyone having their own unique ability, but that's not the case. The system is simple, but the way it's implemented makes it a great system as it still allows creativity but does away with individual gimmicks of one character having a silly overpowered ability, or powering up until he has one. \\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger\u2019s trion system resembles a video game in its use. The show places tangible importance on the skills of the individual user, how they use what they have, the situation they are in, and how they fight with those around them. This is what make the battles truly exciting in World Trigger. They rely more so on strategy and very rarely if ever is there an outright power battle between two characters. It enticing to see how each character uses the weapons along with their own skills. And even if you're stronger, it's possible to lose in a way that's not an asspull designed just so the protagonist can win. While I do love to see a couple characters duke it out and try to kick each other\u2019s ass every now and then, this is fun and refreshing in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nI bring up Jump, the target Shounen demographic, and other shows that make these strange errors frequently because that\u2019s the standard. Those are all the tropes and oft-used clich\u00e9s. Those are all the unnecessary additives along with the annoying detractions that appear in this specific genre, particularly recently. These series hold a lot in common with each other and end up stiffly adhering to a formula to satisfy an audience and they fail to hold the entertain value that they strive for because of it. There\u2019s definitely good in World Trigger, but that comes out because it doesn\u2019t do basic things improperly. It doesn\u2019t do things that are unnecessary, out of character, or out of line.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, I mentioned that the first 10 episodes are quite slow, but any further pacing issues come down to how this show was animated and directed. World Trigger's first 10 or so episodes look god awful, plain and simple. Stills, the rehashed Trigger activation animation, and occasional strange lack of frames in scenes contribute to this. Luckily, they managed to get rid of 2 of these problems as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue that persisted is the stills. I found them strangely endearing at times and they got me to laugh at their placement and how unbelievable it was. There are frequents moments in each episode where the frame sits on a character's face for several seconds as they say/do absolutely nothing. In most other anime, you'd see panning shots and some sort of camera movement or change in perspective when there is no dialogue to keep the viewer occupied. \\n\\n\r\nVarious scenes are also censored even though most action takes place in a fake body. It\u2019s annoying, but bearable. Even with these problems World Trigger may be the best animated of Toei's TV works of the current century, particularly with how underwhelming One Piece is and what little I've seen of Dragonball Super. This should be fairly embarrassing. All fight scenes are done pretty nicely and it's nice to see that Toei at least doesn't slack off here.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I've seen an OP/ED stuck in the middle of an episode. They're good though and for the most part the OST is as well. Toei still uses the same old not so dramatic sound effects that we've heard all the way back since DBZ aired. You'll also find it in One Piece. This helps to draw out various stills and take up episode time.\\n\\n\r\nReally I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed the anime as I was expected to eventually drop it and just go with the manga like with One Piece, but it worth at looking into. \\n\\n\r\nThe filler sucks so don't watch it. It\u2019s genuinely like they tried to put Pokemon battles in World Trigger. It\u2019s insane.\\n",

            "content": "The 2010s era of anime was a great time for shounen jump anime adaptations because, for the most part, all the shounen jump adaptations were not only great in terms of quality but they managed to be near perfect adaptations. Sure some of them had filler episodes in it but compared to other shounen jump anime adaptations from the past decade or two they were pretty good for what they are despite being non-canon. Haikyuu, Assassination Classroom, Bakuman, Hunter x Hunter 2011 and My Hero Academia are the some of the best examples of this of how to adapt the source maternal correctly as wellhaving its own charm in the mix.\\n\r\nNow out of all the anime series from shounen jump that came out in the last 8 years, I feel like World Trigger is the most underrated of the bunch.\\n\r\nWhy is that you may ask?\\n\r\nYou're soon going to find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mikado City Humans are overwhelmed at first when their weapons are found to be useless against Neighbors, until a mysterious organization appears that is able to repel the Neighbors' attacks. The organization is called the National Defence Agency, or \"Border,\" and has appropriated the Neighbor technology called \"Triggers,\" which allows the user to channel an internal energy called Trion and use it as a weapon or for other purposes. By activating a trigger, the body of users is replaced by a battle-body made of trion which is stronger and more resistant. Members of Border are divided in three ranks, A, B, and C, with only the members of rank A possessing the most powerful triggers, comparable in strength to those of Neighbors.\\n\\n\r\nFour years later Mikado City has gotten used with the occasional battles with the Neighbors and have returned more or less to their everyday lives. The story follows a Yuma Kuga who transfers to Third Mikado City Middle School where he meets another boy named who is a Border Agent. However, it turns out that Yuma is actually a Humanoid Neighbor, and his arrival signifies that not all is what it seems in the war against the Neighbors.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty good for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, World Trigger does a great job at establishing its own world and setting.\\n\\n\r\nBorder is not like your typical shounen school setting which forces character interaction right down your through between set characters, it doesn't force countless written exams in such upon character for basic characterization but instead Border functions like an organization where no one is characterized solely of how overpowered and smart they but instead the method in which they come about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe power system for world trigger was very interesting as well being well expanded it great detail. The Trion system in World Trigger resembles like a video game where you have to master the class purpose in combat as well mastering its skills for that class to deal with situations that they are in so they can fight back. This reason alone is why I adored the fight structure in World Trigger because instead a of having a bunch of overpowered characters ganging up on strong foe where they will most likely get defeated unless the writer does a random asspull the characters in World Trigger actually have to work together by communicatingwith each other as well planning out strategies and tactics to defeat their foes. Thanks to the great fight structuring the fights in World Trigger are extremely unpredictable to a point where you never know who is going to win in the end which adds more tension to the fights and because of this all the arcs minus that filler was all fun watch even if the pacing of the show can be a bit too slow at times which I will talk about in a bit.\\n\r\nThe one thing that World Trigger was successful is its themes of teamwork and commutation where characters have to get along as well synergize with each other in order to win fights.\\n\\n\r\nAs much I praise the story of World Trigger as well how different it was in terms of setting, unfortunately, it has two flaws that completely hold it back from being one of the greats. I'm, honestly not going to pretend that World Trigger has great pacing, in fact, World Trigger at various times has pacing issues where it\u2019s too slow to a point where certain parts of the show where there were no fights involve just seemed to drag on to a point where at times the show can get boring to sit through. Personality the pacing in World Trigger didn\u2019t bother me all that much as I am used to shows that have slow pacing but I do acknowledge that it\u2019s a problem especially for fans of the shounen genre who are very used to fast-paced shounen like Naruto, Fairy Tail and My Hero Academia.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing issues in World Trigger didn\u2019t bother me that all that much the second and final flaw almost completely ruined the show for me. The arc that I am talking about is the Fugitive Arc. As much I really liked World Trigger as a whole I simply cannot defend that arc. Not only it was a filler arc that was not good but the directing, writing and even the visuals were at an all-time low in that arc. Plus the new characters in that dreadful arc are contrived morons who were extremely unlikeable and they are just as interesting as watching grass grow. Am not joking. Lucky for me I skipped that arc during my re-watch of the show and as soon as episode 48 I jumped straight to episode 63 and nothing was lost in the progress.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re planning to watch World Trigger skip episodes 49-63 because that\u2019s where the cringe-fest filler arc begins and honestly the less you know about that arc the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall besides the horrendous filler arc that shouldn\u2019t exist as having pacing issues at times, I really liked the story for World Trigger as it\u2019s very different to many shounen series from the past in terms of setting.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has a large characters cast but at the same time, they managed to a good job of handling it\u2019s character cast minus the one in the Fugitive arc because they are shit and not worth mentioning in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nYuma is a pretty interesting character. Despite his lack of knowledge of Japanese culture and customs acts as almost a social critique of Japanese society. Yuma openly states how he doesn't approve of specific traditions and the \"way things are\" in Japan, which really delivers a message to the audience in the form of social critique which was a nice touch to this series. I also adored his character interactions with the other characters in this series as they are often interesting as well being hilarious to watch. Yuma character interactions along made me chuckle a lot. Besides Yuma being funny he is also a strong character who gets developed very well and his backstory overall was nicely told it honestly made me tear quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nJin is a badass character that I loved. I loved his layback personality as well being a general badass on screen. I also liked his views of the Neighbor where despite losing his mother to a Neighbor he still thinks that not all Neighbor are enemies where he also thinks that humans and neighbors should be friends showing that both races could co-exist. This is the stuff that I love about anime.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have mixed feelings towards Osamu. I like the fact that he\u2019s different when compared to most shounen protagonist where they are overpowered he starts off from the bottom where he is literally a weak fighter. While I like the fact, he starts off as a weak fighter I thought he never really got stronger as a character. Yes did a bit stronger as the series went on the problem he always seemed to get ass kicked by many characters in the series. However, while he's not a good fighter his determined to prove everyone wrong completely makes up as we the viewer can sympathize with. However, I will admit that he can quite be a boring character at times especially in the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, I thought Osamu was a decent character.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my least favorite character in the series minus the god-awful filler ones Chika.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I don\u2019t hate Chika by any means, in fact, she is an okay character. The problem with Chika is she is literally a coward in battle. I understand that she is a kid and all but there were moments in the series where Team Osamu could have won if Chika actually shot someone in battle. Also, Chika kinda of getting on my nerves as the series get on as she never wants to shot someone in even though she has great sniper skills. Just like a shitty pacifist fighter where they hate violence even though they are in a war zone where they no choice to fight and that pacifist will only preach they lungs out of why war is wrong. Also, out of all the charters in World Trigger, she is the blandest character in the series. She\u2019s being just eye candy for the viewer where she\u2019s only cute nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the rest of the characters in World Trigger, I was honestly shocked of how well handled and unique they are. They are not the typical throwaway side characters that you will see in most other shounen like Naruto where they don\u2019t get any real screen time. The supporting characters in world trigger all get adequate screen time alongside this show over the course of its run abandons focusing on its main trio multiple times allowing other characters in the show to shine as well consequently demonstrating it\u2019s fantastic job in avoiding the creation of a story that where every event and character interaction just serves the purpose of affecting only one to two characters *cough Naruto Shippuuden.*\\n\\n\r\nSome of my favorite side characters in world trigger include Souya, Shuuji, Kyousuke, Yousuke, Shiori, Shun, Ai and my personal favorite character in this series Kirie.\\n\\n\r\nOverall apart from Chika the characters in World Trigger were pretty great and enjoyable for what they were.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals for World Trigger my thoughts on were rather mixed.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, I really like how colorful it was. Instead of being colorful like in a typical fantasy setting it uses a sci-fi color pallet as we see a lot a lot of blues, whites, blacks and greens are used for the background scenery. The characters designs are all pretty unique, and they stand out very well from each other which was good because I was sick of tired at seeing similar character designs cough *Gundam Seed.* Unfortunately, since this show was done by Toei Animation the characters at times can go off model especially in the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, it\u2019s just decent at best. Sure at times this show can be well animated at that can deliver some great fight choreography but for the most part, the show uses basic animation with a quite a lot of still frames. It\u2019s pretty sad really because if this show was done by Madhouse or Bones than the animation would be amazing. However, I will give Toei this it\u2019s one of the better-looking shows especially when you compare to the likes of Digimon Xros Wars, Dragon Ball Super and Sailor Moon Crystal where they are consistently being a slide show filled with consistent art failures and choppy animation. Also unlike those shows, World Trigger visually gets better but it sadly will never be My Hero Academia good which is pretty sad. While the show is visually decent for the most part, the battles make it up.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals in World Trigger are pretty decent, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad as everyone thinks it is and the strategic battles of the series completely make it up.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in World Trigger is fantastic. At first, I didn\u2019t really care about the soundtrack during my first watch of World Trigger, however, as I re-watch this show I started to notice how great and well created the soundtrack is. Every single track in World Trigger is memorable, and they fit well with the tone and setting perfectly. Easily in my top 30 favorite anime soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has 3 opening themes and surprising no ending theme whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme GIRIGIRI by Sonar Pocket is a good opening theme that fits with mood with the first 23 episodes. The second and third opening themes Ashita no Hikari by AAA and Dream Trigger by Pile are some of my favorite anime opening periods. They are just a joy to listen to.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is great overall that is filled with a lot of well known talented Seiyuus.\\n\r\nI only have seen some clips of the dub on YouTube and I thought it was good overall despite being a bit cheesy in nature. I hope the dub get\u2019s release someday on the net as well having a Blu-Ray release because I would be the Blu Ray for World Trigger in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo after re-watching World Trigger for the second time what do I think about it?\\n\\n\r\nI still think World Trigger is a pretty good shounen series that has a lot of great things in it. The story, for the most part, was pretty good and interesting, the tone was great, and most of the characters are great that have a lot of charm into them and the music/voice acting was great. It does fall in the few areas, though. The pacing was too slow for the most part. The animation wasn\u2019t that constant and the filler arc overall was terrible that shouldn\u2019t exist and you should completely skip it. Despite that, I still liked World Trigger for what it is. If this show was done by any other studio than this show would had been a lot more popular but since it was done by Toei it quickly dived in the underrated territory while Assassination Classroom, Food Wars, Black Clover, Boruto My Hero Academia and Haikyuu have gained the shounen jump spotlight which is a shame because I actually liked World Trigger more than Boruto and Food Wars.\\n\\n\r\nAs a shounen jump adaptation, this was a pretty good one overall minus the filler arc and pacing issues in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, I still think World Trigger was a pretty damm good show that I recommend to people. Just make sure you skip episodes 49-63 because that's where that filler arc start and it's not worth watching in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 8/10",

Talking about the CHARACTERS the principal cast most are super smart and powerful teenagers , as i said the teenagers are super smart but in other times are only fools that only fight then start to cry and make determination dialogues to win then are super smart again , theenemies are the same but are evil adults that apparently are more mature but inferior to teenagers there personalities and development are very unbalanced also there is more characters that stereotypes of shonen  are only to make the principal characters more superiors or only waste time. The ART is simple poor the move in fights even in times that is not action is clumsy and the music is forgettable. For a final thought the series is more for teenagers that like rule of cool vibrates and feel superior even most of the enemies are describe by evil adults but this is a excuse to give a 2/10 even i can said that the of the series writers  think that teenagers are stupid so make this kind of shows\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI have a personal tradition for Christmas.\r\nEvery time the holidays roll around, and I am out and about getting gifts for my parents, I always make sure to pick them up a couple of ornaments. A new Santa one for my father, and a new snowman one for my mother. Fancy. Cute. Interesting. Whatever the make, I make sure that whichever I choose is a fun one to unwrap.\r\nIf World Trigger were a gift, I would never give it to my parents. I would never give it to any of my friends or strangers onthe street. I wouldn\u2019t even give it to my sworn nemesis.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s that deplorable.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn a world where evil Neighbors invade and Triggers are used, Osamu, a teenage boy yearning to become a member of the protective Border Agency, has a fateful encounter with an even younger boy named Yuma. Yuma, as it turns out, is also a Neighbor, but he has come to make peace not war. These two, together with their close friend Chika, find themselves supporting one another as they face the troubles laid out on their path.\\n\\n\r\nThis description is not a thorough one for World Trigger, for the anime is seventy-three episodes long. True, it is not as long as those most popular, long-running shows, but seventy-three is not a number to scoff. After all, the majority of anime are either twelve or twenty-four episodes in length.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, its length is also its downfall.\\n\\n\r\nRepetition is a concept that many people are familiar with. Especially if they watch anime or take part in discussing them. Repetition can be a positive if it is used as a plot point or as a thematic element. Often, though, it is a negative, demonstrating a show\u2019s inability to add variety or a need to linger on the same events, outcomes, and character appeals.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger takes it several leaps further.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost astounding how much the show repeats itself. Take its in-world knowledge. The different weapons, the types of Neighbors, how the structure of Border works. A lot of time is set aside to explain these arguably minor details. A smart move. Giving the audience more about how everything operates is (usually) worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in what can only be described as a blunder, the anime has this segment at the end of almost every episode called \u201cWorld Trigger Fun Facts.\u201d There, they repeat much of the same information that was already given. Those weapons? Here they are again with next to nothing new added. Those Neighbors? Covered once more with the same information. Those rankings? S, A, B, C is \u201ctough\u201d to remember, so it\u2019ll be wise to break it down again.\\n\\n\r\nThese \u201cfun\u201d facts do not stop here because, once the anime reaches roughly past the halfway mark, it begins to repeat the same info from previous segments. The guns, the Neighbors, the rankings. A lot of it is repeated \u2013 again.\\n\\n\r\nRepetition continues with Yuma\u2019s infamous pout where, for \u201ccomedic\u201d purposes, Yuma purses his lips and dons three horizontal lines for eyes. A repeated gesture that is basically a characteristic but gets used in almost every situation by him (and others). (Thankfully, the anime calms this down a bit as events get more serious later, but it still appears at a nominal rate.)\\n\\n\r\nHow about always displaying the names, ages, and roles of the different characters no matter how many times they are seen? The invariance of enemies? A need to litter every battle with explanatory dialogue rather than letting them play out?\\n\\n\r\nYet the worst (best?) example is each episode\u2019s opening. In almost every single episode, the anime replays a fixed reel with narration played on top of it. While it can change when the arc does \u2013 about once every fifteen episodes or so (so about five different sets in total) \u2013 it takes up roughly a minute and thirty seconds of that episode\u2019s time. Which in turn takes away the show\u2019s chances of doing something not repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThe kicker? The anime will then proceed to replay exact scenes from the previous episode. As though the reels were not repetitive enough, the show makes its audience sit through reused material that contains verbatim dialogue and replicated events as if it\u2019s expected.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode forty-one is particularly egregious: The first four minutes and twenty seconds are literally the overused reel and copy-pasted content from the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe repetition is horrible, but, somehow, the anime does not stop hitting itself in the face.\\n\\n\r\nPacing manages to be a problem. The first arc is recognizably slow as the show takes way too much time in setting up its characters, world, and general atmosphere for roughly twenty-one episodes. During this span, the anime does have a couple of battles and a bigger fight break out to help minimize the monotony, but it is still noticeably slowed down.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode twenty-two to thirty-five, the anime enters its large-scale-Neighborhood-invasion arc, and it is at this point that pacing goes out the portal. Over the course of these fourteen episodes, the anime stretches out hours of in-world time, slowing everything down again. It even goes so far as to extend seconds of in-world time (into minutes of airing time), killing any reasoning for the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger gets its pacing wrong again when it halts the progression of its B-Rank-Wars arc in favor of the Xeno-and-Lilith arc. Doing so killed the build-up, the sense of progression that Osamu, Yuma, and Chika had been making. It resumes the B-Rank-Wars arc later, sure, but, by that point, the paced-based damage had been done.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as if the show could not get any worse, it makes some questionable choices throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nThat Xeno-and-Lilith arc has no consequence on the events within the season. The idea is that what the group did will pay dividends sometime in the future. But, for the here and now, the arc represents nothing more than an unnecessary diversion (especially since they were supposed to be training but had to deal with this whole conflict instead).\\n\\n\r\nThe idea behind triggers switching out one\u2019s physical body for a virtual one, while futuristic, removes a lot of tension since their actual bodies are in no real danger.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode sixty interjects the arc that already interjected the arc before it. It\u2019s meant to be a comedic one-off starring \u201cTamakoma branch\u2019s most powerful member,\u201d but it has no place in the occurring narrative.\\n\\n\r\nEven how the season concludes raises eyebrows. It chooses to make the cutoff right as the newest Neighbor invasion starts as well as right before Osamu and the others go into the pivotal B-Rank match.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter tears the muscles around the eye. They aimed to win the B-Rank wars (and thus go on the away missions into the Neighborhood) all the way back in episode eleven. Meaning, even after the remaining sixty or so episodes unravel, the show fails to accomplish its original goal for the season.\\n\\n\r\nAll these problems are bad on their own, but, again, they occur across seventy-three episodes. In other words, the repetition, the pacing, and the poor writing choices are each compounded, exacerbated by the long length of the season, turning these problems from intolerable to wholly insufferable.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has a clear positive in its visual arsenal: The trigger transformation sequence. Blue-and-purple, space-like effects spread over the characters as their virtual bodies replace their physical ones. It\u2019s fancy-looking, and it works.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOh, do not be mistaken. Repetition does not stop with the story. The transformation gets a pass because it at least tries to be interesting. But Yuma\u2019s squinting face? The drab teal outfits? Osamu\u2019s glasses constantly fogging up on only one lens to make him seem serious when, in actuality, it only makes it look as if he does not treat his eyewear with proper care?\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, too. The show almost exclusively takes place in the same city and within the same Border headquarters. It would not be a problem if the anime attempted to spruce up these areas given that they are seen all the time. Nope. It\u2019s the same low-detailed, repetitive locations.\\n\\n\r\nIt does try to break up the monotony with its weapons and its enemies, but these, too, suffer from lack of intrigue. The weapons are mostly swords and shields (and their variants) that go without any distinguishing characteristics besides their yellow-laser composition. And the enemies are giant, bug-like creatures that go featureless save for their same giant-eye weak-point.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the rough, its Black Triggers, which it claims are powerful and unique, are, in fact, powerful and unique. Portal creation, translucent-Trion-coagulating birds, and an all-reaching blade stake their claim as the top-tier gear. If only because everything else is so abysmally tame. (Indeed, the Black Triggers make one wonder what could have been had the show given a similar level of attention to its other parts.)\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the anime\u2019s character designs are not awful. Yes, Osamu is too plain, Chika\u2019s mouth is oddly triangular, and Yuma already needs to dye his hair as a teenager. But, considering the size of the cast, the changes to hair color, pupil formation, body image, styles, and accessories help to differentiate the characters while also giving them their own personalities. Kirie, in particular, gets a brand-new look when she turns on her trigger: a winged hairstyle as well as a light-green outfit.\\n\\n\r\nThen it goes right back to being intolerable with subpar actual animation. The fights are not given enough room to breathe, characters usually only move their mouths, and everybody has a hard time even walking around the room as they discuss the same set of topics for the umpteenth time. At least the glowing cube pieces dart around, right?\\n\\n\r\nA few negative shout-outs are still in order.\\n\\n\r\nThe first goes to the visuals for the second ML (acronym explained later) track. Having each character \u201csing\u201d a portion of the song is not cool in the slightest. Especially when Chika, a female, lip syncs a male\u2019s voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe second goes to the final episode. It is somehow leagues worse than all the episodes before it. Disproportionate heads, stiff animation, and weak choreography end the anime with even more distaste.\\n\\n\r\nThe third goes to the \u201cfun\u201d facts epilogues. They went cutesy and minimalist to fit their \u201cfun\u201d mood, but it really just seems as though the anime was cutting corners with the cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger is yet another anime with a massive cast, reaching about one-hundred distinct characters. Therefore, just the main four will be investigated: Chika, Jin, Yuma, and Osamu.\\n\\n\r\nChika is a young girl who finds herself attracting the evil Neighbors. It\u2019s not her fault, for she simply contains an unbelievable amount of Trion (especially for someone of her size). Her indirect relation with the Neighbors caused her to distance herself from others in order to protect them, leaving her in a spot without too many friends.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Chika, and early on, the show reveals that not only did the Neighbors kidnap one of her close friends, but also her brother went missing beyond the rift, too. In retaliation, Chika enlists herself at Border to save those that were taken from her.\\n\\n\r\nHer gargantuan Trion levels made her gun-type role a no-brainer. With a sniper in tow, she can literally raze entire hills, earning her the nickname \u201cCannon.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the season only gives the audience the tidbits to her background and motivations. The middle section has her being the target of Aftokrator because, to them, she is the \u201cgolden baby bird\u201d they were seeking. In other words, Chika does not do a whole lot for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nNot until the last one-third or so does a new characteristic officially enter the field: She cannot shoot people.\\n\\n\r\nHer mental obstacle is extremely annoying since it comes off as a cheap excuse to stop her from decimating the competition (when most of her foes are in no danger of dying anyway). But it does give her the chance to grow. She eventually manages to fire her gun as well as changes to a different setup that plays to her strengths. Namely, her huge store of Trion.\\n\\n\r\nIs Chika a strong character? No. Mostly since she\u2019s relegated to the side without accomplishing much. However, she\u2019s the best of the four \u2013 and that is telling.\\n\\n\r\nJin is notable for his amazing \u201cSide Effect,\u201d special abilities that certain characters possess. His Side Effect is reading the future. He cannot predict it, but he can see the various intersections as well as influence which one the world could take.\\n\\n\r\nIf that were not enough, he has his own Black Trigger, making him one of, if not the, most powerful Border agent.\\n\\n\r\nJin does receive some attention early on, being the one that inspired Osamu to put his all into joining Border. And he interacts with Osamu and his group often enough, getting them a spot at his branch as well as looking out for them elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, his character starts to go downhill shortly after.\\n\\n\r\nJin gives up his Black Trigger, sensing (through his Side Effect) that it would be for the best to let others wield it, reducing his overall impact and coolness. Then, after warning about Osamu\u2019s potential death during the Aftokrator arc, he basically vanishes, appearing only a handful of times without having any impact on the events at hand.\\n\\n\r\nJin even (way later) turns down Osamu\u2019s invite to their group, a bold move to make Osamu\u2019s team that much stronger.\\n\\n\r\nWhich begs the question: Why is Jin even considered a main character let alone plastered on the front of the anime\u2019s main graphic? His background is not investigated, he does not have an internal conflict, and he sits on the sidelines for a large chunk of the show. In all regards, he\u2019s a massive step down from Chika.\\n\\n\r\nYuma is technically a stronger character than Jin but not by much. Yuma is a humanoid Neighbor, something that Osamu and the others had never heard of before. Yuma, alongside his trusty pal Replica, has a Black Trigger of his own, granting him boosted powers and increased battle prowess.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as his background shows, he does not necessarily need it. When he was in the Neighborhood, he was with his dad, learning about fighting, skills, and battle tactics. In other words, he was already a seasoned fighter.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, a dark entity maimed Yuma, forcing his father to sacrifice himself. In exchange for his life, he creates Yuma\u2019s Black Trigger, saving Yuma by placing his body within it. I.e., Yuma\u2019s current body is actually a fake.\\n\\n\r\nAll this information on Yuma is revealed rather early on (mainly episode eleven). And, to be fair, it is welcome info. The problem is that that is all Yuma has.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s already a versatile fighter, so the battles do not mean much to him. The show never goes back to the Neighborhood, so he does not get context on his background. And he does not have any notable interactions with any of the other cast members, including Chika and Osamu.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Osamu, he is easily the worst of the bunch. From the very beginning, it\u2019s obvious that Osamu has no latent strengths. He is not suited for Border due to his lack of fighting experience and his lack of Trion. He only gets recognized when Yuma gives him the credit for saving the school.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s Osamu\u2019s character for the rest of the show. He is constantly trying to find an out. He is constantly looking for help. He is constantly doing what he can to not be useless.\\n\\n\r\nIt would have been tolerable had he actually grown at a steady pace, but, at every junction, World Trigger seems intent on keeping Osamu at a below-average state for the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nHis crawl is realistic, sure. Going from the absolute bottom to even near the middle of the pack would not (should not) happen overnight. But the anime is seventy-three episodes long. What is normally a crawl turns into an excruciatingly slow waddle that barely gets him past the base of his figurative character mountain.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem is World Trigger\u2019s biggest. It fails to use its very long season to its advantage. Instead, the show\u2019s main four not only reach a new level of stagnation but also fail to feel meaningful to the story at large.\\n\\n\r\nOne argument in favor of the cast is their roles. Yuma\u2019s the ace fighter, Chika\u2019s the overpowered sniper, and Osamu\u2019s the tactician. They form a solid group whose weaknesses are covered by each other. For instance, Yuma takes on the toughest enemies, Chika destroys landmarks when needed, and Osamu develops the plans.\\n\\n\r\nTheir composition, however, is not enough to elevate their individual persons.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character World Trigger has to offer is not out of these four; it\u2019s Xeno. He confronts the main group, has a personal conflict in trusting others, gets his background explored, holds a special relationship with Lilith, and resolves his conflict when he befriends the others and escapes the planet.\\n\\n\r\nBut one strong side character \u2013 a character that is inconsequential to the proceedings \u2013 is not enough to save this anime from the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger, surprisingly, does something unique. Not good unique but unique nevertheless: It does not have an OP or an ED. Oh, no. Instead, the anime created a brand-new entity.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle track (or ML for short).\\n\\n\r\nRemember those repetitive reels? They almost always play at the beginning of each episode, leaving no time for an OP to play. And remember those \u201cfun\u201d facts? They almost always play at the end of each episode, so an ED has no place. That leaves the meat of the episode. The important parts. The middle.\\n\\n\r\nSo, World Trigger, being World Trigger, does not care. With its ML in hand, it will interrupt the flow of the episode to make sure the audience hears what it has to offer. Sometimes twelve minutes in, sometimes a staggering fourteen minutes and thirty seconds in. It must play it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is heard? The first ML has fast lyrics, but the \u201cchange the new world\u201d English bit and the boring background beat squash any hope the song has at becoming listenable. The second ML tries really hard to be cool, with its different vocalists and fade out, but it comes off as incredibly lame since the anime is simply not on the same coolness level. As for the third ML, it stands above its brethren, but that\u2019s not saying much. Its first half is uninspired, but the second half at least has some nice vocal work and a varying pace, making it the only passable piece of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the ML is not playing, the rest of the original soundtrack does instead. The tracks are often slow, ambient tunes, relying on flutes, drums, and reverb effects to strike at the slice-of-life, action, and sci-fi moods. They\u2019re forgettable pieces, overshadowed by the ML\u2019s strangeness.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, voice acting missed the mark. Megumi Urawa as Youtarou was annoying to hear, and Tomo Muranaka as Yuma sounded too disinterested. The others failed to impress.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nYou know what\u2019s ironic? My favorite part of the entire show happens to be repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nKirie and Kyousuke\u2019s running gag, where he lies, she believes him, and then she proceeds to pound on Osamu or whoever else is nearby for \u201ctricking\u201d her, miraculously made me smile. In this swathing sea of dislike, I did, indeed, find something I liked.\\n\\n\r\nThe cat, too. His emotionless stare and laziness was likable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those are the only parts I liked.\\n\\n\r\nKitora was a huge jerk to Osamu for no other reason besides thinking he was coddled too much by everybody else. Chika always bailing out during the fights, rather than trying to help Osamu and Yuma, got on my nerves. Osamu\u2019s half-fogged glasses.\\n\\n\r\nCan\u2019t say I liked the action with its boring shoot-outs. I did not have much in the way of romance to cheer for. Takeru\u2019s \u201ccomedy\u201d made me want to punch myself in the face. And don\u2019t even get me started again on the show\u2019s inept repetition.\\n\\n\r\nIs this the worst anime that I have ever seen? Maybe. If nothing else, it is trapped at the bottom with the other lowest-execution anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger is a boring mess. The story is repetitive. The characters are stagnated. The art is lame. The music has no timing. The entertainment value is minimal. The anime is an ornament that shattered into seventy-three different pieces: worthless.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, horrible repetition, elongates seconds to minutes, and does not even have relevant narrative arcs\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring setting, below average actual animation, and okay character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, stagnation in Osamu, Yuma, Chika, and Jin\u2019s characters prevent them from finding purpose or value\\n\\n\r\nSound: Terrible, bad ML\u2019s, bad OST, bad VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, a running gag and a cat do not cover this year-and-a-half slog\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

            "content": "(Sorry guys, had to re-upload this! Rating is still 10/10!)\r\nI'm going to have to disagree with the opinion a lot of people seem to get from first impressions of this anime. I love it, especially the universe, plot, and characters. Worth giving a chance and continuing to watch. I'm addicted! I love the universe they created, and I'd watch a second series in a heartbeat.\r\nArt:\r\nThe first thing people complain about is the art, but I think that has more to do with how almost every anime these days has very cookie-cutter animation, so when one comes out that has a different style people drop itfor that sole reason-- preconceived notions abound. JoJo has extremely silly animation, but since it is rather famous already people get passed that, and start to actually enjoy it FOR the animation instead of disliking it because of it. It was the same for World Trigger. I enjoy that it has a unique animation style, it reminds me of the same vein as Gash Bell, or Nanatsu no Taizai; both of which I really enjoy for their iconic nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple, but it works well for this sort of story, it doesn't need overly complex effects to get the point across, in fact that would be very out of character. If you are the type to drop something or judge based on art alone, I would recommend giving this one a chance and watching it through while trying to fix that way of thinking. I wouldn't consider the art bad at all, just simple. Other very famous anime have similar styles, so it shouldn't have that much sway. Keep going, give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is something I really enjoy. Other dimensions are a common trope, but World Trigger is done in such a way to make it unique and really gives you a complete universe to believe in. At first it may seem just like another dimension/shounen battle plot, but once it starts to open up and reveal the underlying nuances, you start to understand that there is a whole other dimension (no pun intended) to the plot, where it parallels real life social issues and moral concepts. You want to stand behind the MC, and fight against the evils and injustices the bureaucracy has put in place (or Border HQ). The plot is shown in such a way where that you slowly learn new things about Neighbors, Border, Trion, and even Yuuma little by little in each episode. This builds up to some bigger fights and conclusions later on, and since there's so much information, this is definitely the best way to get it all out there so we really get what is going to happen later on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really like the choice of Seiyuu, and feel each has their own fitting narrative. I have a pretty dry sense of humor, so the subtle dry humor they use is just perfect for me, I also love the social nuances, like pauses and sweet drops at just the right moments to make it hilarious. Older anime uses this technique a lot more often (Like in Gash Bell), whereas these days they tend to make more verbal jokes, which I don't really enjoy nearly as much most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAnd now for the character portion. Aside from plot I think this would be my favorite aspect of the show, I love the depth of character! At first you are thrown in without knowing anything but the basics of who these people are, but gradually you learn and more, especially about Yuuma, and it makes you feel a real connection to the characters and want to urge them on to get stronger and find ways to beat the odds. Yuuma has a much more complex past than you first suspect, and it just continues to get more interesting. Osamu is pretty average, but that's what also makes him relatable. He doesn't start out as much but his character is the type that grows more complex and matures as the series does- so you personally witness the changes in him as he grows and becomes stronger. I don't think there were any major changes in him until he goes through his first big trial (roughly one third through the series), but I think that works out perfectly. Yuuma draws you in, and Osamu keeps you wanting more. It's just these two for the first few episodes of the series, getting you acquainted, but once they start introducing the other characters is when things get fun. Dropping before everyone is on stage is a bad decision. Especially considering this is a 73 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEvery week when I watched this show I would always flail when it was over because I wanted there to be more so badly! (I still do!) I get really into the personal battles the characters are involved in, and I really want to know more about their world! There's so much we don't know yet, and so much to explore. I want Osamu to grow and become strong so he can catch up to his team mates, and I want Yuuma to solve the mysteries around his father he's been searching for, and I want Chika to find her lost friends and family! Without going into much detail about all of these plot-lines, I want to say it really is worth continuing to watch this show and not give up on it. Think of how slow Hunter x Hunter was at first, or Fairy Tail. This is similar but with more sci-fi leanings. Like a more simple/iconic styled Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (\u2665).\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10!\\n\\n\r\nBig things to keep in mind before watching:\\n\r\n\u2022 This show has 73 episodes, the plot will not all be apparent in the first handful of episodes. Give it at least 15 or so episodes, AT LEAST.\\n\r\n\u2022 Don't pre-judge the animation. Remember lots of other famous, good anime has unique styles of animation. (Fairy Tail, JoJo, Nanatsu no Taizai, Kingdom, Gash Bell etc) and all of those were worth getting over it.\\n\r\n\u2022 The credits and OP/ED format is a little different, the recap at first seems annoying now but it will be convenient later on because it has 73 episodes and it can be hard to find where you're leaving off without it. Just try to get used to the OP happening after the initial beginning part of the show. Like most TV drama shows that start off in the plot. It's not that big of a deal and doesn't influence how much show you see.\\n\r\n\u2022 Just be open to giving it a chance!",

            "content": "Although I enjoyed this anime, it was also a terrible disappointment at the same time.  The anime clearly had designs on joining the ranks of Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc... as a long running anime, and 73 episodes is not a bad run.  But, poor pacing, a BRUTAL and ill-timed filler arc that destroyed the momentum of the series, and a sudden ending, takes what could've been an amazing anime and brings it down to just \"pretty good\".   \r\nWorld Trigger has two great draws: A large and interesting cast, and intelligent tactical fights.  The cast in the anime isenormous, and they clearly know it is, as they never fail to remind you of everyone's name, every time you see them.  (And it's necessary, because there are tons of people.)  They were still introducing new and interesting characters even as the show hit a sudden and abrupt end.  The best characters of the series were easily Jin, Kuga and Yotaro, for me.  It's a shame it ended before we could delve more into Kageura as a character.   The rest of the cast was also strong.  \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the weak link of the cast was the MC.  While he had some of the usual respectable traits of an MC: Earnest, honest, brave, etc...Mikumo was just weak.  Really weak.  And while with many shounen anime, the MC starts off as weak, at some point, they progress to catch up with the rest of their team.  But with World Trigger, Mikumo remains weak for far too long.  The disappointing aspect of the abrupt cancellation is it appears like he was just about to turn the corner mentally.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fights were excellent, however.  They were much different from the DBZ-style fights you normally see in anime.  Everything was completely tactical.  The characters deeply analyzed the environment, their opponents, strengths, weaknesses, everything in order to bring out a victory.  It helped to create more engagement in the fights when they happened.   There were some truly awesome moments in the fights, as well.  I wouldn't say they were the greatest animated fights, but they were very fun to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nThe downside here, and I think what probably led to an early cancellation for the show, was an ill-timed filler arc surrounding two characters named Xeno and Lilith.  As good as the rest of World Trigger was, this arc, was just awful.  Amazingly boring, uninteresting, and Xeno was one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen.  It was a big mistake to switch from the large, enjoyable cast with exciting tactical fights to a skeleton crew trying to be a cheap Naruto knock off.  By the time the anime returned from the filler, the whole pace was just destroyed.  I watched World Trigger in binges.  I could only imagine how it must have felt going through it for four months watching it on air.  \\n\\n\r\nI believe that directly resulted in its cancellation, which is why the ending is so abrupt.  They drew out everything so long, that the heroes are still in the midst of trying to accomplish their first objective: \"Make it to the A-ranked Teams\".   There were a series of things they wanted to accomplish, that I won't mention in order to not spoil things, but it ended before they even crossed the first hurdle.  Now THAT is how you know your pacing is off.  73 episodes and you don't get past the first step to the main objective?  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it seems like things behind the scenes killed what could've been a great, long-running anime.   I would recommend watching World Trigger, regardless of its flaws.  But, without question, as soon as you hear the name \"Xeno\", skip the episode, and don't stop skipping the episodes until you know you wont see that name again.  Trust me. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "So found out that world trigger was completed then i started to watch it and frankly for someone who likes these types of anime this anime both triggered and dissapointed me big time. Why almost everyone think this is great praising it like the next coming well no its not. \r\nThe story is the same as most anime there you have scifi combined with superlike human weapons or abilities. Good guys fight back while bad guys keep invading. This is fine i kinda expected it and its not something i would rate an anime bad for. The only  problem is that type of storymakes it easy to guess different plots in it. When i see something happening and think to myself ah so it was going to happen like that, then i know something just normal will be with this anime. The triggers is what make this anime what it is it gives the anime the only  thing to make it unique. What type of triggers does he use what is the difference between each things like that is of interest because thats what this anime is about combined with the alien attack. But this anime pisses me of because i feel like they just say hey lets make this happen while another part says hey lets stop this doesnt feel good lets make something else happen instead. And when they finally get to explain things they create a big event and its basically and now after the invation break. I can watch slow animes i even love those but thats when they actually try to get some sort of picture through or explain not when you just throw a bunch of fights there you just get more and more distraught. \\n\\n\r\nI will give this anime that it has openings that you can enjoy eventhough they try to make the anime unique by plopping the openings in the middle of the episode. The openings are interesting there is that. \\n\\n\r\nNever have i  found myself hate as many characters as i did in this anime never. I was at the 10 episode when i thought should i just toss it aside but no my anime sence told me that there was something i would enjoy. The characters was not any of this. The main character is piss poor weak he cant fight for shit he cant even do dmg whats so great about this. He gets helped almost always and it feels like the only thing he can do is acting like a meat shield or run away as a distraction. The main supporting girl Chika basically gave alot of the story away when i heard about her more clearly which is why i wont spoil it but its obvious. The supporting guy Yuma is your typical op supporting character who helps the main character Osuma a bunch of times hes likable enough but has his weird yet kind side. There are a few other characters i could like but too many gave me that feeling of annoyance and wanted to throw off a cliff\\n\\n\r\nI started to enjoy this anime when i got to about episode 40 surprise ? well you shouldnt be. I had to fight my way through episodes there i wonder is there any point in this anime having a Mc. My advice for whoever reads this is to not care about main character and just view everything as a story of its own and never think of any character as a main just think of them as part of a divition or similar to that or you will run the risk of being burned. \\n\\n\r\nOverall there is nothing special about this anime that i could say i enjoyed all the way through i can only say that it had its good moment but thats it. The story and the consept of the triggers was great but in the end i could find an anime like this and find a better one easly. If i ever watch this one again it will be from around episode 40 or so maybe 38 but not much back than that. \\n",

            "content": "This is it boys and girls, I'm bringing you another anime review that you all been waiting for (No one did).\r\nWhat is it with this anime, at some points it impresses me and makes me think that I found something good, but then you turn around the corner and you get punched in the face.\r\nHow creators were able to balance garbage and awesome in a same anime amazes me. Even if I gave this one 5, I know easy fix how to make it to at least 7. I leave it somewhere at the end of review.\r\n Not because I want you to read allreview or anything B-Ba-Baka! This review may contain some minor spoilers, so please consult with your doctor before reading this, everything is done by professionals with supervision, please do not try this at home.\\n\\n\r\nSo this anime has a plot, and it's not bad really. Building fantasy world little by little, and oh boys when I say little by little I mean it. It's SLOW man! Before it get to some good parts another anime could already ended. But when it gets to those points it's pretty good, I like systems where you get your characters ranked by how awesome they are. And massive wars\\n\r\nthat involves a lot of characters. There are a lot of strategy involved in battles, and I love that. I think that is the best part of this anime.\\n\r\n If you like battles, you should check this one out. But that only happens when humans are fighting against humans, surroundings get so alive, everything happening for a reason and at the same time, really great stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's have some fun, lets talk about stuff that makes you hate your self for wasting time watching this anime. Characters... oh boy... Who was the smart one to make main character guy with glasses I have nothing against people who wear gasses, but come one, this is anime. Every time I watch character with glasses, its most boring, useless person on that anime, whats up with that. Some guy though that  it would be fun to put his little son Timmie in to the anime. Because everybody loves to watch average person living average life in f***ing fantasy worlds. He's weak, cant do anything alone, and will try to save everybody even if it cost his life. Sometimes looks like he is trying to kill him self, because he knows how boring he is. If I want to see something like that, I would go outside, and there is no fantasy involved there.\\n\r\nThen we have Chika, what is wrong with her head? Cmon people, look at it, LOOK AT IT! I would want to know her back story of her head more, that main story. As a character she's horrible, feels like she should have glasses\\n\r\nbut there can only be one useless character with glasses. Thank god, that other characters are decent or even good. Like Jin or Kuga. And there are so many characters, that they run out of ideas how to make them difference\\n\r\nso few of them I could not even tell apart.\\n\\n\r\nBut you want to know what really killed this anime? Do you? Are you sure? Okay then...\\n\r\nFugitive arc. WTF was that? It look like different anime with same characters. Well Chika's head got smaller, so that's good, still looked retarded.. (I swear I could draw her face better)\\n\r\nWorld trigger meeting:\\n\r\nBoss:-okay guys, we have build pretty good world with a lot of possibilities, everything is stable, interesting and makes you want to see what happens next. What should we do next?\\n\r\nWeebmaster3000:-I know just a thing. So you know all that world? Lets trow everything away, introduce few new boring characters and focus anime only on them. Lets put filler episodes in a filler arc. Do some beach, shopping\\n\r\nand random episodes where gag relief side character gets trips with no purpose. And don't try to make any sense with plot, just make it random, it's fun. Trust me on this.\\n\r\nBoss:- well okay then, lets do this! LEEROY JENKINS!!!!\\n\r\nThis arc was an abomination, it gives NOTHING to main plot and makes no sense at all, so stupid, so random, so useless.\\n\r\n I bet weebmaster3000 was that smarta**, to place every opening in the middle of episode.It's like:\\n\r\nOh I see you are enjoying this episode, just let me stop that for you and show you our opening, because maybe you forgot what you are watching, don't worry no need to thank me.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end what to do with this anime? You can make it good on your on. You have the POWER! Skip fugitive arc. Episode 48-63. Believe me, it got NOTHING worth watching. And if you skip it, you will improve this anime dramatically.\\n\r\nJust need to find a way how to kill Osamu and Chika then it would be perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: Got nothing to watch? Looking for something new in anime? Watch it, but skip fugitive arc.\\n\r\nHate boring characters and slow pace? Have something better to do? Don't watch it.",

I picked it back up though because a friend recommended it to me and I am glad I did.\r\nAlmost all the characters feel fledged out with their own personalities and quirks that make them feel like a real person. My favorite character would have to be Kitora. When you first meet her she comes across as stuck up and mean but the more you see them the more you realize that she is just really bythe book and hates to see effort wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two or three Intros in this show and they are all really well made. Though this show is kind of weird when it comes to the intros you can go thirteen minutes into the show sometimes before you get the intro which I kind of like cause it breaks it up to be more digestible. The second intro has to be my favorite though. I cant really pinpoint what it is about it but its just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really good and once you complete the anime you are left wanting more and hopefully one day we will get more of it. Until then there is the manga that you can pick up and continue it. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier the animation takes more then a few episodes to get used to but the character designs are really good and distinctive to the character. You will notice that pretty quickly when it comes to the eyes. I never knew you could draw an eye so many different ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is really underrated and a hidden gem of a show. You should defiantly give it a chance you wont regret it.",

Completely different from middle-school kids levelling up and saving god knows how many worlds.\r\nFor me the story and the concept of the power(trion) was better than that of chakra, nen, or magic. I personallyloved it a lot. The characters were amazing.....they were fucking badass......you will find no annoying characters and almost love every one of the cast. I could also say that BORDER is one of the most fucking badass organization in all of anime history. And the most interesting thing is that our MC is literally the weakest character in the series.....and despite that you will not hate it....can you imagine how amazing that is. He is not an idiot like most of them are...you will never hear monolouges of shounen protagonist and cannot expect what they will do....but here at least you can know what he is thinking. He knows he is the weakest and does things based on what he can and should do. The other MC's are like the baddest of the badasses......I can only say you are gonna love them.\\n\r\nThe only sad thing is that the ending is abrupt. It's because the anime caught up too fast with the manga that they had no more material to continue the story. But I am waiting patiently for it's next season and I hope we will in the same boat.",

Well, I loved this anime from the start!\r\nSlight spoiler alert!!\r\nI am quite pissed at how the main character guy, Mikumo never seem to get stronger. I mean like he is smart, but thats it, he doesn't show any takent and is portrayed as the kind of guy who seems to attract a lot of strong people around him, despite not having any fighting skill at all. But I guess this is one way to develop the plot. Plus theyadd in Kuga as the main character which I absolutely love! \\n\\n\r\nSome people seems to be complaining about the art made by Toei. Well, I have to disagree. I mean like I have seen better arts, but you can't really complain about the quality of the art used here. \\n\\n\r\nI started reading the manga after watching the anime. I have to say, they follow the plot of manga quite well. I practically can just start reading the manga from the middle because the anime and manga connects so well!\\n\\n\r\nWell overall I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I binge watched this in 3 days and enjoyed every moment of it. I highly recommend this anime! Looking forward to the next season!",

Don't know how Toei managed to pull in Yuki Kaji for Osamu, but this was one of the things that made me stick with it. The lack-luster animation, random, long, pauses, and dragged out episodes with ridiculously long recaps was a bit dissapointing and turned away a lot of viewers.\r\n I really liked Kuga's character, his design and backstory, but many others like Osamu and Chika were half baked as charaters. I totally see where the author was going with this story having a characterlike Osamu as one of the main characters and although it will probably be better in the end, people didn't want their time wasted. The seiyuus weren't bad, and honestly, although Osamu isn't the character that Yuki Kaji is used to voicing, it made Osamu a bit more likeable. This anime has lots of flaws but lots of good things with it. Read the manga tbh\\n\\n",

And all of them feel like people. \r\nStory:\r\nPremise is simple, there are other worlds that uses a technology called \"trigger\". Just imagine it as energy that can be manipulated BUT not so simple that anything can just be created in a snap. We follow for the most part, 30 people, 30 fucking people BUT we follow the growth of 3 the most. The story itself is nothing to write home about, it's the cast that's really the meat of thisshow and the story is basically a back draft.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nYou can see how the studio skimped out here, I'm a 90s kid so it's okay with me and the 3d is used with the monsters that are already flat and geometrical in feel anyway so it's forgivable. I can't watch Aijin due to it being a pure 3d, this one doesn't use 3d on people, just the monsters but if any element of 3d in an anime disgusts you, then it's here.\\n\r\nThe action sequences are well handled, the characters look different despite having a battalion but nothing drastic is used to differentiate the characters so as to break immersion, it's a feat really. But yeah, deduction on actual animation but plus for the sheer amount of characters and not just filler faces that it sustains.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's pretty alright. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOsamu is weak, but he's not stupid, but he's not overly smart either. He needs his team and his team needs him. This might not sound exciting to you but for people who love a sense of realism, this is amazing. \\n\r\nI remember one dialogue when Osamu said that he will train hard to catch up with the others, the person he's speaking with replies \"isn't that arrogant, since we're also working hard to improve ourselves\". \\n\r\nGod I love the characters and the characterization in this anime, each character is given respect. Even Chica, the small girl whom I thought will be some mandatory loli fan service was actually fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nsomething to note tho, this moves at a pace that almost mirrors reality, so yeah, it can be quite slow BUT I swear it ramps up at an unnoticeable pace until you're just addicted to it!\\n\r\nDid I say 30 fucking characters all believable?! What a cast!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt's slow but it really does ramp up and leaves you wanting for more. God I wish for more, I need moarrr!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's smart, it's action packed, it has heart and it manages to balance sci-fi with reality, action and heart and it finds a way to make the characters human. This is a great anime and definitely worth the time.",

So you've to get into them\r\nfirst and focus less on the hero because he is part of it.\r\nHe isn't the one making the world spin like in usual shounen manga.\r\nAnother thing that people should also accept is that Osamu, the hero\r\nis not a fighter/attacker/dps class, that's Kouga role.Osamu is more\\n\r\na support tank and Chika is the mage. Kuga is the one who is overlever up\\n\r\nand is caring Osamu and Chika through speed level up.\\n\r\nThat's is good and also bad thing.

That's someting you need to keep in mind and A LOT of NPCs will repeat that fact which is why they're impressed that hero crew can keep up with them.\\n\\n\r\nHero growth is slow but I just explained above the reason that a lot of people don't understand because they're not used to slow leveling and Mc having the role of tank and a tank class is fucking slow to level up in any rpg/mmorpg, lol\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that rpg fans will like is the strategic aspect of the combats.\\n\r\nLot of shounen manga do not cover this part wisely and just go all in in general.\\n\r\nHere it's different, every move/action that someone will make in combat will be\\n\r\nexplained which give dpeth to combat and not some mindless firing/attacking.\\n\r\nAlso the combat are quite diverse in tactics/approach thanks to the different weapons there're and classes.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, to finish my review skip the filler arc.

            "content": "73 episodes of getting almost nowhere. Forget about the mediocre art for a moment, the real problem is that behind it is a story stretched so thin it makes a slice of cheese feel like a brick wall in comparison. Everything about World Trigger screams \"cheap filler\".\r\nDo you have even the slightest capacity to reach logical conclusions? I've got bad news for you, this entire show will tick you off by tripping itself up every few minutes. The best example would be how they somehow pretend that the most basic of combat training that you can learn in 60 seconds by even having a brainand changes you from being instantly defeated to having a fighting chance... wouldn't be taught to ANY student for the first YEAR of their combat training, because that's the \"advanced\" stuff for year two. Had this happened once I would have been forgiving but it happened all the time because there is almost nothing being taught to any of the students at all, the stuff they pretend to learn in 3 years even your average real life student could learn in 3 weeks.\\n\\n\r\nThe next issue is that not only do they drag out every single insignificant little thing for as long as they possibly can, the \"recaps\" are so excessive in length that they take up a big chunk of the actual episodes and by the end you've watched 60 episodes worth of what barely qualifies as content and 13 worth of recaps. I wish this was a lie, it's not.\\n\\n\r\nThe few saving points are occasional laughs, the characters staying consistent (even if some are utterly useless and have such severe learning disabilities they wouldn't last a week in elementary school) and there actually is a decent plot in the background, even if it only shows up every few hours and it would have been fine to shorten the entire show to 20 episodes.",

            "content": "People are too quick to call a series a \u201cunderrated\u201d. This is because it\u2019s not easy to gauge the popularity of a series in relation to the following you think it \"should\" have. If I were to make a list of underrated series, that list would be incredibly short. It would also include World Trigger which isn't a label typically attached to a Weekly Shonen Jump series. An up and comer in WSJ that drew interest in the when it began to air from the mere fact the it ran in that magazine, that interest almost immediately dissipated in the first couple of episodes. Suddenly,everyone remembered that it's Toei animating the series, and being surprised that a bad animation studio badly animates TV shows, they dropped the series. This is a reminder of how heavily influential the actual animation of an anime is for viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs per most WSJ series, World Trigger starts off slow introducing its world, concept, and characters, before kicking off into the actual conflict. Enemies come from another dimension, people set up an organization to stop them, right, yes, whatever. Fairly straightforward Jump exposition dumping. Mainly bizarre is the anime\u2019s weird name sense, though does get better later. The series starts out as main character Mikumo Osamu finds out a neighbor, Kuga Yuma, transferred into his school. Things gets more interesting around 10 episodes in when Border finds out what he is and attempt to deal with him, and even more so later when Border comes into conflict with other Neighbor worlds.\\n\\n\r\nOsamu is extremely weak but he\u2019s well worked as a character. Initially introduced as a morally righteous individual, it was shown in initial scenes that simply being righteous was useless when he gets his ass kicked pathetically by his classmates while Kuga watches. He never gains anything undeserved and doesn't win just because he's more virtuous or emotional than his opponent. He struggles with his lack of strength and his goals in the story, often fearing inadequacy and failure. This is really one of the big things that Jump has traded away over the past few years. I certainly do not expect some inner turmoil on par with shows like Evangelion and others, but seeing protagonists struggle with themselves and make mistakes is always welcome. This combines with Osamu's efforts to improve which are well thought out and interesting to watch. Though somewhat smart his honesty, despite the potential self damage it incurs, is appealing. It creates a good underdog character. And most of the characters run along similar lines of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nShonen Jump has a tendency to constantly have the MC in the spotlight before all else as the recognizable face of the series. Whenever there\u2019s a big fight, the MC is always in the lead, even if the fight has little to do with him. He may or may not give a big speech rebuking his opponent, often with little actual relevance to that conflict. Osamu is the antithesis of this. The MC doesn\u2019t preach to the opposition, or the viewership, which gets highly annoying and silly if not meaningful. Characters are no longer shoved into some the unnecessary \u201cgood guy\u201d and \u201cbad guy\u201d categories. \\n\\n\r\nThis means that characters have to more be defined by their thoughts and actions as people, not just as a hero or villain. This helps the author bring attention to the vast cast without having the audience first watch a huge amount of content. It\u2019s frequent that a huge cast is introduced and only really make a small amount of that huge cast is interesting, or they all end up boring even if a huge amount of time is spent on the characters. They're all just there to make up numbers, but it doesn't feel that way with World Trigger. This is because they don't take up huge amounts of screen time or hold big 1v1 battles involving irrelevant characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe power system is actually quite interesting for the series. Fighting series are defined and remembered by their power systems. World Trigger is no different. Jojo, One Piece, DBZ, Hakusho are all examples of this done positively. Usually most shonen series which involve abilities usually center around everyone having their own unique ability, but that's not the case. The system is simple, but the way it's implemented makes it a great system as it still allows creativity but does away with individual gimmicks of one character having a silly overpowered ability, or powering up until he has one. \\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger\u2019s trion system resembles a video game in its use. The show places tangible importance on the skills of the individual user, how they use what they have, the situation they are in, and how they fight with those around them. This is what make the battles truly exciting in World Trigger. They rely more so on strategy and very rarely if ever is there an outright power battle between two characters. It enticing to see how each character uses the weapons along with their own skills. And even if you're stronger, it's possible to lose in a way that's not an asspull designed just so the protagonist can win. While I do love to see a couple characters duke it out and try to kick each other\u2019s ass every now and then, this is fun and refreshing in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nI bring up Jump, the target Shounen demographic, and other shows that make these strange errors frequently because that\u2019s the standard. Those are all the tropes and oft-used clich\u00e9s. Those are all the unnecessary additives along with the annoying detractions that appear in this specific genre, particularly recently. These series hold a lot in common with each other and end up stiffly adhering to a formula to satisfy an audience and they fail to hold the entertain value that they strive for because of it. There\u2019s definitely good in World Trigger, but that comes out because it doesn\u2019t do basic things improperly. It doesn\u2019t do things that are unnecessary, out of character, or out of line.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, I mentioned that the first 10 episodes are quite slow, but any further pacing issues come down to how this show was animated and directed. World Trigger's first 10 or so episodes look god awful, plain and simple. Stills, the rehashed Trigger activation animation, and occasional strange lack of frames in scenes contribute to this. Luckily, they managed to get rid of 2 of these problems as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue that persisted is the stills. I found them strangely endearing at times and they got me to laugh at their placement and how unbelievable it was. There are frequents moments in each episode where the frame sits on a character's face for several seconds as they say/do absolutely nothing. In most other anime, you'd see panning shots and some sort of camera movement or change in perspective when there is no dialogue to keep the viewer occupied. \\n\\n\r\nVarious scenes are also censored even though most action takes place in a fake body. It\u2019s annoying, but bearable. Even with these problems World Trigger may be the best animated of Toei's TV works of the current century, particularly with how underwhelming One Piece is and what little I've seen of Dragonball Super. This should be fairly embarrassing. All fight scenes are done pretty nicely and it's nice to see that Toei at least doesn't slack off here.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first time I've seen an OP/ED stuck in the middle of an episode. They're good though and for the most part the OST is as well. Toei still uses the same old not so dramatic sound effects that we've heard all the way back since DBZ aired. You'll also find it in One Piece. This helps to draw out various stills and take up episode time.\\n\\n\r\nReally I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed the anime as I was expected to eventually drop it and just go with the manga like with One Piece, but it worth at looking into. \\n\\n\r\nThe filler sucks so don't watch it. It\u2019s genuinely like they tried to put Pokemon battles in World Trigger. It\u2019s insane.\\n",

            "content": "The 2010s era of anime was a great time for shounen jump anime adaptations because, for the most part, all the shounen jump adaptations were not only great in terms of quality but they managed to be near perfect adaptations. Sure some of them had filler episodes in it but compared to other shounen jump anime adaptations from the past decade or two they were pretty good for what they are despite being non-canon. Haikyuu, Assassination Classroom, Bakuman, Hunter x Hunter 2011 and My Hero Academia are the some of the best examples of this of how to adapt the source maternal correctly as wellhaving its own charm in the mix.\\n\r\nNow out of all the anime series from shounen jump that came out in the last 8 years, I feel like World Trigger is the most underrated of the bunch.\\n\r\nWhy is that you may ask?\\n\r\nYou're soon going to find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mikado City Humans are overwhelmed at first when their weapons are found to be useless against Neighbors, until a mysterious organization appears that is able to repel the Neighbors' attacks. The organization is called the National Defence Agency, or \"Border,\" and has appropriated the Neighbor technology called \"Triggers,\" which allows the user to channel an internal energy called Trion and use it as a weapon or for other purposes. By activating a trigger, the body of users is replaced by a battle-body made of trion which is stronger and more resistant. Members of Border are divided in three ranks, A, B, and C, with only the members of rank A possessing the most powerful triggers, comparable in strength to those of Neighbors.\\n\\n\r\nFour years later Mikado City has gotten used with the occasional battles with the Neighbors and have returned more or less to their everyday lives. The story follows a Yuma Kuga who transfers to Third Mikado City Middle School where he meets another boy named who is a Border Agent. However, it turns out that Yuma is actually a Humanoid Neighbor, and his arrival signifies that not all is what it seems in the war against the Neighbors.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty good for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, World Trigger does a great job at establishing its own world and setting.\\n\\n\r\nBorder is not like your typical shounen school setting which forces character interaction right down your through between set characters, it doesn't force countless written exams in such upon character for basic characterization but instead Border functions like an organization where no one is characterized solely of how overpowered and smart they but instead the method in which they come about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe power system for world trigger was very interesting as well being well expanded it great detail. The Trion system in World Trigger resembles like a video game where you have to master the class purpose in combat as well mastering its skills for that class to deal with situations that they are in so they can fight back. This reason alone is why I adored the fight structure in World Trigger because instead a of having a bunch of overpowered characters ganging up on strong foe where they will most likely get defeated unless the writer does a random asspull the characters in World Trigger actually have to work together by communicatingwith each other as well planning out strategies and tactics to defeat their foes. Thanks to the great fight structuring the fights in World Trigger are extremely unpredictable to a point where you never know who is going to win in the end which adds more tension to the fights and because of this all the arcs minus that filler was all fun watch even if the pacing of the show can be a bit too slow at times which I will talk about in a bit.\\n\r\nThe one thing that World Trigger was successful is its themes of teamwork and commutation where characters have to get along as well synergize with each other in order to win fights.\\n\\n\r\nAs much I praise the story of World Trigger as well how different it was in terms of setting, unfortunately, it has two flaws that completely hold it back from being one of the greats. I'm, honestly not going to pretend that World Trigger has great pacing, in fact, World Trigger at various times has pacing issues where it\u2019s too slow to a point where certain parts of the show where there were no fights involve just seemed to drag on to a point where at times the show can get boring to sit through. Personality the pacing in World Trigger didn\u2019t bother me all that much as I am used to shows that have slow pacing but I do acknowledge that it\u2019s a problem especially for fans of the shounen genre who are very used to fast-paced shounen like Naruto, Fairy Tail and My Hero Academia.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pacing issues in World Trigger didn\u2019t bother me that all that much the second and final flaw almost completely ruined the show for me. The arc that I am talking about is the Fugitive Arc. As much I really liked World Trigger as a whole I simply cannot defend that arc. Not only it was a filler arc that was not good but the directing, writing and even the visuals were at an all-time low in that arc. Plus the new characters in that dreadful arc are contrived morons who were extremely unlikeable and they are just as interesting as watching grass grow. Am not joking. Lucky for me I skipped that arc during my re-watch of the show and as soon as episode 48 I jumped straight to episode 63 and nothing was lost in the progress.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re planning to watch World Trigger skip episodes 49-63 because that\u2019s where the cringe-fest filler arc begins and honestly the less you know about that arc the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall besides the horrendous filler arc that shouldn\u2019t exist as having pacing issues at times, I really liked the story for World Trigger as it\u2019s very different to many shounen series from the past in terms of setting.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has a large characters cast but at the same time, they managed to a good job of handling it\u2019s character cast minus the one in the Fugitive arc because they are shit and not worth mentioning in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nYuma is a pretty interesting character. Despite his lack of knowledge of Japanese culture and customs acts as almost a social critique of Japanese society. Yuma openly states how he doesn't approve of specific traditions and the \"way things are\" in Japan, which really delivers a message to the audience in the form of social critique which was a nice touch to this series. I also adored his character interactions with the other characters in this series as they are often interesting as well being hilarious to watch. Yuma character interactions along made me chuckle a lot. Besides Yuma being funny he is also a strong character who gets developed very well and his backstory overall was nicely told it honestly made me tear quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nJin is a badass character that I loved. I loved his layback personality as well being a general badass on screen. I also liked his views of the Neighbor where despite losing his mother to a Neighbor he still thinks that not all Neighbor are enemies where he also thinks that humans and neighbors should be friends showing that both races could co-exist. This is the stuff that I love about anime.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have mixed feelings towards Osamu. I like the fact that he\u2019s different when compared to most shounen protagonist where they are overpowered he starts off from the bottom where he is literally a weak fighter. While I like the fact, he starts off as a weak fighter I thought he never really got stronger as a character. Yes did a bit stronger as the series went on the problem he always seemed to get ass kicked by many characters in the series. However, while he's not a good fighter his determined to prove everyone wrong completely makes up as we the viewer can sympathize with. However, I will admit that he can quite be a boring character at times especially in the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, I thought Osamu was a decent character.\\n\\n\r\nNow for my least favorite character in the series minus the god-awful filler ones Chika.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I don\u2019t hate Chika by any means, in fact, she is an okay character. The problem with Chika is she is literally a coward in battle. I understand that she is a kid and all but there were moments in the series where Team Osamu could have won if Chika actually shot someone in battle. Also, Chika kinda of getting on my nerves as the series get on as she never wants to shot someone in even though she has great sniper skills. Just like a shitty pacifist fighter where they hate violence even though they are in a war zone where they no choice to fight and that pacifist will only preach they lungs out of why war is wrong. Also, out of all the charters in World Trigger, she is the blandest character in the series. She\u2019s being just eye candy for the viewer where she\u2019s only cute nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the rest of the characters in World Trigger, I was honestly shocked of how well handled and unique they are. They are not the typical throwaway side characters that you will see in most other shounen like Naruto where they don\u2019t get any real screen time. The supporting characters in world trigger all get adequate screen time alongside this show over the course of its run abandons focusing on its main trio multiple times allowing other characters in the show to shine as well consequently demonstrating it\u2019s fantastic job in avoiding the creation of a story that where every event and character interaction just serves the purpose of affecting only one to two characters *cough Naruto Shippuuden.*\\n\\n\r\nSome of my favorite side characters in world trigger include Souya, Shuuji, Kyousuke, Yousuke, Shiori, Shun, Ai and my personal favorite character in this series Kirie.\\n\\n\r\nOverall apart from Chika the characters in World Trigger were pretty great and enjoyable for what they were.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the visuals for World Trigger my thoughts on were rather mixed.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, I really like how colorful it was. Instead of being colorful like in a typical fantasy setting it uses a sci-fi color pallet as we see a lot a lot of blues, whites, blacks and greens are used for the background scenery. The characters designs are all pretty unique, and they stand out very well from each other which was good because I was sick of tired at seeing similar character designs cough *Gundam Seed.* Unfortunately, since this show was done by Toei Animation the characters at times can go off model especially in the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation, it\u2019s just decent at best. Sure at times this show can be well animated at that can deliver some great fight choreography but for the most part, the show uses basic animation with a quite a lot of still frames. It\u2019s pretty sad really because if this show was done by Madhouse or Bones than the animation would be amazing. However, I will give Toei this it\u2019s one of the better-looking shows especially when you compare to the likes of Digimon Xros Wars, Dragon Ball Super and Sailor Moon Crystal where they are consistently being a slide show filled with consistent art failures and choppy animation. Also unlike those shows, World Trigger visually gets better but it sadly will never be My Hero Academia good which is pretty sad. While the show is visually decent for the most part, the battles make it up.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals in World Trigger are pretty decent, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad as everyone thinks it is and the strategic battles of the series completely make it up.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in World Trigger is fantastic. At first, I didn\u2019t really care about the soundtrack during my first watch of World Trigger, however, as I re-watch this show I started to notice how great and well created the soundtrack is. Every single track in World Trigger is memorable, and they fit well with the tone and setting perfectly. Easily in my top 30 favorite anime soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has 3 opening themes and surprising no ending theme whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme GIRIGIRI by Sonar Pocket is a good opening theme that fits with mood with the first 23 episodes. The second and third opening themes Ashita no Hikari by AAA and Dream Trigger by Pile are some of my favorite anime opening periods. They are just a joy to listen to.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nThe sub is great overall that is filled with a lot of well known talented Seiyuus.\\n\r\nI only have seen some clips of the dub on YouTube and I thought it was good overall despite being a bit cheesy in nature. I hope the dub get\u2019s release someday on the net as well having a Blu-Ray release because I would be the Blu Ray for World Trigger in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo after re-watching World Trigger for the second time what do I think about it?\\n\\n\r\nI still think World Trigger is a pretty good shounen series that has a lot of great things in it. The story, for the most part, was pretty good and interesting, the tone was great, and most of the characters are great that have a lot of charm into them and the music/voice acting was great. It does fall in the few areas, though. The pacing was too slow for the most part. The animation wasn\u2019t that constant and the filler arc overall was terrible that shouldn\u2019t exist and you should completely skip it. Despite that, I still liked World Trigger for what it is. If this show was done by any other studio than this show would had been a lot more popular but since it was done by Toei it quickly dived in the underrated territory while Assassination Classroom, Food Wars, Black Clover, Boruto My Hero Academia and Haikyuu have gained the shounen jump spotlight which is a shame because I actually liked World Trigger more than Boruto and Food Wars.\\n\\n\r\nAs a shounen jump adaptation, this was a pretty good one overall minus the filler arc and pacing issues in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, I still think World Trigger was a pretty damm good show that I recommend to people. Just make sure you skip episodes 49-63 because that's where that filler arc start and it's not worth watching in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 8/10",

I agree that sound aren\u2019t really impressive but view as a whole, I think it was really worth it to watch it!Sometimes, people have a negative point of view of an anime when they start watching it because of bad reviews but I think everyone should really try to have a good mindset and determine a anime by yourself. Just because other don\u2019t enjoy it doesn't mean you would. Everyone has a different taste, right? As for the conclusion, I hope everyone can watch this anime by their self! Give it some time!

Talking about the CHARACTERS the principal cast most are super smart and powerful teenagers , as i said the teenagers are super smart but in other times are only fools that only fight then start to cry and make determination dialogues to win then are super smart again , theenemies are the same but are evil adults that apparently are more mature but inferior to teenagers there personalities and development are very unbalanced also there is more characters that stereotypes of shonen  are only to make the principal characters more superiors or only waste time. The ART is simple poor the move in fights even in times that is not action is clumsy and the music is forgettable. For a final thought the series is more for teenagers that like rule of cool vibrates and feel superior even most of the enemies are describe by evil adults but this is a excuse to give a 2/10 even i can said that the of the series writers  think that teenagers are stupid so make this kind of shows\\n",

A new Santa one for my father, and a new snowman one for my mother. Fancy. Cute. Interesting. Whatever the make, I make sure that whichever I choose is a fun one to unwrap.\r\nIf World Trigger were a gift, I would never give it to my parents.

These two, together with their close friend Chika, find themselves supporting one another as they face the troubles laid out on their path.\\n\\n\r\nThis description is not a thorough one for World Trigger, for the anime is seventy-three episodes long. True, it is not as long as those most popular, long-running shows, but seventy-three is not a number to scoff. After all, the majority of anime are either twelve or twenty-four episodes in length.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, its length is also its downfall.\\n\\n\r\nRepetition is a concept that many people are familiar with. Especially if they watch anime or take part in discussing them. Repetition can be a positive if it is used as a plot point or as a thematic element. Often, though, it is a negative, demonstrating a show\u2019s inability to add variety or a need to linger on the same events, outcomes, and character appeals.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger takes it several leaps further.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost astounding how much the show repeats itself. Take its in-world knowledge. The different weapons, the types of Neighbors, how the structure of Border works. A lot of time is set aside to explain these arguably minor details. A smart move. Giving the audience more about how everything operates is (usually) worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in what can only be described as a blunder, the anime has this segment at the end of almost every episode called \u201cWorld Trigger Fun Facts.\u201d There, they repeat much of the same information that was already given. Those weapons? Here they are again with next to nothing new added. Those Neighbors? Covered once more with the same information. Those rankings? S, A, B, C is \u201ctough\u201d to remember, so it\u2019ll be wise to break it down again.\\n\\n\r\nThese \u201cfun\u201d facts do not stop here because, once the anime reaches roughly past the halfway mark, it begins to repeat the same info from previous segments. The guns, the Neighbors, the rankings. A lot of it is repeated \u2013 again.\\n\\n\r\nRepetition continues with Yuma\u2019s infamous pout where, for \u201ccomedic\u201d purposes, Yuma purses his lips and dons three horizontal lines for eyes. A repeated gesture that is basically a characteristic but gets used in almost every situation by him (and others). (Thankfully, the anime calms this down a bit as events get more serious later, but it still appears at a nominal rate.)\\n\\n\r\nHow about always displaying the names, ages, and roles of the different characters no matter how many times they are seen? The invariance of enemies? A need to litter every battle with explanatory dialogue rather than letting them play out?\\n\\n\r\nYet the worst (best?) example is each episode\u2019s opening. In almost every single episode, the anime replays a fixed reel with narration played on top of it. While it can change when the arc does \u2013 about once every fifteen episodes or so (so about five different sets in total) \u2013 it takes up roughly a minute and thirty seconds of that episode\u2019s time. Which in turn takes away the show\u2019s chances of doing something not repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThe kicker? The anime will then proceed to replay exact scenes from the previous episode. As though the reels were not repetitive enough, the show makes its audience sit through reused material that contains verbatim dialogue and replicated events as if it\u2019s expected.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode forty-one is particularly egregious: The first four minutes and twenty seconds are literally the overused reel and copy-pasted content from the previous episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe repetition is horrible, but, somehow, the anime does not stop hitting itself in the face.\\n\\n\r\nPacing manages to be a problem. The first arc is recognizably slow as the show takes way too much time in setting up its characters, world, and general atmosphere for roughly twenty-one episodes. During this span, the anime does have a couple of battles and a bigger fight break out to help minimize the monotony, but it is still noticeably slowed down.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode twenty-two to thirty-five, the anime enters its large-scale-Neighborhood-invasion arc, and it is at this point that pacing goes out the portal. Over the course of these fourteen episodes, the anime stretches out hours of in-world time, slowing everything down again. It even goes so far as to extend seconds of in-world time (into minutes of airing time), killing any reasoning for the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger gets its pacing wrong again when it halts the progression of its B-Rank-Wars arc in favor of the Xeno-and-Lilith arc. Doing so killed the build-up, the sense of progression that Osamu, Yuma, and Chika had been making. It resumes the B-Rank-Wars arc later, sure, but, by that point, the paced-based damage had been done.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as if the show could not get any worse, it makes some questionable choices throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nThat Xeno-and-Lilith arc has no consequence on the events within the season. The idea is that what the group did will pay dividends sometime in the future. But, for the here and now, the arc represents nothing more than an unnecessary diversion (especially since they were supposed to be training but had to deal with this whole conflict instead).\\n\\n\r\nThe idea behind triggers switching out one\u2019s physical body for a virtual one, while futuristic, removes a lot of tension since their actual bodies are in no real danger.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode sixty interjects the arc that already interjected the arc before it. It\u2019s meant to be a comedic one-off starring \u201cTamakoma branch\u2019s most powerful member,\u201d but it has no place in the occurring narrative.\\n\\n\r\nEven how the season concludes raises eyebrows. It chooses to make the cutoff right as the newest Neighbor invasion starts as well as right before Osamu and the others go into the pivotal B-Rank match.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter tears the muscles around the eye. They aimed to win the B-Rank wars (and thus go on the away missions into the Neighborhood) all the way back in episode eleven. Meaning, even after the remaining sixty or so episodes unravel, the show fails to accomplish its original goal for the season.\\n\\n\r\nAll these problems are bad on their own, but, again, they occur across seventy-three episodes. In other words, the repetition, the pacing, and the poor writing choices are each compounded, exacerbated by the long length of the season, turning these problems from intolerable to wholly insufferable.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has a clear positive in its visual arsenal: The trigger transformation sequence. Blue-and-purple, space-like effects spread over the characters as their virtual bodies replace their physical ones. It\u2019s fancy-looking, and it works.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOh, do not be mistaken. Repetition does not stop with the story. The transformation gets a pass because it at least tries to be interesting. But Yuma\u2019s squinting face? The drab teal outfits? Osamu\u2019s glasses constantly fogging up on only one lens to make him seem serious when, in actuality, it only makes it look as if he does not treat his eyewear with proper care?\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, too. The show almost exclusively takes place in the same city and within the same Border headquarters. It would not be a problem if the anime attempted to spruce up these areas given that they are seen all the time. Nope. It\u2019s the same low-detailed, repetitive locations.\\n\\n\r\nIt does try to break up the monotony with its weapons and its enemies, but these, too, suffer from lack of intrigue. The weapons are mostly swords and shields (and their variants) that go without any distinguishing characteristics besides their yellow-laser composition. And the enemies are giant, bug-like creatures that go featureless save for their same giant-eye weak-point.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the rough, its Black Triggers, which it claims are powerful and unique, are, in fact, powerful and unique. Portal creation, translucent-Trion-coagulating birds, and an all-reaching blade stake their claim as the top-tier gear. If only because everything else is so abysmally tame. (Indeed, the Black Triggers make one wonder what could have been had the show given a similar level of attention to its other parts.)\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the anime\u2019s character designs are not awful. Yes, Osamu is too plain, Chika\u2019s mouth is oddly triangular, and Yuma already needs to dye his hair as a teenager. But, considering the size of the cast, the changes to hair color, pupil formation, body image, styles, and accessories help to differentiate the characters while also giving them their own personalities. Kirie, in particular, gets a brand-new look when she turns on her trigger: a winged hairstyle as well as a light-green outfit.\\n\\n\r\nThen it goes right back to being intolerable with subpar actual animation. The fights are not given enough room to breathe, characters usually only move their mouths, and everybody has a hard time even walking around the room as they discuss the same set of topics for the umpteenth time. At least the glowing cube pieces dart around, right?\\n\\n\r\nA few negative shout-outs are still in order.\\n\\n\r\nThe first goes to the visuals for the second ML (acronym explained later) track. Having each character \u201csing\u201d a portion of the song is not cool in the slightest. Especially when Chika, a female, lip syncs a male\u2019s voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe second goes to the final episode. It is somehow leagues worse than all the episodes before it. Disproportionate heads, stiff animation, and weak choreography end the anime with even more distaste.\\n\\n\r\nThe third goes to the \u201cfun\u201d facts epilogues. They went cutesy and minimalist to fit their \u201cfun\u201d mood, but it really just seems as though the anime was cutting corners with the cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger is yet another anime with a massive cast, reaching about one-hundred distinct characters. Therefore, just the main four will be investigated: Chika, Jin, Yuma, and Osamu.\\n\\n\r\nChika is a young girl who finds herself attracting the evil Neighbors. It\u2019s not her fault, for she simply contains an unbelievable amount of Trion (especially for someone of her size). Her indirect relation with the Neighbors caused her to distance herself from others in order to protect them, leaving her in a spot without too many friends.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Chika, and early on, the show reveals that not only did the Neighbors kidnap one of her close friends, but also her brother went missing beyond the rift, too. In retaliation, Chika enlists herself at Border to save those that were taken from her.\\n\\n\r\nHer gargantuan Trion levels made her gun-type role a no-brainer. With a sniper in tow, she can literally raze entire hills, earning her the nickname \u201cCannon.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the season only gives the audience the tidbits to her background and motivations. The middle section has her being the target of Aftokrator because, to them, she is the \u201cgolden baby bird\u201d they were seeking. In other words, Chika does not do a whole lot for a long while.\\n\\n\r\nNot until the last one-third or so does a new characteristic officially enter the field: She cannot shoot people.\\n\\n\r\nHer mental obstacle is extremely annoying since it comes off as a cheap excuse to stop her from decimating the competition (when most of her foes are in no danger of dying anyway). But it does give her the chance to grow. She eventually manages to fire her gun as well as changes to a different setup that plays to her strengths. Namely, her huge store of Trion.\\n\\n\r\nIs Chika a strong character? No. Mostly since she\u2019s relegated to the side without accomplishing much. However, she\u2019s the best of the four \u2013 and that is telling.\\n\\n\r\nJin is notable for his amazing \u201cSide Effect,\u201d special abilities that certain characters possess. His Side Effect is reading the future. He cannot predict it, but he can see the various intersections as well as influence which one the world could take.\\n\\n\r\nIf that were not enough, he has his own Black Trigger, making him one of, if not the, most powerful Border agent.\\n\\n\r\nJin does receive some attention early on, being the one that inspired Osamu to put his all into joining Border. And he interacts with Osamu and his group often enough, getting them a spot at his branch as well as looking out for them elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, his character starts to go downhill shortly after.\\n\\n\r\nJin gives up his Black Trigger, sensing (through his Side Effect) that it would be for the best to let others wield it, reducing his overall impact and coolness. Then, after warning about Osamu\u2019s potential death during the Aftokrator arc, he basically vanishes, appearing only a handful of times without having any impact on the events at hand.\\n\\n\r\nJin even (way later) turns down Osamu\u2019s invite to their group, a bold move to make Osamu\u2019s team that much stronger.\\n\\n\r\nWhich begs the question: Why is Jin even considered a main character let alone plastered on the front of the anime\u2019s main graphic? His background is not investigated, he does not have an internal conflict, and he sits on the sidelines for a large chunk of the show. In all regards, he\u2019s a massive step down from Chika.\\n\\n\r\nYuma is technically a stronger character than Jin but not by much. Yuma is a humanoid Neighbor, something that Osamu and the others had never heard of before. Yuma, alongside his trusty pal Replica, has a Black Trigger of his own, granting him boosted powers and increased battle prowess.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as his background shows, he does not necessarily need it. When he was in the Neighborhood, he was with his dad, learning about fighting, skills, and battle tactics. In other words, he was already a seasoned fighter.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, a dark entity maimed Yuma, forcing his father to sacrifice himself. In exchange for his life, he creates Yuma\u2019s Black Trigger, saving Yuma by placing his body within it. I.e., Yuma\u2019s current body is actually a fake.\\n\\n\r\nAll this information on Yuma is revealed rather early on (mainly episode eleven). And, to be fair, it is welcome info. The problem is that that is all Yuma has.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s already a versatile fighter, so the battles do not mean much to him. The show never goes back to the Neighborhood, so he does not get context on his background. And he does not have any notable interactions with any of the other cast members, including Chika and Osamu.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Osamu, he is easily the worst of the bunch. From the very beginning, it\u2019s obvious that Osamu has no latent strengths. He is not suited for Border due to his lack of fighting experience and his lack of Trion. He only gets recognized when Yuma gives him the credit for saving the school.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s Osamu\u2019s character for the rest of the show. He is constantly trying to find an out. He is constantly looking for help. He is constantly doing what he can to not be useless.\\n\\n\r\nIt would have been tolerable had he actually grown at a steady pace, but, at every junction, World Trigger seems intent on keeping Osamu at a below-average state for the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nHis crawl is realistic, sure. Going from the absolute bottom to even near the middle of the pack would not (should not) happen overnight. But the anime is seventy-three episodes long. What is normally a crawl turns into an excruciatingly slow waddle that barely gets him past the base of his figurative character mountain.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem is World Trigger\u2019s biggest. It fails to use its very long season to its advantage. Instead, the show\u2019s main four not only reach a new level of stagnation but also fail to feel meaningful to the story at large.\\n\\n\r\nOne argument in favor of the cast is their roles. Yuma\u2019s the ace fighter, Chika\u2019s the overpowered sniper, and Osamu\u2019s the tactician. They form a solid group whose weaknesses are covered by each other. For instance, Yuma takes on the toughest enemies, Chika destroys landmarks when needed, and Osamu develops the plans.\\n\\n\r\nTheir composition, however, is not enough to elevate their individual persons.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character World Trigger has to offer is not out of these four; it\u2019s Xeno. He confronts the main group, has a personal conflict in trusting others, gets his background explored, holds a special relationship with Lilith, and resolves his conflict when he befriends the others and escapes the planet.\\n\\n\r\nBut one strong side character \u2013 a character that is inconsequential to the proceedings \u2013 is not enough to save this anime from the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger, surprisingly, does something unique. Not good unique but unique nevertheless: It does not have an OP or an ED. Oh, no. Instead, the anime created a brand-new entity.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle track (or ML for short).\\n\\n\r\nRemember those repetitive reels? They almost always play at the beginning of each episode, leaving no time for an OP to play. And remember those \u201cfun\u201d facts? They almost always play at the end of each episode, so an ED has no place. That leaves the meat of the episode. The important parts. The middle.\\n\\n\r\nSo, World Trigger, being World Trigger, does not care. With its ML in hand, it will interrupt the flow of the episode to make sure the audience hears what it has to offer. Sometimes twelve minutes in, sometimes a staggering fourteen minutes and thirty seconds in. It must play it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is heard? The first ML has fast lyrics, but the \u201cchange the new world\u201d English bit and the boring background beat squash any hope the song has at becoming listenable. The second ML tries really hard to be cool, with its different vocalists and fade out, but it comes off as incredibly lame since the anime is simply not on the same coolness level. As for the third ML, it stands above its brethren, but that\u2019s not saying much. Its first half is uninspired, but the second half at least has some nice vocal work and a varying pace, making it the only passable piece of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the ML is not playing, the rest of the original soundtrack does instead. The tracks are often slow, ambient tunes, relying on flutes, drums, and reverb effects to strike at the slice-of-life, action, and sci-fi moods. They\u2019re forgettable pieces, overshadowed by the ML\u2019s strangeness.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, voice acting missed the mark. Megumi Urawa as Youtarou was annoying to hear, and Tomo Muranaka as Yuma sounded too disinterested. The others failed to impress.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nYou know what\u2019s ironic? My favorite part of the entire show happens to be repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nKirie and Kyousuke\u2019s running gag, where he lies, she believes him, and then she proceeds to pound on Osamu or whoever else is nearby for \u201ctricking\u201d her, miraculously made me smile. In this swathing sea of dislike, I did, indeed, find something I liked.\\n\\n\r\nThe cat, too. His emotionless stare and laziness was likable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd those are the only parts I liked.\\n\\n\r\nKitora was a huge jerk to Osamu for no other reason besides thinking he was coddled too much by everybody else. Chika always bailing out during the fights, rather than trying to help Osamu and Yuma, got on my nerves. Osamu\u2019s half-fogged glasses.\\n\\n\r\nCan\u2019t say I liked the action with its boring shoot-outs. I did not have much in the way of romance to cheer for. Takeru\u2019s \u201ccomedy\u201d made me want to punch myself in the face. And don\u2019t even get me started again on the show\u2019s inept repetition.\\n\\n\r\nIs this the worst anime that I have ever seen? Maybe. If nothing else, it is trapped at the bottom with the other lowest-execution anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger is a boring mess. The story is repetitive. The characters are stagnated. The art is lame. The music has no timing. The entertainment value is minimal. The anime is an ornament that shattered into seventy-three different pieces: worthless.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, horrible repetition, elongates seconds to minutes, and does not even have relevant narrative arcs\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring setting, below average actual animation, and okay character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, stagnation in Osamu, Yuma, Chika, and Jin\u2019s characters prevent them from finding purpose or value\\n\\n\r\nSound: Terrible, bad ML\u2019s, bad OST, bad VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, a running gag and a cat do not cover this year-and-a-half slog\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

            "content": "(Sorry guys, had to re-upload this! Rating is still 10/10!)\r\nI'm going to have to disagree with the opinion a lot of people seem to get from first impressions of this anime. I love it, especially the universe, plot, and characters. Worth giving a chance and continuing to watch. I'm addicted! I love the universe they created, and I'd watch a second series in a heartbeat.\r\nArt:\r\nThe first thing people complain about is the art, but I think that has more to do with how almost every anime these days has very cookie-cutter animation, so when one comes out that has a different style people drop itfor that sole reason-- preconceived notions abound. JoJo has extremely silly animation, but since it is rather famous already people get passed that, and start to actually enjoy it FOR the animation instead of disliking it because of it. It was the same for World Trigger. I enjoy that it has a unique animation style, it reminds me of the same vein as Gash Bell, or Nanatsu no Taizai; both of which I really enjoy for their iconic nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simple, but it works well for this sort of story, it doesn't need overly complex effects to get the point across, in fact that would be very out of character. If you are the type to drop something or judge based on art alone, I would recommend giving this one a chance and watching it through while trying to fix that way of thinking. I wouldn't consider the art bad at all, just simple. Other very famous anime have similar styles, so it shouldn't have that much sway. Keep going, give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is something I really enjoy. Other dimensions are a common trope, but World Trigger is done in such a way to make it unique and really gives you a complete universe to believe in. At first it may seem just like another dimension/shounen battle plot, but once it starts to open up and reveal the underlying nuances, you start to understand that there is a whole other dimension (no pun intended) to the plot, where it parallels real life social issues and moral concepts. You want to stand behind the MC, and fight against the evils and injustices the bureaucracy has put in place (or Border HQ). The plot is shown in such a way where that you slowly learn new things about Neighbors, Border, Trion, and even Yuuma little by little in each episode. This builds up to some bigger fights and conclusions later on, and since there's so much information, this is definitely the best way to get it all out there so we really get what is going to happen later on.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI really like the choice of Seiyuu, and feel each has their own fitting narrative. I have a pretty dry sense of humor, so the subtle dry humor they use is just perfect for me, I also love the social nuances, like pauses and sweet drops at just the right moments to make it hilarious. Older anime uses this technique a lot more often (Like in Gash Bell), whereas these days they tend to make more verbal jokes, which I don't really enjoy nearly as much most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAnd now for the character portion. Aside from plot I think this would be my favorite aspect of the show, I love the depth of character! At first you are thrown in without knowing anything but the basics of who these people are, but gradually you learn and more, especially about Yuuma, and it makes you feel a real connection to the characters and want to urge them on to get stronger and find ways to beat the odds. Yuuma has a much more complex past than you first suspect, and it just continues to get more interesting. Osamu is pretty average, but that's what also makes him relatable. He doesn't start out as much but his character is the type that grows more complex and matures as the series does- so you personally witness the changes in him as he grows and becomes stronger. I don't think there were any major changes in him until he goes through his first big trial (roughly one third through the series), but I think that works out perfectly. Yuuma draws you in, and Osamu keeps you wanting more. It's just these two for the first few episodes of the series, getting you acquainted, but once they start introducing the other characters is when things get fun. Dropping before everyone is on stage is a bad decision. Especially considering this is a 73 episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEvery week when I watched this show I would always flail when it was over because I wanted there to be more so badly! (I still do!) I get really into the personal battles the characters are involved in, and I really want to know more about their world! There's so much we don't know yet, and so much to explore. I want Osamu to grow and become strong so he can catch up to his team mates, and I want Yuuma to solve the mysteries around his father he's been searching for, and I want Chika to find her lost friends and family! Without going into much detail about all of these plot-lines, I want to say it really is worth continuing to watch this show and not give up on it. Think of how slow Hunter x Hunter was at first, or Fairy Tail. This is similar but with more sci-fi leanings. Like a more simple/iconic styled Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei (\u2665).\\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10!\\n\\n\r\nBig things to keep in mind before watching:\\n\r\n\u2022 This show has 73 episodes, the plot will not all be apparent in the first handful of episodes. Give it at least 15 or so episodes, AT LEAST.\\n\r\n\u2022 Don't pre-judge the animation. Remember lots of other famous, good anime has unique styles of animation. (Fairy Tail, JoJo, Nanatsu no Taizai, Kingdom, Gash Bell etc) and all of those were worth getting over it.\\n\r\n\u2022 The credits and OP/ED format is a little different, the recap at first seems annoying now but it will be convenient later on because it has 73 episodes and it can be hard to find where you're leaving off without it. Just try to get used to the OP happening after the initial beginning part of the show. Like most TV drama shows that start off in the plot. It's not that big of a deal and doesn't influence how much show you see.\\n\r\n\u2022 Just be open to giving it a chance!",

            "content": "Although I enjoyed this anime, it was also a terrible disappointment at the same time.  The anime clearly had designs on joining the ranks of Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc... as a long running anime, and 73 episodes is not a bad run.  But, poor pacing, a BRUTAL and ill-timed filler arc that destroyed the momentum of the series, and a sudden ending, takes what could've been an amazing anime and brings it down to just \"pretty good\".   \r\nWorld Trigger has two great draws: A large and interesting cast, and intelligent tactical fights.  The cast in the anime isenormous, and they clearly know it is, as they never fail to remind you of everyone's name, every time you see them.  (And it's necessary, because there are tons of people.)  They were still introducing new and interesting characters even as the show hit a sudden and abrupt end.  The best characters of the series were easily Jin, Kuga and Yotaro, for me.  It's a shame it ended before we could delve more into Kageura as a character.   The rest of the cast was also strong.  \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the weak link of the cast was the MC.  While he had some of the usual respectable traits of an MC: Earnest, honest, brave, etc...Mikumo was just weak.  Really weak.  And while with many shounen anime, the MC starts off as weak, at some point, they progress to catch up with the rest of their team.  But with World Trigger, Mikumo remains weak for far too long.  The disappointing aspect of the abrupt cancellation is it appears like he was just about to turn the corner mentally.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fights were excellent, however.  They were much different from the DBZ-style fights you normally see in anime.  Everything was completely tactical.  The characters deeply analyzed the environment, their opponents, strengths, weaknesses, everything in order to bring out a victory.  It helped to create more engagement in the fights when they happened.   There were some truly awesome moments in the fights, as well.  I wouldn't say they were the greatest animated fights, but they were very fun to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nThe downside here, and I think what probably led to an early cancellation for the show, was an ill-timed filler arc surrounding two characters named Xeno and Lilith.  As good as the rest of World Trigger was, this arc, was just awful.  Amazingly boring, uninteresting, and Xeno was one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever seen.  It was a big mistake to switch from the large, enjoyable cast with exciting tactical fights to a skeleton crew trying to be a cheap Naruto knock off.  By the time the anime returned from the filler, the whole pace was just destroyed.  I watched World Trigger in binges.  I could only imagine how it must have felt going through it for four months watching it on air.  \\n\\n\r\nI believe that directly resulted in its cancellation, which is why the ending is so abrupt.  They drew out everything so long, that the heroes are still in the midst of trying to accomplish their first objective: \"Make it to the A-ranked Teams\".   There were a series of things they wanted to accomplish, that I won't mention in order to not spoil things, but it ended before they even crossed the first hurdle.  Now THAT is how you know your pacing is off.  73 episodes and you don't get past the first step to the main objective?  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it seems like things behind the scenes killed what could've been a great, long-running anime.   I would recommend watching World Trigger, regardless of its flaws.  But, without question, as soon as you hear the name \"Xeno\", skip the episode, and don't stop skipping the episodes until you know you wont see that name again.  Trust me. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "So found out that world trigger was completed then i started to watch it and frankly for someone who likes these types of anime this anime both triggered and dissapointed me big time. Why almost everyone think this is great praising it like the next coming well no its not. \r\nThe story is the same as most anime there you have scifi combined with superlike human weapons or abilities. Good guys fight back while bad guys keep invading. This is fine i kinda expected it and its not something i would rate an anime bad for. The only  problem is that type of storymakes it easy to guess different plots in it. When i see something happening and think to myself ah so it was going to happen like that, then i know something just normal will be with this anime. The triggers is what make this anime what it is it gives the anime the only  thing to make it unique. What type of triggers does he use what is the difference between each things like that is of interest because thats what this anime is about combined with the alien attack. But this anime pisses me of because i feel like they just say hey lets make this happen while another part says hey lets stop this doesnt feel good lets make something else happen instead. And when they finally get to explain things they create a big event and its basically and now after the invation break. I can watch slow animes i even love those but thats when they actually try to get some sort of picture through or explain not when you just throw a bunch of fights there you just get more and more distraught. \\n\\n\r\nI will give this anime that it has openings that you can enjoy eventhough they try to make the anime unique by plopping the openings in the middle of the episode. The openings are interesting there is that. \\n\\n\r\nNever have i  found myself hate as many characters as i did in this anime never. I was at the 10 episode when i thought should i just toss it aside but no my anime sence told me that there was something i would enjoy. The characters was not any of this. The main character is piss poor weak he cant fight for shit he cant even do dmg whats so great about this. He gets helped almost always and it feels like the only thing he can do is acting like a meat shield or run away as a distraction. The main supporting girl Chika basically gave alot of the story away when i heard about her more clearly which is why i wont spoil it but its obvious. The supporting guy Yuma is your typical op supporting character who helps the main character Osuma a bunch of times hes likable enough but has his weird yet kind side. There are a few other characters i could like but too many gave me that feeling of annoyance and wanted to throw off a cliff\\n\\n\r\nI started to enjoy this anime when i got to about episode 40 surprise ? well you shouldnt be. I had to fight my way through episodes there i wonder is there any point in this anime having a Mc. My advice for whoever reads this is to not care about main character and just view everything as a story of its own and never think of any character as a main just think of them as part of a divition or similar to that or you will run the risk of being burned. \\n\\n\r\nOverall there is nothing special about this anime that i could say i enjoyed all the way through i can only say that it had its good moment but thats it. The story and the consept of the triggers was great but in the end i could find an anime like this and find a better one easly. If i ever watch this one again it will be from around episode 40 or so maybe 38 but not much back than that. \\n",

            "content": "This is it boys and girls, I'm bringing you another anime review that you all been waiting for (No one did).\r\nWhat is it with this anime, at some points it impresses me and makes me think that I found something good, but then you turn around the corner and you get punched in the face.\r\nHow creators were able to balance garbage and awesome in a same anime amazes me. Even if I gave this one 5, I know easy fix how to make it to at least 7. I leave it somewhere at the end of review.\r\n Not because I want you to read allreview or anything B-Ba-Baka! This review may contain some minor spoilers, so please consult with your doctor before reading this, everything is done by professionals with supervision, please do not try this at home.\\n\\n\r\nSo this anime has a plot, and it's not bad really. Building fantasy world little by little, and oh boys when I say little by little I mean it. It's SLOW man! Before it get to some good parts another anime could already ended. But when it gets to those points it's pretty good, I like systems where you get your characters ranked by how awesome they are. And massive wars\\n\r\nthat involves a lot of characters. There are a lot of strategy involved in battles, and I love that. I think that is the best part of this anime.\\n\r\n If you like battles, you should check this one out. But that only happens when humans are fighting against humans, surroundings get so alive, everything happening for a reason and at the same time, really great stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's have some fun, lets talk about stuff that makes you hate your self for wasting time watching this anime. Characters... oh boy... Who was the smart one to make main character guy with glasses I have nothing against people who wear gasses, but come one, this is anime. Every time I watch character with glasses, its most boring, useless person on that anime, whats up with that. Some guy though that  it would be fun to put his little son Timmie in to the anime. Because everybody loves to watch average person living average life in f***ing fantasy worlds. He's weak, cant do anything alone, and will try to save everybody even if it cost his life. Sometimes looks like he is trying to kill him self, because he knows how boring he is. If I want to see something like that, I would go outside, and there is no fantasy involved there.\\n\r\nThen we have Chika, what is wrong with her head? Cmon people, look at it, LOOK AT IT! I would want to know her back story of her head more, that main story. As a character she's horrible, feels like she should have glasses\\n\r\nbut there can only be one useless character with glasses. Thank god, that other characters are decent or even good. Like Jin or Kuga. And there are so many characters, that they run out of ideas how to make them difference\\n\r\nso few of them I could not even tell apart.\\n\\n\r\nBut you want to know what really killed this anime? Do you? Are you sure? Okay then...\\n\r\nFugitive arc. WTF was that? It look like different anime with same characters. Well Chika's head got smaller, so that's good, still looked retarded.. (I swear I could draw her face better)\\n\r\nWorld trigger meeting:\\n\r\nBoss:-okay guys, we have build pretty good world with a lot of possibilities, everything is stable, interesting and makes you want to see what happens next. What should we do next?\\n\r\nWeebmaster3000:-I know just a thing. So you know all that world? Lets trow everything away, introduce few new boring characters and focus anime only on them. Lets put filler episodes in a filler arc. Do some beach, shopping\\n\r\nand random episodes where gag relief side character gets trips with no purpose. And don't try to make any sense with plot, just make it random, it's fun. Trust me on this.\\n\r\nBoss:- well okay then, lets do this! LEEROY JENKINS!!!!\\n\r\nThis arc was an abomination, it gives NOTHING to main plot and makes no sense at all, so stupid, so random, so useless.\\n\r\n I bet weebmaster3000 was that smarta**, to place every opening in the middle of episode.It's like:\\n\r\nOh I see you are enjoying this episode, just let me stop that for you and show you our opening, because maybe you forgot what you are watching, don't worry no need to thank me.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end what to do with this anime? You can make it good on your on. You have the POWER! Skip fugitive arc. Episode 48-63. Believe me, it got NOTHING worth watching. And if you skip it, you will improve this anime dramatically.\\n\r\nJust need to find a way how to kill Osamu and Chika then it would be perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: Got nothing to watch? Looking for something new in anime? Watch it, but skip fugitive arc.\\n\r\nHate boring characters and slow pace? Have something better to do? Don't watch it.",

            "content": "When world trigger first came out a lot of people couldn't get into it because of the animation style. I even dropped it at one point for that reason. I picked it back up though because a friend recommended it to me and I am glad I did.\r\nAlmost all the characters feel fledged out with their own personalities and quirks that make them feel like a real person. My favorite character would have to be Kitora. When you first meet her she comes across as stuck up and mean but the more you see them the more you realize that she is just really bythe book and hates to see effort wasted.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two or three Intros in this show and they are all really well made. Though this show is kind of weird when it comes to the intros you can go thirteen minutes into the show sometimes before you get the intro which I kind of like cause it breaks it up to be more digestible. The second intro has to be my favorite though. I cant really pinpoint what it is about it but its just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is really good and once you complete the anime you are left wanting more and hopefully one day we will get more of it. Until then there is the manga that you can pick up and continue it. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier the animation takes more then a few episodes to get used to but the character designs are really good and distinctive to the character. You will notice that pretty quickly when it comes to the eyes. I never knew you could draw an eye so many different ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is really underrated and a hidden gem of a show. You should defiantly give it a chance you wont regret it.",

Completely different from middle-school kids levelling up and saving god knows how many worlds.\r\nFor me the story and the concept of the power(trion) was better than that of chakra, nen, or magic. I personallyloved it a lot. The characters were amazing.....they were fucking badass......you will find no annoying characters and almost love every one of the cast. I could also say that BORDER is one of the most fucking badass organization in all of anime history. And the most interesting thing is that our MC is literally the weakest character in the series.....and despite that you will not hate it....can you imagine how amazing that is. He is not an idiot like most of them are...you will never hear monolouges of shounen protagonist and cannot expect what they will do....but here at least you can know what he is thinking. He knows he is the weakest and does things based on what he can and should do. The other MC's are like the baddest of the badasses......I can only say you are gonna love them.\\n\r\nThe only sad thing is that the ending is abrupt. It's because the anime caught up too fast with the manga that they had no more material to continue the story. But I am waiting patiently for it's next season and I hope we will in the same boat.",

Well, I loved this anime from the start!\r\nSlight spoiler alert!!\r\nI am quite pissed at how the main character guy, Mikumo never seem to get stronger. I mean like he is smart, but thats it, he doesn't show any takent and is portrayed as the kind of guy who seems to attract a lot of strong people around him, despite not having any fighting skill at all. But I guess this is one way to develop the plot. Plus theyadd in Kuga as the main character which I absolutely love! \\n\\n\r\nSome people seems to be complaining about the art made by Toei. Well, I have to disagree. I mean like I have seen better arts, but you can't really complain about the quality of the art used here. \\n\\n\r\nI started reading the manga after watching the anime. I have to say, they follow the plot of manga quite well. I practically can just start reading the manga from the middle because the anime and manga connects so well!\\n\\n\r\nWell overall I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I binge watched this in 3 days and enjoyed every moment of it. I highly recommend this anime! Looking forward to the next season!",

            "content": "Although many disagree, I persoanlly liked World Trigger. I read the manga first, so watching the anime was completely painful. Don't know how Toei managed to pull in Yuki Kaji for Osamu, but this was one of the things that made me stick with it. The lack-luster animation, random, long, pauses, and dragged out episodes with ridiculously long recaps was a bit dissapointing and turned away a lot of viewers.\r\n I really liked Kuga's character, his design and backstory, but many others like Osamu and Chika were half baked as charaters. I totally see where the author was going with this story having a characterlike Osamu as one of the main characters and although it will probably be better in the end, people didn't want their time wasted. The seiyuus weren't bad, and honestly, although Osamu isn't the character that Yuki Kaji is used to voicing, it made Osamu a bit more likeable. This anime has lots of flaws but lots of good things with it. Read the manga tbh\\n\\n",

And all of them feel like people. \r\nStory:\r\nPremise is simple, there are other worlds that uses a technology called \"trigger\". Just imagine it as energy that can be manipulated BUT not so simple that anything can just be created in a snap. We follow for the most part, 30 people, 30 fucking people BUT we follow the growth of 3 the most. The story itself is nothing to write home about, it's the cast that's really the meat of thisshow and the story is basically a back draft.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nYou can see how the studio skimped out here, I'm a 90s kid so it's okay with me and the 3d is used with the monsters that are already flat and geometrical in feel anyway so it's forgivable. I can't watch Aijin due to it being a pure 3d, this one doesn't use 3d on people, just the monsters but if any element of 3d in an anime disgusts you, then it's here.\\n\r\nThe action sequences are well handled, the characters look different despite having a battalion but nothing drastic is used to differentiate the characters so as to break immersion, it's a feat really. But yeah, deduction on actual animation but plus for the sheer amount of characters and not just filler faces that it sustains.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's pretty alright. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOsamu is weak, but he's not stupid, but he's not overly smart either. He needs his team and his team needs him. This might not sound exciting to you but for people who love a sense of realism, this is amazing. \\n\r\nI remember one dialogue when Osamu said that he will train hard to catch up with the others, the person he's speaking with replies \"isn't that arrogant, since we're also working hard to improve ourselves\". \\n\r\nGod I love the characters and the characterization in this anime, each character is given respect. Even Chica, the small girl whom I thought will be some mandatory loli fan service was actually fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nsomething to note tho, this moves at a pace that almost mirrors reality, so yeah, it can be quite slow BUT I swear it ramps up at an unnoticeable pace until you're just addicted to it!\\n\r\nDid I say 30 fucking characters all believable?! What a cast!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt's slow but it really does ramp up and leaves you wanting for more. God I wish for more, I need moarrr!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's smart, it's action packed, it has heart and it manages to balance sci-fi with reality, action and heart and it finds a way to make the characters human. This is a great anime and definitely worth the time.",

So you've to get into them\r\nfirst and focus less on the hero because he is part of it.\r\nHe isn't the one making the world spin like in usual shounen manga.\r\nAnother thing that people should also accept is that Osamu, the hero\r\nis not a fighter/attacker/dps class, that's Kouga role.Osamu is more\\n\r\na support tank and Chika is the mage. Kuga is the one who is overlever up\\n\r\nand is caring Osamu and Chika through speed level up.\\n\r\nThat's is good and also bad thing. It's good because that make Osamu\\n\r\nand Chika level up fast but bad because they don't have time to adapt and make mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nThing you've to keep in mind with normal training, Chika and Osamu coul've only fight decently or good only between 2-5 years of training. That's someting you need to keep in mind and A LOT of NPCs will repeat that fact which is why they're impressed that hero crew can keep up with them.\\n\\n\r\nHero growth is slow but I just explained above the reason that a lot of people don't understand because they're not used to slow leveling and Mc having the role of tank and a tank class is fucking slow to level up in any rpg/mmorpg, lol\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that rpg fans will like is the strategic aspect of the combats.\\n\r\nLot of shounen manga do not cover this part wisely and just go all in in general.\\n\r\nHere it's different, every move/action that someone will make in combat will be\\n\r\nexplained which give dpeth to combat and not some mindless firing/attacking.\\n\r\nAlso the combat are quite diverse in tactics/approach thanks to the different weapons there're and classes.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, to finish my review skip the filler arc.

Forget about the mediocre art for a moment, the real problem is that behind it is a story stretched so thin it makes a slice of cheese feel like a brick wall in comparison. Everything about World Trigger screams \"cheap filler\".\r\nDo you have even the slightest capacity to reach logical conclusions? I've got bad news for you, this entire show will tick you off by tripping itself up every few minutes. The best example would be how they somehow pretend that the most basic of combat training that you can learn in 60 seconds by even having a brainand changes you from being instantly defeated to having a fighting chance... wouldn't be taught to ANY student for the first YEAR of their combat training, because that's the \"advanced\" stuff for year two. Had this happened once I would have been forgiving but it happened all the time because there is almost nothing being taught to any of the students at all, the stuff they pretend to learn in 3 years even your average real life student could learn in 3 weeks.\\n\\n\r\nThe next issue is that not only do they drag out every single insignificant little thing for as long as they possibly can, the \"recaps\" are so excessive in length that they take up a big chunk of the actual episodes and by the end you've watched 60 episodes worth of what barely qualifies as content and 13 worth of recaps. I wish this was a lie, it's not.\\n\\n\r\nThe few saving points are occasional laughs, the characters staying consistent (even if some are utterly useless and have such severe learning disabilities they wouldn't last a week in elementary school) and there actually is a decent plot in the background, even if it only shows up every few hours and it would have been fine to shorten the entire show to 20 episodes.",

A little intelligent boy who fought all is lifein countless worlds and is slowly dying because of it, with nothing that can be done to save him but is still fighting, enjoying life and trying to discover new worlds is kinda new... yes it is, be honest!)\\n\r\n-And definitely when you know he is not the only one deep like that-\\n\\n\r\nYou have good characters evolutions for most of them (even the non main ones, or the government ones or the racists ones... everybody evolves with time, like in real life), \\n\r\na world of thousands of different planets and countries to explore that we only saw a glimpse of, a super cool robot that knows a lot of things (REPLICA fan^^)  that saves the day while combining it's effort with the hero who's weak as shit but still manages to succeed because he actually has a brain (*wink One piece Naruto bleach DB... I love you all but you couldn't manage to do that). \\n\r\nNone of the main characters are dumb (even the secondary characters have a brain! Yeah they do!:D) even though you have so many different of them, they are well created and you can tell the author put a lots of thought into each one of them. \\n\r\nThis show talks about racism, accomplishing yourself, how to fit in a new world, power struggles between different part of a government, colonization,what would happen if we would be invaded by aliens and why would they do it, strategics, school, friendship, leadership, new technologies and I am missing a lot more... \\n\r\nIt does all that with awesome fights, while being funny and intelligent, without thinking that there is a good or a bad side/person and in 50 episodes can make you realize how complex a real world is.\\n\r\nWhat more do you want?! Seeing how this show has been treated, it is jam for pigs, literally!\\n\r\nSo PLEASE KEEP GOING WITH THIS SHOW!!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnd to those who actually think this show is not worth it because you watched like 10 episodes... may I kindly remember you that: \\n\r\n\"ALL LONG SAGAS TAKE TIME TO START FOR CHRIST SAKE!\" (go back watch One piece Naruto or DB and tell me if the 5-10 first episodes are not boring... why do you forget that?)

I do NOT like the execution of World Trigger.\r\nThe story and characters aren't really anything special, but when I first watched this show, I found it overall enjoyable and a fun use of my time. My major problems with it come from how its anime adaption was handled, much like most of Toei's shows. \r\nWhen one delves deeper into the series, they may notice the small detail that the last episode recaps take up halfthe run-time of the actual episode. The opening theme song sometimes doesn't even play till a normal show would go on a commercial break, aka the middle of the episode. In general, the whole show is slower than molasses and does not go nearly as well with my potatoes. The animation isn't... awful, but its nothing spectacular either. Most of it is limited and slow, and does not take nearly as much advantage of its story and context as it should.\\n\\n\r\nThese pacing and general technical issues are also stacked on the fact that the story of World Trigger is pretty mediocre at best. Its not awful, and I've even said that I liked it, but once you go deeper into the world of Anime, this story feels a little too familiar. the soundtrack is more or less forgettable, except for a couple decent OPs.\\n\\n\r\nI never finished World Trigger, but I feel like it has remained in a solid  constant state of quality, and I've heard enough about the last 20 episodes that I can make an informed opinion about it.

            "content": "World Trigger is one of those anime that are focused on character development and plot. I think this was a fair anime, but it could've been better in many ways. For instance, the plot was a bit rushed. There were times where I got lost and didn't fully understand what was happening in the story. Other than that said, I really enjoyed the first season of World Trigger.\r\nPlot | 08\r\n   Main character becomes a huge icon and fights neighbors and their creations. He allies with a neighbor and forms a team with him and another girl, their sniper. This genre is not uncommon,but the plot is quite common found in anime similarly to Bleach, Kekkaishi, and Gate.  I have this an 08 only because I enjoyed the difference between the action anime that have been coming out.\\n\\n\r\nArt | 07\\n\r\n   Although, not aesthetically drawn, it is simple and easy on the eyes. Nothing too flashy, sparkly, glamorous, and just right for an action anime. To me, it's not the details that matter, but how the backgrounds and characters mesh.\\n\\n\r\nSound | 06\\n\r\n   There aren't really any dramatic or suspenseful soundtracks in this anime. The sound effects are cool and basic, nothing too much to the ears. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter | 08\\n\r\n   I couldn't really come to like Osamu, the main character. He is physically weak and takes him too long to realize he needed to focus and train on his body. Although, he is very intelligent and is the brain of his team. You could say he is also one of the \"useless\" teammates. Chika, the sniper, is a very tiny, timid, and short girl. She knows she is weak so she wanted to be someone useful to the team. She holds a lot of Trion, so she can shoot massive explosions. I came to like her in the end. Kuga, is probably my second favorite character in this anime, he is the neighbor, and is very strong. He knows when his opponent is stronger than him and thinks logically. The other characters in the anime, you don't really focus too much on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment |08\\n\r\n   I probably started getting into World Trigger around episode 28. The first 20 episodes are boring and Osamu is weak and boring, dull, incapable of getting stronger. But after a while, when he realizes how weak he is, he changes and the story starts moving. My favorite part of the anime is during the team fights.\\n\\n\r\nOverall | 08 \\n\r\n   The anime wasn't bad nor amazing, but it was worth the while to watch. Chika and Kuga really grow on you more than Osamu does. I would definitely watch this again C=",

            "content": "World Trigger has annoying plot progression. \r\nEvery, and I mean EVERY arc will abide to that age-old rule of all shitty shounens, \"every next episode until climax covers less and less time in the story\".\r\nMC is an absolute, painful to watch weakling at the beginning, is a shameless weakling thorought the show that, while understands that he's weak, doesn't become exceptionally backstabby, as a conscious weakling should, and, in the very last episode, becomes a weakling that maybe has chances of stopping to be weak.\r\nIn shounen genre it's trying to watch and empathise with non-dynamic, weak MC, so that's a significant drawback too.\r\nWorse yet, thewhooping 73 episodes end extremely abrubtly, without even any effort on studios part to tie up the loose ends, obviously aiming for seconds season. However the show wasn't received as well as it should, and the manga went on an indefinite hiatus, so we're left with a show that basically ends crudely somewhere in 3/4 of fourth (i think?) arc.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, the characters are quite charming (annoyingly enough, MC and his overpowered sidekick don't belong to that group), and the art quite solid. \\n\\n\r\nI won't hide the fact I dropped the show at first after withnessing that the main premise is humans fighting against some weird, white animal-styled knick-knacks you'd buy your mom for christmas if you had no idea what'd be good for a present. They have some kind of eyes inside their mouths too, so...\\n\r\nbut don't worry, the story generally focuses on interactions between humans, and stupid CG fights against lazily made mob robots takes suprisingly little screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThat's generally my opinion of the show. If you've run out of interesting anime to watch, it's worth a go. It's not at all exceptional, however.",

            "content": "World Trigger seems like one of those anime that requires you to be a fan of the manga in order to appreciate it.  When I first heard of this anime, it was getting terrible reviews for its languid pacing and mediocre artistry.  Mind you, this was 10 episodes in.  About around episode 50 \u2013 when I checked back in \u2013 users were giving this 10s, saying it drastically improved.  That piqued my interest, and I thought, hell, if I could power through Hitman Reborn, which took roughly 25 episodes JUST to get mildly interesting (still a better anime overall), I couldgive this a shot.  Cut to episode 50, and I was more or less ambivalent on the series, but there were some aspects of it I liked.  However, once I finally finished the series, I was left unfilled, as if the anime failed to reach its potential.\\n\\n\r\nWorld Trigger has the foundation of a good action-sci-fi shonen.  The main character, Osamu Mikumo, is someone we the viewers can identify with.  He\u2019s part of a multi-tiered organization called Border, whose main function is the protect citizens from \u201dneighbors\u201d, or extraterrestrials.  Border agents are divided into four ranks: C, B, A, and S.  Mikumo begins as a C-rank agent, which is no different than being a civilian employee in a police department.\\n\\n\r\nMikumo is not particularly skilled in any one area, but he has a lot of heart and courage.  Ideally, we\u2019d take pleasure in seeing him hone his skills and become someone who can hold his own in battles.  Yet, in 73 episodes, combat-wise, he\u2019s at the same place he was in the beginning of the series.  He literally doesn\u2019t figure out his most corrigible skill until the final episode.  And that\u2019s his ability to strategize.\\n\\n\r\nEventually Mikumo, a.k.a. Megane-Kun, breaks his C-Rank shackles with the help of Yuuma Kuga, the transfer student who befriends him.  It\u2019s revealed early on that he is a neighbor and possesses a black trigger.  Agents and humanoid neighbors use weapons called triggers, and black triggers are the most effective triggers in the world, capable of tremendous power.  In other words, Yuuma has his ultimate weapon at the beginning of the series.  Unlike Mikumo, Yuuma is overpowered and constantly has to handicap himself, especially when sparring against fellow Border agents.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the trio is Chika Amatori, the milquetoast childhood friend of Mikumo who\u2019s secretly one of the most powerful characters.  Then there are other notable characters like Jin, the Border poster boy, who has a predictive side effect (sixth sense), and Replica, Yuuma\u2019s trion companion.  The anime focuses on Mikumo, Yuuma, and Chika as they join Border and train to become strong enough to go on away missions.  And really by the end, none of them show any character growth.  Yes, we do learn their motivations for joining Border, but I didn\u2019t notice any significant change in their personality.  Mikumo remains a martyr, forever putting others\u2019 well-being above his own, Chika never steps out of her comfort zone to be remotely interesting, and while Yuuma shows flashes of depression, he can\u2019t stop making that dumb-ass face long enough for you to care!\\n\\n\r\nDespite having so many episodes, World Trigger fails drastically in terms of characterization.  It doesn\u2019t help that every episode you\u2019re introduced to, conservatively, three new characters!  Seriously, there are so many characters in World Trigger.  Sooooo many.  A few of them are actually memorable, but memorable only as a character type.  You don\u2019t remember their actual names, but you remember: \u201coh, there\u2019s the edge lord,\u201d or, \u201cthere\u2019s the compulsive liar and the girl who always believes him,\u201d and of course, \u201cthere\u2019s the tsundere\u201d.  The anime itself doesn\u2019t even try to hide the fact that there\u2019s a metric-ton of characters, because every time you see a character, you see their name, their age, and the ranking.  And this continues until the final episodes, as you\u2019re always introduced to new, underdeveloped characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the beginning, World Trigger caught a lot of flak for its lackluster animation.  For the most part, those criticisms are accurate.  The character design ranges from average to flat-out lazy.  A lot of the characters look the same, with no distinguishing features other than hairstyle and weird irises.  Then there are some characters that have black dots as eyes.  And Yuuma - 75% of the time he\u2019s making an annoying face that seems to be a catch-all for reacting to everything.  The only time the animation reaches an acceptable level is during the battles.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the rank battles are the best part of World Trigger.  They utilize the most fascinating part of shonen anime (IMO), which is battle strategy - overcoming an opponent\u2019s trump card by analyzing it and determining how it works.  Yuuma, because of his skillset, makes every battle he\u2019s in worthwhile.  Mikumo, on the other hand, makes them exhausting, as he barely improves and ends up being a liability.  He has some brilliant strategic moments though; too bad he waited until the end of the anime to make that his primary focus.   \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that sucks about the battles in general is that the stakes are extremely low.  Border agents fight using a body made out of trion, which is like some form of energy.  So when someone loses all of their trion, they \u201cbail out\u201d and return to their fleshly bodies.  There are a few times when characters such as Mikumo fight without a trion body, and you know what?   Those were the most suspenseful battles in the entire anime!  The battles against the neighbors are mostly good (until you realize no one can die) and the rank battles provide the most fun (until you realize Mikumo\u2019s team, excluding Yuuma, sucks).      \\n\\n\r\nBased on the review thus far, you might think that this anime is trash, but it\u2019s not.  It\u2019s okay, but \u201cokay\u201d is not good enough for an anime of this length.  There were times when I truly thought the anime was reaching its stride, and then it spends the next few episodes with one-dimension Border executives, or Chika and her dull sniper trainee group.  Or it might take a huge detour to explore some \u201cfugitive\u201d characters when instead it could be concentrating on having the main characters reach the point where they\u2019re able to explore the neighborhood.  With better pacing and less characters, World Trigger could actually be good, but in 73 episodes, like its main character, it doesn\u2019t even begin to reach its potential. \\n",

            "content": "The series started off great, but after the Large-Scale Invasion Arc, it went downhill.  The world(s) building was great and had potential, but after the Invasion arc they focused on some pool and beach episodes, and Ranking Wars.  During the Ranking Wars, there was explanations on strategies from each team before, during, and after the matches with use a small amount of focus on the actual fights.  Also, filler or not, after the Invasion arc, the Border agents fought off against a horde of enemies, with some top level enemies mixed in.  Most of the high ranking agents did well againstthe large scale invasion, but during a filler arc, some of the same rankers had problems with only one not so OP enemy.\\n\r\nNot sure why Osamu was the MC, he would fit better as a side character.  I liked his courage, but he was weak and the only reason why he survives is because of others.  Yet, he wants to go behind enemy lines.  He only gets slightly stronger, and they want to make him out to be some kind of genius, but he is just an above average strategist.  Then there is the freaky big headed Chika, some of her decisions make me wonder what is the point of that big head of hers, especially during the filler arc.  The rest of the characters are pretty decent, Jin and Kuga should be the main characters of the show.",
